james richard hackley hackley was convicted of several offenses related to his sale of cocaine base to a government informant and subsequent efforts to have that informant the lead witness in the government case against him murdered.hackley challenges his convictions,the joinder of the charges into a single trial,the court refusal to grant him new counsel,and his sentence.although the facts in this case come perilously close to the lower boundary of what we will accept as substantive evidence of a conspiracy to distribute drugs,for the reasons discussed below,we affirm.
david jackson,a longtime crack user who had worked as a confidential informant since,brought hackley to the government attention in may.jackson worked for a tree service company and was out doing tree work in winchester,virginia on may,when he saw hackley drive up in a white vehicle.they had known each other since,but had not seen each other for about a year.jackson had never purchased cocaine from hackley before,but knew from previous discussions with him that hackley had sold cocaine in the past.they chatted about how they had been doing,and then jackson asked hackley if he had cocaine.at trial,this was how jackson described their conversation 
i asked him if he was still getting cocaine.
is that the word you used were you that specific 
yeah,yeah,yeah,still getting that shit,cocaine,and he said yeah.then i asked him for an.he told me i was lucky,he just come back from maryland,pull over to the parking lot,and i bought some crack off of him.
had you purchased crack cocaine from him in the past 
prior to that you had never purchased cocaine from him 
q.then why was it that you would have this conversation about crack cocaine 
i known the man since.we had discussions before,but i never bought.
the purchase took place in hackley vehicle.after jackson got into the vehicle,he pulled out for the purchase and saw hackley reach underneath his seat and pull out a brown paper bag.hackley pulled out a piece of crack cocaine that was approximately the size of two golf balls and broke off a piece for jackson.
that evening,jackson contacted agent kevin coffman,an officer with the northwest virginia regional drug task force whom jackson had known for a couple years.jackson told coffman that he had purchased crack from hackley earlier that day.
the government arranged for jackson to make six controlled purchases from hackley between may,and august.during these purchases,hackley sold jackson a total of grams of cocaine base in the form of crack for.in addition,jackson made unauthorized purchases of crack for his personal use.at some point that summer,hackley explained to jackson that he was receiving the cocaine from his family in maryland.
hackley was arrested on august,and held at the warren county jail in front royal,virginia.while incarcerated,he wrote letters to four different female friends in which he discussed paying jackson not to testify or persuading him to lie.these letters expressed that he would rather if jackson did not show up,and that the only way out of jail is if jackson do show up.he also spoke with his fellow inmate,ray johnson,about not wanting jackson to appear in court.hackley also told johnson that he owned a caliber handgun.while it is unclear whether johnson or hackley first proposed killing jackson,at some point that topic arose.hackley told johnson that david jackson needed to be killed so he did show up in court.johnson testified that hackley desire to have jackson killed was pretty set in stone.id.
unfortunately for hackley,johnson contacted federal agents and told them that hackley was discussing having their witness killed.johnson became a confidential informant and began cooperating with the government in its investigation of hackley murder for hire scheme.
with johnson cooperation,the bureau of alcohol,tobacco,firearms and explosives atf sent special agent leonard codispot to pose as an inmate at the warren county jail.johnson told hackley that codispot could help him have jackson killed.codispot testified that hackley initiated a conversation by saying to him i got a problem.i need this guy taken out.you know,he testifying against me.
codispot testified that he asked hackley if there was a certain way he would like to have david jackson killed,asking,do you want me to stab him,cut his head off or shoot him with a gun.hackley did care how it was done,he just wanted jackson gone forever.codispot asked him,d o you want me to just take him away for a while and make him disappear for a little bit.hackley said no,he wanted him gone forever.
codispot also testified that hackley mentioned that he had a gun hidden at irvette reaves house that codispot could probably get,but that he no longer had her phone number.reaves was hackley girlfriend but apparently disassociated herself after seeing another woman with him in prison.hackley wrote to tell her where the gun was hidden and to ask her to move it.despite their falling out,reaves moved the gun to her new home and kept it until agents searched her house on april.
hackley offered codispot or his motorcycle in exchange for his help.he twice wrote to another girlfriend,susie dearing,asking her to have keys made for the bike and telling her that codispot was going to come inspect it.he asked dearing to damage one of the keys to the bike so that it could not start it.hackley wrote to dearing that he was concerned that codispot was going to try to cheat him.johnson gave dearing address and phone number to codispot so that he could inspect the motorcycle.
after codispot left the jail,agents staged the death of jackson,complete with a picture in a fake news story.according to johnson,when hackley was given a copy of the article,hackley was e cstatic.
on april,a federal grand jury for the western district of virginia returned a indictment against hackley.count one charged hackley with conspiracy to distribute five or more grams of cocaine base in violation of b b and.counts two through seven charged hackley with distribution of crack in violation of a and b c.
the grand jury returned a superseding indictment on june.this indictment retained the original seven counts and added four additional charges murder for hire,in violation of solicitation to commit murder for hire,in violation of and obstruction of justice,in violation of c and felon in possession of a firearm,in violation of g.
hackley had entered into a plea agreement with the government on september,but sought to withdraw from that plea agreement on october,a little more than a week before trial.hackley and his assigned attorney moved on october for the court to appoint another lawyer to represent him.the district court denied this motion.
on october,hackley filed a motion for a separate trial on count eleven felon in possession of a firearm.the district court denied this motion on october.
the government filed a notice of enhanced punishment pursuant to on october.
on october and,hackley was tried before a jury in charlottesville,virginia.at trial,after the government rested,hackley moved for a judgment of acquittal on counts nine solicitation to commit murder for hire and eleven.the court denied the motion.hackley requested a jury instruction on entrapment with respect to count eight murder for hire which the district court denied.on october,the jury found him guilty on all eleven counts.thereafter,hackley made a renewed motion for judgment of acquittal on count nine,and this time on count one as well.the district court denied the motion on december.
on january,the district court sentenced hackley to a term of months in prison.the court calculated hackley criminal history as eight points,based on ten convictions,the oldest of which was a conviction in october for distribution and conspiracy to distribute cocaine.offenses older than years do not usually result in enhancements under chapter,part a e.the court,however,at the suggestion of the probation office in the presentence report psr,included hackley conviction because his incarceration continued until september,less than fifteen years before may.including the conviction moved his criminal history from category iii to category iv and increased the recommended sentence range under the sentencing guidelines from months to months.his month sentence falls within both sentencing guidelines ranges.
hackley now appeals the denial of his motions for judgment of acquittal with respect to counts one conspiracy to distribute and nine solicitation to commit murder for hire,the denial of an instruction on entrapment for count eight murder for hire,whether there was sufficient evidence to convict him on count eleven felon in possession of a firearm,the district court refusal to grant him a separate trial on count eleven,its refusal to allow him to substitute counsel before trial,and finally his sentence.we consider each in turn.
hackley appeals the district court denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal with respect to count one,conspiracy to distribute and possess a controlled substance with intent to distribute,in violation of a,b b,and.he argues that there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction.
we review the district court ruling on a motion for judgment of acquittal de novo and will uphold the verdict if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,it is supported by substantial evidence.united states alerre,cir.substantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.id.internal quotation marks omitted.while acknowledging that the evidence is indeed thin,we nonetheless affirm because we must assume on appeal that the jury resolved any issues of witness credibility in the government favor.see united states jeffers,cir.nonetheless,we reiterate that this case represents the very boundary of what passes for substantial evidence of a conspiracy.
in order to prove conspiracy in this case,the government was required to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that an agreement to distribute and possess cocaine with intent to distribute existed between two or more persons the defendant knew of the conspiracy and the defendant knowingly and voluntarily became a part of this conspiracy.united states yearwood,cir quoting united states burgos,cir en banc.since hackley does not appeal his convictions for the substantive crime of distribution of a controlled substance,the issue is whether there was sufficient evidence of an agreement to support the finding of conspiracy.
the presence of a knowing and voluntary agreement distinguishes conspiracy from the completed crime and is therefore an essential element of the crime of conspiracy.see iannelli united states,d burgos,at.conspirators need not know all of the details of the conspiracy,provided that they know its essential object.united states goldman,cir.this agreement need only be a tacit or mutual understanding between the defendant and his accomplice.united states ellis,cir.circumstantial evidence alone is sufficient to support a conviction for conspiracy.ellis,at internal quotation marks omitted.
in united states townsend,the seventh circuit held that,in drug conspiracy conspiracy cases,evidence of a relationship,standing alone,is insufficient to support a conspiracy conviction,cir.two years later,in united states mills,we interpreted that holding,saying,evidence of a transaction is at least relevant probative on the issue of whether a conspiratorial relationship exists,cir.since then,we have held that evidence of a continuing relationship when coupled with evidence of large quantities of drugs,or continuing relationships and repeated transactions,creates a reasonable inference of an agreement.united states reid,cir citing burgos,at.
the government attempts to use this inference to prove that hackley conspired both with jackson and with unnamed maryland suppliers.this,however,is not entirely accurate.as the district court correctly instructed the jury,because jackson was at all relevant times a government agent,despite his unauthorized purchases,he can not be a.united states lewis,cir.the unnamed maryland suppliers,then,are the only possible people with whom hackley could have had a conspiratorial agreement.
preliminarily,we note that in this case,the evidence of substantial quantities of drugs is,on its own,too thin to support an inference of conspiracy.all of the evidence of the scale of hackley comes from the two confidential informants.jackson testified that he saw hackley with two sized quantities of crack.johnson testified that he believed hackley sold about an ounce or two a week.
the government offered no testimony about how much crack two sized quantities would be,arguing instead that the government need not prove the exact weights of drugs.see united states natanel,cir.while we do not disagree,if we are to infer the existence of an agreement based on the drug quantity,it would be helpful to have some sense of what that quantity is,particularly when it appears limited even the government describes jackson authorized purchases as relatively small amounts.appellee br.the cases on which the government relies in support of this inference all involve larger quantities than those reflected here,yearwood,at five ounces sold for in a single transaction united states parker,cir kilograms sold over a year period to multiple witnesses along the distribution chain.of the cases on which the government relies,the smallest quantity contemplated is ounces,but there witnesses testified that they were repeat customers.reid,at.
nonetheless,we are constrained to affirm because the government evidence of continuing relationships and repeated transactions,although sparse,is sufficient to support an inference of an ongoing relationship between hackley and the unnamed maryland suppliers.three pieces of evidence,taken together,form the basis from which a jury could reasonably infer that hackley had a continuous relationship with maryland suppliers.the first is jackson testimony that hackley told jackson that he was getting his supply of crack from his family in maryland.supporting this testimony is jackson further observation that hackley was able to sell crack when he returned from maryland.
the second is jackson testimony that hackley was still getting cocaine,that he had known hackley since,and that they had discussed crack cocaine previously.although jackson had not actually bought cocaine from hackley before may,a reasonable jury could infer from this testimony that hackley had previously received cocaine from his family in maryland.
the third is a cryptic conversation between hackley and dearing in which they discussed his other girlfriend desire that he tell on someone else so that he could get out.appellee br.at government exhibit.hackley responded that p eople deal with me cause i not about all that bullshit.id.hackley further explained to dearing that not tell ing on people was the whole principle of the game.id.although she testified that she did not know what hackley meant when he said p eople deal with me,dearing also testified that the game was the drug game.
from the totality of this evidence,we conclude that a jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that hackley had a continuous relationship with maryland suppliers.under the test articulated in reid and burgos a jury could reasonably infer that hackley had a standing agreement a conspiracy with unnamed maryland suppliers to bring their drugs to market in virginia.
it bears emphasis,however,that although there is ample evidence that hackley distributed crack,the conspiracy evidence is far weaker the relatively small amount of drugs involved and the scant evidence of a relationship between hackley and his suppliers in maryland are the outer limits of that which could support an inference that a conspiracy existed.distribution and conspiracy remain separate offenses,and although we certainly allow the government to use circumstantial evidence to prove the presence of an agreement the sole element distinguishing conspiracy from the substantive crime the government must take care not to ask the jury to infer an agreement based on guilt of distribution alone 
next,we address whether the district court erred when it denied hackley a jury instruction on entrapment.the affirmative defense of entrapment has two parts government inducement of the crime,and a lack of predisposition on the part of the defendant to engage in the criminal conduct.mathews united states,d see also united states ramos,cir.as a general proposition,a defendant is entitled to an instruction as to any recognized defense for which there exists evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to find in his favor.mathews,at.we review de novo a district court denial of a jury instruction on entrapment.ramos,at.
the district court is the gatekeeper if the defendant does not produce more than a mere scintilla of evidence of entrapment,the court need not give the instruction.united states phan,cir.this circuit has repeatedly held that solicitation of the crime alone is not sufficient to grant the instruction,as that is not the kind of conduct that would persuade an otherwise innocent person to commit a crime.ramos,at quoting united states hsu,cir.
hackley argues that he has asserted more than a mere scintilla of evidence of entrapment.he claims that a reasonable jury could conclude that johnson,not hackley,initiated the discussion of murder,and that his earlier plan was to pay jackson not to testify.who started the conversation is irrelevant.his argument founders on the fact which he does not dispute that johnson was not a government informant at the time that the discussions about doing away with jackson began.entrapment only arises in the context of government inducement.
moreover,there is ample evidence in the record from which the jury could find that hackley was predisposed to prevent jackson from testifying.in addition to his discussions with johnson,hackley wrote numerous letters to his girlfriends about his desire to prevent jackson from testifying.predisposition is not limited only to crimes specifically contemplated by the defendant prior to government suggestion.ramos,at internal citations omitted.instead,i t is sufficient if the defendant is of a frame of mind such that,once his attention is called to the criminal opportunity,his decision to commit the crime is the product of his own preference and not the product of government persuasion.united states osborne,cir.such was clearly the case here.
hackley appeals the district court denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal as to count,solicitation to commit murder for hire,in violation of and section criminalizes using the mail or other interstate commerce facilities with intent that a murder be committed in violation of the laws of any state or the united states for pecuniary gain section makes it a crime to solicit anyone,including a government agent,to commit a crime of violence.hackley claims that there was insufficient evidence to show that he used the mail or other interstate commerce facilities while soliciting codispot to kill jackson.we disagree.
the record clearly shows that hackley wrote to his many girlfriends seeking help in his murder for hire scheme.for example,he wrote to dearing instructing her to show codispot the motorcycle.while it is true that hackley did not write or call codispot himself,simply says use the mail with intent that a murder be committed.we have never held that requires that defendants mail the person whom they solicit,nor does the statute support such a limited reading.since hackley letters to dearing facilitated his solicitation of codispot,we affirm.
hackley makes two claims with respect to count eleven first,that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of being a felon in possession of a firearm,in violation of g and second,that the district court erred by denying his motion for a separate trial on this count.we discuss each in turn.
as discussed above,w hen reviewing a claim,we will sustain the jury verdict if there is substantial evidence,taking the view most favorable to the government,to support it.united states jackson,cir quoting glasser united states.substantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.id.quoting burgos,at.since hackley stipulated that he was a felon,the only issue is whether he possessed a firearm.
a convicted felon is guilty under g if he exercised dominion and control over a firearm.jackson,at internal quotation marks omitted.hackley claims that he could not have exercised dominion or control over the firearm because he was incarcerated.we need not reach this issue because the indictment charged him with possessing the firearm on or between august,and august.hackley was not arrested until august.
before his arrest,hackley purchased the gun and stored it at irvette reaves house.she testified that she did not know it was there until he found out that she was moving and asked her to bring it to her new house.hackley also wrote to her from prison to inquire about what she had done with his toy.since a jury could infer from this evidence that hackley possessed the gun on august,before he was arrested,we affirm.
hackley also claims that joinder of count eleven with the other counts in the indictment was improper and that trial on all counts together prejudiced him.neither claim has merit.whether offenses in an indictment are improperly joined under rule a is a question of law reviewed de novo.united states cardwell,cir.we review the district court decision not to sever the offenses for abuse of discretion.united states acker,cir.
an indictment may charge a defendant in separate counts with two or more offenses if the offenses charged are of the same or similar character,are based on the same act or transaction,or are connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.a.under this court decision in cardwell,counts are properly joined if they are based on the same act or transaction or are connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan such that they have a logical relationship to one another.at internal quotation marks omitted.this test permits broad joinder to promote efficiency,but does not permit stretching the statute to cover offenses that are only related temporally.id.at.
in cardwell,we held that a felon in possession charge was not necessarily related to a charge of murder for hire when the gun was not intended to be part of the crime,unless there exist additional facts demonstrat ing that the crimes were logically related to one another.id.at emphasis omitted.we held that the defendant statement that he would have used the gun to avoid arrest for murder for hire was sufficient to make joinder of the charges proper.id.here hackley not only possessed the gun that was to be used in the crime he offered that exact gun for the undercover agent to use to murder jackson.if contemplating using a gun to avoid arrest for murder for hire shows a sufficient relationship for joinder then surely contemplating using a gun in the murder for hire is also sufficient.that hackley did not make an effort to actually use the gun,and that he was incarcerated during the relevant time period,does not render the relationship any less logical.for these reasons,we hold that count eleven was permissibly joined with the other charges.
in the alternative,hackley argues the district court erred when it declined to sever count eleven for a separate trial because its inclusion prejudices him.federal rule of criminal procedure a gives courts discretion to sever offenses if joinder in a single trial would prejudice a defendant.it is not enough for the defendant to show that severance offers him a better chance of acquittal.united states reavis,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the supreme court has held that severance is appropriate only if there is a serious risk that a joint trial would prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.zafiro united states,d joinder of defendants.similarly,we have held that t he trial court has a wide range of discretion in matters of severance which should be left undisturbed,absent a showing of clear prejudice or abuse of discretion.acker,at.hackley has shown neither cl
