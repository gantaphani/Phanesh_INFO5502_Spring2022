this case is about what constitutes a proper inference for a jury to draw when making determinations of guilt.calvin bonner was found guilty of armed robbery by a jury in october of.in june of,after a renewed motion for a judgment of acquittal,the district court overturned his conviction based on insufficient evidence.the government appealed that ruling,arguing that,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,the jury could have found sufficient evidence to convict bonner.we disagree with the government and affirm the district court opinion.we do so on the grounds that the government failed to produce sufficient identity evidence placing bonner at the robbery and relied on unsubstantiated,unscientific inferences to bolster its minimal evidence.we conclude that no reasonable jury could find bonner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt based on the evidence presented at trial.

the government alleged that on october,darren moore,an employee of a subway restaurant,observed a pink or reddish suv parked at the back of the restaurant around pm while he was emptying a mop bucket.about thirty seconds later,moore testified that he was confronted by two armed african american male assailants with pantyhose over their faces,hooded sweatshirts,and hats.moore also testified that one robber was wearing a black and white yankees hat.the suspects forced moore into the restaurant,told him to call his supervisor,and ordered him to the floor.one of the robbers then confronted casey jones,the assistant manager,who gave him the money from the cash register.moore testified that the robbery took roughly two minutes.after the robbers left,jones called the police.moore quickly locked the back door first and then moved to lock the front door.while locking the front door,moore observed the suv he had seen earlier pulling to the front of the restaurant and asked jones to relay the car description to the police.jones described it as a reddish pink honda passport.the only physical characteristic of the robbers that moore or jones identified was that each was an african american male 
the police were informed that two to three armed suspects robbed a subway restaurant and fled the scene.detective andrew eads responded to the call immediately.when he was approximately twenty to thirty seconds away from the subway restaurant,detective eads received additional information that the suspects had fled in a burgundy honda suv.detective eads observed a burgundy honda passport exiting the restaurant parking lot as he approached the scene.he conducted a stop of the car and found one occupant,terry bethea,with two small baggies of marijuana in his coat.later,during a search of the car,detective eads along with officer brammer found several other items including bonner identification and wallet,several rounds of ammunition,a toy gun,two,registration of the car to tyra edmonds who was bonner girlfriend at that time,and some scattered clothing items.three cell phones,belonging to bethea,edmonds,and lamont ruth bonner cousin,were also recovered.bonner placed several short calls to edmonds and ruth cell phones that night.the time between jones call to the police and detective eads stop was approximately five minutes.
surveillance footage revealed that bethea,who was not charged with anything in conjunction with this incident,did not match the description of the robbers.additionally,moore did not identify bethea as one of the robbers and told the detectives that the clothes recovered in the vehicle did not match the clothing worn by the robbers.jones also testified that bethea was not the robber because he was not sufficiently bulky.about thirty minutes after the police arrived,they asked jones to identify a new york yankees baseball hat recovered near the dumpster behind the restaurant.the police recovered the hat after their second search of the area surrounding the dumpster at the back of the restaurant jones identified the hat as belonging to one of the robbers.forensic evidence from the hat showed that there were multiple dna matches and that one of them,identified as the predominant profile,belonged to bonner.special agent karen winningham,the forensic analyst,found other dna on the hat,but did not try to match that dna to other individuals.the dna analysis could not determine who last wore the hat.
the government introduced additional evidence about the area around the subway.moore testified that there is generally traffic at the food lion located in the same plaza until it closes at pm.the police conducted a search of the area using canine trackers that sniffed the yankees hat.the first canine tracker followed the trail to a nearby condo development.the second canine tracker led the police to a marathon gas station less than half a mile away.almost five hours after the search was completed,a phone call was placed at the marathon gas station to the home of edmonds.
