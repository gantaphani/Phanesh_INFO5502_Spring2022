this appeal stems from the controlled delivery of a parcel containing twenty pounds of marijuana the parcel to the residence of defendant appellant corey golson golson,where upon acceptance,state and federal law enforcement agents conducted a search of golson home pursuant to an anticipatory search warrant the anticipatory warrant issued by pennsylvania magisterial district judge mark martin mdj martin.there are two primary issues to resolve.
first,rule b of the federal rules of criminal procedure mandates that either a federal judge or a judge of a state court of record must issue a warrant in a federal prosecution.golson claims,among other things,that the government violated rule b because mdj martin was not a judge of a state court of record.in reviewing golson claim pursuant to a suppression motion,the united states district court found that the anticipatory warrant was issued pursuant to an investigation under state law,which is not governed by the federal rules of criminal procedure.we will affirm pursuant to united states bedford,cir.
second,federal postal inspectors seized the parcel for a period of four days prior to obtaining a warrant to open and search it.since a prolonged seizure occurred,golson claims the contents of the parcel should be suppressed.the district court found the seizure to be reasonable.we agree and will affirm.
background 
factual background 
on wednesday,july,a postal inspector at the phoenix branch of the united states postal inspection service uspis intercepted the parcel,which was being sent out of state,on suspicion of narcotics trafficking.the parcel was sent from tubbs at an address in phoenix,arizona to derek brown at west locust street,mechanicsburg,pa 
a phoenix uspis postal inspector deemed the package as suspicious because the return address was fictitious and.additionally,based on his experience,drug traffickers often bring narcotics across the border from mexico into arizona,and then mail them to the east coast.
phoenix uspis contacted postal inspector joseph corrado inspector corrado or corrado at uspis harrisburg,pa branch,about their suspicions concerning the parcel.corrado agreed to investigate,and the phoenix uspis sent him the parcel in harrisburg.
corrado received the parcel the next morning july.that same day,with the assistance of the pennsylvania state police,uspis conducted various name and address verifications and other database checks concerning the parcel addressee and destination address.corrado determined that derek brown was not a person known to receive mail at the residence.corrado testified that the use of a fictitious name is indicative of narcotics trafficking.
since corrado was the only one working narcotics in harrisburg,he relied on state police to assist with the investigation.corrado requested the use of the state police trained narcotics canine,which was able to detect the presence of narcotics in the parcel.with that information,corrado requested that the state police criminal investigation bureau reconnoiter at the parcel destination,and gather intelligence about its recipients.
corrado then presented the foregoing facts to the attorney office,who,in turn,decided to apply for a search warrant to open the parcel.later that day,corrado sent assistant attorney daryl bloom ausa bloom a draft affidavit in support of the search warrant.
the next day july,corrado was on leave from work,and was scheduled to return to work on monday,july.ausa bloom arranged for united states magistrate judge smyser to review a draft of the search warrant application ahead of monday morning,so that it could be executed as soon as corrado returned.
on monday morning july,inspector corrado and ausa bloom conferred with smyser,corrado swore to the truth of his affidavit,and a search warrant for the parcel was issued.within a of obtaining the warrant,inspector corrado returned to uspis harrisburg office,and opened the parcel.the parcel contained approximately twenty pounds of marijuana.
following this discovery,members of the uspis,pennsylvania state police,and cumberland county drug task force,assembled into a team of approximately twelve the controlled delivery and search team or the team for the purpose of carrying out a controlled delivery of the parcel.
before conducting the controlled delivery,the team reconstructed the parcel.they replaced the twenty pounds of marijuana with a representative sample and sham material to represent the original weight of the parcel.in addition,the officers placed indicator equipment,with gps capability,into the parcel to keep track of it,and to be alerted when the parcel was opened 
the same day,pennsylvania state trooper brian overcash trooper overcash,one of the agents assisting with surveillance and intelligence gathering and a member of the controlled delivery and search team,obtained the anticipatory warrant from mdj martin.corrado testified that the anticipatory warrant was obtained by trooper overcash to expedite delivery of the parcel.trooper overcash affidavit in support of the warrant overcash affidavit stated in relevant part 
a federal search and seizure warrant was executed on the parcel.the parcel contained approximately pounds of suspected marijuana.the marijuana was field tested with positive results.
it has been the experience of trooper overcash,that the amount of marijuana seized,is of a quantity consistent with possession with intent to deliver.it has also been the experience of your affiant that persons involved in the sale of controlled substances also have in their possession,or close proximity,other controlled substances,paraphernalia,and records,proceeds associated with the sale of controlled substances.
your affiant requests that an anticipatory search warrant be granted for the residence at west locust st,mechanicsburg.this warrant will only be executed pending a successful controlled delivery of the package.package taken inside residence.additionally the package will transmit an audible beep to officer sic when the package is opened.
trooper overcash affidavit did not specify that the twenty pounds of marijuana had been replaced by a trace amount of marijuana and sham material.nevertheless,the anticipatory warrant authorized a search of the residence,upon completion of the delivery of the parcel to the residence,and once the indicator equipment alerted the controlled delivery and search team that someone had opened the parcel.
on the same day that mdj martin issued the anticipatory warrant,a uspis postal inspector disguised as a letter carrier and wearing a wire,the reconstructed parcel to the residence.at the time of delivery,elijah small small answered the door,and when the undercover inspector asked for derek brown,small went to find him.golson son,corey jamal golson cjg,next appeared at the door.the undercover inspector announced to cjg,i have a parcel here for derek brown.are you derek brown.cjg replied,yes id.at and proceeded to sign for the parcel as derek brown.cjg then took the parcel into the residence.
approximately thirty minutes later,the indicator equipment alerted the controlled delivery and search team that the parcel was opened.both pennsylvania state law enforcement agents,and federal agents all members of the team entered the residence.they found cjg in the kitchen next to the parcel,and small and charles richardson on the second floor of the residence.pennsylvania state law enforcement issued miranda rights to all three individuals and took them into their custody.
acting on the anticipatory warrant,the controlled delivery and search team searched all three floors of golson residence.the following items were seized from cjg bedroom a handgun,a shotgun,and ammunition.the team found the following items in the recording studio room adjacent to cjg bedroom ammunition,including hollow point bullets,packets of heroin packaged for distribution,forty grams of raw heroin,a cutting agent,packaging material consistent with drug distribution,a heat sealer,heat sealable bags,a scale,rubber examination gloves,and masks.id.in the second floor bedroom,determined to be that of golson,the team found the following items a handgun,a shotgun,packets of heroin,rolling papers,and a marijuana grinder.id.the heroin and marijuana positive.the pennsylvania state police took custody of all the seized items.
the record reflects that the parcel was intended for golson,and although cjg represented himself as derek brown to the undercover inspector,he did so only under golson instruction.
ultimately,the government brought charges against cjg,although,initially there was a state prosecution.cjg cooperated with law enforcement by agreeing to testify against golson in the instant case.cjg received a month term of imprisonment as a result of his cooperation 
procedural background 
golson entered a plea of not guilty on a indictment charging him with criminal conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute marijuana and heroin,in violation of u.distribution and possession with intent to distribute marijuana and heroin,in violation of a,b c,b d and and possession of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime,in violation of c a,c l b i.
golson filed a motion to suppress the seizure of evidence allegedly obtained through two separate fourth amendment violations.first,golson argues that the search of the residence violated rule b because mdj martin,who is not a federal judge or a judge of a state court of record,issued the anticipatory warrant and was unreasonable under the fourth amendment because the warrant was obtained based on trooper overcash affidavit that contained misleading material facts.second,golson argues that because inspector corrado retained possession of the parcel for four days before seeking a warrant to open it,the seizure was unreasonable.
after the suppression motion was denied,golson entered a conditional guilty plea to the indictment pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of criminal procedure.under the conditional plea,golson reserved the right to appeal the adverse determinations of his motion to suppress.
the district court sentenced golson to months of imprisonment,three years of supervised release,and issued an assessment fee of and a fine of.golson appeal of the district court denial of his motion for suppression is now before us.
ii.jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction to hear this case pursuant to.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
iii.analysis 
suppression of evidence obtained pursuant to the anticipatory warrant 
the fourth amendment protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures.const.amend.iv.it remains a cardinal principle that searches conducted outside the judicial process,without prior approval by judge or magistrate,without a warrant,are per se unreasonable under the fourth amendment.california acevedo,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted united states robertson,cir generally,for a seizure to be reasonable under the fourth amendment,it must be effectuated with a warrant based on probable cause.
t he ultimate measure of the constitutionality of a governmental search is reasonableness,maryland king,d internal quotation marks omitted however,absent special circumstances,law enforcement agents must obtain a warrant from a neutral magistrate based on probable cause.see treasury employees von raab,d.for federal prosecutorial purposes,a valid warrant must also comply with the federal rules of criminal procedure.see.a.
golson contends that the district court erred in failing to suppress the evidence obtained pursuant to the anticipatory warrant.in support of this contention,golson reiterates his arguments from the original suppression hearing.first,the warrant is invalid because the government failed to have a federal judge or a judge of a pennsylvania court of record issue the warrant,as required by rule b.second,the anticipatory warrant is invalid because the warrant application contained a material misrepresentation of fact.because both of these arguments lack merit,we will affirm the district court denial of golson motion to suppress.
a.the anticipatory warrant is not subject to rule b 
we begin with golson first argument that the government violated rule b when it obtained the anticipatory warrant from mdj martin.as a threshold matter,we must consider whether rule b is applicable to the anticipatory warrant,as the government contends,and if so,whether mdj martin is a judge of a state court of record.b.because these questions require the interpretation of rule b,we exercise plenary review.united states toliver,cir.for the reasons set forth below,we find that the anticipatory warrant is not subject to the mandates of rule b as such,the dispute as to whether mdj martin is a judge of a state court of record is moot 
to put this dispute in context,rule b grants the authority to issue search warrants to federal judges and judges of state courts of record.b in a federal prosecution,rule b will apply,by its own terms,to a search warrant made a t the request of a federal law enforcement officer or an attorney for the federal government.in the third circuit,rule b also applies to warrants made at the request of a law enforcement officer or attorney,if the federal court reviewing the warrant deems the search to be federal in character see united states bedford,cir.indeed i f the search is deemed federal in character,the legality of the search would be conditioned upon a finding that the warrant satisfied federal constitutional requirements and certain provisions of.designed to protect the integrity of the federal courts or to govern the conduct of federal officers.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted emphasis added.
on the other hand,rule b will not apply to a search warrant made at the request of someone other than a federal law enforcement officer or government attorney when the resulting search is state in character,even if the fruits of that warrant are later entered into evidence in a federal prosecution.id.at.in that situation,the warrant,assuming proper issuance under state law,need only conform to federal constitutional requirements.bedford,at.
whether a search can be characterized as either state or federal is a inquiry that looks at the extent to which federal officers were involved in the search and seizure.id.at citing lustig united states.byars united states.t he court must be vigilant to scrutinize the attendant facts with an eye to detect and a hand to prevent violations of the constitution by circuitous and indirect methods.
to determine the warrant validity,we must focus on the facts regarding the character of the search in their totality.bedford,at.in bedford,although agents from both the state and federal government assisted in executing the search warrant,we deemed the search state in character based on assessing the following eight factors 
the warrant was issued under state law and directed to state officers the warrant was predicated on probable violation of state narcotics laws there was no evidence of bad faith on the part of either the state or federal officers federal agents did not assist in the obtaining of the warrant there was no evidence that federal agents instigated or supervised the search defendant was initially arrested by local police officers the majority of the evidence was found by local officers and the products of the search,placed in the custody of local police,formed the basis of a state prosecution.
id.at.the bedford court was more inclined to view the search as a state undertaking in which federal agents participated solely to supply additional manpower for the execution of the warrant.id.at.
applying the factors set forth in bedford,we find that the search of golson residence was state in character.the anticipatory warrant was issued by mdj martin upon state trooper overcash application factor the anticipatory warrant indicated that there was a violation of pennsylvania controlled substance,drug device and cosmetic act.factor golson failed to show bad faith of federal or state officers in obtaining the anticipatory warrant in state court factor while federal officers may have assisted in laying the groundwork for the anticipatory warrant,trooper overcash championed the effort to obtain the warrant factor there is no in
