trevor watson was convicted,after a jury trial,of attempting to kill a federal witness with intent to prevent testimony and communication with law enforcement,see a a,c,for which he was sentenced to months imprisonment.he appeals the conviction,challenging several of the district court evidentiary rulings and asserting that the prosecution allegedly improper closing argument severely prejudiced his case.we affirm.
a brief summary of the facts suffices for now,although we will engage in a more detailed discussion of certain facts and evidence in our analysis of the claims presented on appeal.
in mid,curtis best,his associate antonio narvaez,and their purported ringleader john camacho were among those indicted for participating in a substantial cocaine conspiracy the camacho conspiracy.best agreed to cooperate,and he assisted federal authorities in identifying additional,including the appellant trevor watson.based on this and other evidence,watson was indicted in april for his personal involvement in the illicit operation.
on february,roughly two months prior to his indictment watson,accompanied by his friend jonathan ace,approached best and mutual acquaintance al rue outside of ann jackson barbershop in boston south end.while ace and rue engaged in casual conversation,watson and best slowly walked and talked,lamenting their recent lack of communication.a short distance from the barbershop,watson stopped,enveloped best in a faux embrace,and stabbed him ten times in the kidney,chest,arms,and hands while stating so you talking so you telling,huh at the time,best was still actively cooperating with law enforcement on the camacho case.
ace and rue separated the two,whereupon best was transported to the hospital for emergency surgery.during his initial police interview the following day,best described his assailant as a light to medium skinned,short,stocky male that spoke with a hispanic accent,and a spanish guy with an accent,neither of which fit the appellant.several days later,best recanted those descriptions,and with the assistance of a photo array,identified watson as his attacker.
shortly thereafter,a federal grand jury in the district of massachusetts indicted watson on one count of attempting to kill a federal witness with intent to prevent testimony and communication with law enforcement,a a,c,and one count of using physical force against a federal witness with intent to prevent the same,see a a,c.watson first trial ended in a hung jury in november.he was convicted after a second trial less than a month later,and the district court imposed a month incarcerative sentence.this timely appeal ensued.
watson challenges only his conviction,alleging that the district court erred in admitting certain documents and testimony at trial,and an improper inference drawn by the prosecutor during closing argument irreversibly prejudiced his case.we address each of these claims in turn.
evidentiary issues 
although the admissibility of evidence is ordinarily reviewed for abuse of discretion,united states barrow,cir,where,as here,the appellant failed to interpose any contemporaneous objections at trial,a district court evidentiary determinations are subject only to plain error review,udemba nicoli,cir.to prevail under this exacting standard,watson must demonstrate that the district court decision to admit any of the challenged evidence constituted an error which was clear or obvious,and which not only affected his substantial rights,but also seriously affected the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.united states savarese,cir 
evidence concerning the paul pierce trial 
while watson awaited trial for the subject offense,authorities seized from his prison cell three seemingly incriminating documents.the first,a letter to his friend ricky knight,included the following pertinent excerpt 
i am charged with intimidating a federal witness that has been working since,and assault with intent to murder an informant in front of a barber shop.the police report says it s a male years old with a spanish accent.the police report also says best identified me by putting both thumbs up at my picture in the photo a rray i had introduced my lawyer to the fact that if best was to sign an aff i davit saying i not the guy who stabbed him it was some spanish guy about,which i am not either,i be alright,so please holla at al rue and let end this stuff.
in a second letter addressed to his friend keith mccarthy,watson wrote 
i am charged with assault with intent to murder an d intimidat e federal informant curtis jason best the incident happened at ann barbershop by slades.the barber that was there is a good friend ricky knight phone number redacted he also is good friends with best,so he could be very helpful.i need you to find out if ann the barbershop owner made a statement to help me or not.the police report said it was a year old man with a spanish a ccent that assaulted best.the boston police said best picked out my picture or days later as his attacker.the paul pierce case was the same way,but at trial,he changed his statements and i got found not guilty of attempted murder barber rick phone number redacted.i need best to let those people know that it was a spanish unknown person around in a aff i davit i hear best confronted the spanish guy cut him first,then the tables turned real ugly.i be here for a while,stay in touch,i look forward to your return letter.
emphasis added.finally,in what appears to be a personal checklist,watson scribed the following 
have the barber,truec,bum,or someone have best sign an aff i davit saying it s a year old spanish g uy.
i had no knowledge of the camacho case and no contact with anyone involved.
shara can put witnesses at the scene saying it was a year old spanish g uy.
please have best in court on the stand with my barber present,truec,bum,fred,keith,a host of others.
turned myself in for the paul pierce case and this one.
emphasis added.
the potential evidentiary import of these documents is plain they may fairly be viewed as evidence of a plan to solicit false or misleading eyewitness testimony.less transparent,however at least without additional context is the significance of watson analogies to the paul pierce case.thus,after properly admitting the documents at trial as admissions by a party opponent,see.d a,the court took judicial notice,to which both parties expressly stipulated,of the following facts 
i taking judicial notice of certain facts related to a paul pierce trial.trevor watson and two other individuals were charged with assault with intent to murder,assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon,and assault and battery in relation to the stabbing of paul pierce at the buzz club in boston,massachusetts,on september.
watson was found not guilty of each of the charges which charged assault with intent to murder,assault by means of a dangerous weapon.those are the stabbing charges.but he was found guilty of assault and battery.that means an unlawful push,shove,punch,kneeing someone.but not the stabbing charges.
prior to the trial of the paul pierce case,krystal bostick told the providence police department that on september,she saw a man known to her as trevor stab paul pierce in the back at the buzz club bostick also identified a photograph of trevor watson in an array.in grand jury proceedings before trial,bostick,under oath,described watson as attacking pierce from behind trying to pull him down from the neck,and during this attack wielding a smooth edged knife attached to brass knuckles.
after her interview with the providence police,and her testimony in the grand jury,but prior to trial,krystal bostick reached out to watson defense counsel,met with defense counsel,and signed an affidavit during that meeting in which she recanted her prior testimony.
when called as a witness at trial,bostick gave nonresponsive answers to the prosecutor questions,including testifying that she did not remember the events at the buzz club,and at one point testified that she had no memory of where she was on september.
throughout her testimony,bostick repeatedly recanted her prior statements and identifi
