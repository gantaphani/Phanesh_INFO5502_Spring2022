two different juries have now found the providence fire department liable under title vii to one of its first women firefighters,julia,for that form of sex discrimination known as sexual harassment.asks us to reinstate the first verdict for.the city defends the trial court decision to vacate that verdict and order a new trial but complains that the second verdict,for,based on evidence over a shorter period of time,is unsound.
we conclude that the trial court erred when it vacated the first verdict on the grounds that evidence from before the charge period had been erroneously admitted.the evidence was properly admitted to prove a continuing violation and it would have been error to exclude it.we reinstate the original verdict and remand for recalculation of the attorneys fees due plaintiff for the two trials.in particular,this opinion 
clarifies the continuing violation doctrine as to serial violations 
discusses the interplay between that doctrine and the law of sexual harassment 
applies recent supreme court case law in hostile work environment cases as to the standard for employer liability for i conduct and ii supervisor conduct and 
analyzes whether the damages award based largely on emotional distress and psychological harm is excessive.
we summarize the evidence at trial in the light most favorable to.see andrade jamestown hous,cir 
until,no female firefighters had ever served in the city of providence fire department.in january,and six other women who had passed a written examination were admitted to the city firefighter training program,along with male trainees.was hired under the city newly implemented affirmative action policy.
the structure of authority in the fire department starts with the commissioner of public safety,followed by the chief of the department.next is an assistant chief of the department and a deputy assistant chief,followed by several battalion chiefs,captains,and lieutenants.each of the fourteen stations called engines is headed by a captain,who oversees the station several groups,each of which is headed by a lieutenant or by the station captain.that is the overall management command structure.there were no women in the command structure directly over at any time in question.further,had no women in her group when she was assigned to the various engine companies.she was the first and the lone woman wherever she worked in the department.
in january of,the department chief promulgated a sexual harassment policy.the policy prohibited firefighters from keeping sexually explicit books and magazines,viewing sexually explicit movies,or making sexual jokes at their respective stations.the superior officer at each station was responsible for enforcing the policy,and they had been trained to do so.new firefighters were to be instructed during two hours of sensitivity training,including a component on sexual harassment,to be incorporated into the curriculum of their training program.
underwent this training program.during this period and often in the presence of supervisors,overtly sexual behavior was directed toward.for example,during a class break,a male trainee,ferro,passed around a video camera playing scenes of ferro having sex with his girlfriend.the instructor was in the classroom and did nothing.ferro also discussed his sexual prowess,endurance,penis size,and his sexual encounters during lunch breaks,just outside the training facility.these incidents occurred in the presence of officers.
expressed her disgust and discomfort directly to ferro,but ferro was undeterred.during a training exercise in a pool and in the presence of an officer of the academy,ferro pointed to breasts and commented that she was stacked.ferro constantly discussed sexual positions and oral sex.just blocked them out.while standing in line for roll call,which was conducted by various academy officers,ferro,standing behind,would frequently expound his opinion that women are pigs.
ferro behavior was not unique.another male trainee,mcdonald,snapped bra,commented on her scent,and asked if another female trainee,whom mcdonald called a dyke,ever looked at while they were changing clothes.mcdonald also asked,in the presence of several other firefighters,if she was on birth control.he said he wanted to know so that they could all bang her at a union party that night.common conversation was whether firefighters had gotten banged over the weekend.some of these incidents occurred in the presence of training academy officers.the commentary made so uncomfortable that she began trying to camouflage her body by wearing oversized shirts.she did not complain to any of the officers because she did want to cause any waves and just wanted to get through the academy.
after completing the training program,accepted a temporary assignment in the office of the fire department chief,chief bertoncini.she worked for chief bertoncini from june to september,and after a brief layoff,from november,until march.she performed administrative tasks under the instruction of two women who worked directly for the chief.in presence,the chief sat on the lap of his preferred secretary with his arm around her shoulder,and referred to the other secretary who was not present as a stupid fat bitch and commented on her breast size.
during that time,mccollough,another firefighter working near,blew in her ear,rubbed his cheek against hers,and stood over her with their bodies squarely touching as she made copies.he also asked her out on dates at least twelve times,all of which declined.did not complain to chief bertoncini at the time for fear of being labeled a whiner.
also while at chief bertoncini office,encountered her former fellow trainee ferro,who continued to discuss his sexual encounters in front of her and urged to have him,promising that if she did,she would never want another man.these comments often were made in the presence of officers.felt distinctly uncomfortable around ferro.
chief johnson,the superintendent of the carpentry shop located in the fire prevention bureau,told that mcdonald the one who had snapped bra during training talked about her a lot and was crazy about her.made it clear to chief johnson that she was not interested.
in march of,was assigned to engine,group b.the engine company consisted of four groups,each with an officer in charge,one of whom also served as captain of the house.was the only female firefighter at engine.the company living quarters consisted of a common bathroom,kitchen,and sitting room each firefighter had a private bedroom.a typical shift involved two days and two nights on,four days off.saw stacks of pornographic magazines in the common sitting room and bathroom,which sometimes were open to a page displaying pictures of naked men and women engaged in sexual acts.saw male firefighters reading the magazines,which made her very uncomfortable.the officers knew the magazines were there and did nothing.this inaction clearly violated the harassment policy,however,did not complain.
in the summer of,lieutenant young,who was acting head of group,suggested that the group take a patrol ride through their district in a fire truck.lieutenant young offered the other firefighters beer,which declined.while they were driving through a part of the district that was known as a popular hangout for men,lieutenant young wrote name and the station phone number on pieces of paper and threw them out the window to the men on the street below.asked him to stop,but lieutenant young laughed and continued.
in the fall of,injured her hand and was out for four or five months,but continued to go to the station weekly to pick up her paycheck.during one such visit,encountered her commanding officer,lieutenant cionfolo.lieutenant cionfolo asked how she met her boyfriend.then,referring to one of the women in chief bertoncini office,he told you just a virgin and the woman lies flat on her back.
also during this time,a chief officer told brother coley,also a city of providence firefighter,to warn her that there was a closed circuit television hidden in her bedroom at engine,scheduled to return to work the next week,called her commanding officer,lieutenant cionfolo,and asked him to investigate the rumor.she asked him not to tell anyone or make a big thing out of it if it was just a rumor.lieutenant cionfolo arranged for to meet him at the station the next day to investigate and he promised not to tell anyone.when she arrived,lieutenant cionfolo,in the presence of two other firefighters in the group,told her we did find the video camera.accompanied lieutenant cionfolo to her room,which was being used by a male firefighter while was not there.she noticed a poster of a woman on the wall when she objected to lieutenant cionfolo,he removed it.was unsure whether there was a camera in her room,especially since a chief officer had warned her.she wore pants to bed,had difficulty falling asleep,and was afraid to change in her room because she felt like i was being invaded of my privacy when i was in that room.
shortly after returning to work,while at another station,was sitting with several male firefighters.the men were in regular uniform but without their outer jackets on,which were to be worn outside.jacket was on the back of her chair.station chief costa entered the room and asked if the jacket was hers,then told her you put that jacket on and you keep it on.none of the male firefighters were told to wear their outer jackets.
another firefighter at engine,isom,left a note on bed asking her out on a date.discovered it upon returning from a call at was concerned that isom had been in her room late at night while she was there.she took the note to the officer in charge,lieutenant dunne,and asked him to talk to isom about it and tell him that she was not interested in dating him.dunne spoke to isom,but,a few days later,isom verbally asked on a date.declined and again spoke to dunne,who told her he would take care of it.
after the incident,avoided isom she was plagued by worries that she might have to work with him somewhere else at another station in a dormitory where he might be sleeping next to me.in general,felt awkward all the time to be working with men whom she knew wanted to go out with her 
i tried to be nice to them as much as possible.they my,but also in the back of my mind is that i also have to go to a fire with them,and i inexperienced,and i want to know that these people are not going to stand there and let me fall flat on my face.
started becoming anxious when she had to go to work and had trouble sleeping when she was at the station overnight.
once had an accident backing the fire truck into the station she hit the wall of the station and damaged a ladder.department procedure required drivers to have spotters while backing into the station,but none were available at the time.when chief costa investigated,he was told that there had not been spotters available.he told that she was going to have to take the heat for this and say that there were spotters present,an untruth.complied.after a hearing before the accident review board,was put on probation for six months.
in april,fought her first major fire.that event would ultimately lead to her transfer to engine,a different station.some standard procedures were not followed during the fire lieutenant cionfolo did not give instructions or follow protocol in engaging engine line,which he handed to a member of a different fire company instead of left the fire floor to get a new air tank after hers ran out,and she assisted a rescue company with a fire victim before returning to her position on the fire floor.left her position on the line after an alarm went off indicating that she had only minutes remaining in her air pack.on her way to get a new pack,she encountered chief costa,the district battalion chief in charge of her station,in the stairwell.chief costa ordered to get the fuck back up those stairs.obeyed the order,but ultimately ran out of air and returned to engine to retrieve a new tank.after the fire was out,chief costa walked past and asked,why did you leave your company but did not give a chance to respond.had seen many mistakes by others at the fire and felt singled out by chief costa comment.she told lieutenant cionfolo about the incident,who told her not to worry about it.
four days after the fire,lieutenant cionfolo informed that she was to attend a meeting with him,chief costa,and dave curry,a union representative,to discuss her performance at the fire.no other firefighters in group were required to attend similar meetings,and lieutenant cionfolo told her that she was the biggest problem at the fire.chief costa asked to account for her actions during the fire.when described the incident where chief costa had ordered her back upstairs after her air tank alarm went off,costa interrupted her,saying repeatedly,i did tell you to get back up those stairs.i told you to get the fuck back up those stairs.chief costa said to,you know,i not doing this because you a woman responded,you must have a problem with it because you keep bringing it up that i a woman.chief costa replied,this is how you get your reputation.recounted the events of the fire several times over the course of approximately two hours chief costa and lieutenant cionfolo told her that their records did not match what she was telling them.when chief costa asked why she did not have a line,she told him that lieutenant cionfolo had given it to a member of another company,a violation of protocol.they also confronted about a rumor that she was seeking to transfer out of the company and asked her if she wanted to go to fire prevention replied that she wanted to remain a firefighter and that she did come on this job to sit up in an office.chief costa ended the meeting by asking and lieutenant cionfolo whether they could continue working replied that she could,but cionfolo did not reply.the union representative,curry,opined that the problem was just a personality conflict.chief costa directed and lieutenant cionfolo to meet to work things out,and to report the results to him the next day.
the next day,met with lieutenant cionfolo.he accused her of having sold him down the river by telling chief costa that he gave up his line at the fire.he repeated the rumor about wanting to transfer admitted that she was interested in going to a company that was more committed to doing drills and maintaining preparedness.lieutenant cionfolo told her to get out of his station and that she was off his group.he took gear off of the truck and told her to report to a different station.he called chief costa in presence and told him she was rude,disrespectful,and did know what the christ she was doing.was summoned to another meeting with chief costa,where she was asked to sign a transfer form on which lieutenant cionfolo had written that they had reached an impasse that will affect our working together and that it was in the best interest of the department and engine company that be transferred did not agree to the transfer but understood that she had no choice.
submitted a form to department chief bertoncini describing her version of the events during the fire and requesting a meeting with him,but was told by chief bertoncini secretary that the chief would not respond.when met with the union,george farrell,to file a grievance with the union about her transfer,he discouraged from filing a grievance,telling her you do want to do that,do you,so she did not.after a temporary detail,she was transferred permanently to engine.
arrived at engine on may,and met with the officer in charge that day,lieutenant gonsalves,as well as the other firefighters in her group,all male at the meeting,they asked whether she minded that they slept in their underwear the sleeping quarters at engine consisted of one room of beds,without partitions.did not object.the showers and bathrooms were not private.slept in her full uniform and did not use the showers.lieutenant gonsalves and other firefighters asked her about the fire,stating that they heard she had bailed out.the captain of the station,captain hiter,who also headed group,informed that she came to engine with a black cloud,a bad reputation because she had bailed out of the fire.before arrived,captain hiter told her brother vincent,also a providence firefighter,that the group was not happy about her coming to work there,and that captain hiter himself had a problem working with a woman.
asked captain hiter for a locker to store personal belongings,including personal hygiene items.he told her none were available and that lockers were issued by seniority was the least senior in her group.others in her group had lockers issued by the city.brought in her own.
on her first day,found pornographic magazines in the drawers of the kitchen and sitting area.she did not say anything because it was accepted it was everywhere and because she just got shacked out of engine to engine and did not want to begin her stay at engine on a bad note.on about three occasions,witnessed the male firefighters in her group watching pornographic movies in the common sitting area.had to pass through the area in order to access the kitchen.captain hiter knew that these materials were in the station and that the city sexual harassment policy prohibited them,but did nothing.
shortly after arrived,lieutenant gonsalves told that he and the other firefighters in her group were trying to find a way to have put on detail out of engine on july because they wanted to light off fireworks and did not want there.lieutenant gonsalves also told,we did take you over here lying down.we do want you here.you were just transferred over here.captain hiter confirmed that was to take a detail on july,even though it was not her turn,because the male firefighters wanted to celebrate together as a group.was upset because the group was supposed to make decisions collectively about who took details,without the captain influence,and because she was supposed to be a part of that company now but was obviously unwanted.nonetheless,she did as she was instructed.
on another occasion,returning from a call,and her group passed cheaters,a topless bar.lieutenant gonsalves,who was the officer in charge at the time,commented that our sister has a vip pass to get us into cheaters.was embarrassed but did not say anything because she wanted to be as nice as possible to these guys and want ed them to accept me.
within a month of her arrival at engine,and captain hiter began meeting to discuss various issues,including complaints about by the other firefighters in her group that was trying to get away with things when captain hiter was not there.captain hiter asked about whether her locker was city property because other,more senior firefighters in the company complained that she was not entitled to a locker it was later determined that the locker was not city property,and was allowed to keep it.
by september,noticed that the male firefighters frequently met behind closed doors in captain hiter office without inviting her in these meetings occurred daily,with or without captain hiter,but always excluding.asked captain hiter what was motivating the exclusionary meetings and why they never talked as a group,but captain hiter did not respond.
ostracism intensified.on one call,when was driving,she asked lieutenant gonsalves for directions,as she was new to the district and did not know her way around other firefighters routinely helped each other with directions while driving.lieutenant gonsalves responded,i not the fucking chauffeur,you are.when approached her colleagues after a fire,they all walked away from her.one of the chiefs from another station referred to as the maytag man because she was always alone.if rode in the back of the fire truck,the firefighters in the cab closed the window so that she could not hear what was being said.when the group met after a fire to debrief,they ignored questions about her performance and rolled their eyes.
other incidents contributed to the hostile environment.one firefighter kept pictures of nude women in his locker,which saw she described the effect of seeing those pictures 
i see these pictures of these women there,and is this what they think of women is this how they viewing me there was no respect.
another discussed oral sex and asked if she knew whether a particular firefighter girlfriend swallowed deep.male firefighters frequently referred to women as cunts or pussies.
car was damaged,and she suspected it was vandalized by one of her.in addition,her locker was glued shut.lieutenant gonsalves and other firefighters in her group frequently referred to food was eating as lesbian food.
the ostracism took its toll on.in addition to gaining a significant amount of weight,she had difficulty sleeping because she was up all night agonizing about going to work.she became exhausted and was a nervous wreck.
the atmosphere at engine continued to deteriorate.in september,once again was assigned to a detail when it was not her turn,as she had been on july.when she attempted to check the station records to confirm whose turn it was,lieutenant gonsalves simply repeated that she had to take the detail.lieutenant gonsalves made a comment to,disilva another firefighter,that just got nothing but big tits.someone hung a poster in the dormitory of a woman in a provocative pose,entitled miss julie stratton,but with the last name crossed out so that it read miss julie,whose first name is julia,understood this to be a reference to her.brother vincent removed the poster.vincent also found mail taped to locker that was addressed,firefighter julia awol.
also at that time,brothers vincent and coley came to engine to confront the male firefighters about their treatment of.coley had discussed his concerns with chief johnson on several occasions,and chief johnson finally suggested that coley should go talk to the members of engine and try to straighten the situation out.the brothers had a heated exchange with lieutenant gonsalves and captain hiter as a result of that incident,brothers were disciplined.
after that,disilva met with chief cotter to discuss his concerns about the male firefighters treatment of in general and told chief cotter about lieutenant gonsalves comment that had nothing but big tits.at chief cotter request,disilva submitted a written complaint to the department chief.no one from the chief office contacted disilva about his complaint.
on september,shortly after the incident involving her brothers,decided to seek help from the city eeo officer,gwen andrade.she did not follow the chain of command by complaining to captain hiter because he knew what was happening at engine but had done nothing about it.met with andrade,along with a union representative,stephen day,a union attorney whose presence did not request,and disilva.showed them the altered poster but got no response.they laughed when told them about the lesbian food comments.union representative day told the meeting was limited to discussing engine conduct only,although wanted to discuss the earlier incidents.eeo officer andrade did not ask any questions during the meeting.andrade concluded that complaints were related to social issues,not work issues,and ended the meeting by telling to come up with solutions.then retained her own attorney.
after meeting with andrade,group continued to exclude her,spending time in captain hiter office with the door closed.because was excluded from group discussions about upcoming drills,she would be the only member of her group who was unprepared when it was time to perform the drills.during one such drill,one of the firefighters screamed at in front of others for not being prepared.
still attempted to discuss her concerns with captain hiter,but he did nothing.she began receiving crank phone calls at home and at the station,with the caller whining or making crude noises.she was a nervous wreck while at work and sometimes felt her body shake uncontrollably.while responding to a call,took a wrong turn and had an accident while trying to turn around.that incident was the breaking point.felt she was no longer able to function and left work on status in december.she began seeing a psychiatrist,with whom she continues treatment.when went to the station to retrieve her belongings,she discovered pornographic mail belonging to a fellow firefighter had been placed in her locker.
in january of,with her attorney,met with chiefs bennett and cotter,as well as the city attorney,to discuss complaint.the two chiefs were assigned to investigate allegations.had prepared an outline and discussed many of the incidents that had occurred at both engine and engine,and answered the chiefs questions.she emphasized that she was eager to have the matter resolved and return to work,and asked the chiefs to tell her if she was doing something wrong.at the end of the meeting,was told that she would be contacted when their investigation was completed.the two chiefs scheduled no further meetings with her.
approximately one month after the meeting,called chief bennett to discuss the status of the investigation.chief bennett told her that he was unable to proceed with the investigation because they refusing to speak there no use.chief bennett also told that there was a gag order put out prohibiting him from speaking to firefighters,lieutenants,and lower than a chief.the new chief of the department,chief dimascolo,had told bennett and cotter that the union did not want its members involved in the investigation,and chief dimascolo declined to take any action to encourage their participation.frustrated,chief bennett and chief cotter withdrew from the investigation in february.shortly thereafter filed her administrative charge of discrimination.
remained out of work for over two years.as a result of the stress she experienced,gained a total of pounds.she was anxious and afraid to leave the house,and was particularly anxious about encountering providence firefighters.
returned to work at the fire department in.following her psychiatrist advice she no longer works as a line firefighter but instead joined fire prevention,where she remains today.
on july,filed a discrimination charge with the rhode island commission of human rights and with the equal employment opportunity commission and received notice of right to sue.also filed a federal court complaint against the city on june,and an amended complaint on july,also naming four firefighters as individual defendants the complaint included claims of disparate impact and sex discrimination under title vii and rhode island law,as well as claims.
a jury trial began july.defendants filed a motion in limine to exclude all evidence of harassment occurring before tenure at engine on the grounds that those acts were outside title vii limitations period and that such evidence was unduly prejudicial and should be excluded pursuant to.invoked the continuing violation doctrine,alleging that there were acts occurring before and during the period,and arguing that the evidence was not unduly prejudicial under rule but relevant to proving that theory.the court denied defendants motion.
introduced evidence of harassment spanning the entire duration of her employment at the fire department from to her time spent in training in,the period in which she worked in the chief office later that year,her stay at engine in,and finally,her seven months at engine in.at the close of case,defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law.the court granted the motion as to the counts against the city and individual defendants on the ground that there was no evidence that the city of providence or the individual defendants had intentionally discriminated against.does not appeal this decision.the court also dismissed title vii disparate impact claims as duplicative of her hostile work environment sexual harassment claim.that reasoning is legally doubtful,but does not appeal this decision either,and so,for purposes of this opinion,we take the hostile work environment claims as encompassing any disparate impact claims.
the court also ruled that t he statute of limitation clearly applies in this case,and limits the plaintiff claims to september,forward for sexual harassment.when argued that the earlier evidence was relevant to show a continuing violation,the court responded i allowed that evidence in to show a pattern,but it does have anything to do with the claim that took place at engine.the whole gist of your case is what happened at engine.the court also noted failure to complain about her treatment before september.counting back days from when filed her complaint with the eeoc on july,the court found claim was limited to the incidents occurring at engine since september.because the state limitations period was days,and for the sake of simplicity,the court decided that evidence from may,the time transferred to engine could be considered.the district court instructed the jury only to consider engine evidence and not to consider any of the evidence it had heard about the two years prior to engine tenure.having been successful in its motion to exclude evidence for the period before worked at engine,the city was not permitted to put on evidence in its case relating to incidents.the city had,of course,plaintiff witnesses on this point.the city made no offer of proof.
the jury awarded against the city on her hostile work environment sexual harassment claim.the city moved for a new trial.the district court granted the motion on the ground that it had committed a prejudicial error of law by allowing evidence of sexual harassment,and because it believed its curative instruction to the jury was ineffective.the verdict was excessive,the court thought,because that sum made it clear that the jury had considered evidence in awarding compensatory damages,despite the court contrary instruction.
second trial began in april.the district court limited the evidence to tenure at engine,from may to december of.once again,the jury found in favor of,awarding her against the city on her hostile work environment claim.
the city again moved for a new trial,which the district court denied.sought an award of attorneys fees and costs for both trials.the district court awarded in attorneys fees and in costs for the second trial only no costs were awarded for the first trial.
the city appeals the district court denial of its motion for a new trial after the second trial,and seeks on reinstatement of the first jury award,as well as attorneys fees and costs for the first trial.
to reinstate original verdict 
we begin with from the judgment as a matter of law in favor of defendants at the close of evidence in the first trial and from the grant of a new trial after the first jury verdict.the district court power to grant a motion for a new trial is limited to those circumstances in which allowing the verdict to stand would result in a miscarriage of justice.see velazquez,cir.the appellate court review is for abuse of discretion.but where,as here,the court order granting a new trial is based upon a legal conclusion,we review that ruling de novo.see fleet bank anchor media television,cir because the court order granting defendants a new trial was based solely upon its legal conclusions that defective claims had been allowed to go to the jury,we first determine the correctness of the court rulings in this regard.
defendants had filed a motion in limine to exclude all evidence of events before the charge filing period,arguing that such evidence was barred by the statute of limitations and by rule.granting this motion would have meant no evidence could be introduced of the events taking place before september,four months after was assigned to engine.
objected,arguing that the case came within the continuing violation doctrine,an equitable exception to the filing period,because there was an ongoing pattern of discrimination.see provencher cvs pharmacy,cir.if the doctrine applied,it would have two consequences could introduce earlier evidence and she could recover damages for earlier conduct.there is a second theory under which earlier evidence was arguably,that even if the continuing violation doctrine did not apply,the evidence was still relevant and probative as to whether the later discrimination took place.see united air lines,evans,d.s ometimes prior incidents become admissible as relevant background evidence.lindemann grossman,employment discrimination law ed see also morrison carleton woolen mills,cir.but the focus at trial was on admissibility under the continuing violation doctrine,and so we shall focus on it.
the district court denied the motion in limine,stating that it could not make a decision on relevancy in a vacuum.so the,evidence was allowed in.the city objected to some of the evidence,but not to most of it.where it made no objections,the city has waived any claim that the evidence was inadmissible.an unsuccessful motion in limine does not preserve an evidentiary objection.see fusco general motors,cir.at the end of the plaintiff case,defendants moved for judgment,again arguing that evidence of events before september,was inadmissible on statute of limitations and rule grounds.the plaintiff argued that the continuing violation exception to the statute of limitations applied.the city presented no counter argument in reply and kept hammering a single theme,as though the continuing violation doctrine did not exist.
after dismissing the individual defendants from the case,leaving only the city,the district court held that the period evidence was admitted in error because the statute of limitations barred the evidence.like the city,the district court never explicitly addressed invocation of the continuing violation doctrine or why it would not apply.that omission was itself error.indeed,the only reason expressed by the district court in support of its decision was its feeling that had brought these events on herself,see infra note,and that therefore the events were irrelevant to her discrimination claim.insofar as the court thought that to be a reason for applying the statute of limitations,it erred.indeed,the district court expressed its feeling that plaintiff case as to events failed on its merits,calling it all eyewash.any determination of the merits was for the jury,not the court.
these errors could prove to be harmless if was in fact not entitled to use the continuing violation doctrine.we review de novo a judgment as a matter of law that the continuing violation doctrine does not apply.see provencher,at schultz rhode island hosp.trust bank,cir.unless there are no material facts in dispute permitting resolution as a matter of law as to whether a continuing violation occurred,it is a jury issue.we reverse a judge determination if we determine that a reasonable jury could have found in plaintiff favor.provencher,at.we conclude that a reasonable jury could have found that was a victim of a continuing violation.see cambridge plating,napco,cir whether discovery rule exception applied see also martin nannie and the newborns,cir reversing grant of summary judgment in sexual harassment case where jury could find plaintiff made out continuing violation.
before analyzing why a jury could find the continuing violation doctrine applicable,there is an important definition to be emphasized.by its nature,a hostile work environment often means that there are a series of events which mount over time to create such a poisonous atmosphere as to violate the law.in the leading supreme court cases,the evidence of harassment covered a period of years.faragher city of boca raton,d period harris forklift,d two and a half years meritor sav.bank,fsb vinson,d four years.and so there is a natural affinity between the hostile work environment theory and the continuing violation doctrine.thus,a court should not hastily dismiss on timeliness grounds a harassment claim where a continuing violation is alleged.yet the two theories are not the same and not every hostile work environment claim presents a plausible continuing violation.like the third circuit,we decline to adopt a per se rule that a properly alleged hostile work environment claim also constitutes a continuing violation.west philadelphia,cir.
we look at whether the defendant conduct constitutes harassment under title vii,then determine whether a reasonable jury could have found that there was a continuing violation of title vii,thus allowing to present evidence of acts before the filing period.a brief overview of title vii sexual harassment law is helpful.
hostile work environment 
title vii of the civil rights act of prohibits an employer from discriminating against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin.a west.t he very fact that the discriminatory conduct was so severe or pervasive that it created a work environment abusive to employees because of their race,gender,religion,or national origin offends title vii broad rule of workplace equality.harris,at.courts have long recognized that sexual harassment is a form of gender discrimination prohibited by title vii.provencher,at.
title vii sexual harassment law has evolved considerably from its early focus on quid pro quo sexual harassment,where an employee or supervisor uses his or her superior position to extract sexual favors from a subordinate employee,and if denied those favors,retaliates by taking action adversely affecting the subordinate employment.see,lipsett of puerto rico,cir collecting cases.title vii also allows a plaintiff to prove unlawful discrimination by showing that the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment.harris,at.citations omitted.further,title vii protection is not limited to economic or tangible discrimination.id.
the supreme court has outlined the tests a plaintiff must meet to succeed in a hostile work environment claim that she or he is a member of a protected class that she was subjected to unwelcome sexual harassment that the harassment was based upon sex that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of plaintiff employment and create an abusive work environment that sexually objectionable conduct was both objectively and subjectively offensive,such that a reasonable person would find it hostile or abusive and the victim in fact did perceive it to be so and that some basis for employer liability has been established.see faragher,at.harris,at.meritor,at.it is undisputed that is a member of a protected class and that she considered defendants conduct unwelcome thus,the first two elements of her claim are met.the evidence is compelling that she suffered harassment based on sex.see oncale sundowner offshore,d courts and juries have found the inference of discrimination easy to draw in most sexual harassment situations,because the challenged conduct typically involves explicit or implicit proposals of sexual activity.we discuss employer liability,the sixth element,a bit later.
in hostile environment cases,the fourth and fifth elements are typically the most important.they must be determined by the in light of the record as a whole and the totality of the circumstances.meritor,at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.several factors typically should be considered in making this determination the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.see faragher,at.quoting harris,at.
as part of its evaluation,a jury may consider a broad range of conduct that can contribute to the creation of a hostile work environment.indeed,harassing conduct need not be motivated by sexual desire to support an inference of discrimination on the basis of sex.oncale,at.evidence of sexual remarks,innuendoes,ridicule,and intimidation may be sufficient to support a jury verdict for a hostile work environment.see white new hampshire dep t of corrections,cir universidad metropolitana,cir evidence of two specific incidents of harassment in the context of an ongoing pattern of conduct sufficient to survive summary judgment in hostile work environment claim.the accumulated effect of incidents of humiliating,offensive comments directed at women and pranks,taken together,can constitute a hostile work environment.williams general motors,cir.
still,conduct that results from genuine but innocuous differences in the ways men and women routinely interact with members of the same sex and of the opposite sex does not violate title vii.oncale,at.thus,offhand comments,and isolated incidents are not sufficient to create actionable harassment the hostile work environment standard must be kept sufficiently demanding to ensure that title vii does not become a general civility code.faragher,at.quoting oncale,at.
certain comments by the district court lead us to emphasize two other controlling principles.first,harassment that is not overtly sexual is nonetheless actionable under title vii,so evidence of that sort may be admissible.alleged conduct that is not explicitly racial in nature may,in appropriate circumstances,be considered along with more overtly discriminatory conduct in assessing a title vii harassment claim.banco popular de puerto rico,cir,citing degrace rumsfeld,cir evidence of equipment sabotage and silent treatment considered along with racially explicit notes.that reasoning applies equally to sexual harassment where a plaintiff endures harassing conduct,although not explicitly sexual in nature,which undermines her ability to succeed at her job,those acts should be considered along with overtly sexually abusive conduct in assessing a hostile work environment claim.see lipsett,at conduct that was not explicitly sexual was nonetheless charged with animus,and therefore could be found to have contributed significantly to the hostile environment.as the eleventh circuit observed,
sexual harassment which creates a hostile or offensive environment for members of one sex is every bit the arbitrary barrier to sexual equality at the workplace that racial harassment is to racial equality.surely,a requirement that a man or woman run a gauntlet of sexual abuse in return for the privilege of being allowed to work and make a living can be as demeaning and disconcerting as the harshest of racial epithets.

the second principle follows.courts should avoid disaggregating a hostile work environment claim,dividing conduct into instances of sexually oriented conduct and instances of unequal treatment,then discounting the latter category of conduct.such an approach defies the meritor court directive to consider the totality of circumstances in each case and rob s the incidents of their cumulative effect.williams,at.moreover,such an approach not only ignores the reality that incidents of nonsexual as work sabotage,exclusion,denial of support,and in context contribute to a hostile work environment,it also nullifies the harassing nature of that conduct an employer might escape liability,even if it knew about certain conduct,if that conduct is isolated from a larger pattern of acts that,as a whole,would constitute an actionable hostile work environment.thus,employers would lack the incentive to correct behavior that,like more overtly sexual forms of harassment,works against integrating women into the workforce.see burlington indus.ellerth,d citing title vii basic policy of encouraging forethought by employers williams,at recognizing as harassment conduct that is not overtly sexual go es to the core of plaintiff entitlement to a workplace free of discriminatory animus.
statute of limitations problems must be understood in the context of substantive law.the stage set,we turn to the limitations issue.
b.the continuing violation doctrine 
a plaintiff who brings a hostile work environment claim under title vii must file her claim within days of an act of discrimination,and in general can not litigate claims based on conduct falling outside of that period.see provencher,at.the limitations period serves to protect employers from the burden of defending claims arising from employment decisions that are long past.thomas eastman kodak,cir quoting delaware state college ricks,d.but where a title vii violation is of a continuing nature,the charge of discrimination filed may be timely as to all discriminatory acts encompassed by the violation so long as the charge is filed during the life of the violation or within the statutory period.pilgrim trustees of tufts college,cir quoting kassaye bryant college,cir.the continuing violation doctrine is an equitable exception that allows an employee to seek damages for otherwise allegations if they are deemed part of an ongoing series of discriminatory acts and there is some violation within the statute of limitations period that anchors the earlier claims.provencher,at.this ensures that these plaintiffs claims are not foreclosed merely because the plaintiffs needed to see a pattern of repeated acts before they realized that the individual acts were discriminatory.thomas,at.
before analyzing whether a jury could find the continuing violation doctrine applicable,there are important definitions of the problem to be emphasized.this is not a case,like provencher,where the problem with application of the doctrine was that there was no discriminatory act within the charge filing period.see at.the city made no such claim and the district court found there were claimed discriminatory acts in the engine era.this is also not a case of claimed continuing effects from earlier discriminatory policies,as in united air lines,evans.see at.nor is this a case of a claimed systemic violation under the continuing violation doctrine,where an employer maintains a discriminatory policy that is responsible for multiple discriminatory acts that may not fall within the statutory period.see provencher,at.the question is instead whether what claimed fell within the branch of the continuing violation doctrine which courts have called serial violations.
this court has identified several criteria in determining the sufficiency of a serial continuing violation claim,which we summarize here 
is the subject matter of the discriminatory acts sufficiently similar that there is a substantial relationship between the otherwise untimely acts and the timely acts see pueblo int l,cir sabree united of carpenters joiners local,cir.
are the acts isolated and discrete or do they occur with frequency or repetitively or continuously see provencher,at.
are the acts of sufficient permanence that they should trigger an awareness of the need to assert one rights see jensen frank,cir sabree,at.
allowing for variations in language,this is essentially the test first articulated by the fifth circuit in berry board of supervisors of louisiana state,cir,and adopted in a majority of other circuits west philadelphia,cir mascheroni bd.of regents of of,cir selan kiley,cir bell chesapeake ohio ry,cir roberts gadsden mem,cir other circuits,while not expressly adopting the berry court test,employ similar standards to determine whether the continuing violation doctrine applies.see,van zant klm royal dutch airlines,cir instances of discrimination must be specific and related and plaintiff must be without notice of discriminatory nature of events when they occur curry district of columbia,mentioning approaches taken by other circuits but rejecting plaintiff continuing violation claim because conduct alleged not sufficiently similar.
the first two criteria are easily met on this record.the only arguable issue is whether plaintiff produced sufficient evidence on the third criterion,which goes to whether the earlier acts were sufficient to put on notice that she had a substantial,actionable claim and should have complained earlier.this is not a case where there was a single act of such permanence or import to act as a trigger.see sabree,at late claim not excused where plaintiff admitted that he believed,at every turn,that he was being discriminated against and there was no substantial relationship between the transfers complained of.rather,this case raises what may be the most difficult question under the doctrine whether the sheer volume and repetition of the harassment should,as a matter of law,have led to file a discrimination claim earlier.
it is here that the statute of limitations question overlaps with the substantive law of hostile work environment.it would be anomalous to say that,for statute of limitations purposes,a plaintiff should be on notice that she has a discrimination claim where the substantive law says she does not have such a claim yet.here,the relevant law makes clear that often a sexual harassment claim will not accrue until after a period of recurring acts of harassment.a plaintiff usually will not have a viable claim of hostile work environment from single acts that are isolated or sporadic or not themselves severe enough to alter the work environment and create an abusive work from an objective and subjective viewpoint.or they may not of themselves appear to be discriminatory.but the recurrence of events that do not of themselves appear to be discriminatory may,over time,come to demonstrate both an increasingly difficult environment and that the events lack an innocent explanation.a plaintiff may be unable to appreciate that he is being discriminated against until he has lived through a series of acts and is thereby able to perceive the overall discriminatory pattern.sabree,at.as the seventh circuit has said,
sexual harassment serious enough to constitute unlawful discrimination on grounds of sex is often a cumulative process rather than a one time event.in its early stages it may not be diagnosable as sex discrimination,or may not cross the threshold that separates the nonactionable from the actionable,or may not cause sufficient distress to be worth making a federal case out of,or may not have gone on long enough to charge the employer with knowledge and a negligent failure to take effective remedial measures.

here,it can not be said as a matter of law that was on notice that she had to file an eeoc claim before september.own actions show that in the course of september of,things started to reach a breaking point for her her health was deteriorating and her brothers efforts to intervene at the station to protect her had failed.one could reasonably infer that she had not realized there was actionable discrimination until this point.and once was on notice of the harassment,she brought the matter to the city attention.she sought the assistance of the city eeo officer.when the eeo officer did nothing,turned to captain hiter when he did nothing,she turned to chiefs bennett and cotter.when the department,under pressure from the union,frustrated the investigation by prohibiting bennett and cotter from talking to anyone below the level of chief,it became clear that there would be no recourse for short of filing an eeoc complaint.and she did so promptly.a reasonable jury could easily have found that this case fit within the continuing violation doctrine.and because the evidence was necessary to prove a continuing violation,it was error to exclude it under rule.the probative value far outweighed any prejudice.
as a result,there was no error in the district court original decision to admit the evidence and there was error in its later decision to instruct the jury not to consider the evidence.because the grant of the new trial was based on the later erroneous decision,the order granting the new trial on that basis was in error.what to do about that error requires further analysis.we pause,though,to consider whether the new trial order may be affirmed on the judge alternate ground.
other grounds 
while not entirely clear,it appears that the trial judge concluded from the size of the verdict,that the jury had not followed his instructions to disregard conduct,and that defendant had been prejudiced as a result and that this amounted to a miscarriage of justice.
but this conclusion is flawed for two reasons.first,even if the jury did not follow their instructions,such error was not prejudicial because,as we have ruled,the instructions were erroneous the jury was entitled to consider the conduct of the defendant.second,there is no ground to believe that the jury did in fact fail to follow their instructions.the law requires that we assume that the jury followed instructions and only awarded for engine conduct.see united states,cir o ur system of trial by jury is premised on the assumption that jurors will scrupulously follow the court instructions.the gap between a award at the second trial,where no evidence was admitted,and a verdict at the first trial,does not mean the jury the first time around also awarded for conduct.and we have no other basis to assume the jury failed to follow instructions.
if,alternatively,the trial judge ruling was based on the belief that the verdict alone warranted setting aside the jury decision,the ruling was still in error.a jury award of damages stands unless it is grossly excessive or shocking to the conscience.brown freedman baking,cir.whether the jury award here can be so characterized depends on what damages plaintiff was entitled to sue for and whether she adequately proved those damages.compensatory but not punitive damages are available under against local governmental agencies compensatory damages include noneconomic injuries,such as emotional distress,pain and suffering,harm to reputation,and other consequential injury,caused by the defendant unlawful conduct.lindemann grossman,employment discrimination law.
