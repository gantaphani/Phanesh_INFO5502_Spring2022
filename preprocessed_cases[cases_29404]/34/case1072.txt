the plaintiff class challenges the seizure and detention of vehicles by the city of new york.this appeal is taken from the most recent order issued in this litigation,the december,amended order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york mukasey,insofar as the order allows a district attorney to decide unilaterally that a vehicle seized pursuant to a warrantless arrest should be retained as potential evidence for a criminal proceeding.for the following reasons,we conclude that due process requires review by a neutral.we therefore vacate the amended order and remand to the district court.
background 
this is the third time this section action comes to this court.commenced in,the action challenges the constitutionality of new york city forfeiture statute,city admin.code.six of the seven named plaintiffs were arrested for driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol the seventh had her car seized after her estranged husband was arrested for drugs and weapons possession while using it.in all seven instances,the vehicles were seized as instrumentalities of the crime,with a view to forfeiture.none of the vehicles was seized as evidence,property that may be needed as evidence for a criminal prosecution 
on november,the district court dismissed the action on the ground that the probable cause supporting an arrest constituted sufficient process to support the seizure and continued impoundment of a vehicle.this court reversed in krimstock kelly,cir krimstock i,which held that due process requires a prompt hearing before a neutral to test the probable validity of the deprivation pendente lite,including the probable cause for the initial warrantless seizure and the necessity and legitimacy of continued impoundment.krimstock i,at.we remanded for the district court i to decide plaintiffs motion for class certification pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure and ii to fashion a hearing process that rectifies the constitutional infirmities in new york forfeiture statute.
krimstock i considered only the seizure and retention of vehicles for forfeiture as instrumentalities of crime.a footnote added that the parties appear to agree that plaintiffs vehicles were not seized as arrest evidence pursuant to b but rather as instrumentalities of crime,and that i n any event,it is hard to imagine how an arrestee vehicle could serve as evidence in the ordinary dwi case.krimstock i,at.
on remand,the district court solicited the parties views regarding the structure of a class and framing of appropriate relief.at that point,the issue arose as to vehicles seized as evidence.the plaintiffs asked that the district court apply any relief procedures to all vehicle seizures and the city asked the court to exclude vehicles seized as evidence.the city argument was supported by the district attorneys of the five counties of new york city and the special narcotics prosecutor of the city of new york collectively the district attorneys 
the district court october,order the initial order applied to all vehicles seized on or after january,and provided 
at the time of seizure,the new york city police department must give written notice of the right to a hearing and a form to be used to request such a hearing 
the claimant of a vehicle either the owner or the person from whom the vehicle was seized has the right to a hearing within ten business days after receipt by the police department of a written demand for such a hearing 
the hearings would be conducted by the office of administrative trials and hearings oath and 
the police department has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that probable cause existed for the arrest of the vehicle operator,that it is likely the city would prevail in an action to forfeit the vehicle,and that it is necessary that the vehicle remain impounded in order to ensure its availability for a judgment of forfeiture.
additional provisions were crafted to meet objections that the inclusion of vehicles seized as evidence would impair administration of the criminal law.thus the initial order 
required that the police department give the relevant district attorney notice of oath hearings 
authorized oath judges to order continued retention of vehicles when necessary to ensure their availability as evidence 
allowed the district attorney to seek a retention order from an oath judge,a justice of the new york supreme court or a judge of the new york city criminal court and 
provided that no vehicle could be released without the driver waiving all claims and defenses in the criminal proceeding alleging a defect in the vehicle or other factual assertion based on the vehicle condition at the time of seizure.
the city and district attorneys appealed,arguing that the provisions for a retention order and a waiver of defenses were inadequate to protect their interests.while the appeal was pending,we denied defendants motion for a stay,so the initial order was in effect from january,until august.on august,we issued an opinion affirming the initial order as it relates to vehicles held for forfeiture but vacating and remanding the order as it relates to vehicles held as evidence.jones kelly,cir krimstock ii.without ruling on the merits of the remedial order,we remanded because the district court had relied on assumptions about the impact of hearings on prosecutions without testing the assumptions in an evidentiary hearing.
the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing on april,at which the district attorneys presented two witnesses.maureen mccormick,kings county executive assistant district attorney and chief of the kings county vehicular crimes bureau,described the procedures used to designate vehicles as potential evidence needed for a criminal proceeding,and the impact of the initial order and krimstock process on prosecutions.cheryl mccormick,director of legislative affairs at the new york county district attorney office,provided statistics on the numbers of cars released and retained by the district attorneys offices and the nature and type of cases in which district attorneys sought to retain vehicles as evidence plaintiffs presented no witnesses.
in an oral ruling on december,the district court found that the district attorneys concern about the inclusion of trial evidence in the initial order is legitimate that the designation of vehicles as trial evidence was conducted cautiously,not contumaciously and that the number of vehicles so designated is not insignificant and makes the order as heretofore constructed a potentially serious encumbrance to criminal prosecutions.accordingly,the district court modified its initial order to provide that a krimstock hearing would not go forward if the district attorney sends prior written notice to the oath judge that the vehicle in question is needed as potential evidence in a pending criminal matter.thus a district attorney could unilaterally decide that a vehicle is needed as evidence and forestall any hearing on the legitimacy of the arrest,seizure,and continued retention.the timing and hearing procedures in the initial order were otherwise unchanged.
plaintiffs appealed.
discussion 
in krimstock ii,we explained that the district court has broad discretion to ensure that the mandate of the prior decision of this court is carried out.at.because the retention of a vehicle implicates both fourth and fourteenth amendment rights,we analyze each in turn.krimstock i,at.
a.the fourth amendment 
no one disputes that plaintiffs vehicles have been seized within the meaning of the fourth amendment the issue is whether the seizure and continued impoundment is reasonable.krimstock i accepted that the reasonableness of the arrest and seizure is satisfied by a police officer determination that probable cause exists,but held that the determination at the outset and the eventual civil forfeiture proceeding do not justify the interim impoundment of the vehicles for the months or years of limbo between an arrest and a forfeiture proceeding,krimstock i,at,and that reasonableness required prompt review by a neutral factfinder,id.at.
krimstock i does not decide the present appeal it dealt solely with vehicles being held for forfeiture,and the court analysis depended in part on the of the city in taking vehicles for forfeiture.id.at.courts have,however,subjected a prosecutor assertion that evidence is necessary for a criminal investigation to scrutiny for reasonableness.for example,prior to the enactment of federal rule of criminal procedure e now g,federal courts invoked their general supervisory powers to order the return of property seized under a valid search warrant if the united states attorney could not establish the continuing need to hold it in re search warrant for premises known as encore house,united states premises known as taylor,cir see also in re smith,holding that,even though the prosecutor alleged that evidence was needed for a criminal proceeding,the district court had to evaluate this alleged need and to balance the government interests against the claimant interests.the courts in these cases ruled that the government may retain seized property for a reasonable time before instituting criminal proceedings,but that the need for continued retention should be evaluated for reasonableness weighing the competing interests in light of less drastic means such as a claimant stipulation not to challenge the validity of a copy or duplicate.
in krimstock ii,we instructed the district court on remand to decide a number of factual issues regarding the reasonableness of the retention of a vehicle for evidence 
is the city concern that criminal prosecutions will be encumbered by hearings that include arrest evidence legitimate or imagined is the city contumacious or cautious we can not tell.thus,we are compelled to remand this matter to the district court to establish a record of the actual number of vehicles involved in current prosecutions as trial evidence,and,perhaps,to compare relevant figures for past prosecutions over an appropriate period of time it may well be that the number of vehicles held as evidence has dwindled to so few that the order as currently constructed does not present an encumbrance to the prosecution of criminal cases,or that it is of such insignificance that evidence vehicles need not be included in the sweep of the order.
krimstock ii,at.
at the evidentiary hearing,witness cheryl mccormick posited some evidentiary uses of vehicles for example,to rebut a defense theory that erratic movement was caused by vehicle malfunction,or to show the trajectory of bullet holes and identified potential adverse consequences of requiring krimstock hearings for vehicles held as evidence,including i vehicles improperly released may become unavailable or inadmissible ii an oath determination may conflict with the retention order of a criminal court iii a trial judge might limit the prosecution use of the vehicle to what had been specified in the application for the retention order iv a retention order or oath hearing might be used by the defense to obtain discovery for the criminal proceeding and v a waiver of defenses may not protect the prosecution from defenses raised later or by new counsel.
however,neither witness could identify a single instance in which an adverse consequence transpired during the nine months in which the initial order was in force.and they both conceded that it was not difficult to obtain a retention order to prevent the release of a vehicle,that all of the retention orders sought were parte,without notice to the vehicle owner or an opportunity to contest the that the initial order had not yet encumbered any prosecutions.
that is unsurprising,because the feared adverse consequences are easily avoidable i retention orders are readily available to avert spoliation ii the krimstock hearing process can specify that the order of a criminal court prevails in a conflict as the initial order suggested iii trial courts can be instructed that a prosecutor use of vehicle evidence need not be limited to the purposes identified in the application for the retention order iv retention orders can be sought ex parte so criminal defendants can not abuse the hearing to obtain discovery and v enforceable waivers can be drafted and required.
the data presented by the witnesses confirm that no undue burden on criminal enforcement results from mandated review by a neutral vehicles were classified as arrest evidence when the initial order took effect on january,of them,twelve percent were later classified by prosecutors as trial evidence and just one percent were actually presented at a criminal proceeding.of the vehicles seized as arrest evidence during the eight months the initial order was in effect january to august,only six percent were later classified as trial evidence and none was presented at a criminal proceeding.the numbers are not large 
in holding that the fourth amendment does not require review of a district attorney decision to retain a vehicle as potential evidence,the district court relied in part on footnote of gerstein,which cautions 
criminal justice is already overburdened by the volume of cases and the complexities of our system.the processing of misdemeanors,in particular,and the early stages of prosecution generally are marked by delays that can seriously affect the quality of justice.a constitutional doctrine requiring adversary hearings for all persons detained pending trial could exacerbate the problem of pretrial delay.
at.this observation was made,however,in the context of the court holding that probable cause to detain can be ascertained without a adversarial hearing.by the same token,we conclude that no adversarial hearing is required to review a prosecutor unilateral determination that a vehicle is needed as potential evidence,and that district attorneys must be permitted to seek retention orders ex parte so that defendants can not use the hearings for discovery or to restrict the prosecution theories at trial.
fourteenth amendment 
courts use the balancing test articulated in mathews eldridge in deciding whether the demands of the due process clause are satisfied where the government seeks to maintain possession of property before a final judgment is rendered.krimstock i,at see mathews eldridge,d.the test weighs the private interest affected the risk of erroneous deprivation through the procedures used and the value of other safeguards and the government interest.krimstock i,at.in krimstock i,we applied the mathews eldridge test and concluded 
t he fourteenth amendment guarantee that deprivations of property be accomplished only with due process of law requires that plaintiffs be afforded a prompt,hearing before a neutral judicial or administrative officer to determine whether the city is likely to succeed on the merits of the forfeiture action and whether means short of retention of the vehicle can satisfy the city need to preserve it from destruction or sale during the pendency of proceedings.
at.specifically,we found that the private interest was strong given t he particular importance of motor vehicles as a mode of transportation and,for some,the means to earn a livelihood,id.at,and the inability to remedy that hardship even if the claimant prevails at the forfeiture proceeding although the second factor favors the government,it lacks weight because the risk of erroneous deprivation that is posed to innocent owners is a substantial one,id.at and the government interests in preserving the vehicle for future forfeiture proceedings and in preventing the vehicle from being used as an instrumentality in future crimes can be adequately protected by other means.id.at.
applicability of the test 
the district court noted the relevance of the mathews eldridge test to krimstock i,but held that the test is inapplicable to vehicles seized as evidence in criminal cases the test has never been applied to the seizure of property for use as evidence at trial,and i do not see the occasion of applying it here.rather,the district court held and defendants contend that seizure and retention of evidence in pending criminal cases are governed solely by the fourth amendment and the procedures established specifically to govern criminal matters.
however,the mathews eldridge te
