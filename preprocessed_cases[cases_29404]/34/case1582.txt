in this case,we must decide whether rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure requires that a defendant be present at a pretrial hearing where the district court determines whether the government violated its discovery obligations and,if so,how to remedy the violation.after counsel for defendant nicholas gonzales flores filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude evidence as a sanction for the government alleged discovery violation,the district court denied the motion at a hearing that gonzales flores did not attend and in which he did not otherwise participate.gonzales flores now contends he should have been present.because rule does not require a defendant to be present at a hearing on such a motion,however,we shall affirm his conviction and sentence.
throughout the fall of,a joint narcotics task force investigated a conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine in the western district of virginia.after identifying gonzales flores as the primary source of the drugs used in the conspiracy,members of the task force enlisted a confidential informant to conduct a controlled purchase of methamphetamine from him.they also executed a search warrant at gonzales flores home,where they found three grams of methamphetamine,digital scales,a handgun and magazine,and in cash.
based on this and other evidence,federal prosecutors charged gonzales flores,in february,with various counts involving the distribution of methamphetamine,see a,b a,b c,a,as well as with being an illegal alien and knowingly and intentionally possessing a firearm that had been shipped in interstate or foreign commerce,see g a.
on june,two days before gonzales flores jury trial on these charges was scheduled to begin,the government informed his counsel that it intended to call three expert witnesses.gonzales flores counsel filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude the witnesses proposed testimony on the ground that the government had failed to provide timely and adequate disclosure of the testimony,as required by rule a g of the federal rules of criminal procedure.the district court considered the motion the next day during a telephonic hearing in which an assistant united states attorney and gonzales flores counsel participated.although gonzales flores was unaware of the hearing until after it occurred,and thus neither attended the hearing nor participated in it by telephone,his counsel never objected to his absence.
defense counsel argued at the hearing that the district court should remedy the government alleged rule violation by excluding its proposed testimony.while insisting that any deficiencies in the disclosure of the witnesses testimony were excusable and that the testimony should therefore not be excluded,the government nevertheless expressed its willingness to agree to a continuance of the trial if gonzales flores counsel requested one.the district court declined to consider a continuance or to exclude the testimony.it found that the government belated disclosure had in no way prejudiced the preparation of the defense,since gonzales flores counsel could have reasonably anticipated that the government would introduce expert testimony on the topics about which the three expert witnesses proposed to testify and could have prepared accordingly.the judge did,however,indicate his willingness to reconsider the motion in limine should any prejudice or evidence of prejudice arise during the course of the trial.
at trial,the government called the three expert witnesses who were the subject of the motion in limine,as well as a number of other lay and expert witnesses.the first expert,a forensic analyst,testified that the substance recovered during the search of gonzales flores home was indeed methamphetamine.the second expert,a officer familiar with the drug trade,testified that the various items recovered during the search were more consistent with a methamphetamine distribution scheme than with personal use of the drug.and the third expert,a firearms analyst,testified that the weapon recovered during the search was operable and had traveled in interstate commerce.two additional expert witnesses corroborated the testimony of the forensic and firearms analysts.the government also called the confidential informant who had conducted the controlled purchase of methamphetamine from gonzales flores indicted and unindicted coconspirators who had purchased methamphetamine from,and used the drug with,gonzales flores and a number of officers involved in the investigation and arrest of gonzales flores.
the jury convicted gonzales flores of all the charged offenses except knowingly possessing methamphetamine with intent to distribute,convicting him instead of the offense of simple possession of methamphetamine.the district court sentenced gonzales flores to a month term of imprisonment and a term of supervised release.this appeal followed.
gonzales flores challenges his conviction and sentence on the ground that the district court violated rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure by ruling on his counsel motion in limine at a hearing from which he was absent.it bears emphasis that gonzales flores does not contest the underlying merits of the district court ruling at the hearing or,for that matter,any other ruling made by the district court during the entirety of the proceedings against him.the only issue before us is whether the district court erred by holding the hearing in gonzales flores absence.
because gonzales flores counsel never objected to his client absence from the hearing,we review gonzales flores claim under the familiar standard.see united states rolle,cir.according to that standard,a defendant who raises a forfeited claim on appeal must show that the district court committed an error that was plain and that affected the defendant substantial rights that is,that affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.united states olano,d.even if a defendant makes these showings,we may nevertheless decline to notice the error unless it seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at alteration in original quoting united states young,d.
in determining the scope of rule,we begin,as always,with the rule text.rule first identifies certain stages of a criminal prosecution at which a defendant must be present to wit,the initial appearance,the initial arraignment,and the plea every trial stage,including jury impanelment and the return of the verdict and sentencing.a.we have consistently interpreted this provision in accordance with the plain meaning of its constituent terms.for example,we have affirmed a defendant right to be present for jury impanelment,see united states camacho,cir,a stage we have held to include the voir dire of all prospective jurors,see rolle,at united states tipton,cir.we have also given the word present its ordinary meaning,upholding a defendant right to be physically present rather than just virtually present,through some electronic medium at his sentencing.see united states lawrence,cir.
there is a question whether the kind of pretrial hearing at issue in this case constitutes a trial stage within the meaning of rule a and is therefore at least in principle subject to rule a presence requirement.it is not clear whether the requirement applies to any pretrial proceedings other than those specifically enumerated in rule a namely,the initial appearance,the initial arraignment,and the plea given that rule a implies that no trial stage precedes jury impanelment.compare,united states burke,cir holding that rule a does not apply to pretrial hearings,with united states johnson,cir assuming that rule a applies to at least some pretrial proceedings.however,we can resolve the instant case on a more straightforward ground and therefore assume,without deciding,that a pretrial hearing on an alleged discovery violation constitutes a trial stage subject to rule a general presence requirement.
after identifying those stages at which a defendant must be present,rule proceeds to exempt specific kinds of proceedings from this requirement.see.b.as relevant here,rule b provides that a defendant need not be present at a proce
