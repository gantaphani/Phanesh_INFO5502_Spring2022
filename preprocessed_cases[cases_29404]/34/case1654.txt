appellee antoine jerome pettiford pleaded guilty to one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g,and received an enhanced sentence of months imprisonment,in part because he had five prior convictions which qualified him as a career criminal under the provisions of the armed career criminal act the acca,e.two of the five state court convictions were subsequently vacated,and pettiford brought a petition under for relief from the enhanced federal sentence.the district court granted pettiford petition,holding that as a result of the vacatur of the two state convictions,pettiford was entitled to relief.the district court then resentenced pettiford to a term of months imprisonment.for the reasons that follow,we reverse the district court order and remand with instructions to reinstate pettiford original sentence.
on november,a grand jury charged pettiford with one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g.the grand jury determined that on july,pettiford,having been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,did knowingly and unlawfully possess a smith wesson caliber pistol.
on april,the united states probation office issued a criminal history report the special report,in which it considered whether pettiford was subject to an enhanced criminal sentence under the acca.the acca provides that if a person who violates g has three previous convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense,or both,committed on occasions different from one another,such person shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than fifteen years.e.because pettiford had eight prior violent and serious drug felonies,the united states probation office concluded that he qualified for an enhanced sentence under the acca.
in a may,letter,pettiford contested the validity of three of the eight convictions as acca predicates,and the special report was revised to eliminate them on july.thereafter,on october,the government filed a of enhanced penalties,in which it explained that pettiford was subject to the enhanced penalty provisions of e,based in part on the following five state convictions a conviction for possession with intent to manufacture narcotics a conviction for breaking and entering a dwelling,battery,malicious destruction,and assault a conviction for assault a conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine and a conviction for conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute cocaine.
pursuant to a written plea agreement,signed on january,pettiford pleaded guilty to the charged offense.in that agreement,pettiford stipulated that he was an armed career criminal subject to an enhanced sentence under the provisions of e.he further stipulated that 
based on the of enhanced penalties filed by the united states on october,and as found by the probation office in its pretrial criminal history report,pettiford has three or more prior convictions which qualify him as a armed career criminal subject to an enhanced sentence under the provisions of e.
the district court confirmed that pettiford agreed that he was subject to an acca enhanced sentence in its plea colloquy,and again at sentencing thereafter,the district court sentenced pettiford to months imprisonment,and pettiford did not appeal this sentence.
before sentencing,pettiford filed in state court a coram nobis petition for relief,seeking to vacate his two convictions.on september,after pettiford had been sentenced in federal court,the circuit court for baltimore county vacated the two convictions,concluding that the sentences had been illegal because the court imposed an invalid period of incarceration as a condition of probation.almost a year later,on august,pettiford filed a petition under for relief from the enhanced federal sentence in the district court of maryland.
in his pro se petition,pettiford contended that he was entitled to relief because as a result of the vacatur of the two drug convictions,he no longer qualified as an armed career criminal.specifically,he argued that his drug conviction could not have been an acca predicate conviction because,he alleged,the judgment and transcript do not show whether he was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance or conspiracy to merely possess a controlled substance which was pettiford recollection.because his drug conspiracy conviction was merely a possession offense,pettiford maintained that he had only two remaining convictions that qualified for acca purposes,not three.
on january,the district court issued an order appointing a public defender to represent pettiford,and requiring the public defender to verify whether,in addition to the conviction,pettiford wished to challenge any of the other qualifying convictions.in response to this order,on june,the public defender filed a memorandum of law explaining that pettiford challenged the use of all his predicate convictions.the government filed a response to this memorandum on july,arguing,inter alia,that pettiford was procedurally barred from challenging the use of the three predicate convictions because these challenges were not raised at trial or on direct appeal,and the defendant neither offer ed cause excusing this failure nor c ould he show prejudice from not having raised the arguments.as a result,in a reply,the public defender clarified that for purposes,only the two vacated convictions should be considered,and that pettiford challenges to the three remaining predicates were not a part of his habeas petition but instead they were relevant considerations at a resentencing following the grant of his habeas petition.in other words,pettiford asked the district court to bifurcate the proceedings.
on november,the district court granted pettiford petition and ordered that he be resentenced.the district court granted pettiford habeas relief because two of his qualifying convictions had been vacated after his initial sentence.the district court recognized that even with the two drug convictions vacated,pettiford record retain ed three convictions that might enhance his sentence under e,but nevertheless granted pettiford a resentencing based on an examination of pettiford remaining acca qualifying convictions akin to what would occur at a proceeding.in doing so,the district court decided that pettiford conviction for maryland assault in was not a violent felony under the acca.relying on shepard united states,and united states simms,cir,the district court explained that when analyzing whether a conviction is a violent felony under the acca,courts can not consider documents that are not incorporated into the charging document.because the only basis for concluding that pettiford assault might be a violent felony is found in a statement of probable cause,which was not incorporated into the charging document,the district court concluded that the assault conviction was not a violent felony,and thus could not be counted.disregarding both the assault conviction and the two sentences vacated by the maryland state courts,the district court found that pettiford has two remaining acca qualifying convictions and no longer qualifies for an enhanced sentence under the acca.
on december,the government filed a motion for reconsideration,which the district court denied on january.pettiford was subsequently resentenced on january,to months in prison.this appeal followed.
on appeal,the government contends that the district court erred in granting pettiford petition,because even after the vacatur of pettiford two drug convictions,pettiford still had three qualifying predicate convictions.pettiford responds that a defendant need only show that some of his underlying predicate convictions were vacated to be entitled to relief.however,in the event we find otherwise,he argues that his challenges to the other predicate convictions should be considered as part of his habeas claim,and that if he failed to challenge these convictions,that failure should be excused because he can show cause and prejudice for the procedural default.alternatively,he maintains he is actually innocent of the enhancement,and thus,the district court did not commit error in granting the petition.appellee br.at.we consider each argument in turn.in so doing,we review legal issues de novo and factual findings under a clear error standard.united states roane,cir.
we first consider the government argument that the district court erred in granting pettiford petition on the basis of pettiford two vacated convictions 
in custis united states,the supreme court observed that if a defendant is successful in attacking his state sentences,he may then apply for reopening of any federal sentence enhanced by the state sentences.later,in daniels united states,the court again noted that if a challenge to an underlying conviction is successful in state court,the defendant may then apply for reopening of his federal sentence,but added that if the prior conviction is no longer open to direct or collateral attack in its own right,then the federal prisoner can do nothing more about his sentence enhancement.finally,in johnson united states,the court reiterated the holdings of custis and daniels,adding,inter alia,that from the date the district court enters judgment in the federal case,the defendant is obliged to act diligently to obtain the order vacating the predicate conviction.
in accordance with this line of cases,this court,when reviewing sentences imposed under the career offender guideline,has concluded that sentence enhancements based on previous convictions should be reconsidered if those convictions are later vacated.see united states gadsen,cir noting that a defendant may apply for a reopening of his federal sentence once he has successfully challenged the underlying conviction specifically,this court has held that if a defendant succeeds in a future collateral proceeding in overturning his state conviction,federal law enables him then to seek review of any federal sentence that was enhanced due to his state conviction.united states bacon,cir.given this language,the district court determined that pettiford was entitled to relief because he had successfully challenged in state court two state sentences that had been used to enhance his federal sentence.
however,as noted by the government,even without the two vacated state convictions,pettiford record retains three convictions that support enhancing his sentence under e.thus,the issue before us is whether a petitioner is entitled to relief after successfully attacking some of his predicate sentences if those vacated convictions are not necessary for the armed career criminal designation.neither we nor the supreme court have addressed this specific issue and although,since custis,several other circuits have held or indicated that a defendant may be able to receive relief if he has successfully challenged in state court a state conviction previously used in enhancing the federal sentence,in each of these cases,the state sentences at issue,if vacated,would have lowered the defendant conviction count below the minimum number necessary to enhance the sentence.see,united states doe,cir united states lavalle,cir united states walker,cir united states pettiford,cir young vaughn,cir united states cox,cir united states rogers,f d,cir united states nichols,cir.
to determine whether pettiford should have been awarded habeas relief and had his sentence reopened on the ground that two of the five convictions used to support his sentence were later vacated,we must look to the language of.section provides that habeas relief should be awarded where 
the court finds that the judgment was rendered without jurisdiction,or that the sentence imposed was not authorized by law or otherwise open to collateral attack,or that there has been such a denial or infringement of the constitutional rights of the prisoner as to render the judgment vulnerable to collateral attack.
b.once the petitioner has shown this,the court shall vacate and set the judgment aside and shall discharge the prisoner or resentence him or grant a new trial or correct the sentence as may appear appropriate.id.thus,a district court resolution of a prisoner petition proceeds in two steps.see united states hadden,cir.first,the district court must determine whether the prisoner has met his burden of showing that his sentence is unlawful on one of the specified grounds.id.second,if the prisoner sentence is found unlawful on one of those grounds,the district court should grant the prisoner an appropriate remedy,which includes discharge,resentencing,or a new trial.id.if the prisoner fails to show that his sentence is unlawful on one of the specified grounds under the threshold inquiry,however,the court must deny the petition.id.
pettiford can not meet the threshold inquiry,in that he has failed to establish any of the specified grounds for rendering the sentence unlawful.first,he cites no precedent,nor do we find any,suggesting that,in this situation,pettiford was sentenced in violation of the constitution.second,he points to nothing in the record,nor are we able to find anything,to suggest that the district court did not have jurisdiction.third,the sentence was authorized by law because the vacatur of the two convictions did not render pettiford acca sentence invalid as a threshold matter.section e establishes a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years without parole for any person convicted of a violation of g who has three or more previous convictions for a violent felony or serious drug offense.e.after the vacatur of the two convictions,three predicate convictions remained in pettiford record.thus,the statutory preconditions for sentence enhancement were still present,and pettiford sentence was still subject to enhancement pursuant to the acca.finally,we do not believe that the sentence is otherwise open to collateral attack.a.the supreme court has interpreted the phrase otherwise subject to collateral attack as involving a claim of error of fact or law of the fundamental character that renders the entire proceeding irregular and invalid.united states addonizio,see also united states eakman,cir holding that a sentence is subject to collateral attack if the district court received misinformation of a constitutional magnitude and the district judge relied at least in part on that misinformation quoting united states.spiropoulos,cir.there is no evidence that pettiford sentencing was constitutionally defective or flawed in a fundamental way.indeed,in his habeas petition,pettiford made no such claim.
instead of finding that pettiford sentence was unlawful on one of the specified grounds,the district court granted pettiford relief on the assumption that vacatur of any predicate sentence automatically entitles a petitioner to habeas relief without further inquiry.see t his court finds that pettiford subsequently vacated convictions entitle him to a.this was error.vacatur alone does not entitle a petitioner to habeas relief.rather,as we stated in bacon,vacatur entitles a petitioner to seek review.at.in seeking review,however,the petitioner must still meet his burden of showing that his sentence is unlawful on one of the specified grounds,because only after determining that a sentence is unlawful can the district court vacate and set aside the sentence.see hadden,at.here,not only did pettiford fail to show that his sentence was rendered unlawful by the vacatur of his two convictions,but also the district court failed to make this inquiry before finding that pettiford was entitled to relief.
admittedly,after granting relief,the district court did determine that pettiford sentence was unlawful.after concluding that pettiford subsequently vacated convictions entitle d him to habeas relief,the district court considered pettiford remaining acca qualifying convictions akin to what would occur at a proceeding,and determined that without his assault conviction,pettiford sentence exceeded the maximum sentence allowed by law because the sentence could no longer be enhanced under the acca in so doing,however,the district court inverted the process.pursuant to hadden,the district court had to determine whether pettiford sentence had been rendered unlawful on one of the specified grounds by the vacatur of his two convictions before vacating and setting aside the sentence.see at.by doing otherwise,the district court bypassed the threshold inquiry of whether pettiford petition,on its face,sufficiently established that pettiford sentence was rendered without jurisdiction,imposed in violation of the constitution or the laws of the united states,or that it was otherwise subject to collateral attack.
the flaw in the district court approach is made manifest by the fact that,by virtue of the vacated convictions,pettiford argued on collateral review the applicability of case law that would not be available to others similarly situated.below,pettiford argued that his assault conviction could not be counted as an acca predicate because it was not a violent felony.his argument principally relied on shepard,at,in which the supreme court held that to determine whether a conviction constitutes a violent felony,a court may not go beyond conclusive records made or used in adjudicating guilt and look to documents submitted to lower courts even prior to charges,and on simms,at,in which we held that a court may not consider documents that are not expressly incorporated into the charging document.relying on these cases,pettiford argued that his assault could not be classified as a violent felony because the only basis for such a conclusion is found in a statement of probable cause which was not incorporated into the charging document.the district court agreed with pettiford,citing shephard and simms for support.neither shepard nor simms,however,were available to pettiford at the time of the original sentencing,nor have they been found to be retroactively applicable.see united states davis,app x cir see also united states christensen,cir corey united states,app x cir united states armstrong,app x,cir.and,as we have noted,the district court reached this inquiry only because it bypassed the threshold determination of whether pettiford petition,on its face,sufficiently established that pettiford sentence was unlawful on one of the specified grounds 
in sum,because the district court failed to hold pettiford to his burden of showing that the vacated sentences rendered his federal sentence unlawful on one of the specified burden the record demonstrates he could not agree with the government that the district court erred in granting pettiford relief 
although pettiford characterized his challenges to the remaining three convictions as resentencing issues in the district court,on appeal,he argues that we should consider his challenges to the and predicate convictions as part of his habeas petition.if we do so,he asserts that we should find him entitled to relief.because pettiford never challenged his three remaining predicate convictions at sentencing or on direct appeal,he would typically be barred from raising the se claim s on collateral review.oregon,see also united states emanuel,cir issues are deemed waived in a motion if they were not raised on direct appeal.the supreme court has recognized an equitable exception to the bar,however,when a habeas applicant can demonstrate cause and prejudice,or actual innocence.see dretke haley,see also mikalajunas,at.we thus consider whether pettiford has shown cause and prejudice,or actual innocence,below.
in order to collaterally attack a conviction or sentence based upon errors that could have been but were not pursued on direct appeal,the movant must show cause and actual prejudice resulting from the errors of which he complains mikalajunas,at.the existence of cause for a procedural default must turn on something external to the defense,such as the novelty of the claim or a denial of effective assistance of counsel.id.at.
pettiford maintains that cause existed to excuse his default because he had no legal basis to challenge the predicate convictions at the original sentencing he explains that at the initial sentencing,his two drug convictions had not yet been vacated,and in the absence of these reversals,he still had three prior serious drug two drug convictions and the drug conspiracy his record to qualify him as an armed career criminal independent from the assault conviction and the breaking and entering conviction.as a result,he argues,any challenge to his acca status,or the underlying sentences,at his original sentencing would have been futile.
as a preliminary matter,the government asserts,and our review of the record reveals,that pettiford never argued cause and prejudice below.instead,pettiford maintained that his challenges to the and convictions were resentencing issues,not habeas issues,and thus he was able to forego showing cause and prejudice.in the briefs below,pettiford counsel explained,t he challenges to pettiford other prior convictions are not part of his habeas petition pettiford has not sought to amend his habeas petition to include these challenges.similarly,counsel maintained,t he criminal history challenges to the three remaining predicates are issues,not habeas claims.it is settled in this circuit that failure to present an argument to the district court constitutes waiver before this court.united states evans,cir.further,the supreme court recently held that an argument not presented to the federal district court in a habeas petition is forfeited and can not be advanced at the merits stage,on appeal.mcdaniel brown,recognizing that his claim can not prevail,respondent tries to rewrite his federal habeas petition.his attempt comes too late,however,and he can not now start over.
nonetheless,assuming arguendo that pettiford current cause theory is properly before us,we are unable to find any external impediments resulting in counsel failure to challenge the and convictions at sentencing,or on direct appeal.on the contrary,the record shows that trial counsel did challenge three of the eight predicate convictions listed on the special report.a petitioner can not establish cause when the facts underlying the claim were in existence and were available upon a reasonably diligent search,rose lee,cir,and here,the facts underlying pettiford challenges to the and convictions were available at pettiford sentencing.
further,pettiford alleged basis for demonstrating cause has no recognition in the law see,bousley united states,finding that futility can not constitute cause if it means simply that a claim was unacceptable to that particular court at that particular time internal quotations and citation omitted richardson turner,cir holding the same.if we were to accept pettiford cause exists to excuse procedural default where the defendant believes that challenging a predicate sentence would be there would be no reason for a defendant to challenge his predicate convictions during sentencing,unless he could attack a sufficient number of sentences to bring his predicate count below the number necessary for the enhancement.all other challenges would be handled by the courts on collateral attack,thereby rendering meaningless our longstanding commitment to the finality of judgments.see,sawyer whitley,emphasizing finality over the correction of errors mccleskey zant,same wainwright sykes,same.we can not agree to this.habeas review extracts significant costs from judicial,defense,and prosecutorial resources.schneckloth bustamonte,powell,concurring.more importantly,as the supreme court said in mccleskey,we do not want habeas corpus review to give litigants incentives to withhold claims for manipulative purposes and to establish disincentives to present claims when evidence is fresh.at see also reed ross,wainwright,at.instead,if an attack on a predicate sentence can be raised at sentencing,that attack should be handled by the sentencing judge,irrespective of whether a successful challenge would render a sentencing enhancement obsolete.
thus,because we find that pettiford has failed to demonstrate cause to excuse his failure to challenge the and predicate sentences at sentencing or on direct appeal,we can not excuse his procedural default.
with pettiford having failed to demonstrate cause and prejudice to excuse his procedural default,the question remains whether he can show actual innocence.
