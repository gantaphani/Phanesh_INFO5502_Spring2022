opinion of the court 
kareem brown appeals the denial by the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania of his motion to suppress evidence.brown argues that he was improperly stopped and searched,and thus the incriminating evidence uncovered by that search was not properly admitted at his trial.we agree,and accordingly reverse the district court denial of brown motion to suppress and vacate his conviction 
factual background 
our facts are taken from the suppression hearing held by the district court.on the evening of june,jelena radenkovic and lucia zapatero were walking in the block of locust street in philadelphia.they were approached by two black male teenagers who attempted to grab radenkovic purse.she refused to let go,and one of the males pointed a gun at her.she turned and walked away from him.the males then abandoned the robbery attempt and ran south on street.
moments after the attackers fled,radenkovic called to report the robbery to the police.in the course of that call,radenkovic described the robbery suspects as males between and years of age,one and the other,wearing dark,hooded sweatshirts and running south on street.immediately after calling,radenkovic called her friend,william firth,who was waiting to meet her at a nearby restaurant.radenkovic told firth about the attempted robbery and described the suspects,providing just the clothing,the general description.i did go into too many details,but in enough detail.
minutes later,a police officer,who was not identified in the record,arrived and took a second description from radenkovic.that officer then relayed the description over the police radio.the parties contest the content of the broadcast.the government states the broadcast described the two suspects as black males in their teens or with dark clothing.brown asserts the printout of the radio call reads black male,black hoody,last seen on locust,attempted to grab female purse.location westbound on locust both.the description reads,gray hoody,black pants number two,thin,navy blue hoody.the district court findings of fact state that the broadcast consisted of the description radenkovic had provided in her call to the operator.the court found that,while the officer was speaking over the radio and describing one of the suspects as years old and the other as three or four years older,lucia zapatero commented that she thought the suspects were older,in their early twenties.
within minutes of the police broadcast,radenkovic,who was sitting in the police car at this point,received a call from firth,who stated he had just seen two men fitting the descriptions of the robbery suspects at and lombard streets a location three blocks south of locust street the court also found that a second officer,kathleen pacheco,who arrived on the scene at that time,heard radenkovic exclaim that the guys who had robbed her were at and lombard streets.
based on radenkovic comments,officer pacheco drove to and lombard streets and en route issued a radio call with the location information provided by radenkovic.upon arriving,pacheco observed two black males,kareem brown and jerome smith,who appeared to be coming out of a store with cups of coffee.pacheco issued another radio call,stating that she had in her sight the two men that were described in the broadcast.the following exchange took place between officer pacheco and the court about her statement that the men matched the description of the suspects 
the court in what way did they match the description 
officer pacheco from the radio 
the court what way 
officer pacheco that they were two black males with dark clothing.
the court that it 
officer pacheco that what we received.
on the date of the attempted robbery,brown,the appellant in this case,was years old,tall,and had a full beard.smith was years old,tall,and also had a full beard.
meanwhile,a third officer,officer marano santiago,had received the call with the location tip from officer pacheco and arrived at and lombard streets at approximately the same time.santiago observed smith and brown as they were walking across the street and hailing a taxi.he testified that the men were walking normally and were not out of breath.he also stated it was not unusual to see two black males at that location,as there is a predominantly black neighborhood less than two blocks away.
officer santiago testified as well that smith and brown fit the description he received over the radio,in that they were black males of the described height in dark clothing.santiago agreed at the suppression hearing that two black males wearing dark clothing is a very general description.in fact,at some point before leaving his vehicle,santiago had called for a more specific description of the suspects,but did not receive any additional information santiago summed up by stating that t hey were the only two black males at that location.that was the only reason why those two males were stopped by me and they were investigated by me.indeed,he testified that he would have stopped them even if they were both five feet tall wearing white clothes.
officer santiago then approached smith and brown,told the taxicab to keep moving,and informed them that they looked like two persons who had attempted to commit a robbery and that he wanted to talk to them.
i told them basically what happened at and locust.i told them that i need to make an investigation on both males.it was a nice,brief conversation we had.i let them know that we were having the complainant,the victim of the robbery,coming over to and lombard to see if they were the doers.if they were,they were free to go.at that point,as we were waiting,i demanded both males for my safety and their safety that i was going to pat them down.
officer santiago testified that he wanted to pat them down because 
there was a robbery committed at and locust for my safety at that point,i felt that i should pat them down.like i said,they were not at that were not apprehended at any point.they complied with my demands,so i felt it was my right for me to pat them down.
santiago also stated,in response to questioning by the court,that he had decided to pat down the defendants regardless whether they ran away or complied.
the district court found that,as santiago attempted to frisk him,brown struggled and appeared to try to escape while he was facing the police car,brown attempted to place his hand in his pocket,causing santiago to restrain him santiago placed brown in handcuffs and then recovered a gun from brown front belt area.the moment at which brown struggled and appeared to try to escape was described in more detail by officer pacheco 
officer santiago said to brown,c ome on,i have to pat you down.we just have a job.you match the description.santiago takes him over to the car,stands up against the car,turned him around,started to pat him,and he started to kind of like break away.with that,santiago put him over the head of the car.you could see that he was fidgeting.i jumped on santiago back to keep brown from getting his hands loose before we could cuff him 
officer pacheco also stated that brown placed his hands on the police car before his breakaway attempt.this version of events was supported by a report called a report summarizing the incident based on information the arresting officers provided to detectives shortly after the arrest.the report states that b oth males had their hands placed on the hood of the police vehicle.brown started to struggle while handcuffs were being placed on his hands.
a different version of the frisk was provided by officer santiago,who testified that as soon as i requested both of them to put their hands on the vehicle,they made the intent to put their hands on the vehicle,they made the intent to put their hands on top of the car,but they never did.that when smith fled.after smith ran,brown had the intent also to flee,but being that he was so close to me,i held him.we went into a little struggle.
ultimately,police officers brought radenkovic to the two locations where brown and smith were being held.radenkovic informed the police that these were not the males who attempted to rob her brown and smith had beards and the robbers did not,and smith and brown were much older than the robbers.
brown moved to suppress the firearm found on him,claiming there was not reasonable suspicion for the stop.after a evidentiary hearing,the district court denied the motion.
the case then went to a jury trial.brown was found guilty of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm under g and e.his sentence included months imprisonment and five years supervised release.he appeals 
ii.discussion 
the fourth amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures const.amend.iv.generally,for a seizure to be reasonable under the fourth amendment,it must be effectuated with a warrant based on probable cause.united states robertson,cir.but,under the exception to the warrant requirement established in terry ohio,d,an officer may,consistent with the fourth amendment,conduct a brief,investigatory stop when the officer has a reasonable,articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.illinois wardlow,d.any evidence obtained pursuant to an investigatory stop also known as a terry stop or a stop and frisk that does not meet this exception must be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree.see wong sun united states,d united states coggins,cir 
before us is whether officer santiago had reasonable suspicion to stop and frisk brown.if not,the firearm found on him must be suppressed as the fruit of an unlawful seizure.we review the district court denial of a motion to suppress for clear error as to the underlying factual findings and we exercise plenary review over questions of law.united states coward,cir.
a.when was brown seized 
we begin by determining when the seizure of brown occurred,as that is the moment the fourth amendment becomes relevant.terry,at.see johnson campbell,cir.only then can we evaluate the presence or absence of reasonable suspicion,as we must consider only the facts available to the officer at the moment of the seizure.terry,at.see also florida,d johnson,at.
the government urges us to hold that brown was not seized until after the officers succeeded in handcuffing him,which was after his attempted breakaway and the finding of the gun.brown contends that he was seized earlier in the encounter,at the moment he submitted to officer santiago show of authority by turning and placing his hands on the police vehicle.the benefit to the parties of having their characterization of the seizure adopted is the seizure occurred after brown apparent escape attempt,we must include that attempt in our analysis of reasonable suspicion.in contrast,if the seizure occurred before the attempted escape,it plays no role in the reasonable suspicion analysis.see,johnson,at.flight from a lawful frisk or arrest can contribute to a finding of reasonable suspicion thus,the timing of the seizure could tip the finding in favor of one party or the other.see,wardlow,at.h eadlong flight is suggestive of wrongdoing united states brown,cir flight combined with other factors may support a warrantless stop and frisk.
a seizure occurs when there is either a a laying on of hands or application of physical force to restrain movement,even when it is ultimately unsuccessful,or b submission to a show of authority.california hodari,d.put another way,when a seizure is effected by even the slightest application of physical force,it is immaterial whether the suspect yields to that force.id.at.in contrast,if a suspect in the absence of physical force does not submit to an officer show of authority,there is no seizure and no fourth amendment claim.id.at.t he test for existence of a show of authority is an objective one not whether the citizen perceived that he was being ordered to restrict his movement,but whether the officer words and actions would have conveyed that to a reasonable person.id.at.
here there was a clear show of authority when santiago told brown and smith that a robbery victim was being brought over to identify them as possible suspects and,if they were not identified,they would be free to implying that they were not free to leave.santiago also said he demanded that the men submit to a.this instruction would have conveyed to a reasonable person that he was being ordered to restrict his movement.see also united states mendenhall,d suggesting that a reasonable person would not feel free to leave when he or she is confronted with the threatening presence of several officers,the display of a weapon by an officer,some physical touching of the person of the citizen,or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer request might be compelled johnson,at interaction became a stop when officer persisted in asking defendant to roll down his car window after defendant had refused officer first request.
brown clearly submitted to this show of authority.as officer pacheco testified,and the report confirms,brown turned to face the police car and placed his hands on the vehicle in response to santiago demand.this conclusion is not meaningfully contradicted by santiago testimony that brown had begun to move his hands to the vehicle,but did not complete the action.moreover,brown initial submission is not undercut by any subsequent attempt to flee.the facts before us are similar to those of united states coggins,where a police officer began questioning the defendant and his companions,the defendant stood up and asked to go to the bathroom,the officer told him to wait,the defendant sat back down,then again stood and ran off.at.we held that the defendant initially yielded to the officer authority by sitting back down,and there was thus a seizure e ven though he fled soon thereafter.id.at.unlike the defendant in united states valentine,brown demonstrated more than momentary compliance with the arresting officers demands,cir even if valentine paused for a few moments and gave his name,he did not submit in any realistic sense to the officers show of authority.brown first yielded to santiago authority by turning to face the police car and placing or moving to place his hands on the vehicle.it was only after this initial submission that he began to struggle.
was the seizure of brown based on reasonable suspicion 
having determined when the seizure of brown occurred,was it based on reasonable,articulable suspicion that brown and his companion might be the robbery suspects terry,at.determining reasonableness after establishing moment of seizure.reasonable suspicion is an elusive concept,but it unequivocally demands that the detaining officers must have a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.united states cortez,d.an officer objective basis for suspicion must be particularized because the demand for specificity in the information upon which police action is predicated is the central teaching of this court fourth amendment jurisprudence.terry,at.at the same time,we must allow officers to draw on their own experience and specialized training to make inferences from and deductions about the cumulative information available to them that might well elude an untrained person.united states arvizu,d internal quotation marks omitted see also united states nelson,cir.the ultimate question is whether a reasonable,trained officer standing in santiago shoes could articulate specific reasons justifying brown detention.johnson,at.
in evaluating whether there was an objective basis for reasonable suspicion,we consider the totality of the whole picture.cortez,at.robertson,at.as our court has observed,
t he supreme court has repeatedly recognized that a reasonable suspicion may be the result of any combination of one or several factors specialized knowledge and investigative inferences united states cortez,personal observation of suspicious behavior terry ohio,information from sources that have proven to be reliable,and information from sources unknown to the by the accuracy and intimacy of the information provided to be reliable at least as to the details contained within that tip alabama white.
the factors that informed officer santiago decision to stop and frisk brown were a the police radio broadcast of a description of the robbery suspects and the extent to which brown and smith matched that description,b the radio call from officer pacheco conveying the location tip provided by firth,and c santiago personal observation of brown and smith at and lombard streets.although santiago conceded that brown and smith being the only two black males at that location was the only reason why those two males were stopped by me and they were investigated by me,we must consider only whether a reasonable,trained officer standing in santiago shoes could articulate specific reasons justifying the investigative stop of brown.johnson,at.thus,even if the initial radio broadcast and the conduct of brown and smith did not factor into santiago reasonable suspicion analysis,they must be included in ours.although we examine each of the three factors in turn,our ultimate determination of reasonable suspicion requires us to consider these items not in isolation from each other,but as noted as part of the totality of the circumstances.arvizu,at.
the radio broadcast 
the first factor contributing to the totality of the circumstances was the initial radio broadcast describing the attempted robbery suspects and the extent to which brown and smith matched that description.the fact that every detail provided in a description matched the details observed by the officers can contribute to a finding of reasonable suspicion.nelson,at.the broadcast description in this case,however,fails to satisfy the fourth amendment demand for specificity.terry,at.
the broadcast,as described in the district court findings of fact,identified the suspects as males between and years of age,wearing dark,hooded sweatshirts and running south on street,where one male was and the other was in the more stringent context of probable cause,we have concluded that,armed with information that two black males driving a black sports car were believed to have committed three robberies in the area some relatively short time earlier,the officer could not justifiably arrest any man who happened to drive by in any type of black sports car.united states kithcart,cir though offering no opinion on whether there was sufficient reasonable suspicion for a terry stop.similarly,even the less stringent standard of reasonable suspicion can not be met by a description that paints with this broad of a brush.
by way of contrast,consider the facts of united states harple,cir,where reasonable suspicion was supported,along with other factors,when the suspects car substantially matched the description,including the color of the car,the presence of a third brake light in the rear window,and five or more young,white,male passengers.see also nelson,at finding support for reasonable suspicion when there was an exact match of the unique,plates,occupants and direction of travel.
to make matters worse,the match of brown and smith to even this most general of descriptions was hardly close.among other things,the robbery suspects were described as between and years of age,but on the date of the stop brown was years old and smith was years old.moreover,both brown and smith had full beards and the description of the suspects included no mention of any facial hair.indeed,about the only thing brown and smith had in common with the suspects was that they were black.what we have is a description that,while general,is wildly wide of target.by no logic does it,by itself,support reasonable suspicion.
the location tip 
when,as here,one officer santiago conducts a stop and frisk based on information provided by another officer pacheco,a finding of reasonable suspicion to justify the stop require s the presentation of evidence by the government that the officer who issued the radio bulletin pacheco had reasonable suspicion,not simply that it was reasonable for the arresting officer santiago to have relied on the bulletin.coward,at see also united states hensley,d when the police make a terry stop in objective reliance on a flyer or radio bulletin,we hold that the evidence uncovered in the course of the stop is admissible if the police who issued the flyer or radio bulletin possessed a reasonable suspicion justifying a stop.emphasis in original nelson,at when officers stop was based on match of defendants with broadcast information,the reasonableness of the stop depends on the reliability of the tip itself rogers powell,cir the legality of a seizure based solely on statements issued by fellow officers depends on whether the officers who issued the statements possessed the requisite basis to seize the suspect.emphasis in original.our focus is thus the first pacheco.would the location tip give a reasonable,trained officer standing in her shoes reasonable suspicion to order the stop johnson,at.
pacheco information regarding the location of the suspects was based on comments by the victim,radenkovic,relaying observations by radenkovic friend,william firth.it is well settled that reasonable suspicion can be based on information gathered from another person.robertson,at see also johnson,at noting that officers may rely on a trustworthy second hand report,if that report includes facts that give rise to particularized suspicion.both our court and the supreme court have considered the reliability of tips from citizens in several terry stop cases,but almost always in the context of anonymous informants.in the typical case,an unidentified person calls the police and reports a man with a gun standing at a particular location wearing specified clothing.see,at.anonymous caller reported that a young black male wearing a plaid shirt and standing at a particular bus stop was carrying a gun.
the record before us does not fit neatly into the typical anonymous tip framework,as firth made no effort to hide his identity and was known to radenkovic.despite this distinction,we may still borrow underlying principles from the anonymous tip context to evaluate the reliability of firth tip.robertson,at distinguishing anonymous informant case from hot pursuit case,aided by a bystander informative tip,but still applying standards of reliability from anonymous tip cases.
in the context of anonymous tips,the supreme court has made clear that an informant veracity,reliability,and basis of knowledge are highly relevant in determining the value of his report.alabama white,d quoting illinois gates,d.when considering fully all the facts about a tip,the honesty of the caller,the reliability of his information and the basis of his knowledge are closely intertwined issues that may usefully illuminate the commonsense,practical question whether there is reasonable suspicion to support a terry stop.gates,at.see also white,at.holding gates analysis applicable to reasonable suspicion context valentine,at supreme court uses a flexible standard that assesses the relative value and reliability of an informant tip in light of the totality of the circumstances.
the following specific aspects of tips indicate reliability 
the tip information was relayed from the informant to the officer in a interaction such that the officer had an opportunity to appraise the witness credibility through observation.nelson,at see also valentine,at.
the person providing the tip can be held responsible if her allegations turn out to be fabricated.valentine,at internal quotations and citation omitted see also,at.adams williams,d nelson,at.
the content of the tip is not information that would be available to any observer.nelson,at citing white,at,d.a not truly anonymous tip is accorded greater weight when the specific details of language,type of activity and location matched a pattern of criminal activity known to the police,but not to the general public,and the tip could not have been generated by the general public,nor based solely on observation.id.at,see also united states roberson,cir affording tip less weight when information could have been gained by caller looking out of his window at the time of his call.
the person providing the information has recently witnessed the alleged criminal activity.see gates,at.informant statement that the event was witnessed entitles tip to greater weight adams,at.citing situat
