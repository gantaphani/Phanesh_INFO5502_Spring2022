following a guilty plea,defendant troy harris was convicted in in the united states district court for the southern district of new york robert patterson,judge of conspiracy to traffic in narcotics,see b a,for which crime he was sentenced to months imprisonment and five years supervised release.see united states harris,cr rpp,ecf harris now appeals from a judgment of the same court loretta preska,chief judge entered on may,revoking his supervised release and imposing an additional prison term of months based on a finding that he had engaged in new criminal conduct while on federal supervision,specifically,assault,as proscribed by new york penal law,and narcotics distribution,in violation of new york penal law.harris challenges both grounds for revocation.
as to narcotics trafficking,harris does not dispute the alleged conduct.instead,for the first time on appeal,he challenges the district court statutory authority to revoke supervision based on conduct that had already prompted it to modify the terms of his supervision.harris argues that e confers modification and revocation authority in the disjunctive,so that once a court exercises one here,modification in response to particular conduct,it can not exercise the other revocation with respect to that same conduct.
as to assault,harris argues that the district court impermissibly considered victim hearsay in making its preponderance finding that he engaged in such new criminal conduct while on federal supervision.
because we conclude that both arguments fail on the merits,we affirm the challenged revocation judgment.
background 
harris began serving the five year supervision component of his federal sentence on march.that supervision was subject to certain conditions,three of which are relevant here that harris not commit another federal,state,or local crime truthfully answer all probation inquiries and notify his probation officer ten days prior to any change in residence.
initial noncompliance report assault 
on august,three years into harris supervision term,the united states probation department for the southern district of new york probation filed a report notifying judge patterson that harris had been arrested by the new york city police department nypd based on a recent complaint filed by a woman who stated that harris had struck her in the face with a closed fist after she confronted him for smacking her on her buttocks during an event they were attending.app x probation reported that the offense assault,see penal law represented a class a misdemeanor and a grade c violation of supervised release.nevertheless,because the state case had been dismissed when the complainant declined to press criminal charges,probation recommended that no action be taken with respect to harris federal supervision.the district court accepted the recommendation the following day,august.
second noncompliance report narcotics trafficking 
less than three weeks later,on september,probation filed a second noncompliance report notifying judge patterson of harris september,nypd arrest,this time for third degree criminal sale of a controlled substance,see penal law,based on police observations of harris exchanging crack cocaine for money.probation recommended,and harris agreed to,a modification of supervision to add a search condition,which the district court ordered on september.
violation warrant and revocation petition 
two months later,on november,probation determined that harris was in violation of the supervision condition requiring that he provide advance notice of any change in residence.on that day,probation conducted an unannounced visit to harris reported residence,the apartment of his maternal aunt.not only was harris not present,but a search also revealed that he had little to no belongings in the apartment.app x.when probation reached harris by phone,he stated that he was at his uncle apartment.after some initial hesitation,he provided the building address but refused to identify the apartment number.
judge patterson was advised of these facts the same day,and promptly issued an arrest warrant based on four alleged violations of supervised release failure truthfully to answer probation inquiries,failure to notify probation of a change in residence,selling narcotics in violation of state law,and committing third degree assault in violation of state law.the united states marshal executed the warrant and produced harris in court later that day.on consent,harris was released pending a hearing on the violation charges,subject to additional supervision conditions of home detention and electronic monitoring.
on november,probation formally petitioned for revocation of harris supervised release based on the four alleged violations.the petition advised that,insofar as one of the violations involved possession of narcotics,revocation was mandatory under g.further,because harris had pleaded guilty to a class a felony,the alleged narcotics offense constituted a grade a supervision violation,and harris had a criminal history category of ii,his recommended guidelines sentencing range for that violation was to months imprisonment,see approximately half the statutory year maximum,see e.probation explained that the other three allegations pertained to grade c violations of supervision,which given harris criminal history category of ii corresponded to a recommended guidelines sentencing range of to months imprisonment.see.probation recommended that harris be sentenced to months imprisonment,the low end of this lesser range,to be followed by an additional term of supervised release.
revocation hearing 
in february,harris case was reassigned to chief judge preska,who conducted a revocation hearing on the narcotics and charges on april,
government motion to admit victim hearsay statements 
at the outset,the government moved to allow statements by the victim of the alleged assault to be admitted through three law enforcement witnesses nypd officer efrain ayala,who first responded to the victim call on the night of the assault nypd detective jose chevere,who interviewed the victim two weeks later and united states attorney office criminal investigator antoinette guzman,who interviewed the victim six months after the incident.the government stated that the victim herself refused to testify notwithstanding receipt of a subpoena and an offer of appointed counsel and immunity based on her professed fear of retaliation by harris or his associates,all of whom continued to live in the victim neighborhood.it argued that this fear,coupled with the reliability of the victim statements,constituted good cause to conclude that the interest of justice did not require the victim appearance at the hearing.see fed.crim.b c.
the district court agreed.it credited the proffered fear based on the victim consistent expression of it,and concluded that harris confrontation interest was entitled to little weight by comparison.further,it found the hearsay statements reliable because they bore overall consistency,the first one was made near the time of the assault following a call,and the account was corroborated by the responding officer observations of physical injuries consistent with the reported assault.
violation findings 
narcotics trafficking while on supervision 
in support of the narcotics trafficking violation,two police officers testified to witnessing harris exchange drugs for money,and to recovering the exchanged drug packet,the contents of which tested positive for cocaine.the district court deemed this testimony credible and sufficient,by itself,to establish the charged violation.it also found the conclusion corroborated by further credited police and physician testimony establishing that,after arrest,harris attempted to conceal another packet of cocaine still in his possession by ingesting it.
assault while on supervision 
in support of the violation,law enforcement officials testified that on three occasions the day of the assault,two weeks later,and six months thereafter the victim recounted how,in the early morning hours of july,while she was dancing with a group of people,harris smacked her hard on the buttocks.see app x.when she verbally confronted harris about that conduct,he punched her in the mouth with a closed fist.id.at.the district court credited the victim hearsay accounts not only because of their overall consistency,but also because the victim,having called,had an incentive to be truthful responding officer ayala had personally observed the victim swollen and bruised lip with a laceration on the inside and all three officers who spoke with the victim reported finding her credible.id.at.based on this evidence,the district court concluded that harris commission of the assault while on supervision was proved by more than a preponderance rather,the proof was overwhelming.id.at.
in light of the district court findings that harris had committed the crimes of narcotics trafficking and assault while on supervision,the government moved to dismiss the remaining two violation charges,which motion the court granted at the conclusion of the hearing.
revocation judgment 
on may,the district court revoked harris supervised release and sentenced him to a total of months imprisonment to be followed by an additional one year of supervised release.harris,who is currently serving that prison sentence,timely filed this appeal.
ii.discussion 
challenge to court statutory.standard of review 
harris submits that,because the actions a court may take under e are stated in the disjunctive or,the district court was not statutorily authorized to revoke his supervision based on the same conduct narcotics trafficking that had earlier prompted it to modify the conditions of his supervision by adding a search condition while ordinarily we review questions of statutory interpretation de novo,see united states cassesse,cir,our review here is for plain error because harris failed to assert the challenge in the district court,see fed.crim.b united states marcus,d holding that plain error will be identified only if there is error that is clear or obvious,rather than subject to reasonable dispute that affects defendant substantial rights and that seriously impugns fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings accord united states rodriguez,cir.
in urging otherwise,harris maintains that the error was preserved when,at the conclusion of sentencing,he told the district court,i would like to state,for the record,this is double jeopardy.i being punished twice for the same crime.app x.the argument fails because harris now expressly disavows any double jeopardy claim,mounting a purely statutory challenge not raised below.see appellant br.further,he concedes that,if the statutory challenge was not preserved,plain error review applies.see id.at.
while we conclude that harris statutory challenge was not preserved,the matter is of no import because,in any event,the claim fails at the first step of plain error analysis that is,harris fails to demonstrate error.thus,his challenge fails even de novo review.
the statutory text and context do not support construing modification and revocation as mutually exclusive actions 
in considering de novo whether e authorizes a district court that has already modified supervision conditions in response to certain conduct to revoke supervised release based on the same conduct,we begin with the statute text because we assume that the ordinary meaning of the statutory language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.marx revenue,d brackets and internal quotation marks omitted see united states rowland,cir.if the statute meaning is plain,the inquiry ends there.as harris implicitly acknowledges,nothing in the text of e states that revocation following modification must be based on different conduct.see appellant br.noting issue appears to remain an open question.instead,he urges us to infer such a requirement from the statute use of the word or in e.he argues that the actions authorized in e thus operate only in the disjunctive,so that once a court modifies supervision conditions in response to certain conduct,it can not then revoke supervised release based on the same conduct.we are not persuaded.
established canons of statutory construction ordinarily suggest that terms connected by a disjunctive be given separate meanings.reiter sonotone,d see loughrin united states,d observing that disjunctive or signals that words it connects are to be given separate meanings internal quotation marks omitted.this serves to avoid interpretations that render statutory terms superfluous.mizrahi gonzales,cir.superfluity,however,is not a concern here because the words modify and revoke,as used in e,bear plainly different meanings with quite different effects on liberty.moreover,the different meanings obtain whether the actions are taken in response to the same or distinct conduct.
in any event,even when striving to ensure separate meanings,the disjunctive canon does not apply absolutely,particularly where the context dictates otherwise.reiter sonotone,at.see mizrahi gonzales,at refusing to conclude simply from the use of the word or that congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,because rule that disjunctive phrases bear different meanings is general,not absolute and,thus,courts should consider how a disjunctive or conjunctive form fits into the statutory scheme as a whole internal quotation marks omitted.the statutory context for use of the word or in e does not indicate congress intent to preclude revocation based on conduct that earlier prompted modification of supervision conditions.
this conclusion is evident from the fact that e modification does not require that a defendant be charged with a violation of much less be found to have violated any particular supervision condition.compare fed.crim.b requiring probable cause finding of supervision violation to pursue revocation of supervised release,with fed.crim.c requiring hearing,but no specific violation charge,to pursue modification of supervision see united states king,cir.distinguishing rule b revocation proceeding from rule c modification proceeding based on,inter alia,former requirement.rather,e authorizes district courts to modify supervision conditions at any time prior to the expiration or termination of supervised release as warranted by the circumstances generally.e.by contrast,revocation can occur only upon proof by a preponderance of the evidence that a charged condition of supervision has,in fact,been violated.see id.e.this statutory structure strongly signals congress intent to distinguish the two actions revocation and modification not by demanding that they respond to different conduct,as harris here urges,but rather,by the different charge and proof burdens assigned to each.see generally barnhart sigmon coal,d stating that,when congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion quoting russello united states,d.such a structure signals congress intent that the action causing a greater loss of liberty revocation can not be taken unless and until a higher burden of proof is satisfied.but it does not signal congress intent for modification and revocation to be mutually exclusive in responding to the same conduct.
indeed,such a construction could render other provisions of inoperative or at least insignificant,contrary to the rule that courts must give effect to all of a statute provisions so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,void or insignificant.corley united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.specifically,harris urged construction,insofar as it would prohibit revocation in his case,would run afoul of g,which mandates revocation where,as here,a supervised defendant is found to have possessed a controlled substance.see g.it would also undermine factors properly informing supervised release,such as deterrence of criminal activity and protection of the public from such activity by the defendant.see id.c citing id.a b c among factors relevant to determining conditions of supervised release see also id.e providing for same factors to be considered in modifying or revoking supervised
