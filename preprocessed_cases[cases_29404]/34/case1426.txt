opinion of the court 
this matter is before us in the context of an ongoing grand jury investigation of suspected federal criminal activity.to maintain the confidentiality of the investigation,we will refer only to such facts as have been made public by the assistant attorney.indeed,this panel has not been made aware of the facts in the underlying investigation,nor need we be in order to decide the issues before us.moreover,because the grand jury is impaneled for only a limited lifetime,we must act expeditiously and limit our analysis to the issues directly before us without digression.
in late,a grand jury began investigating the financial arrangements and business dealings of the individual who we believe may be the primary target.some of his business dealings have apparently been carried out by an entity we call,for want of a better designation,the organization.the grand jury investigation led to inquiry of jane doe,the executive director of the organization,who had,and has,intimate knowledge of and access to the papers and other material of both the primary target and the organization.it appears that jane doe is also a target of the grand jury investigation.if she was not at the outset,she certainly has become a target in light of the events with which we are concerned.the organization,through its counsel attorney,has entered into a agreement with jane doe and her counsel in response to the investigation.
on april,the government issued a grand jury subpoena to the organization.it requested all documents,including email,from january,to the present,concerning,inter alia the organization document retention and destruction policy the payment of certain expenses,contributions,or donations to the primary target and all grants,contributions,or donations to the primary target.attorney produced a large number of documents on behalf of the organization in response to the subpoena.these are not at issue here.
the government was unsatisfied with the document production,particularly with respect to what it perceived as the organization failure to search for and produce email stored on the organization computer hard drives.on january,the government issued a second subpoena to the organization,requesting essentially the same documents as in its previous subpoena.in a letter dated january,the government notified attorney that it wished to have fbi and irs experts perform a scan of the organization computers to recover stored information,including deleted email files.
on february,pursuant to an agreement among the parties,an fbi computer technician went to the organization place of business and imaged the hard drive on jane doe computer.the government thus made an exact copy of the contents of the hard drive,including deleted email files.it uncovered numerous stored messages which could be construed to show a conscious effort by the organization staff to destroy emails.
concerned about the potential obstruction of justice by jane doe and others at the organization,the government issued a subpoena duces tecum to attorney on march.it sought to compel grand jury testimony regarding his discussions with jane doe as to her compliance or apparent with the prior subpoenas for production of the organization email.the government also sought production of attorney notes concerning his conversation with jane doe regarding the organization compliance with the two grand jury subpoenas and the january,letter.on march,the government issued a separate subpoena for production of documents to the custodian of records at attorney law firm.
the government,attorney and jane doe then sought to reach an agreement that would limit the scope of attorney testimony before the grand jury.the government proposed that attorney testify on five subjects that he represents the organization in connection with the april,and january,subpoenas that he received the january,subpoena and january letter from the government that he informed jane doe by telephone on january,of his receipt of the january subpoena that he faxed a cover letter to jane doe enclosing the cover letter and subpoena from the government and that he advised jane doe on january regarding how to comply with the subpoena.jane doe voiced no objection to subjects,but she challenged number,claiming that attorney advice regarding compliance with the subpoena is privileged.
on january,the government filed a motion to enforce the subpoena and to compel attorney testimony.attorney and jane doe were permitted to intervene with regard to the motion,and they filed a motion to quash or to modify the subpoena to the extent that it required disclosure of privileged information.
on january,the district court held a hearing on the motions.the government argued that the exception should overcome the claim of privilege.in support of its position,it submitted an ex parte affidavit from an fbi agent with knowledge of the evidence gathered in the investigation.the district court also heard testimony from attorney and from jane doe attorney hereinafter doe attorney.with the government absent from the courtroom,the two attorneys testified essentially to their recollection of the conversations with jane doe on january,after receipt of the second subpoena and the government cover letter.
the dispute before the district court was limited to whether attorney should be compelled to reveal the substance of his january,telephone conversation with jane doe and to produce his handwritten notes concerning that conversation.on february,the district court granted the government motion to enforce its subpoena.the court concluded that although attorney advice regarding the subpoena is protected by the privilege,and his notes are covered by the doctrine,disclosure was appropriate in light of the exception.based on its review of the government ex parte affidavit,the district court found sufficient evidence that jane doe was in the process of committing obstruction of justice at the time of her january conversation with attorney,and used the information provided by attorney in furtherance of the crime.
the government promptly scheduled attorney appearance before the grand jury.the district court denied a stay pending appeal.jane doe timely appealed,and this court also denied a stay.on february,attorney provided the requested documents and testified before the grand jury.
the government argues that this court can not grant any effective relief to jane doe because attorney has testified and the documents it requested have been produced.the appeal,the government states,is moot and should be dismissed.it relies for support on church of scientology united states,in which the supreme court stated that federal courts are not empowered to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions,or to declare principles or rules of law which can not affect the matter in issue in the case before them.church of scientology united states,d quoting mills green.the court explained that if an event occurs during the pendency of an appeal which makes it impossible for the court to render the prevailing party any effectual relief whatever,the appeal must be dismissed as moot.id.quotation marks and citation omitted.
the court noted,however,that if there is some means by which the court can effectuate even a partial remedy,the case remains a live controversy.see id.at.based on that language,jane doe responds to the government suggestion of mootness by arguing that she is not without a remedy because the true harm,which is in the indictment,has not yet occurred.appellant br.at.jane doe recognizes that the remedy she initially requested,the quashing of the subpoena directed to attorney,is no longer available,but she posits a number of remedies that this court could grant.therefore,she argues,this is not a case where,in the language of scientology,it is impossible for us to grant her any effectual relief whatever.
turning first to the documents,jane doe argues that this court could direct the district court to order the return of attorney notes of the conversation he had with jane doe on january,documents he turned over pursuant to the grand jury subpoenas.this was a remedy expressly recognized by the supreme court in scientology.in that case,a district court ordered a clerk to comply with an irs civil summons requesting the production of two conversations between officials of the church of scientology and their attorneys.the church timely appealed enforcement of the subpoena but its request for a stay was denied,and the tapes were produced during the appeal.the court of appeals concluded that the appeal was moot because the irs had already obtained the tapes,but the supreme court rejected that conclusion.it observed that while the court of appeals could not return the parties to the status quo ante,it could effectuate a partial remedy by ordering the government to destroy or return any and all copies of the tapes in its possession.the court stated,when the government has obtained materials as a result of an unlawful summons,a court can effectuate relief by ordering the government to return the records.id.at.
the notes attorney produced to the grand jury are tangible property,like the audio tapes.therefore,this court can fashion a meaningful remedy for the allegedly unlawful subpoena by ordering a return of attorney notes to attorney at his request if we decide the notes are privileged 
other courts of appeals have held that the availability of a direction to the grand jury to return notes or documents precludes a finding of mootness.see in re grand jury subpoenas stover,cir applying scientology in grand jury context and holding that refusal to quash subpoena duces tecum was not moot because court could order return or destruction of produced documents see also in re arbitration security life ins,cir dismissing as moot portion of appeal concerning enforcement of subpoena for testimony,but hearing appeal regarding production of documents united states florida azalea specialists,cir t his appeal is not moot because if we hold that the subpoena was improperly issued,florida azalea would be entitled to a partial remedy in the form of return or destruction of its documents.
the government does not make any effort to distinguish these cases,and we do not understand it to dispute jane doe argument that the case is not moot,at least insofar as the documents are concerned.we therefore conclude that the availability of an order directing the grand jury to return attorney notes precludes any finding that this appeal is moot,at least with respect to the documents.
the more difficult issue is whether the appeal is moot with respect to attorney testimony regarding the contents of his january conversation with jane doe.jane doe suggests that an instruction could be given to the grand jury to disregard attorney testimony and that would constitute effective relief which prevents the appeal from being moot.she argues that federal courts have the power to instruct the grand jurors that they must disregard evidence previously presented to them.we recognize that is the remedy frequently used by trial courts when jurors are exposed to testimony that was not admissible.see,united states de jesus mateo,cir within wide margins,the prejudice caused by improper testimony can be addressed by providing appropriate curative instructions.citation omitted.on the other hand,courts control over a grand jury is significantly more limited than their control over a trial jury.in any event,we will assume arguendo that a curative instruction would be a possible result in an appropriate case.
the government relies heavily upon in re grand jury proceedings john roe,cir,where,as here,an attorney testified in response to a subpoena prior to resolution of the clients appeal and prior to issuance of an indictment.id.at.the clients argued the appeal was not moot because the court could either enjoin the grand jury from considering the attorney testimony or it could dismiss the grand jury.id.at.the court held that the appeal was moot,distinguishing scientology because the subpoena there was for the production of tangible physical property audio tapes,whereas the subpoena under review sought intangible witness testimony.id.at.the court noted that scientology did not involve grand jury proceedings,the independence and secrecy of which limit the availability of effective relief.id.at.
the eleventh circuit rejected the option of dismissing the grand jury as a remedy,noting that it could not prevent the government from presenting the testimony to another grand jury.jane doe has also suggested that we could circumvent mootness by ordering the impaneling of a new grand jury.we reject that course and agree with the eleventh circuit that dismissal of the grand jury is not an appropriate remedy,at least in this case.even if this court could provide that remedy,we find apt the eleventh circuit observation in in re grand jury proceedings john roe that dismissing the grand jury would not erase the attorney testimony from the mind of the united states attorney and others having access to the testimony.id.at.as such,ordering the impaneling of a new grand jury would not constitute effectual relief,scientology,at,because it would do nothing to prevent the government from using the testimony again in any event,that is much too draconian a remedy for the situation presented here.
what jane doe really seeks,therefore,is an order that prevents any future use of attorney testimony.the eleventh circuit rejected a injunction as a remedy stating that it would be unenforceable.in re grand jury proceedings john roe,at see also office of thrift supervision,dep t of treasury dobbs,a party can not retrieve testimony once it is given the party can only ask that the testimony be sealed against future use.in that event,such a challenge would be ripe only at the time when that future use is a real,not a speculative,possibility.because appellant seeks only to seal his testimony against future use,we find that his appeal became moot upon his compliance with the district court order enforcing the subpoena.citations omitted.
we are not convinced that we should rule out the possibility of a injunction as a remedy.although this court has not addressed whether a future use injunction would be appropriate in the grand jury context,we have held that future use injunctions can be entered in response to an unlawful irs civil summons.in gluck united states,cir,we held that an appeal from enforcement of a summons was not moot even though the appellant had complied with the summons by providing the requested documents.we explained that the surrendering of the documents to the irs does not end the controversy between the parties because,if we find that the summonses were illegal,we can still fashion a of the use of the summoned afford appellants effective relief.id.at emphasis added.the gluck decision relied upon united states friedman,cir,where we held that an appeal from enforcement of a subpoena duces tecum was not moot despite subsequent compliance.we observed that,
i f the taxpayers were to prevail in their contention that all summonses were illegal because they were issued solely to gather evidence for use in a criminal prosecution,then the records acquired from friedman would have been obtained unlawfully.such a ruling could affect the possible use of these records in any subsequent criminal or civil proceeding brought against the taxpayers.
id.at see also united states waltman,cir holding that surrender of a personal diary in response to subpoena did not moot appeal because if the diary is not a corporate record,the individual respondent is entitled to its return and appropriate suppression of the use of its contents.as the circuit court of appeals has put it,t he third circuit approach implies that no subpoena case is moot so long as the court can provide redress by sealing documents or testimony against future use.office of thrift supervision,at.
we do not need to decide at this time whether we should or could issue a future use injunction.we follow the example of the supreme court in scientology where,after holding that a return or destruction of the audio tapes at issue provided an effective remedy,the court declined to address whether a injunction would also be an effective remedy.the court explained,
petitioner also argues that a court can effectuate further relief by ordering the irs to refrain from any future use of the information that it has derived from the tapes.such an order would obviously go further towards returning the parties to the status quo ante than merely requiring the irs to return the tapes and all copies thereof.however,as there is no guarantee that the irs will in fact use the information gleaned from the tapes,it could be argued that such an order would be an impermissible advisory opinion.because we are concerned only with the question whether any relief can be ordered,we leave the future use question for another day.
at.citations omitted.
similarly,it is not clear that the attorney plans to use attorney testimony as the basis for a still unissued indictment or in any criminal proceeding.under these circumstances,we need not decide whether we will extend our jurisprudence to the grand jury context.as in scientology,the potential availability of a injunction means that the issue is not moot.we thus reject the government suggestion that this appeal is moot.
we now turn to the merits of jane doe appeal.she argues that the district court order enforcing and refusing to quash the subpoena to attorney undermines the privilege because the subpoena seeks to ascertain the contents of her conversation with attorney on january.although jane doe retained a personal lawyer,her lawyer and attorney who represents the organization entered into a joint defense agreement,and therefore the privilege is applicable.in any event,the supreme court has held that communication between a corporation counsel and the employees of the corporation are covered by the privilege.upjohn united states,d.
the court stated that the privilege is the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known.id.at.c ourts long have viewed the privilege central concern as one to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice.united states zolin,d quoting upjohn,at.
despite the importance of the privilege in the administration of justice,the supreme court in zolin commented on the costs of the privilege in that it has the effect of withholding relevant information from the factfinder.id.quoting fisher united states,d.therefore,the privilege can be overridden if the client used the lawyer services to further a continuing or future crime or fraud.see in re grand jury proceedings,cir.
jane doe argues that the exception is inapplicable in this case because she did not initiate the communication with attorney or solicit any advice.she relies on the language in doe,where this court stated,o nly when a client knowingly seeks legal counsel to further a continuing or future crime does the exception apply.united states doe,cir.
that sentence in the doe opinion reflects the facts in that case,the client,a law enforcement officer,initiated the communication with the attorney and sought his advice as to how to circumvent the prohibition against investing in a witness business.nothing in that opinion,or in any opinion,suggests that the exception applies only if the client initiates the conversation.
to the contrary,the exception is equally applicable in situations where there has been a prior relationship and the communication at issue was made in the context of that relationship.there would be no reason to limit the applicability of the exception to contact,as the exception purpose is to further frank and open exchanges between the client and his or her attorney,whether newly retained for purposes of the investigation or otherwise.
the burden to make the necessary showing for the exception falls on the party who seeks application of the exception.in criminal cases,it is the government that seeks to invoke the exception to counter a defendant effort to prevent disclosure of certain testimony or documents on the ground of the privilege.therefore,it is the government that must bear the initial burden.we have described the showing that must be made as follows 
t he government must make a prima facie showing that the client was committing or intending to commit a fraud or crime,and the communications were in furtherance of that alleged crime or fraud.a prima facie showing requires presentation of evidence which,if believed by the,would be sufficient to support a finding that the elements of the exception were met.
in re grand jury subpoena,cir citations omitted see also impounded,cir haines liggett group,cir.
in clark united states,the supreme court,in describing the evidentiary standard for the application of the exception,stated 
there must be a showing of a prima facie case sufficient to satisfy the judge that the light should be let in 
to drive the privilege away,there must be something to give colour to the charge there must be prima facie evidence that it has some foundation in fact.when that evidence is supplied,the seal of secrecy is broken.
id.at.citations and footnote omitted.the burden is not a particularly heavy one.as the court of appeals for the seventh circuit stated,prima facie evidence can not mean enough to support a verdict in favor of the person making the claim.in re feldberg,cir.
in this case,the district court found that at the time of jane doe january,conversation with attorney,jane doe was committing the crime of obstruction of justice.the court finding that the government met its burden of presenting evidence demonstrating a reasonable basis to suspect the perpetration of a crime,if based on adequate evidence,satisfies the first prong of the exception.
the district court based its finding on the evidence before it,which included the ex parte affidavit provided by the government.the supreme court has made clear that the district courts may use ex parte evidence supplied by the government in order to make the required findings.zolin,at.
in zolin,the irs sought to use two tape recordings produced in an earlier case to make the required showing that the exception overcame the claimed privilege.the court of appeals for the ninth circuit had opined that the determination of the applicability of the exception must be based on sources independent of the communications recorded on the tapes.id.at.in holding that was error,the supreme court stated that a rigid independent evidence requirement does not comport with reason and experience,that in camera review may be used to determine whether allegedly privileged communications fall within the exception,and that the party opposing the privilege must present evidence sufficient to support a reasonable belief that in camera review may yield evidence that establishes the exception applicability.id.at.
in accordance with zolin,the district court here used the affidavit of the fbi agent to support its finding that at the time of jane doe january,conversation with attorney,jane doe was committing the crime of obstruction of justice by participating in a scheme to delete emails on the computers of the organization,its officers,and staff.that this was the crime on which the government hinged its arguments with respect to the exception was made clear in the assistant attorney arguments before this court.
in conducting our review of the district court finding,we too must base our decision on the evidence submitted to the district court ex parte.we are hampered in articulating the basis for our conclusion by the need to keep the evidentiary support confidential because much of the relevant information that was before the district court is sealed as it pertains to the ongoing investigation of the grand jury.moreover,the parties briefs have been sealed.we are therefore comfortable to discuss only such facts as the assistant attorney disclosed in his argument in open court before us.
based on our review,we agree that there was sufficient evidence to support the district court finding that jane doe could be found to have engaged in the ongoing crime of obstruction of justice that does not mean we believe there is sufficient evidence to support a jury verdict to that effect beyon
