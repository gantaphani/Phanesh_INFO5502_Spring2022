jorge molina gómez molina appeals the district court order denying his motion to suppress both the heroin discovered in hidden compartments of his laptop computer and sony playstation game console and some of the statements he made to united states customs and border protection cbp officers upon returning to puerto rico from colombia.while we find no fourth amendment violation,molina statements made during further secondary questioning regarding drug trafficking activity should have been suppressed.as a result,his case must be remanded so that he can opt to withdraw his plea and proceed to trial should he choose to do so.
background 
on august,at approximately,molina arrived at the luis muñoz marín international airport in san juan,puerto rico,via panama,after a trip to colombia.this was the third time in four months in which molina had taken a short trip to colombia,a known source of illegal narcotics.as a result,the cbp computer system flagged molina for questioning.
upon deplaning,molina was referred to secondary inspection,where he claimed one bag,one computer case holding an acer laptop computer,and one small bag containing a sony playstation.the bag contained personal belongings,three cell phones,and a western union money gram in the amount of one million colombian pesos approximately sent to molina at the hotel galaxy the day after he arrived in colombia by a colombian man named rodolfo trochez sardí.
in response to the cbp officers questions,molina explained that he traveled to cartagena,colombia,for four days to visit a friend,camilo,whom he met through another friend named cynthia.he stated that he purchased his ticket for on the copa airlines website using a credit card,but that he did not have the credit card with him.molina told the cbp officers that while in colombia he stayed at the hotel galaxy and did not leave his hotel room,but rather just ate and played games on his playstation.
these answers raised the cbp officers suspicions,and further questioning and investigation revealed problems with molina story.for example,molina did not know either camilo or cynthia last name.and,contrary to his assertion,molina did not purchase his plane ticket online via credit card,but rather it was purchased in cash at a cali,colombia travel agency.indeed,all three of molina colombian trips were booked with cash through this travel agency.
molina was then escorted to a small approximately,windowless room containing one desk where he was patted down and subjected to further secondary questioning.he was in this room for approximately two hours and was asked about his trip to colombia,his intentions upon reentry,and drug trafficking generally.the record is unclear as to what specifically the cbp officers asked and what molina responses were.he did,however,tell the officers that he had to work the following morning at,and he denied any involvement in drug trafficking.
while this questioning was ongoing,other cbp officers were inspecting molina belongings.they his laptop,playstation,and three cell phones and saw no contraband.they also confirmed that the electronics were all operational,but noted that while the laptop turned on,it contained no data despite being an older model.a review of the three cell phones showed text messages from camilo,sardí,and numerous unidentified others.these text messages involved money transactions totaling approximately and referenced money molina had already received and money he would receive once he arrived in new york.the phones also revealed a confirmed plane ticket from san juan to new york for the following morning,contradicting molina statement to cbp officers that he would be working in san juan at 
given all of these red flags,the officers suspected that molina was smuggling narcotics.because the yielded no results and the of molina electronics came back negative,the officers were concerned that molina was carrying drugs internally.they explained the situation to molina,and he voluntarily consented to a medical exam.at around,molina was taken,in shackles to san gerardo hospital.an exam was inconclusive,so a ct scan was performed and his were monitored.these tests confirmed that there were no foreign objects inside molina body.later that day,at around,he was released from the hospital and transported back to the airport.
upon returning to the airport,molina was released by cbp and allowed to enter the united states.he was given all of his belongings except for the laptop and playstation,which were detained for further examination by the cbp forensics laboratory because a showed interest in the laptop.molina was given a pamphlet explaining the detention process and whom to contact to inquire about the property.
the following day,august,the laptop and playstation were received by the cbp forensic lab.the detention ticket indicated that the detention was for data extraction but this was in error,as the electronics were detained in order to be searched for hidden contraband.indeed,no data extraction was ever conducted.beginning on august,molina started calling the cbp to inquire about the status of his electronics and when they would be returned.on august,a cbp forensic chemist disassembled the electronics and found black bags hidden inside sophisticated compartments of both the laptop and playstation.the bags contents tested positive for heroin grams in the laptop and kilograms in the playstation.
on august,cbp,in coordination with ice,called molina to inform him that his electronics could be picked up at the airport.when molina arrived later that day,he was arrested by ice agents.the agents read molina his rights,which molina subsequently waived.he confirmed that he owned both the laptop and the playstation,that he took them to colombia and intended to return with them,that he had planned to travel to new york the morning after he returned to puerto rico but never did so,and that his trip to colombia and new york were paid for by sardí.
molina was indicted for possession with intent to distribute one kilogram or more of heroin,in violation of a b a i,in september.in december,he filed a motion to suppress the heroin and any statements made during the further secondary questioning as violations of his fourth and fifth amendment rights,respectively.the motion was denied via a brief text order,which stated in its entirety 
i am of the opinion that the position advanced by the government in the opposition to the motion to suppress is correct as a matter of law.the motion to suppress is denied.if the defendant pleads,he may preserve the issue on appeal.
three days later,molina entered a conditional plea pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of criminal procedure and he now timely appeals the denial.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and review de novo its conclusions of law and its rulings on the constitutionality of the government conduct.united states beras,cir see also united states carrigan,cir fourth amendment united states mittel carey,cir fifth amendment.because the district court made no findings of fact,the entire record is reviewed de novo.united states robles,cir.so long as any reasonable view of the evidence supports it,we will uphold the denial of the motion to suppress.united states brown,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
b.the search of the electronics 
molina first argues that the search of his laptop and playstation,which uncovered the hidden heroin,was an unreasonable search in violation of the fourth amendment to the united states constitution.pursuant to the fourth amendment,
the right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures,shall not be violated,and no warrants shall issue,but upon probable cause,supported by oath or affirmation,and particularly describing the place to be searched,and the persons or things to be seized.
const.amend.iv.it is well established,however,that the fourth amendment balance of reasonableness is qualitatively different at the international border than in the interior due to the longstanding concern for the protection of the integrity of the border.united states montoya de hernández,d.this concern is,if anything,heightened by the veritable national crisis in law enforcement caused by smuggling of illicit narcotics.id.as a result,there is a recognized border search exception to the warrant requirement.see united states ramsey,d see also montoya de hernández,at beras,at.international airports such as the luis muñoz marín international airport are the functional equivalent of an international border and are thus subject to this exception.robles,at united states uricoechea casallas,cir.
under the border search exception,r outine searches of the persons and effects of entrants are not subject to any requirement of reasonable suspicion,probable cause,or warrant.montoya de hernández,at see also united states braks,cir the first circuit standard for routine border searches is the no suspicion standard.these searches are reasonable simply by virtue of the fact they occur at the border.united states flores montano,d quoting ramsey,at.searches,by contrast,require reasonable suspicion.montoya de hernández,at united states barrow,cir.though there is no rule,and the supreme court has cautioned against c omplex balancing tests,flores montano,at,whether a search qualifies as routine or not routine often depends on the degree of invasiveness or intrusiveness associated with the search.braks,at listing numerous factors to consider.for example,searches that are highly intrusive searches of the person,flores montano,at,such as strip searches and body cavity searches,have been deemed to be,barrow,at braks,at united states kallevig,cir.so have searches of property that are destructive,flores montano,at,such as drilling a hole in a metal cylinder.robles,at.by contrast,braks,at,searching luggage inside an aircraft cargo hold,uricoechea casallas,at,opening bottles of liquor and testing the contents,barrow,at,and removing,disassembling,and reassembling a fuel tank without causing damage,flores montano,at,have all been deemed routine searches.
here,molina argues that the search of his laptop and playstation that led to the discovery of the two heroin bags constitutes a and unreasonable search.however,he is unable to point to any specific act that is either or unreasonable.instead,his argument seems to be that because the initial and search of his laptop and playstation turned up negative,and because his detention at the hospital to which he consented showed that he was not carrying drugs internally,it was therefore unreasonable to detain his laptop and playstation for further testing.and,even if it was reasonable to further detain the electronics initially,he contends,the detention became unreasonable during the days they were at the cbp lab.the government,for its part,counters that the search qualifies as a routine border search and thus no suspicion at all let alone reasonable suspicion was necessary,but even if reasonable suspicion was necessary,that standard was satisfied.
we need not categorize the search as either routine or because we agree with the government that even assuming the search was,reasonable suspicion existed to justify the search.reasonable suspicion exists when agents demonstrate some objective,articulable facts that justify the intrusion as to the particular person and place searched.robles,at quoting uricoechea casallas,at see also montoya de hernández,at describing reasonable suspicion as a conclusio n about human behavior upon which practical people,including government officials,are entitled to rely alteration in original quoting new jersey,d internal quotation marks omitted.
such objective,articulable facts are present here.first,this was molina third trip in four months each only for a matter of days to colombia,a country known for its connection to drug smuggling.second,molina gave odd and suspicious answers to routine customs questions.these answers ranged from highly dubious he could not remember the last name of either the friend he was visiting camilo or the friend who introduced them cynthia and all he did while in colombia was stay in the hotel and play with his playstation to assertions proven to be lies he claimed to have purchased his ticket online with a credit card but in actuality paid for it in cash at a travel agency and he claimed to be working in puerto rico the next morning but in fact had a confirmed flight to new york city.third,his laptop was old and operational,yet it contained no data.finally,his phones contained text messages involving prior and future money transactions.taken together,these facts easily give rise to a reasonable suspicion that molina was attempting to smuggle narcotics.see robles,at holding that reasonable suspicion existed where a metal machine part of no commercial value was shipped from colombia a known source country for narcotics to a residence in the united states at a cost higher than its worth,without insurance united states lamela,cir finding reasonable suspicion where defendant,among other things,was a passenger aboard an international flight originating in colombia and gave inconsistent responses to routine questions relating to the purpose of his travel kallevig,at explaining that the pattern and brevity of defendant recent visits to countries considered to be important sources of drugs was properly noted as a relevant factor in evaluating reasonable suspicion.
that the initial of the electronics and the,ct scan,and bowel monitoring of molina came up negative in no way alters this conclusion or transforms a legitimate and proper search into an unreasonable one.authorities must be allowed to graduate their response to the demands of any particular situation,montoya de hernández,at quoting united states place,d,and that is precisely what the cbp officers did here.the officers had reasonable suspicion that molina was smuggling drugs they just did not know where the drugs were hidden.there is nothing unreasonable about the officers shifting their attention back to the electronics and giving them a more look once they were satisfied that the drugs were neither on nor in molina body.to the contrary,this approach is eminently reasonable when one considers that a conducted while molina was at the hospital showed interest in his laptop.
similarly,the search did not become unreasonable during the days the electronics were detained.the supreme court has consistently rejected time limits,instead placing an emphasis on common sense and ordinary human experience.id.at quoting united states sharpe,d see also flores montano,at noting that r espondent points to no cases indicating the fourth amendment shields entrants from inconvenience or delay at the international border.though days does seem lengthy,it is not unreasonable under these circumstances.we will not the techniques used by the cbp lab and require that a faster alternative which could have damaged the electronics during the disassembly and reassembly process,could have put an unnecessary budgetary and workload strain on the lab,or could even have failed to detect the expertly hidden heroin be employed see montoya de hernández,at c ourts should not indulge in unrealistic,t he fact that the protection of the public might,in the abstract,have been accomplished by means does not,in itself,render the search unreasonable.quoting sharpe,at,id.at explaining that the customs officers were not required by the fourth amendment to simply shrug their shoulders and allow an alimentary canal smuggling defendant into the interior because she had been detained for too long before passing balloons quoting adams williams,d.thus,the search of molina laptop and playstation did not violate his fourth amendment rights.
c.the further secondary questioning 
molina also argues that the further secondary questioning conducted by the cbp officers in a small,windowless room violated his fifth amendment rights because he was not given his miranda warnings prior to being questioned we agree 
the supreme court developed the miranda rules as a prophylactic measure to dissipate the coercion inherent in the custodial interrogation setting,with a goal of ensuring that any statements made by a suspect are truly the product of free choice and consistent with the fifth amendment to the united states constitution.united states vázquez,cir quoting miranda arizona,d.accordingly,i t is well established that miranda warnings must be communicated to a suspect before he is subjected to custodial interrogation.united states nai fook li,cir.both custody and interrogation must be present to require miranda warnings.see,united states fernández ventura,cir fernández ventura i.
custody exists where there is a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.though custody is a somewhat amorphous concept,relevant considerations in a custody determination include,but are not limited to,whether the suspect was questioned in familiar or at least neutral surroundings,the number of law enforcement officers present at the scene,the degree of physical restraint placed upon the suspect,and the duration and character of the interrogation.id.at quoting united states masse,cir.
in the border context,we also must take into account the strong governmental interest in controlling our borders.united states fernández ventura,cir fernández ventura ii.as a result,the rules surrounding miranda at the border are more relaxed.see united states long tong kiam,cir n ormal miranda rules simply can not apply to this unique situation at the border.this is a situation utterly unlike a normal law enforcement setting.internal citation omitted.e vents which might be enough to signal custody away from the border will not be enough to establish custody in the context of entry into t he country.fernández ventura ii,at quoting united states moya,cir.for example,even though a traveler being questioned by cbp is not free to leave,he is not necessarily in custody.see fernández ventura i,at e ven secondary inspection does not per se constitute custodial interrogation.id.at explaining that it is simply wrong to conclude that a traveler is in custody because they may not simply walk away from an interrogating officer internal quotation marks omitted see also united states butler,cir t he mere detention of a person in a border station security office from which he or she is not free to leave,while a search of a vehicle occurs,is not custody for miranda purposes.
relaxed rules,however,do not mean no rules,and a review of the record persuades us that,given the totality of the circumstances,molina was,indeed,in custody during this further secondary questioning.first,molina was placed in a small,windowless room,approximately,with at least two cbp officers.as we noted in united states pratt,cir,the confining character of a c ustoms questioning cell,combined with isolation with two probing inspectors,creates an oppressive atmosphere that we can not ignore.
second,molina was held in this room for between and two hours.though this is never a singly determinative factor,id.at,the longer someone is detained,the more likely he is in custody.compare id.at finding that a encounter supports a characterization of routine c ustoms inquiry rather than custodial interrogation,and borodine douzanis,cir finding that a encounter was not custodial and referring to similar cases involving encounters of and,with united states garcía,cir holding an encounter to be custodial where detention lasted for at least an hour.but see fernández ventura ii,at finding that a encounter was not extraordinary and did not establish custody where the record did not support defendant allegation that he was subjected to focused questioning for that entire time.
third,the questioning was not routine.the cbp officers were no longer probing whether or not to admit molina into the country,as they had already reviewed molina travel documents and therefore confirmed his citizenship.instead,they were probing their suspicions of molina involvement with drug smuggling activity.pratt,at finding that because,among other things,n o events transpired to create or to symbolize a high and evident degree of suspicion about the appellant by the agents,the encounter did not transgress the limits that case law has permitted in the absence of miranda warnings 
taken together,we conclude that this encounter which involved a lengthy detention in a small,windowless room and probing questions about potential illegal activity went above and beyond a routine customs inspection to determine whether or not molina should be admitted into the united states.instead,it was akin to a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.fernández ventura i,at quoting thompson keohane,d.thus,molina was in custody for miranda purposes.
being in custody,however,is only half the equation.molina must still prove that he was subject to interrogation.interrogation refers to both express questioning and its functional equivalent,which includes any words or actions on the part of the police other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.id.at quoting rhode island innis,d.at the same time though,questions from customs officials are especially understood to be a necessary and important routine for travelers arriving at american entry points.see also pratt,at explaining that individuals approach official airport customs inspections inquiry knowing of its greater necessity and routine.this understanding cuts against the potentially coercive aspect of the customs inquiry,and thus lessens the need for miranda warnings.fernández ventura i,at see also long tong kiam,at we now reaffirm the authority of border inspectors to ask questions of those entering the united states.as a result,a careful examination of all the circumstances is needed in order to distinguish between routine customs questioning and custodial interrogation.fernández ventura i,at.
here,the record is unclear as to what exactly molina was asked during secondary questioning.he claims,however and the government does not contest that he was asked general questions regarding his reasons for traveling to another country,his activities while there,his reasons for entering the united states,and his involvement in activities.according to molina,this was all interrogation because he was in custody during the further secondary questioning,and thus all statements made while in the small windowless room must be suppressed.
molina position is far too broad.some of the questions asked,such as molina reasons for traveling to colombia,what he did while there,and why he decided to return when he did,were routine questions which we have held do not constitute interrogation.see,id.at i n the customs context,we have stated that questions from officials are especially understood to be a necessary and important routine for travelers arriving at american entry points.united states tajeddini,cir asking where a traveler was arriving from and with whom he was traveling constitute routine customs questions not requiring miranda warnings united states ledezma hernández,cir finding that routine questioning at the border as to the traveler destination and the contents of his truck was not custodial interrogation.indeed,these are the same questions molina was asked during his initial questioning,and he has conceded that they were appropriate questions.
the cbp officers questioning into molina involvement with drug activity,however,is more problematic.this line of questioning had nothing to do with whether or not to admit molina into the country.instead,these questions symbolize d a high and evident degree of suspicion by the cbp officers.pratt,at finding that limited questioning seeking an explanation as to why the traveler possessed a ticket issued for another person was routine and did not create or symbolize a high and evident degree of suspicion about the appellant.the officers were already leery that molina may have been involved in drug trafficking,and this line of questioning was clearly aimed at eliciting an incriminating response.see innis,at
