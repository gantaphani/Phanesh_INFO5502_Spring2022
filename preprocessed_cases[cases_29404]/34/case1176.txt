ronald repak was convicted of two counts of hobbs act extortion,in violation of,and two counts of federal program bribery,in violation of.repak appeals his conviction and sentence on those counts.for the reasons stated below,we will affirm.
this is a public corruption case coming out of johnstown,pennsylvania.the defendant,ronald repak,was the executive director of the johnstown redevelopment authority jra,which receives federal and state funding to assist in economic development for the city of johnstown.a voluntary board of directors governs the jra.to promote economic development in johnstown,the jra board of directors awards contracts to remediate industrial proprieties and issues grants to attract companies to johnstown.
while the jra board of directors ultimately confers contracts and grants,the jra executive director,who runs the operations of the organization,makes recommendations to the board as to which contractors should receive those contracts and grants.the jra board of directors relied on the director to keep them informed as to what was going on.as one jra board member testified,percent of what any board member knew in most situations w as told to them by the director.in short,the executive director plays a vital role in the process of selecting who receives jra contracts and grants.
repak was the executive director from november to february.his assistant was debbie walter.with walter help,repak solicited a number of items from contractors who had been awarded contract work by the jra during his time as executive director repak solicitations included requests for concert tickets,sporting event tickets,and golf outings.jra contractors acquiesced in repak solicitations because if they did,they felt that they would lose work.as one contractor testified,repak would sometimes provide some innuendos like,hey,i reviewing some invoice here of yours,which was usually followed up with some type of request.or sometimes,he would say,well,i can get someone else to do the work.see also repak provided a lot of,i said innuendos,subtle things through conversations.and then it would always be followed in a short period of time by either an instruction or request.w ith him,instructions and requests were the same thing.
of particular importance in this appeal are two items that repak received from jra contractors but that were unassociated with any jra project a new roof on his house and excavating services for his son gym.the government also charged repak with receipt of pittsburgh steelers tickets from another contractor,kimball.the jury,however,acquitted repak on the counts related to receipt of the steelers tickets.for that reason,we discuss only the receipt of the roof and excavating services in detail.
in,jra contractor eads group eads replaced the roof on repak home at no cost to repak.while repak and several eads employees were together,repak overheard an eads employee,stephen sewalk,discussing his past roofing business.repak then asked sewalk to take a look at the roof on his home.at that time,eads did significant business with the jra.based on repak past solicitations for tickets and other items,sewalk stated that he inward ly sigh ed following repak roof request and thought here we go again.although sewalk initially tried to ignore repak request,sewalk knew it was going to go away after repak made the request again several months later.id.sewalk then went to look at repak roof but testified at trial that he did not give repak a quote for work on the roof.rather,after sewalk spoke with eads ceo,eads figured the roof was going to be another favor and informed repak that it would cover the cost of replacing his roof.sewalk testified that,although repak offered to pay for the roof at one point,repak also told him to bury the roofing expenses in an invoice to the jra.eads ultimately replaced the roof at a cost of to.instead of concealing those expenses in jra invoices as repak instructed,eads simply bore the cost of replacing the roof.when asked at trial why eads did this for repak,sewalk responded that eads replaced the roof simply so that eads could maintain the workload with the jra.see also w e wanted to keep people employed and do our work.so i figured if we told repak no that we were going to be working there much longer.
also in,a jra contractor performed excavating services at a gym owned by repak son.neither repak nor his family paid for it.repak initially asked another jra contractor to do the excavating work,but,after repak told the contractor to bury out of the excavating price quoted in a jra invoice,the contractor turned him down and refused to work for the jra again.as that contractor put it,i just discussed it with my wife and kids,and we just decided it would be better just to walk away than continue to work for the jra and repak.
repak then enlisted another jra contractor,excavating company,to do the work.repak instructed to demolish two abandoned homes and level lots adjoining his son gym and then to spread gravel on the leveled area for parking.this work cost.after completing the requested work,an employee,rick mcnulty,asked repak whom should invoice for the work.repak told mcnulty to just bury the in invoices to the jra and did not offer to pay for services.at that time,sixty percent of business came from the jra.yet,rather than follow repak instruction to submit fraudulent invoices,assumed the cost to level and gravel the property near the gym.when asked why did this,mcnulty explained that providing these gratuitous services to repak was just part of doing business with the jra and repak.
as members became suspicious of repak dealings with jra contractors,the jra board of directors implemented policies to control gratuities and expenditures.the gratuities policy prohibited jra contractors from offering any gratuity to any jra employee and prohibited jra employees from accepting the same.the expenditures policy required the approval of the jra board of directors for all jra expenditures over.at trial,jra contractors expressed the relief they felt following enactment of the gratuities policy.one jra contractor testified,i was relieved because it gave me my ammunition to say no,i guess.i did have to continue doing this.echoing the sentiment behind the jra policies,another contractor opined,it had to stop.it was getting to the point that repak was like one power running everything in the city of johnstown and if this was the way you would choose to do business,you would do business here.
a grand jury returned a indictment against repak arising out of his actions as the executive director of the jra.the six counts related to three underlying factual circumstances counts and pertained to repak receipt of pittsburgh steelers tickets from kimball counts and dealt with the installation of a new roof on repak house by eads and counts and related to the excavation services performed by at repak son gym.counts,and charged repak with violations of the hobbs act,a,for knowing obstruction,delay,or effect on commerce by extortion through the solicitation and receipt of goods and services,which were not due him or his office,and to which he was not entitled,in exchange for his official action and influence as the executive director of the jra to facilitate the award of jra contracting work.counts,and charged repak with violations of the federal program bribery statute,a b,alleging that he did corruptly solicit,demand,accept,and agree to accept something of value,intending to be influenced and rewarded in connection with jra business,specifically that repak respectively solicited and obtained goods and services in exchange for his official actions and influence as the executive director of the jra.
before trial,the district court decided two motions in limine filed by the government that were relevant to repak appeal.first,repak challenged the admission of evidence of solicitations and items he received beyond those items charged in the indictment evidence.the district court allowed the government to introduce the evidence,determining that the evidence was admissible to prove repak mental state for the charged offenses.see united states repak,wl,at.july.second,repak challenged the admission of evidence of an affair he had with walter under rule of the federal rules of evidence.following briefing on the issue,the district court permitted admission of the affair evidence,concluding the affair was relevant to repak mental state and would further assist the jury in assessing walter credibility when she testified.see.
at trial,the parties jointly proposed and,with limited exceptions not relevant here,agreed to jury instructions.the district court later read those instructions to the jury.the instructions informed the jury of the elements of the two charged offenses violations of the hobbs act and the federal program bribery statute.the elements of a hobbs act violation were defined as follows 
first,that the defendant took from the three jra contractors the property described in counts,and.second,that the defendant did so knowingly and willfully by extortion under color of official right.third,that as a result of defendant actions interstate commerce was obstructed,delayed,or affected.
the elements of federal program bribery were defined as 
first,that at the time alleged in the indictment defendant was an agent of the jra.second,that the jra received federal benefits in excess of in a period.third,that defendant solicited and accepted something of value from the three jra contractors.fourth,that defendant acted corruptly with the intent to be influenced or rewarded in connection with the business and transactions of the jra.
repak main defense to the charges at trial was that he lacked the requisite mental state in accepting any items to influence the awarding of jra contracts.
the jury convicted repak on counts through,the hobbs act and federal program bribery charges involving the roof on repak house and the excavating services for his son gym.the district court sentenced repak to months of incarceration on each count of conviction,with the sentences to run concurrently.the district court also ordered repak to pay restitution to eads in the amount of and to in the amount of.repak timely appealed his judgment of conviction and sentence 
the district court had jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to because this case involves an offense against the laws of the united states.we have jurisdiction over the appeal under.
on appeal,repak raises six arguments related to the district court evidentiary rulings,the jury instructions,the sufficiency of trial evidence,and the prosecutor conduct during closing arguments.we conclude that none are meritorious.
repak first contention is that,under rule b of the federal rules of evidence,the district court improperly admitted evidence of his solicitations of items from jra contractors beyond those charged in the indictment.we review the district court evidentiary ruling for abuse of discretion,united states friedman,cir.citing united states starnes,cir,but also exercise plenary review to the extent the rulings are based on a legal interpretation of the federal rules of evidence,complaint of consolidation coal,cir.
rule b states evidence of a crime,wrong,or other act is not admissible to prove a person character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.fed.evid.b.while generally excluding evidence of an individual other acts to show that individual propensity to behave in a certain manner,rule b permits admission of evidence for another purpose,such as proving motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,absence of mistake,or lack of accident.fed.evid.b.
rule b is a rule of general exclusion united states caldwell,cir.see also united states brown,cir.rule b is generally a rule of exclusion.that is,rule b directs that evidence of prior bad acts be excluded unless the proponent can demonstrate that the evidence is admissible for a purpose.caldwell,at.we clarified in caldwell that this court past description of rule b as inclusionary,see,united states cruz,cir,referred to rule b language allowing evidence to be used for any purpose other than to show propensity,fed.evid.b.see caldwell,at.that is,our prior reference to rule b as inclusionary merely reiterate d the drafters decision to not restrict the uses of evidence.id.we used that language because,prior to rule b,the corresponding common law rule for evidence limited the uses of such evidence.see united states green,cir.rule b altered the common law rule with inclusionary language,allowing the proponent of evidence to identify any purpose and no longer requiring the proponent to pigeonhole his evidence into one of the established exceptions,on pain of exclusion.id.in sum,rule b is a rule of exclusion,meaning that it excludes evidence unless the proponent can demonstrate its admissibility,but it is also inclusive in that it does not limit the purposes for which evidence can be admitted.
because rule b is a rule of general exclusion,the party seeking to admit evidence has the burden of demonstrating the evidence applicability.caldwell,at.admissibility under rule b requires the satisfaction of four distinct steps the evidence must be proffered for a purpose that evidence must be relevant to the identified purpose its probative value must not be substantially outweighed by its potential for causing unfair prejudice to the defendant and if requested,the evidence must be accompanied by a limiting instruction.see huddleston united states,caldwell,at.
the government here sought to introduce evidence of repak business relationships with vendors of the jra,which specifically include d instances of other uncharged acts of solicitations by repak to jra vendors,including but not limited to kimball,eads,and.without further explanation,the government contended in its motion in limine that repak prior course of conduct and business with the named entities,including previous solicitations,was extremely relevant and would go directly to prove repak knowledge and corrupt intent.the prosecution also argued that the uncharged acts of solicitation were admissible under rule b as background evidence to complete the story and provide context.
the district court permitted introduction of the proffered evidence.in relevant part,the district court reasoned 
t he court finds that the rule b evidence that the government intends to introduce is admissible.defendant business dealings with the various vendors,including other instances of solicitations that were not charged in the indictment in this case,are relevant to showing a necessary element of the crimes charged in this case.specifically,these business dealings and other solicitations will be used by the government to establish defendant knowledge as to the charges of extortion under color of official right and his willful intent as to the charges of solicitation by a bribe.thus,the other acts evidence is being introduced for a proper evidentiary purpose and not as propensity evidence.the government intends to introduce other act evidence to develop examples of solicitations during the course of defendant business transactions with various entities,and for which defendant acted with the requisite corrupt intent and knowledge.likewise,the government evidence of other solicitations is relevant under rule to establish necessary elements of the crimes charged in this case.the government has presented a sufficient chain of inferences connecting these other acts to material facts in this case without implicating the evidentiary rules prohibition of using propensity evidence.furthermore,this evidence satisfies the balancing requirements of rule.the other act evidence to be introduced by the government is probative of facts in this case and that probative value is not substantially outweighed by any unfair prejudice.finally,in accordance with the law on this issue,the court will provide a limiting instruction as necessary.
repak challenges the sufficiency of the district court rule b analysis,arguing that the district court failed to properly explain how the uncharged acts of solicitation relate to a purpose and the district court erred by not properly scrutinizing the evidence prejudicial effect vis its probative value.we agree with repak that the district court analysis was lacking but conclude that,under a proper rule b analysis,the government evidence was admissible.
we proceed by critically analyzing each of the four steps in the methodological process for determining admissibility under rule b.
the government and district court satisfied step one of the applicable rule b analysis,properly identifying a purpose for introducing repak other past solicitations knowledge and intent see brown,at caldwell,at.the plain text of rule b allows for the admission of evidence to show knowledge and intent as the government proffered here.see fed.evid.b noting that evidence may be admissible for proving intent and knowledge see also united states vega,cir.evidence of prior bad acts may be admitted for the purpose of demonstrating the defendant knowledge in the later offense with which he is charged.repak put his mental state at issue in this case.his knowledge and intent are elements of the two charged offenses.see a a b see also evans united states,concluding that,to show extortion under the hobbs act,the government must prove that a defendant obtained a payment knowing that the payment was made in return for official acts.repak contested those elements at trial,contending that he did not accept items from jra contractors with the intention of influencing the awarding of jra contracts.use of the uncharged solicitations to show repak mental state was a proper use of that evidence under rule b.
the government and district court,however,faltered at step two of the rule b analysis.both failed to explain how the government proffered evidence was relevant to repak mental state.see caldwell,at evidence must be relevant to a purpose.nonetheless,the admission of this evidence was proper because it was relevant to that purpose.
to be relevant,proffered evidence must fit into a chain of inferences a chain that connects the evidence to a proper purpose,no link of which is a forbidden propensity inference.united states davis,cir.t his chain must be articulated with careful precision because,even when a purpose is at issue in a case,the evidence offered may be completely irrelevant to that purpose,or relevant only in an impermissible way.caldwell,at.
we have recently reiterated the importance of concretely connecting the proffered evidence to a purpose.in united states caldwell,we rejected the use of prior gun possession convictions to show a defendant knowledge that he actually possessed a gun.id.at.testimony at trial demonstrated that the defendant was seen carrying the gun,and yet the government proceeded to introduce the defendant prior gun possession convictions to show his actual possession of the charged gun.id.at.because the government proceeded solely on a theory of actual possession,we held that the defendant knowledge was not at issue in the case.id.a bsent unusual circumstances such as when a defendant claims he did not realize the object in his hand was a gun,the knowledge element in a case will necessarily be satisfied if the jury finds the defendant physically possessed the firearm.we reached that conclusion because we could observe no articulation by the government of a logical chain of inferences showing how the defendant prior convictions were relevant to show the purpose of knowledge.id.at.rather,the government there simply relied on ipse dixit,stating the baseline position that the evidence of the defendant prior gun convictions was generally relevant to show the defendant knowledge that he possessed the gun related to the charged offense.id.that baseline position told us nothing about how the evidence helped established the defendant knowledge.id.we further observed that the district court in caldwell likewise failed to articulate how the disputed evidence tend ed to show that the defendant knowingly possessed the gun related to the charged gun possession.id.in doing so,we emphasize d that it is not enough to merely recite a rule b purpose that is at issue the court must articulate how the evidence is probative of that purpose.id.at.in summary,caldwell makes clear that a logical chain of inferences must be articulated so that we are assure d that the evidence is not susceptible to being used improperly by the jury.id.
similarly,in united states brown,cir,we rebuffed the government efforts to introduce evidence of a defendant previous use of straw purchasers to buy guns to show that the defendant had knowledge that he was in a car with a gun.id.at.as in caldwell,we began by noting the complete lack of an explanation by the government for how its evidence was relevant to its proffered purpose.see id.at the government has completely failed to explain how the fact that the defendant used a straw man in to purchase firearms tends to prove that he knowingly possessed the gun under the driver seat of the impala six years later.these are two entirely distinct acts,and participation in one has no relationship to the other.the government explanation was that the defendant prior use of a straw purchaser made it more likely that he used a straw purchaser to obtain the gun he was charged with possessing.id.that,we noted,was too great a leap in logic and indubitably forged the government chain of inferences with an impermissible propensity link.id.critically,the district court there also failed to explain sufficiently its basis for admitting the evidence.the district court stated simply that the government could use the evidence to show motive or knowledge and that type of thing along those lines.id.at citations omitted.we instructed that the district court should not merely inquire of the prosecution what it wishes the evidence to prove but rather put the government to the task of explaining how the evidence should work in the mind of a juror to establish the fact the government claims to be trying to prove.id.quotation marks and citations omitted.
the government proffer and district court explanation here fell short,failing to explain how evidence of uncharged solicitations would have a tendency to make repak knowledge and intent more probable in the mind of a juror.the question is whether the evidence of other uncharged solicitations by repak was relevant to show repak mental state as to the charged conduct solicitation of the roof and excavation services.in its motion in limine,the government merely stated,in cursory fashion,that repak prior course of conduct and business with the named entities,including previous solicitations,was extremely relevant and would go directly to prove repak knowledge and corrupt intent.as in caldwell and brown,the government failed to articulate a chain of inferences supporting the admission of repak uncharged solicitations.instead,the government stated only that a logical chain connecting the evidence to a purpose exists.that statement is not enough to demonstrate the admissibility of rule b evidence.the district court should have asked the government to explain how the proffered evidence should work in the mind of a juror to establish repak knowledge and intent related to the roof and excavation services.caldwell,at quoting united states miller,cir.
the district court analysis of the rule b admission is also wanting.as quoted above,the district court observed,defendant business dealings with the various vendors,including other instances of solicitations that were not charged in the indictment in this case,are relevant to showing a necessary element of the crimes charged in this case.it added that t he government ha d presented a sufficient chain of inferences connecting these other acts to material facts in this case.like the government explanation,this analysis is inexact and fails to adequately link the evidence to a purpose with careful precision.caldwell,at see also brown,at when confronted with a proffer under rule b,a district court should not merely inquire of the prosecution what it wishes the evidence to prove.in essence,this was the mere recitation of the purposes in rule b that we have previously deemed inadequate.caldwell,at.
despite the inexact nature of the government proffer and the district court rule b analysis,our review of the record leads us to conclude that the evidence of repak uncharged solicitations was properly admitted to prove repak mental state.although we strongly prefer that the government and district court provide the chain of inferences supporting the admission of evidence as this court has repeatedly required,we are able to discern that the chain exists here.repak repeatedly solicited and received items from jra contractors at great cost to the contractors the growing costs of these items to the jra contractors tends to show that repak knew that these items were not unilateral token gifts therefore,it is more likely that repak knowingly and intentionally accepted the roof and excavating services with an understanding that those items were to influence the award of jra contracts to those contractors this chain of inferences did not require the jury to make too great a leap in logic.brown,at.
that chain of inferences is not unfamiliar.in united states console,cir,we upheld the admission of evidence against two lawyers who conspired with a doctor to submit fraudulent medical bills to insurances companies.id.at.the evidence there showed that the lawyers also engaged in a similar scheme with doctors other than the doctor charged in the indictment.id.we reasoned that the evidence tended to support the finding that the lawyers knew the bills related to the charged conduct were fraudulent and that they intentionally submitted them to insurance companies as part of a broader plan to defraud insurance companies through fraudulent personal injury claims.id.at.for that reason,we permitted admission of the evidence under rule b.
in a recent similar case,we concluded that rule b allowed for the admission of evidence that a defendant the executive director of the legislature for the virgin islands received a kickback bribe from a third party.see united states willis,cir.much like the present case,the government alleged that the defendant received money from contractors in exchange for the defendant facilitating the award of certain renovation contracts to those same contractors.id.at.the government proffered evidence showing that,while he held a different government position,the defendant received money from an individual in exchange for lifting a lien on that individual bank account.id.at.the individual was one of the contractors connected to the charged conduct.id.the purpose for introducing that proffered evidence was to demonstrate that the defendant was not mistaken about the nature of the transactions involved in the renovation and fully intended to accept bribes and commit extortion.id.at.we determined that a strong nexus existed between the past bribe the defendant received and the charged conduct.id.more specifically,the earlier bribe demonstrated that the charged payments from contractors were not loans,that they were not gifts,and that the defendant intended to accept cash in exchange for handing out more government contract work.id.
much like in willis,the past solicitations here were closely related to the charged acts,and participation in one had a relationship to the other.brown,at.the government evidence of uncharged solicitations demonstrated repak course of conduct over a relatively circumscribed time period with the same actors involved in the charged conduct.that evidence thus tends to show that repak intended to accept the roof and excavating services in exchange for handing out more government contract work.willis,at.the evidence makes it more likely that repak did not unwittingly solicit and receive the roof and excavation services without knowing or intending that the services were meant to influence him in his role as the jra executive director.vega,at permitting use of rule b evidence related to prior conspiracy to show that the defendant did not unwittingly participate in the charged crime.therefore,while the government and district court failed to adequately connect the evidence to a purpose,a more fulsome examination demonstrates that the evidence was relevant to prove repak mental state.
the district court analysis also fell short at step three of the rule b analysis.that third step requires that evidence must not give rise to a danger of unfair prejudice that substantially outweighs the probative value of the evidence under rule of the federal rules of evidence.see brown,at.rule states the court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice.fed.evid.rule creates a presumption of admissibility.united states claxton,cir.evidence can not be excluded under rule merely because its unfairly prejudicial effect is greater than its probative value.rather,evidence can be kept out only if its unfairly prejudicial effect substantially outweigh s its probative value.united states cross,cir.alteration in original quoting fed.evid.nevertheless,district courts must undertake some analysis,provide meaningful balancing,when applying rule to determine the admissibility of rule b evidence.caldwell,at.we will reverse where the court reasoning is not apparent from the record.id.quoting united states smith,cir.
the balancing or lack thereof performed in caldwell is instructive.in caldwell,the district court stated what i want to say is that not only are the past convictions admissible under b,but because knowledge and intent are at issue here,they are more probative than prejudicial.i find that the probative value outweighs any prejudicial effect as well as to their admissibility.id.at.that analysis,we concluded,offered nothing more than a bare recitation of rule.id.the omission of any meaningful evaluation of the prejudicial effect of the rule b evidence failed to ensure that the probative value of the evidence was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.id.
the district court analysis here is strikingly similar to the recitation of rule we determined to be inadequate in caldwell.the district court stated simply that the evidence satisfies the balancing requirements of rule.in the following sentence,the district court simply reiterated its conclusion the other act evidence to be introduced by the government is probative of facts in this case and that probative value is not substantially outweighed by any unfair prejudice.id.although the government tendered its rule balancing when offering its evidence,the district court needed to provide its own rule balancing before admitting the evidence.an evaluation under rule is not meaningful if it merely states a bare conclusion.more is required.as the district court failed to offer its own reasoning,the district court balancing failed to provide meaningful evaluation of the government evidence of repak uncharged solicitations.caldwell,at.
that said,it is apparent from the record that the prejudicial effect of the government evidence does not substantially outweigh the probative value of that evidence.id.the probative value of repak past solicitations was significant.see willis,at upholding the admission of a past bribe as evidence tended to show that a government official did not perceive the bribe to be a loan or a gift vega,at permitting use of rule b evidence because that evidence tended to show that the defendant did not unwittingly participate in the charged crime console,at concluding that rule b evidence was relevant to show defendants knowledge and intent regarding the charged conduct.moreover,repak challenged the proof as to his knowledge and intent,making those elements of the charged offenses the centerpiece of the trial.caldwell,at t he probative value of prior act evidence is diminished where the defendant does not contest the fact for which supporting evidence has been offered.repak himself concedes that this evidence played a key role at trial and likely contributed to the government carrying its burden as to his mens rea.see reply br.a t trial the government repeatedly emphasized the b evidence.
that compelling probative value is not substantially outweighed by any prejudice arising from the admission of the uncharged solicitations.for one,as explained below,the district court provided a limiting instruction,mitigating any concern that the jury would have used this evidence to draw a propensity inference.see infra.we have no reason to believe the jury did not follow the limiting instruction.see united states newby,cir.w e presume that the jury will follow a curative instruction unless there is an overwhelming probability that the jury will be unable to follow it and a strong likelihood that the effect of the evidence would be devastating to the defendant.internal quotation marks and citations omitted quoting greer miller.second,any prejudice here does not compare to the heightened prejudicial impact identified in caldwell.at.there,we observed the heightened prejudice caused by the introduction of evidence when that evidence was admitted in the form of a prior criminal conviction,especially a prior conviction for the same crime as that being tried.id.in comparison,the government here introduced evidence of repak uncharged conduct.given that difference,the evidence of repak uncharged conduct was simply not of the same prejudicial ilk as the identical past convictions introduced in caldwell.
the district court application of rule to the government evidence lacked the rigor this court requires.yet in our application of proper rule scrutiny,we conclude than any danger of unfair prejudice resulting from admission of repak uncharged solicitations fails to substantially outweigh the probative value of those solicitations.
finally,the district court dutifully performed the fourth step of the rule b analysis,appropriately providing limiting instructions for the evidence as requested by repak.as we have held,the district court must provide the jury with a limiting instruction,if requested,advis ing the jury that the evidence is admissible for a limited purpose and may not be considered in another manner.caldwell,at see also brown,at.here,the district court provided two limiting instructions.during the trial,the district court advised the jury that 
t his evidence of other acts,in other words,acts that are not charged in the indictment,was admitted only for limited purposes.you may only consider this evidence for the purpose of deciding whether the defendant had the state of mind,knowledge,or intent necessary to commit the crimes charged in the indictment.
at the close of the evidence,the district court instructed,the evidence of other acts was admitted for limited purposes.you may consider this evidence only for the purpose of deciding whether the defendant had the knowledge or intent necessary to commit the crimes charged in the indictment.the district court thus satisfied step four in providing a limiting instruction on the jury use of the rule b evidence.
we agree with repak that the government and district court failed to adequately explain the basis for admitting the evidence under rule b.nevertheless,under a proper rule b inquiry,the evidence of repak uncharged solicitations was admissible.
repak contends that the admission of evidence regarding his affair with his assistant,debbie walter,was an error under rule of the federal rules of evidence.this court reviews the district court admission for abuse of discretion.see united states bailey,cir.
as noted above,rule states the court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice.fed.evid.we have observed 
rule does not provide a shield for defendants who engage in outrageous acts,permitting only the crimes of caspar milquetoasts to be described fully to a jury.it does not generally require the government to sanitize its case,to deflate its witnesses testimony,or to tell its story in a monotone.
cross,at quoting united states gartmon,cir.thus,a district court need only keep out evidence if its unfairly prejudicial effect substantially outweigh s its probative value.id.at.
in briefing before the district court,repak contended that his affair with walter was irrelevant to the charges in the indictment or simply prejudicial.in response,the government explained that the affair put walter actions and testimony into context,squarely addresse d facts at issue,whether or not solicitations and receipt of items occurred as charged,and impacted walter credibility.the district court ruled that,while prejudicial,evidence of the affair was also highly probative.according to the district court,the affair was relevant to the government burden of showing defendant mental state regarding the crimes charged.as an example,the district court observed that witnesses will testify that solicitations by defendant were made to benefit walter because she was his paramour,thus demonstrating a motive for certain solicitations.id.it also accepted the government argument that the affair would assist the jury in assessing walter credibility.
repak argument on appeal is but straightforward.he contends that evidence of his affair was not relevant and that the prejudice created by its admission substantially outweighed whatever probative value that evidence has.repak arguments are ultimately unpersuasive.the district court reasonably exercised its discretion to admit the affair evidence.see united states universal rehab.servs.pa,cir.if judicial is ever desirable,it is when a rule analysis of a trial court is reviewed by an appellate tribunal.quoting united states long,cir.
the government elicited testimony from multiple jra contractors regarding requests for items coming directly from walter.see.those contractors also testified that they would buy items for walter at repak request.see.one contractor affirmed that he had knowledge of the affair while the solicitations were occurring,and another knew that giving walter items would make repak happy.for her part,walter admitted that she had a romantic relationship with repak.she also testified that she would occasionally email repak requests for items to jra contractors.she stated that she would make these requests because of both her business and personal relationship with repak.finally,repak himself admitted to the affair.
given this legal and factual background,the evidence of repak affair was relevant.see fed.evid.for one,testimony of the affair tended to show that repak possessed the requisite mens rea when obtaining items from the jra contractors.more specifically,the evidence may have explained repak motivation in making certain requests.see,walter testifying that she asked repak to get tickets to a tony bennett performance.evidence of the affair may also have shown that repak knew the items were given to walter to please him and thereby garner contracts for the jra contractors.see stating that items were provided for walter because she was repak assistant and with him constantly and was involved with all their projects the same united states scarfo,cir.permitting admission of evidence describing witnesses relationship to the defendants to illustrate the witnesses role in the criminal acts.second,the affair evidence assisted the jury in assessing walter credibility.her credibility was at issue when it came to her testimony about the requests she made for repak,repak views about the gratuities policy enacted by the jra,and the reasons she was willing to help repak make those requests.as we have unequivocally held,evidence concerning a witness credibility is always relevant,because credibility is always at issue.green,at.the affair evidence was unquestionably relevant.
while relevant,the affair evidence likely caused some prejudice to repak.the record,however,fails to demonstrate that that prejudice was unfair or that it substantially outweighed the evidence probative value.the affair evidence was hardly a main feature of the trial the testimony outlined above constitutes the entirety of the testimony regarding the affair.in short,trial testimony regarding the affair was not belabored it simply advised the jury of the personal relationship between repak and walter for the permissible purposes mentioned above.
thus,given the probative value of the affair evidence and the limited nature of its prejudicial effect,the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting that evidence.see united states lee,cir.observing that district courts are owed substantial deference in weighing evidence under rule.
repak next challenges the sufficiency of the trial evidence underlying his convictions.we exercise plenary review over a district court grant or denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal based on the sufficiency of the evidence,applying the same standard as the district court.starnes,at.in reviewing a jury verdict for sufficiency of the evidence,we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and affirm the judgment if there is substantial evidence from which any rational trier of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.united states iglesias,cir.internal quotation marks and citations omitted quoting united states lore,cir.this standard is highly deferential.united states,cir.en banc.we must be ever vigilant not to usurp the role of the jury by weighing credibility and assigning weight to the evidence,or by substituting our judgment for that of the jury.id.alteration in original quoting united states brodie,cir.
repak makes two arguments against his convictions on counts and,charging violations of the hobbs act.first,repak contends that there is no evidence he received the roof and excavation services for his agreement to influence official acts.second,repak maintains that the award of jra contracts is not an official act under as interpreted by the supreme court in mcdonnell united states.we conclude that the trial evidence was sufficient to permit a rational trier of fact to find repak guilty of both counts beyond a reasonable doubt.
repak contention that there is no evidence of an agreement to influence official jra actions is wrong on the law and contrary to the record.when proving a violation of,the government does not have to show the defendant had an express agreement.united states bradley,cir.t he government need only show that a public official has obtained a payment to which he was not entitled,knowing that the payment was made in return for official acts.evans,at.put differently,it is sufficient if the public official understands that he is expected,as a result of the payment,to exercise particular kinds of influence or to do certain things connected with his office as specific opportunities arise.bradley,at quoting jury instructions.the instructions the district court provided to the jury here mirrored the language from that case law 
the government is not required to prove an explicit promise to perform the official acts in return for the payment.passive acceptance of a benefit by a public official is a sufficient basis for this type of extortion if the official knows that he is being offered payment in exchange for his ability to do official acts.
therefore,repak contention that the government failed to demonstrate an agreement is unpersuasive.
while the government need not show an agreement,it does need to demonstrate repak acceptance of the roof and excavating services knowing that they were given in exchange for his influencing the award of jra contracts.rarely will the sort of knowledge the government charged repak with be reflected in a written agreement,nor does the government need to produce such a document.see bradley,at.rather,the government need only rely on circumstantial evidence.id.at.the government did so here.
at trial,jra contractors testified to the unspoken understanding between themselves and repak.explaining why eads provided repak with free services,eads employee stephen sewalk testified i f we did follow repak instructions,i felt that we would lose work.that view was based on more than intuition.repak would tell sewalk,hey,i reviewing some invoice here of yours,which was usually followed up with some type of request.see also recalling that repak would threaten that he would find someone else who would be willing to fulfill his demands repak provided a lot of,i said innuendos,subtle things throughout conversations.and then it would always be followed in a short period of time by either an instruction or request.w ith him,instructions and requests were the same thing.employee rick mcnulty similarly explained that providing free services and items to repak was simply part of doing business with the jra and repak.he reached this conclusion following messages from repak telling mcnulty that repak need ed certain items from and followup calls from repak to mcnulty asking why items had not yet been provided.putting a finer point on his testimony,mcnulty stated that he knew that if he did provide those services,it would be a problem from a work aspect.
as the old adage goes,actions often speak louder than words.here,the actions of the jra contractors spoke volumes about their understanding with repak.eads provided repak with a new roof,bearing to in costs.after receiving the new roof,repak told sewalk to bury eads expenses in an invoice to the jra.sewalk testified that he knew his company would not get more work from the jra if it required repak to pay for his roof.similarly,provided repak with excavating services for his son gym,at a cost of to.echoing sewalk testimony,mcnulty stated that when he asked repak who he should invoice for the excavating services,repak told him to just bury it in invoices to the jra.this evidence was more than sufficient to show that repak obtained the roof and excavating services,knowing that the payment was made in return for official acts.evans,at.
viewing that evidence in the light most favorable to the government,a rational jury could have convicted repak of the hobbs act charges.see bradley,at observing that knowing winks and nods demonstrating a mutual understanding with a public official was sufficient for conviction under quoting evans,at kennedy,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
repak second contention regarding counts and,relying on mcdonnell united states,is equally unpersuasive.
in mcdonnell,the supreme court vacated convictions under because jury instructions in that case improperly defined official act.at.pursuant to,a criminal offense occurs when an individual obstructs,delays,or affects commerce by extortion,with extortion defined as the obtaining of property of another,with his consent,under color of official right.a,b.the parties in mcdonnell agreed that extortion under color of official right under included the element of obtaining property knowing the property was given in return for official action.at.the parties further agreed that official action should be given the same meaning those words have in the federal bribery statute,a.id.
section a of the federal bribery statute defines an official act as any decision or action on any question,matter,cause,suit,proceeding or controversy,which may at any time be pending,or which may by law be brought before any public official,in such official official capacity,or in such official place of trust or profit.a.the supreme court held that proving an official act requires a showing.mcdonnell,at.
first,the government must identify a question,matter,cause,suit,proceeding or controversy that may at any time be pending or may by law be brought before a public official.id.quoting a.the supreme court made two key clarifications as to this required showing.first,the court defined a question or matter as similar in nature to a cause,suit,proceeding,or controversy.id.at.the court further clarified that the question or matter must involve a formal exercise of governmental power that is similar in nature to a lawsuit before a court,a determination before an agency,or a hearing before a committee.id.at.second,the court observed that the question or matter must also be something specific and focused that is pending or may by law be brought.id.it described a question or matter that is pending as something that is relatively circumscribed the kind of thing that can be put on an agenda,tracked for progress,and then checked off as complete.id.at.
the second part of the showing to prove an official act requires the government to demonstrate that the public official made a decision or took an action on that question,matter,cause,suit,proceeding,or controversy,or agreed to do so.id.at.providing some contour to that requirement,the court observed that if a public official uses his official position to provide advice to another official,knowing or intending that such advice will form the basis for an official act by another official,that too can qualify as a decision or action.id.at.by way of example,the court noted that a decision or action to initiate a research study would sufficiently constitute a decision or action on a question or matter.united states growers of,observing that the hosting of a championship sports team by the president of the united states would not constitute an official act.
as in mcdonnell,the parties here agreed to instructions,read to the jury,which defined extortion under color of official right to mean that a public official induced,obtained,accepted,or agreed to accept a payment to which he or she was not entitled,knowing that the payment was made in return for taking,withholding,or influencing official acts.emphasis added.the instructions also required that the official acts be pending before a government agency.the parties do not dispute that the definition of official acts comes from a of the federal bribery statute.
repak insists that the trial evidence of his facilitating the award of jra contracts failed to demonstrate an official act,as defined in mcdonnell,because that evidence did not demonstrate a question or matter akin to a lawsuit before a court,a determination before an agency,or a hearing before a committee and something specific and focused that is pending or may by law be brought before a public official.at.
repak first mcdonnell argument is off the mark.the awarding of a jra contract is not only akin to an agency determination it is an agency determination.the supreme court in mcdonnell concluded that a revitalization commission allocation of grant money was not only a sufficiently focused and concrete matter but also involve d a formal exercise of governmental power that is similar in nature to a lawsuit,administrative determination,or hearing.id.at.as in mcdonnell,a decision by the jra a governmental agency to award money to contractors as part of its public mission to develop johnstown infrastructure is undoubtedly the formal exercise of governmental power.id.at.it is,plainly,an agency determination.
repak second mcdonnell argument,that the award of jra contracts is not a specific and focused question or matter that is pending,is likewise unpersuasive.id.in mcdonnell,the government argued that the focus of an event hosted by the defendant was economic development and that economic development was sufficiently narrow under a.id.the supreme court in mcdonnell,however,concluded that economic development is not specific and focused.id.at.in doing so,the court reasoned that economic development is not naturally described as a matter pending any more than justice is pending or may be brought by law before a judge,or national security is pending or may be brought by law before an officer of the armed forces.id.at.it noted,though,that a revitalization commission decision to allocate grant money would be a focused and concrete matter.id.at.
in the language of mcdonnell,the award of jra contracts is specific and focused.it is a concrete determination made by the jra board of directors and the kind of thing that can be put on an agenda,tracked for progress,and then checked off as complete.id.at.it is something within the specific duties of an official position the function conferred by the authority of his office.id.the jra and its board of directors were undisputedly tasked with the responsibility of awarding contracts.the jra received federal funds and,among other obligations,was responsible to distribute those funds,to provide for the engineering,and procurement of construction related to redevelopment projects.as part of that process,and in his capacity as jra executive director,repak made recommendations to the jra board of directors as to which contractors should be used on specific projects.the assigning of contractors to jra projects can thus naturally be described as a matter pending before the jra,unlike the nebulous issue of economic development in mcdonnell.at.
implicit in both of repak arguments under mcdonnell is the suggestion that the facilitation of the award of those contracts is not a decision or action on a question or matter.the supreme court held in mcdonnell that an action on a question or matter includes a public official use of his position to exert pressure on another official or provide advice,knowing or intending that such advice form the basis for an official act.id.at.as demonstrated by the record here,repak had the power to,and indeed did,make recommendations to the jra as to the contractors it hired for projects.the evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that he accepted the roof and excavating services knowing that he was to use his power,the ability to provide advice,to influence the jra awarding of contracts.
therefore,the facilitation of the award of jra contracts is an official act as defined by mcdonnell.evidence of repak receipt of items knowing he was to facilitate the award of those contracts provided a sufficient basis for a rational trier of fact to convict him of the hobbs act charges under counts and.
as to counts and related to,repak argues that the trial evidence insufficiently demonstrated that he possessed the corrupt intent to be influenced by the roof and excavating services he received.again,repak is incorrect.a rational trier of fact could find the requisite intent beyond a reasonable doubt.
as outlined above,the jra contractors testified to an unspoken but certain understanding between themselves and repak under which they would provide repak with items of value usually items he specifically requested and repak would influence the award of jra contracts.the statements attributed to repak at trial repeatedly suggested as much,and his continued receipt of items from those contractors further demonstrated that he intended for such items the costs for which he instructed be buried in jra invoices to influence the award of jra contracts to those contractors.in sum,when viewed in the light most favorable to the government,the record demonstrates more than enough evidence for a rational trier of fact to conclude,beyond a reasonable doubt,that repak possessed the requisite intent to convict him on the charges.united states andrews,cir.concluding that the trial evidence sufficiently demonstrated the defendant intent to have a public official influence government action under.
repak also argues that the district court provided the jury with erroneous instructions.more precisely,he contends that the instructions related to the hobbs act counts and and the federal program bribery statute counts and failed to properly advise the jury of the elements of the offenses charged.the parties agree that plain error review applies.see united states zehrbach,cir.where a party has not made a clear,specific objection to the charge that he alleges is erroneous at trial,he waives the issue on appeal unless the error was so fundamental and highly prejudicial as to constitute plain error.quoting bennis gable,cir.b efore an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial,there must be error,that is plain,and that affects substantial rights.johnson united states,quoting united states olano.a n error affects substantial rights when it affected the outcome of the lower court proceedings.gov t of the mills,cir.second alteration in original quoting united states marcus.it is a rare case in which an improper instruction will justify reversal of a criminal conviction when no objection has been made in the trial court.united states disalvo,cir.quoting henderson kibbe.
although repak fails to state the underlying legal basis for his jury instruction challenge,we have held 
due process requires that the government prove every element of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt.accordingly,jury instructions that relieve the government of this burden violate a defendant due process rights.carella california.the inquiry is whether the court instruction constituted a mandatory presumption by directly foreclos ing independent jury consideration of whether the facts proved established certain elements of the offense with which the defendant was charged.id.at.
united states korey,cir.citation omitted.in making this inquiry,the j ury instructions must be read as a whole.united states flores,cir.quoting eeoc.dep t of health soc,cir.jury instructions satisfy due process if the charge as a whole fairly and adequately submits the issues in the case to the jury.united states thayer,cir.quoting zehrbach,at.
repak first challenges the instructions associated with counts and,which charged violations of.in relevant part,the jury instructions read 
count of the indictment charges that repak did knowingly obstruct,delay,and affect commerce and the movement of articles and commodities in commerce by extortion,as those terms are defined in.that is,repak,while executive director of the jra engaged in a course of conduct whereby he solicited and obtained from eads,with eads consent,a new roof on the personal residence of repak,which was not due to him or his office and to which he was not entitled,in exchange for his official action and influence as the executive director of the jra,to facilitate the award of jra contracting work to eads,all under color of official right and all in violation of.
count of the indictment charges that repak did knowingly obstruct,delay,and affect commerce and the movement of articles and commodities in commerce by extortion,as those terms are defined in.that is,repak,while executive director of the jra engaged in a course of conduct whereby he solicited and obtained from,with consent,building demolition and grading services at evolution gym,which was not due to him or his office and to which he was not entitled,in exchange for his official action and influence as the executive director of the jra,to facilitate the award of jra contracting work to,all under color of official right and all in violation of.
the instructions then state that an element of is that the defendant did knowingly and willfully by extortion under color of official right obtain property from the jra contractors.the instructions go on to define extortion under color of official right,defining the phrase to mean that a public official induced,obtained,accepted,or agreed to accept a payment to which he or she was not entitled,knowing that the payment was made in return for taking,withholding,or influencing official acts.
repak advances two arguments regarding those instructions.first,he contends that the jury instructions allowed the jury to convict him for any official acts,without limiting the focus to only his facilitation of the award of jra contracts.second,he argues that even if the indictment did not broaden the allowable official acts of which he could be convicted,the district court failed to inform the jury that it must determine whether the facilitation of the award of jra contracts is an official act.neither argument carries the day.
as to repak first argument,he fails to identify any other official act on which he could have been convicted,and,in doing so,fails to explain how he could have been convicted of official acts other than his facilitation of the award of jra contracts.and review of the record reveals no other official act evidence presented by the government.indeed,the government only theory at trial was that repak accepted the roof and excavating services knowing that he was expected to facilitate the award of jra contracts to eads and.
repak second challenge to the instructions fares no better.the district court instructions charged the jury with how it might find that repak committed extortion under color of official right and defined that extortion to include the influencing of official acts.the instructions go even further by identifying the official act as facilitat ing the award of jra contracting work.thus,contrary to repak contention,the instructions were sufficient in requiring the jury to determine whether the facilitation of the award of jra contracts constituted an official act.
reading the jury instructions as a whole,we believe those instructions fairly and adequately submit ed to the jury the issue of whether facilitating the award of jra contracts constituted an official act.thayer,at.
with regard to counts and,which charged violations of,repak again argues that the jury instructions broadened the conduct that he could be convicted of,beyond just the facilitation of the award of jra contracts.he specifically takes issue with the following language from the instructions the fourth element the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that repak accepted or agreed to accept,or solicited something of value corruptly,and with the intent to be influenced or rewarded in connection with some business or transaction of the jra.emphasis added.according to repak,that instruction permitted the jury to convict him of influencing any jra business or transaction,not merely the award of jra contracts.
reading those instructions as a whole,we conclude that the instructions did not violate repak due process rights.in summarizing the charges against repak,the district court stated 
count of the indictment charges that repak did corruptly solicit,demand,accept,and agree to accept something of value,intending to be influenced and rewarded in connection with the business transaction and series of transactions of the jra that is,repak solicited and obtained a new roof on his personal residence in exchange for his official actions and influence as the executive director of the jra,to facilitate the award of contracting work to eads.
count of the indictment charges that repak did corruptly solicit,demand,accept,and agree to accept something of value,intending to be influenced and rewarded in connection with the business transaction and series of transactions of the jra that is,repak solicited and obtained building demolition and grading services at his son gym in exchange for his official actions and influence as the executive director of the jra,to facilitate the award of contracting work to.
those instructions thus specifically identify the business or transaction the government charged repak with influencing the award of jra contracting work.id.moreover,as with the charges under,repak fails to identify any other jra business or transactions in the trial evidence that could have supported a conviction.again,the government only theory at trial was that repak received a roof and excavating services from eads and,respectively,to facilitate the grant of jra contracts.the instructions related to,therefore,as a whole fairly and adequately submit ed the issues in the case to the jury.thayer,at quoting zehrbach,at.
repak also asserts that reversal is called for because the indictment charging him was constructively amended.we exercise plenary review in determining whether there was a constructive amendment of the indictment,but,inasmuch as repak did not raise the constructive amendment in the district court we consider the issue on a plain error basis.united states daraio,cir.
in united states daraio,we described the circumstances under which constructive amendment of an indictment occurs 
an indictment is constructively amended when,in the absence of a formal amendment,the evidence and jury instructions at trial modify essential terms of the charged offense in such a way that there is a substantial likelihood that the jury may have convicted the defendant for an offense differing from the offense the indictment returned by the grand jury actually charged.
id.at.the key inquiry is whether the defendant was convicted of the same conduct for which he was indicted.id.at quoting united states,cir.if a defendant is convicted of the same offense that was charged in the indictment,there is no constructive amendment.united states vosburgh,cir.
repackaging his earlier challenge to his jury instructions,repak contends that his indictment was constructively amended such that he could have been convicted for facilitating any official act under the hobbs act,counts and,and i
