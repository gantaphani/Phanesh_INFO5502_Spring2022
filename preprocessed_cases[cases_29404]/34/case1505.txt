michael jerome palmer appeals the district court denial of his motion to suppress drug and firearm evidence seized by police officers during a traffic stop in chesapeake,virginia.the court conducted an evidentiary hearing and,in early may,rendered its ruling in favor of the government.as explained below,we are satisfied that the officers did not contravene the fourth amendment and thus affirm.
in april,the federal grand jury in norfolk,virginia,indicted palmer on two offenses possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine,in contravention of a and being a felon in possession of a firearm,in violation of g.palmer moved to suppress the drug and firearm evidence underlying the charges,which chesapeake officers had seized during the october traffic stop of a vehicle driven by palmer.in may,the district court denied palmer suppression motion.see united states palmer,cr.may,ecf the opinion.in june,palmer pleaded guilty to both offenses in the indictment,but reserved the right to appeal the suppression ruling.in september,the court sentenced him to months in prison.palmer timely noted this appeal,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
because the district court denied palmer motion to suppress,we recount the facts in the light most favorable to the government.see united states watson,cir.on october,officer ring of the chesapeake police was patrolling that city ipswich neighborhood.during his patrol,ring stopped palmer,who was driving a silver nissan altima,on paramont avenue.when ring exited his patrol car and greeted palmer through the window of the nissan,he smelled an overwhelming odor of air freshener.he saw at least five air fresheners inside the car,some hanging in the passenger compartment and others plugged into the vents.ring advised palmer that he had been stopped because the nissan windows were too darkly tinted,in violation of state law,and also because the inspection sticker on the vehicle front windshield appeared fraudulent.ring then obtained palmer driver license and the vehicle registration card,and returned to his patrol car to make a database check.
from the driver license and registration officer ring learned that palmer listed a box as his address and that the nissan was registered to a woman who was not present.within minutes of beginning the database check,ring also learned that palmer was a suspected member of a gang called the bounty hunter bloods,according to a caution notice issued by the nearby norfolk police department.see opinion.ring advised his colleague,officer blount who was also on the scene of palmer purported gang affiliation,and asked blount about the availability of a drug dog.
officer ring also sought information on palmer from another database called linx.ring could not initially log into the linx system because his former partner had changed the password.he eventually accessed linx,however about seven minutes into the traffic stop by utilizing officer blount login credentials.as ring was logging into linx and searching its database,he called about a drug dog.ring relayed by radio the information that he had gathered palmer was nervous there was an overwhelming odor of air freshener from the nissan there were at least five air fresheners in the car palmer driver license address was a box,as opposed to a street address the nissan was registered to someone other than the driver and palmer was a suspected member of the bounty hunter bloods.
about eleven minutes into the traffic stop,officer ring identified palmer in linx.ring learned that palmer had a criminal record that included four arrests on drug charges plus an arrest for illegal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.as a result,ring radioed again about a drug dog,but was unable to confirm its availability.after completing his linx search,ring returned to the nissan from his patrol car.because he suspected the inspection sticker was fraudulent,ring decided to verify the sticker authenticity by looking at the back of it,which would enable him to determine whether it was legitimate.after asking palmer to exit the nissan,ring leaned through the open door and examined the back of the inspection sticker.while reading the sticker which he concluded was legitimate ring smelled marijuana.
officer ring immediately advised palmer that he had grounds to search the nissan.because ring wanted to be sure that the nissan contained drugs before searching the vehicle,however,he again checked on the drug dog availability.see opinion.at that point approximately seventeen minutes after the traffic stop had been initiated ring called officer duncan,who had a drug dog.about ten minutes later,duncan arrived with the drug dog boomer.duncan walked boomer around the nissan,and the dog alerted twice.
officers ring and duncan thereafter entered and searched the nissan.they discovered a clear plastic bag containing crack cocaine in the center front console and a caliber smith wesson pistol wedged between the driver seat and the console.as a result,palmer was arrested.after the search and arrest,ring measured the nissan window tint.those measurements confirmed ring initial suspicion that the nissan windows were illegally tinted 
on april,the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing on palmer suppression motion.during the hearing,officer ring the prosecution only witness recounted his actions and observations during the traffic stop.
officer ring explained that,before the traffic stop,he knew of numerous citizen complaints to the authorities about the sale and use of illegal drugs in the ipswich area.he also described his familiarity with virginia legal limits on window tinting and said that he could barely see into the vehicle that palmer was driving.see aside from the window tint,ring suspected that the nissan inspection sticker was illegal,based on his experience and having stopped numerous vehicles with fraudulent stickers.ring explained that he could not see the perforated portion that should be observable on a legitimate sticker.the back of a legitimate inspection sticker,he said,shows the perforated portion and contains information identifying the vehicle.
although it is understandable for any person to be nervous when interacting with the police,officer ring said that palmer appeared to be more nervous than normal during the traffic stop.see.specifically,ring observed that palmer was being overly cooperative but still very nervous in his demeanor.id.regarding palmer liberal use of air fresheners,ring explained that drug traffickers often use heavy air freshening to mask the pungent odor of marijuana.see id.at.ring also explained that drug traffickers often operate vehicles registered to others.that is so because,when the police apprehend a drug trafficker,they tend not to seize the vehicle if it is registered to someone not present.similarly,when ring was asked in light of the drug investigations in which he had participated whether a box on a driver license can be indicative of involvement in drug trafficking,he responded affirmatively.
officer ring also emphasized that he developed a concern for officer safety after learning of palmer suspected gang affiliation and prior criminal record.ring stated that c riminal street gangs are known for violence and that his department had received intelligence reports of threats against law enforcement specifically from the blood gang.see.ring explained that palmer history of multiple drug arrests,as well as his arrest for possessing a firearm as a convicted felon,caused ring to believe palmer would potentially still have a firearm on him.id.
according to officer ring,palmer was initially hesitant to get out of the nissan,and palmer had thereafter lingered near the vehicle front door until ring requested that he move to the car rear.shortly thereafter,while ring was inside the passenger compartment checking the inspection sticker,he smell ed the marijuana very faintly before his sense of smell was overwhelmed with the air freshener.see.ring confirmed that officer blount smelled marijuana as well.
officer ring made at least two other observations that strengthened his suspicion of criminal activity.first,palmer had two cell phones on his hip.see.according to ring,i t common for people who distribute narcotics to have more than one cell phone in their possession.id.he said that those involved in drug trafficking often rely on one phone to store contacts and pictures while utilizing the other phone to arrange drug deals.second,ring believed that palmer was seeking to divert suspicion from himself as they waited for officer duncan and the drug dog.palmer kept telling us that he helps the police and that he ha d a contact in the police department.see id.at.
as the hearing ended,the district court remarked that officer ring had presented to this court a very,very careful appearance,one of a person who is very seriously trying to abide by what the requirements of the law are.see.although it was inclined to believe that ring had acted lawfully,the court took the suppression motion under advisement.
on may,within a week of the evidentiary hearing,the district court filed its opinion denying the suppression motion the opinion concluded that officer ring had properly stopped the nissan,based on suspicions of a window tint violation and a fraudulent inspection sticker.the opinion explained that ring also possessed the reasonable,articulable suspicion of criminal activity necessary to extend the traffic stop,identifying eight supporting factors in that regard 
palmer was in a high crime area where citizens were complaining about drug dealing 
ring believed that the nissan windows were illegally tinted 
palmer was nervous 
the nissan emitted an overwhelming scent of air freshener from the multiple air fresheners 
palmer was a suspected member of a violent gang called the bounty hunter bloods 
palmer driver license listed a box address,rather than a residence 
palmer was driving a vehicle registered in another person name and 
palmer had a criminal record that included four previous arrests for narcotics charges as well as a charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.
see opinion.the opinion explained that those factors,when taken together,gave rise to reasonable suspicion because they eliminate d a substantial portion of innocent travelers and indicate d that criminal activity was afoot.id.that is,ring possessed the reasonable suspicion necessary to extend the stop beyond its original scope and duration as soon as he completed the computer checks.id.
the opinion also explained that officer ring had probable cause to search the vehicle when he first smelled marijuana and also after the drug dog alerted.without specifying whether ring entry to check the inspection sticker constituted a search of the nissan,the opinion concluded that ring had reasonable suspicion to investigate the inspection sticker authenticity,and that he had dispelled that suspicion by the least intrusive means in a short period of time.see opinion.ring detection of a marijuana odor while in the car,in turn,supplied ample cause for a search of the nissan.according to the opinion,the officers were also entitled to delay searching the vehicle and wait for a drug dog 
in sum,the opinion ruled that officer ring had made a legitimate traffic stop,that he had sound reasons for extending the stop,and that his subsequent actions did not violate the fourth amendment.palmer motion to suppress the evidence was therefore denied.the constitutionality of ring activities is the sole question preserved by palmer conditional guilty plea.
we review de novo a district court rulings with respect to reasonable suspicion and probable cause.see ornelas united states,d.absent clear error,we will not disturb factual findings made by a district court after an evidentiary hearing on suppression issues.see united states dire,cir.when a district court has denied a suppression motion,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.see united states watson,cir.
on appeal,palmer contends that officer ring did not have any objectively reasonable basis for initiating the traffic stop of the nissan,and that ring unreasonably expanded the scope of the stop shortly after it began.palmer also labels ring entry into the nissan to view the inspection sticker as constitutionally impermissible.the government counters that ring legitimately stopped palmer for suspected traffic violations,and that ring subsequent actions were consistent with the fourth amendment.
before assessing the parties contentions,we identify some pertinent legal principles.the fourth amendment guards against unreasonable searches and seizures.see const.amend.iv.a traffic stop is a seizure within the meaning of the fourth amendment and must be reasonable under the circumstances.see delaware prouse,d.in that regard,the courts assess the constitutionality of a traffic stop under the standard articulated in terry ohio,d.see arizona johnson,d.pursuant thereto,we first assess whether the articulated bases for the traffic stop were legitimate.see united states rusher,cir.second,we examine whether the actions of the authorities during the traffic stop were reasonably related in scope to the bases for the seizure.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
as the supreme court has explained,terry first prong is satisfied whenever it is lawful for police to detain an automobile and its occupants pending inquiry into a vehicular violation.see johnson,at.without question,such a violation may include failure to comply with traffic laws.see,united states green,cir concluding that windows illegally tinted under virginia law justif ied the stop united states digiovanni,cir observing that officer made traffic stop on basis of perceived violation of maryland law that prohibits following another vehicle too closely.
in assessing the legitimacy of a traffic stop,we do not attempt to discern an officer subjective intent for stopping the vehicle.see united states branch,cir.we simply ask whether the circumstances,viewed objectively,justify th e action.see whren united states,d internal quotation marks omitted united states johnson,cir observing that a traffic stop is legitimate when officers observe a traffic violation,regardless of their true,subjective motives for stopping the vehicle.
terry second prong restricts the range of permissible actions that a police officer may take after initiating a traffic stop.an officer is entitled to conduct checks that do not bear directly on the reasons for the stop,such as requesting a driver license and vehicle registration,or checking for criminal records and outstanding arrest warrants.see rodriguez united states,d.generally,however,an officer focus must remain on the bases for the traffic stop,in that the stop must be sufficiently limited in scope and duration to satisfy the conditions of an investigative seizure.see united states guijon ortiz,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
thus,when following up on the initial reasons for a traffic stop,the officer must employ the least intrusive means reasonably available to verify or dispel his suspicion in a short period of time.see digiovanni,at internal quotation marks omitted.to be clear,the law does not require that the officer employ the least intrusive means conceivable.see united states sharpe,d a creative judge engaged in post hoc evaluation of police conduct can almost always imagine some alternative means by which the objectives of the police might have been accomplished.if an officer acts unreasonably in attempting to confirm his suspicions during a traffic stop,however,he runs afoul of terry second prong.
relatedly,a legitimate traffic stop may become unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete its initial objectives.see illinois caballes,d.put differently,an officer can not investigate a matter outside the scope of the initial stop unless he receives the motorist consent or develops reasonable,articulable suspicion of ongoing criminal activity.see digiovanni,at.
reasonable suspicion is a commonsense,nontechnical standard that relies on the judgment of experienced law enforcement officers,not legal technicians.see ornelas united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.as we recently explained in united states williams,the artic
