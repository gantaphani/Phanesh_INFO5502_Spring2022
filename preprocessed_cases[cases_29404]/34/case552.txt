defendant edward pierre ran an illegal wholesale and retail drug distribution business in fall river,massachusetts.
in,pierre was convicted of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute the jury hung on a separate drug conspiracy count.the conspiracy count was retried in,and pierre was convicted of conspiring to distribute crack cocaine and cocaine.pierre and,michelle mickens,pled guilty and testified against pierre at both trials.pierre subsequently was sentenced to a term of imprisonment on the conspiracy charge,a term of imprisonment,which was to run concurrently,on the possession charge,and five years supervised release.the district court also entered a final order of forfeiture for against pierre.
pierre appeal relates primarily to the conspiracy conviction and the accompanying sentence,although he does assign error to the introduction of certain evidence at both the and trials and to his sentence on the possession count.he also claims that the district court forfeiture order was error.on appeal,we reject his myriad claims of error and affirm his convictions,his combined sentence,and the forfeiture order.
pierre and mickens were indicted on august,for conspiring to distribute cocaine base.on september,the grand jury returned a second superceding indictment charging pierre and mickens with conspiring with others,from at least april until september,to distribute fifty or more grams of crack and or more grams of cocaine,and charging pierre with possessing with intent to distribute or more grams of cocaine on or about july.a forfeiture count sought criminal forfeiture of the proceeds of the conspiracy,including and five pieces of jewelry.mickens pled guilty,while pierre went to trial.after a trial in december,a jury found pierre guilty of the possession count,but found that the quantity of drugs was less than grams.the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the conspiracy count.the conspiracy count was retried in april and may,and a jury found pierre guilty of the conspiracy count.in a special verdict form as to the forfeiture allegation,the jury found that at least and a pair of diamond earrings were proceeds of the drug conspiracy.
the facts in evidence at the conspiracy trial fairly establish the following.
pierre ran a drug business in fall river from at least april to september.during that time,pierre obtained cocaine from a source in brockton.he would then cook some of the cocaine into crack,and he would sell both crack and powder cocaine to customers in fall river and new bedford.pierre did not have a driver license,so he employed people to drive him back and forth to brockton and around fall river.in particular,mickens testified at trial that she chauffeured pierre,in addition to transporting drugs,collecting money,and selling crack for him.at the height of her involvement,mickens made retail sales of up to worth of crack per night at fall river bars and collected at least twice a week from pierre wholesale customers.among pierre biggest wholesale customers were members of the boyz,a gang that sold crack around the fifth street area of fall river 
mickens testified that pierre used the proceeds of his drug operation to buy more drugs,to pay his living expenses and those of mickens and the mother of his children,and to buy luxury items like expensive clothes and jewelry.in addition,pierre obtained at least seven cars for use in his drug business,all of which he registered to other people.mickens testimony was corroborated by motel,bank,and motor vehicle records,and by the testimony of paula costa,who bought crack from pierre,and fall river police officers.
ii.trial error claims 
pierre raises three claims of trial error and argues that each of the errors entitles him to a new trial.first,pierre argues that the district court constructively amended the indictment by admitting evidence of offenses not charged therein.next,he argues that in failing to suppress evidence of a particular drug seizure,the district court admitted evidence that violated pierre fourth amendment rights and that was unduly prejudicial and irrelevant.finally,pierre argues that the district court impermissibly admitted prior bad acts evidence.
constructive amendment of the indictment 
at both of pierre trials,mickens and several fall river police officers testified to an incident on april,at the old colony apartment complex,where pierre then resided.detective michael boutin testified that on that date he discovered a bag containing cocaine,a scale,and a bottle of inositol a substance used to cut cocaine and crack hidden behind a ceiling panel in the hallway of an old colony building.he and other officers seized the items in the bag,replaced them with items,and returned the bag to its hiding place.
the police officers then established surveillance at the site.officer scott paul testified that he saw pierre emerge from his apartment with a small.officer alan beausoliel testified that he saw pierre approach the location of the hidden items.although he could hear the ladder and ceiling tile being moved,officer beausoliel did not observe pierre remove the bag from the ceiling.officer paul observed pierre returning to his apartment with the.he then heard a thud and running.other officers spotted pierre running out of the building and fleeing in a car.a fingerprint lifted from the bottle of inositol later was matched to pierre.
mickens corroborated this account.she testified that pierre had told her that he had hidden cocaine and a scale in the ceiling of the building,and that when he returned to retrieve it,he noticed that a switch had been made.when he heard a noise and saw police,pierre had run out of the building and fled in a car driven by an associate named kennisen.
in addition,detective steven washington testified that within the two weeks before the old colony incident he and two other officers had observed pierre meeting with an individual by the name of noel lukenson the officers initially observed lukenson and pierre talking in a car parked on the street.pierre then left,and after entering and exiting a nearby building,lukenson began crawling on the ground,took up a divot of grass,and removed a large white bag from underneath the divot.lukenson then drove to old colony,picked up pierre,and drove to two fall river bars.at the first bar,a person entered the car and left within approximately two minutes.at the second bar,the officers observed pierre meeting with another man the man handed pierre money,and pierre then put his hand to his mouth,shook the other man hand,and left.
pierre argues that these two incidents were unrelated to the conspiracy charged in the indictment,and that by permitting testimony about them,the district court constructively amended the indictment.he argues that the indictment charged only a conspiracy between pierre,mickens,and the boyz.pierre position is that his supposed conspiracy with mickens and the boyz had nothing to do with the old colony incident or with any agreement he might have had with lukenson.rather,he argues,these incidents were evidence of an independent,uncharged conspiracy.in particular,he emphasizes that mickens did not know lukenson,and that there was no evidence connecting the boyz to lukenson.he argues that there is a possibility that his conviction rests upon an offense not charged by the grand jury,and that as a result he is entitled to reversal of his conviction.united states dunn,cir.
the government argues that pierre has not preserved his constructive amendment claim,and that our review is only for plain error.see united states decicco,cir.we bypass the forfeiture issue and rule on the merits.
constructive amendment of an indictment is prohibited in order to preserve the right of the person accused of a crime to have a grand jury vote on an indictment,to prevent reprosecution for the same offense,and to protect the right of the accused to be informed of the charges.united states vavlitis,cir.a constructive amendment occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are altered,either literally or in effect,by prosecution or court after the grand jury has last passed upon them.united states fisher,cir quoting dunn,at internal quotation marks omitted.when the facts proved at trial differ from those alleged in the indictment,the indictment has been constructively amended.id.constructive amendment is per se prejudicial and is grounds for reversal of a conviction.dunn,at.
the second superceding indictment charged that 
f rom a time unknown to the grand jury,but at least by in or about april of,and continuing thereafter until september of,in the district of massachusetts and elsewhere,pierre did knowingly and intentionally conspire and agree with mickens and others known and unknown to the grand jury to distribute grams or more of a mixture or substance which contains a detectable amount of cocaine base,also known as crack,and to distribute more than grams of cocaine.
the plain language of the indictment encompasses the old colony incident and the activities with lukenson,which took place in april.see id.at.it does not limit the charged conspiracy to the boyz.further,evidence of the lukenson incident was presented to the grand jury that returned the indictment.
we find no support in the record for pierre argument that the government primary theory of the case was that pierre and mickens conspired together and with the boyz to distribute cocaine,or his contention that the government switched theories in the trial.the government presented the lukenson evidence to the grand jury and the old colony evidence at the trial.the prosecution theory all along was that pierre conspired with many people,including lukenson and women other than mickens.
nor did the evidence presented at the trial necessarily show two distinct conspiracies,as pierre argues.contrary to pierre suggestion,there is no requirement that all of the participants in a conspiracy know or even know of one another.united states fenton,cir.the test for determining whether a single agreement existed among is a pragmatic one,taking into account the totality of the circumstances.id.
the evidence at the trial showed continuity between the two time periods at,when the lukenson and old colony events took place,and the summer of,when mickens began a relationship with pierre.see united states david,cir.mickens testified that pierre told her about the old colony incident,and that he told her he fled in a car driven by a man named kennisen.she testified that she knew kennisen because pierre regularly directed her to collect money from him and because she frequently drove pierre to new bedford to meet with kennisen likewise,mickens testified that when she arrived in fall river in,pierre had an ongoing relationship with the boyz.
the evidence also showed that pierre business operated in the same way and to the same end in april as it did during mickens later involvement.see id.the old colony and lukenson evidence demonstrated that in april pierre used other people to drive him around,hid his drugs in public spaces and outdoors,cut his drugs with inositol,and sold his drugs at fall river bars.mickens testimony was that during the time she was involved with pierre business,he used other people to drive him around,often hid his drugs outdoors in holes in the ground,cut his drugs with inositol,and sold his drugs at fall river bars.
the facts proved at trial were more than adequate to prove one ongoing conspiracy,with pierre at the center.see fenton,at.there was no constructive amendment.dunn,at see also united states kelly,cir.
drug seizure evidence 
on february,pierre was driving in a convenience store parking lot when he was stopped by fall river police officer david murphy.officer murphy later testified that he stopped pierre because he was aware at the time that pierre did not have an active license.after confirming that pierre license had been suspended,officer murphy arrested pierre for driving with a suspended license.pierre was taken to the fall river police department where he was searched as part of the booking process.during the search,police officers recovered cocaine from pierre pocket.
pierre filed a motion to suppress the february traffic stop evidence,arguing that officer murphy did not have reasonable suspicion to stop pierre.the district court denied the motion after an evidentiary hearing.the court found that pierre had reasonable suspicion to stop pierre for driving without a license.the cocaine seized during the traffic stop was admitted at both the and trials.pierre argues that the information on which officer murphy based the traffic stop was stale,and that introduction of the seized cocaine therefore violated his fourth amendment rights.
we review the district court ultimate determination of reasonable suspicion on a motion to suppress de novo.united states capelton,cir.we review subsidiary factual findings for clear error.id.
a traffic stop constitutes a seizure within the meaning of the fourth amendment.united states chhien,cir.as a result,the stop must be supported by a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity.id.at.reasonable suspicion requires more than a naked hunch that criminal activity is afoot,but less than probable cause.id.its existence is assessed on a basis,in light of all the attendant circumstances.id.when evaluating a claim of staleness,courts do not measure the timeliness of information simply by counting the number of days that have elapsed.united states bucuvalas,cir,abrogated on other grounds by cleveland united states,d.rather,a court must assess the nature of the information,the nature and characteristics of the suspected criminal activity,and the likely endurance of the information.id.
at the suppression hearing,officer murphy testified that from september to september he had worked in the vice and intelligence unit of the fall river police department.during that time,pierre name came up often in conversation fellow officers frequently discussed his drug dealing,and officer murphy was informed that pierre did not have an active license.officer murphy testified that after he left the vice unit,he continued to talk with detectives there regarding pierre,and no one ever informed him that pierre license status had changed.
pierre relies on united states laughrin,cir,a tenth circuit case,to argue that officer murphy information from the time he served in the vice unit was so old as to be meaningless,and therefore could not justify a traffic stop.laughrin,however,is distinguishable.in that case,a police officer had stopped the defendant based on his knowledge,which was at least weeks old,of the defendant driving record.id.at.the officer previously had stopped the defendant when he was driving on a suspended license,but the court noted that there was no indication from the officer testimony about the length of the license suspension.id.at.the court stated that if there had been testimony about the length of the suspension,the court might have been able to affirm the finding of reasonable suspicion.id.in the absence of such testimony,however,it held that the officer information was too stale to justify the stop.id.
here,however,officer murphy offered testimony indicating that pierre license had been suspended during the entire year that officer murphy had served in the vice unit.this testimony suggests that pierre license was suspended on an ongoing basis,rather than for a short period of time,making the suspicion that it was still inactive some five months later more reasonable.moreover,officer murphy testified that he kept in touch with some of the detectives in the vice unit,and that none of those detectives ever informed him during conversations about pierre of any change in pierre license status.although he did not explicitly state as much,the import of officer murphy testimony was that because pierre license status was relevant to future investigations and cases,he would have expected someone to have informed him if pierre license status had changed.we hold that officer murphy had reasonable suspicion to stop pierre car,and that the district court did not err in failing to suppress the cocaine seized incident to pierre arrest.
pierre cursorily states that the february evidence was irrelevant and unduly prejudicial.see.this argument has been waived,see united states zannino,cir i ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived,and is without merit in any event.evidence that pierre was driving without a license served to corroborate mickens testimony that pierre did not have a license and employed people to drive him around.likewise,evidence that pierre was carrying cocaine when he was stopped in february is directly relevant to his participation in a drug distribution conspiracy between april and september.
prior bad acts evidence 
pierre argues that the old colony,lukenson,and february traffic stop testimony should not have been admitted because it was evidence of prior bad acts.see.b id.he also argues that during the trial,officer alan correiro,who appeared on behalf of the government,testified about an uncharged shooting in an attempt to prejudice the jury concerning the character of pierre.the district court determination that evidence is not precluded by federal rules of evidence or b is reviewed for abuse of discretion.united states frankhauser,cir.
our conclusion that the old colony,lukenson,and february traffic stop evidence was proof of the conspiracy charged in the indictment defeats the prior bad acts argument as to that evidence.see united states arboleda,cir.moreover,none of this evidence was unduly prejudicial.see id.at.
as to the correiro testimony,it was a minor issue that was fully remedied by the district court.correiro was called to testify about statements that pierre made to him in october.when questioned about an omission in his report,correiro explained that the initial report was not about drugs because the investigation was of a shooting incident.defense counsel objected,and the district court instructed the jury to disregard the answer.during,correiro again referred to the incident and stated that charges had been brought against pierre.defense counsel then moved for a mistrial,which the district court denied,and the court instructed the jury more forcefully that the shooting incident had nothing to do with the case before them,that the charges against pierre had been dismissed,and that they should not think or talk about the incident.we normally presume that a jury will follow an instruction to disregard inadmissible evidence inadvertently presented to it.greer miller,d.only if there is an overwhelming probability that the jury could not have followed the instruction and a strong likelihood that the evidence was devastating to the defendant will we assume otherwise.id.this is not such a case.
iii.claims 
pierre argues that the forfeiture order was error because the government failed to demonstrate that he earned as a result of the conspiracy for which he was convicted.he further argues that the government was improperly permitted to seize substitute assets prior to the trial.
sufficiency of the evidence 
following the guilty verdict at the trial,the jury returned a special verdict in which it found that at least and a pair of diamond earrings seized by the government were derived,directly or indirectly,from the conspiracy a forfeiture verdict must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence.united states keene,cir united states rogers,cir.we have no problem finding a sufficient evidentiary basis for the jury verdict here.
the evidence in support of the forfeiture verdict at the trial included mickens testimony,as well as several records documenting expenditures by pierre.mickens testified that from the time she moved to fall river in until she developed a relationship with pierre the following year,she saw pierre exchanging money with others in various locations.she further testified that during the period of her involvement with summer until her arrest in september admitted to her that he had been in the drug business for years,and she observed pierre regularly obtain cocaine from a source in brockton and sell crack to customers in fall river and new bedford.mickens testified that she drove pierre to his source in brockton q uite a bit,once a week,twice a week,sometimes more,and that she drove pierre around fall river j ust about every day so that he could collect money or drop off ounces.she also testified that she sold crack for pierre,and at the height of her involvement she sold up to worth of crack per night she further indicated that if pierre did not need her to drive him around,she was in the bar selling drugs from the time they opened,all day.mickens also stated that she collected at least two times per week from pierre biggest wholesale customers,and that pierre also collected money from them.finally,mickens testified that she observed pierre cook up part of a of cocaine that he had obtained in florida.
the documentary evidence presented by the government showed that during the course of the conspiracy pierre spent over on motel rooms,over on cars,and deposited and withdrew nearly from a bank account.he also spent at least on jewelry.finally,he paid the living expenses of mickens,totaling over per year,and the expenses of his children and their mother.mickens testified that pierre had no job other than drug dealing.at the time mickens met pierre,he did have a used car lot,but mickens testified that he used the car lot to deal drugs and sold only one or two cars before getting rid of the lot a couple of months after she had met him.
although one can not,based on this testimony and documentary evidence,tally specific amounts to arrive at,the government may satisfy its burden of proof by either direct or circumstantial evidence.united states houlihan,cir.from the time of her involvement in,mickens estimated that she earned or collected between and over per week in drug money for pierre.the jury could easily have inferred from the evidence presented that on average pierre sold at least worth of cocaine or crack each week over the life of the conspiracy.such an inference supports the jury finding that was forfeitable.
substitute assets 
when pierre was arrested,the government seized from him various pieces of a watch,necklace,ring,bracelet,and valued at over.it then began administrative forfeiture proceedings,but when pierre filed a motion contesting the forfeiture,the government abandoned the claim.pierre motion also requested immediate return of the jewelry,but the government refused to return the jewelry to pierre,stating that it was evidence of criminal activity.see.g providing that the district court may impose reasonable conditions to protect access to seized property and its use in later proceedings.the district court agreed that the government was permitted to retain possession of the jewelry as evidence and denied pierre motion requesting return of the jewelry.
on september,the government obtained a second superceding indictment that included a forfeiture allegation specifying the seized jewelry and as forfeitable.at the trial,fernandes testified that pierre had spent money on gold chains and a jeweled bracelet,and the government offered the jewelry into evidence without objection.prior to the trial,however,pierre challenged the admissibility of the jewelry,arguing that the government was unable to tie it to the alleged conspiracy.the district court granted pierre motion to exclude the jewelry from the trial,except for the pair of earrings,which mickens testified pierre purchased for himself during their relationship.defense counsel then took possession of the excluded jewelry.
after the jury in the trial returned a special verdict finding that and the earrings were forfeitable,the district court entered a preliminary order forfeiting the earrings and the other four pieces of jewelry as substitute assets,p,since the government was unable to locate the specified in the special verdict.see united states hall,cir substitute property may be seized by the government to satisfy a forfeiture order where,by an act or omission,the defendant has prevented the government from tracing his illegally obtained assets.nine months later,the district court entered a final order of forfeiture,forfeiting the earrings and the substitute assets.
pierre does not object to the forfei
