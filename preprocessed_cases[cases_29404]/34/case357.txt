ronald pena appeals both his conviction and sentence for possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime.his primary contentions are that his conviction rested on improperly admitted fingerprint evidence and that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of either charge.after a careful review,we reject pena claims and affirm the district court.
facts and procedural background 
because pena challenges the sufficiency of the evidence brought against him,we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.united states,cir citing united states,cir.as a result of a phone call placed to the brockton police on august,at about,officers of the brockton police department were dispatched to the area of north warren avenue to look for a particular individual.sergeant kenneth lofstrom,who was in a marked cruiser,observing pena walking down the street,pulled up next to pena and asked if he could speak with him.pena responded,why what up a second marked cruiser pulled up,and as the officer driving that cruiser exited the vehicle,pena took off running through a vacant lot on north warren avenue.he then ran across walnut street and through a backyard at crowell street before being apprehended by police and arrested.
officers then searched for evidence in the area where pena had been observed running.they found a sidekick ii cell phone as well as a green baseball cap.pena had been wearing such a cap before fleeing the police.the officers also found a loaded smith wesson model magnum revolver lying on the ground in plain view and,a few feet from the firearm,a clear plastic bag with other,smaller clear plastic bags inside of it containing a white substance.a state laboratory analysis later determined that the bags contained a net weight of grams of cocaine base 
when pena was transported to the brockton police department for booking,officers recovered in united states currency from his front right pocket.pena was fingerprinted and advised of his miranda rights.he subsequently asked the officers if they had found his cell phone,and when pena was shown the sidekick ii phone,he identified it as his.
on december,the grand jury returned a indictment charging pena with possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute,in violation of a the drug charge or count one and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime,and possession of a firearm in furtherance of that crime,in violation of c the firearm charge or count two.
a jury trial commenced on may.at a motions hearing prior to opening statements,pena moved to exclude testimony regarding fingerprint evidence,arguing that it failed to meet the standard for expert testimony under.the district court provisionally denied the motion and allowed three troopers from the massachusetts state police trained in fingerprint analysis to testify at trial that they compared a partial latent fingerprint found on the revolver to an inked fingerprint of pena left thumb using the method analysis,comparison,evaluation,and verification,and matched the latent fingerprint with the inked fingerprint to the exclusion of all others.pena renewed his objection to the testimony,and the district court again denied the motion in an oral ruling.
also,christina rosado,a civilian witness residing at north warren avenue,testified that on the afternoon of august,she looked out her kitchen window and saw a man run across her backyard,reach into the area of his right hip,and make two separate throwing motions,as if he were throwing something away.rosado testified that she then observed the man continue to run until he was out of her line of sight.
on june,on the seventh day of trial,pena moved for judgment of acquittal,asserting that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction on either count charged in the indictment.the district court orally denied the motion,and on june,pena was convicted on both counts of the indictment.pena filed a motion for acquittal on count two,and that motion was also denied.on february,the district court sentenced pena to consecutive terms of imprisonment totaling months as well as four years of supervised release.
on appeal we consider the following issues whether the district court erred in admitting the testimony of the massachusetts state troopers regarding the fingerprint evidence,and whether the totality of the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict 
admissibility of expert testimony regarding fingerprint evidence 
we review pena claim that the district court erred in admitting expert testimony regarding fingerprint evidence for abuse of discretion.united states diaz,cir.
pena challenges the method used by the state troopers in matching the partial latent fingerprint recovered from the firearm to pena inked fingerprint.pena claims that the method was not scientific and that the troopers conclusion that his fingerprint matched the partial latent print was based on no discernible standard.specifically,pena argues that the method was unreliable because it involved merely a visual comparison of the two prints where the trooper conducting the initial analysis knew that the inked print was taken from a suspect and the trooper made no diagrams,charts,or notes as part of his evaluation.given our standard of review,we are not persuaded.
federal rule of evidence permits a witness qualified as an expert to offer opinion testimony if the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data,the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,and the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.as the supreme court has held,it is the task of the trial judge to ensure that an expert testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d.this involves a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.id.at.the court later extended daubert application to technical and other specialized knowledge in addition to scientific testimony.see seahorse marine supplies,puerto rico sun oil,cir citing kumho tire,carmichael,d.
in this case,the district court declined to hold a daubert hearing and initially denied pena motion to exclude the fingerprint evidence.on day of trial,massachusetts state trooper kevin halle gave extensive testimony about the method,his training and experience using the method for fingerprint identification,and how he used the method in pena case.he explained that after he had analyzed the partial latent print,compared it to the prints on pena fingerprint card,and determined that it matched pena left thumb print,he had two other troopers independently verify his findings.those two troopers then testified as to their verification of the match.
though trooper halle acknowledged that the massachusetts state police used no specific minimum number of points to confirm a fingerprint match,and the district court expressed some reservation about the reliability of the testimony on that basis the court ultimately decided to admit the testimony,noting that the case law is overwhelmingly in favor of admitting fingerprint experts under virtually any circumstance.consequently,the court reasoned,the only way it would have considered excluding the testimony or giving a limiting instruction is if there had been data,real evidence presented about the limitations of fingerprinting.instead,as the court acknowledged,pena motion to exclude relied on one article from the fordham law review,and that not enough to carry the weight of the exclusion motion.
the district court did not abuse its discretion.numerous courts have found expert testimony on fingerprint identification based on the method to be sufficiently reliable under daubert.see united states baines,cir united states mitchell,cir united states sullivan,d,united states llera plaza,d,commonwealth patterson,finding method reliable for single latent fingerprint impressions.though ackno
