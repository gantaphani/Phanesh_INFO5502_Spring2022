background 
shortly after midnight on march,shoup was driving his suv,a black chevy tahoe bearing license plate vz,through downtown salem,massachusetts,when he encountered bard carvalho and several friends walking from a local bar to the home of one of his friends.shoup leaned out the car window and yelled homo at the group.thinking it was a joke,carvalho yelled back you a homo.the carvalho group continued walking until they arrived outside his friend house on lynde street.shoup pulled up in his suv,exited the vehicle,approached carvalho,and stated do you have a problem with me carvalho observed what appeared to be a handgun protruding from shoup waistband,with the handle wrapped in silver duct tape.determined to get away from the dangerous situation quickly,carvalho grabbed his friend tamsen wrist,led her inside the apartment,and immediately called.carvalho other friends remained outside talking with shoup.
carvalho promptly advised the dispatcher that i a man driving a car bearing license plate vz had just threatened him and his friends ii the man has a gun in his pants and iii the vehicle in question is a black tahoe.by this time,one or two minutes had elapsed since carvalho left his friends outside,and carvalho observed through the apartment window that shoup was driving away.carvalho advised the dispatcher i sorry i called it probably not that severe,but he had a gun in his pants and he was threatening us.carvalho then notified the dispatcher that he was observing shoup taking a left from lynde street onto north street.carvalho described the man as a to year old caucasian which matches shoup physical appearance,and thought that he may have been intoxicated.when the dispatcher asked carvalho if the man had brandished the gun,carvalho replied no he just had it.he pulled the coat back and had it like exposed there was some silver duct tape on like,i think on the gun.the dispatcher told carvalho that a police officer would be sent to lynde street,and rang off.
within fifteen to thirty minutes,the police stopped shoup suv in downtown salem.when asked if he knew why he was stopped,shoup replied yes.shoup was carrying a folding knife in his right front pant pocket,with only the clip exposed.the police discovered a black police baton under the front seat of the vehicle,as well as two loaded and holstered handguns inside the console between the driver seat and the front passenger seat.one firearm had a handle.
shoup was indicted on one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm.g.at trial,carvalho testified that he had observed shoup carrying what appeared to be a gun in his waistband.the government corroborated that testimony by playing the tape of the carvalho phone call.the arresting officers testified to stopping the shoup vehicle shortly after the call,and to the seizure of the two handguns from the console.
the defense called shoup brother,john,who testified that he had borrowed dan shoup suv on march because he intended to take his family on a beach outing the following day,that he used the suv on that day to take a friend named sean nobile on errands,and that during this trip he was surprised to discover that nobile was carrying two firearms.john further testified that he told nobile to put the guns in the console and lock it,but when john dropped nobile off at his home,both of them had forgotten that the guns were still in the console.john testified that he used the suv on march to take his family for an outing,then returned the car to dan shoup house late in the day on march,but forgot to tell dan that the two guns were in the locked console.shoup former girlfriend,colleen dowgos,testified for the defense that nobile contacted her about twelve days after shoup arrest,and told her that he had paid the bail to get shoup out of jail on state charges.since shoup meanwhile had been on federal charges,dowgos gave nobile the keys to shoup apartment because nobile wanted to retrieve some property he had left there.because sean nobile invoked his fifth amendment right against,the district court declared him an unavailable witness.
the jury found shoup guilty.at sentencing,which occurred prior to the decision in united states booker,d,the district court sentenced shoup at the low end of the applicable guidelines range,months,but noted that booker might rule the sentencing guidelines unconstitutional,in which case the court would impose the statutory minimum sentence of months.shoup now appeals from his conviction and sentence.
discussiona.admissibility of tape transcript 
shoup first contends that the district court erred in allowing the government to introduce in evidence the audiotape and transcript of carvalho call,because they do not qualify under any exclusion from the hearsay rule,see.d a prior statement inconsistent with trial testimony id.d b prior consistent statement to rebut charge of recent fabrication id.d c statement of identification,and their admission constitutes reversible error because carvalho testimony was much more tentative in identifying the object in shoup waistband as a handgun or as one of the two guns in evidence,and standing alone,would not have persuaded the jury to reject the defense theory that the two guns belonged to nobile and that shoup was unaware of their presence in the locked console of the car.
as shoup did not object to the admission of the recording or transcript,we review his challenge for plain error only,and will reverse only if he demonstrates that i there was error ii the error was obvious and iii the error affected shoup substantial rights by altering the outcome of the trial.see united states bartos,cir noting that,provided these three conditions are satisfied,the court may in its discretion,reverse to prevent a miscarriage of justice citing united states olano,d.
shoup argument fails,since he can show neither that there was error,nor if there were an error,that it was obvious.the government contends that the call satisfies either the excited utterance or the present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule.see.noting that a statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition is an exception to the hearsay rule id.noting that a statement describing or explaining an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving the event or condition,or immediately thereafter,is an exception to the hearsay rule.
shoup counters,inter alia,that the recording would not have been admissible under either exception since too much time had elapsed between the time shoup confronted carvalho with the gun and the time carvalho spoke with the dispatcher.rules and do not require that the statement occur contemporaneously with the event,however,since in many,if not most,instances precise contemporaneity is not possible and hence a slight time lapse is allowable.advisory committee note see united states taveras,cir noting that permissible delay may in fact be even a few minutes or more.given carvalho testimony that shoup drove away only one or two minutes into carvalho call,carvalho call came immediately after his confrontation with shoup,and while carvalho friends were still outside with shoup and remained at risk.see united states rondeau,cir finding no error in admission of call made as or immediately after defendant threatened the caller with the gun.carvalho began the call by declaring that shoup has a gun in his pants.
further,the record contains no other indication that the recording lacked evidentiary reliability.the defense stipulated to the accuracy of the transcript of the call.the carvalho testimony was entirely consistent with the tape,and in many respects more detailed.id.noting that caller never changed his account of the events.carvalho testified that he saw something in his shoup waistband that i believed at the time was a pistol,with silver duct tape on its handl
