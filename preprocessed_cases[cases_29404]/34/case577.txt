jacinta thomas and pier 
the morning of july,thomas,a resident of santurce,puerto rico,got in her ford taurus and drove to pier.she arrived sometime between and and immediately came under customs surveillance.after thomas entered the dock area,she parked her car and got out.after exiting her vehicle,she answered her cell phone and then looked toward the cargo vessel.customs agents observed her frequently looking toward the freight and cargo area,as if searching for someone specific.unlike others with business in the port,she did not enter any offices,was not carrying any documents,and repeatedly used her cell phone.she then reentered her vehicle and left the dock area for ten to fifteen minutes.
upon her return,she parked again,got out of her car,and sat in a chair,chatting with people passing by.this time she remained on the dock for several hours.while she was there,the ci placed four calls to her cell phone to establish contact and to coordinate delivery of the box.these calls took place at,and and as these calls were made,surveillance confirmed that thomas was using her cell phone.it took hours to coordinate the delivery of the box to thomas,because thomas did not want to pick up the box at the end of the pier,but instead wanted the box delivered to her car.ultimately,the ci arranged to have one of his employees take the box on a forklift to thomas car.when the forklift operator arrived at her car,thomas got up from her chair,pointed to the side of the car,walked in front of the forklift operator,and opened the door to the driver seat.the forklift operator placed the box in the rear seat behind the driver.
after the box was placed in her vehicle,thomas stayed near her car momentarily and then walked toward the lady romney,another cargo vessel.thomas returned to her car accompanied by another woman,who was wearing a type of hair net commonly worn by cooks.this woman joined thomas approximately thirty seconds before thomas began to drive out of pier.as thomas was driving out of pier,customs agents stopped her.after identifying himself,agent ritchie flores asked thomas whether she had any cargo or foreign property in her vehicle.thomas replied that she had a box in the rear seat that had come from anguila.flores was aware,however,that the wine box had originated in martin and had not traveled to anguila.flores asked if he could search both the box and thomas she consented.inside the wine box,flores discovered packages wrapped in newspaper and covered in grease and inside these packages were bricks of heroin and cocaine base,containing kilograms of heroin hydrocholoride and kilograms of cocaine base there was no wine in the box.
customs procedure 
under customs regulations,all incoming foreign cargo must be manifested and declared,including merchandise brought by crew members.to exit the port with foreign merchandise,the recipient must proceed to customs with the required forms and receive clearance.thomas did not have any paperwork to accompany the box of wine.
narcotics smuggling 
the value of one kilogram of heroin was wholesale and retail,and the value of one kilogram of cocaine base was wholesale and retail.the range of value for the entire shipment,therefore,was between wholesale and retail.at trial,a dea task force member expressed the view that,because of the value of the shipment,the owner of the drugs would only assign the job of picking up the drugs to a highly trusted member of the drug organization.he also testified that a drug organization would never use a person who was unaware of what was being transported.

thomas testified that she had arrived,as usual,at pier the morning of tuesday,july,to pick up henriquez.when she arrived,however,jack,the captain of the lady romney,asked her to take his girlfriend to the beauty parlor,which thomas did,returning shortly thereafter to pick up henriquez.after thomas returned to pier,henriquez asked if she could borrow thomas cell phone and disappeared inside the lady romney.thomas waited for henriquez to reappear and ultimately went inside the vessel to find henriquez,who told her that she had to finish cooking for the crew that day and would then be ready to leave.henriquez also told thomas that she had a box of liquor to take out.thomas replied that this would be no problem.thomas returned to the dock,where she continued to wait for henriquez.as thomas waited,she placed a number of calls on her cell phone,including to her daughter and her own clients 
thomas agreed that while she was waiting for henriquez,she received a telephone call from someone,informing her that henriquez had asked him to call her about the box of wine and that he needed her permission to deliver the box,since it was her car.thomas agreed,knowing that henriquez had informed her about the wine.this same person called a second time and told her to come pick up the box thomas refused and instead told him to bring the wine to her vehicle.this took some time and thomas went back inside the lady romney to hurry henriquez along.when she came out,a person had arrived at her vehicle with a forklift and the wine.thomas told him where to place the box.henriquez emerged from the lady romney,got into thomas car,and they both left pier.
