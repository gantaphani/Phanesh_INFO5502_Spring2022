on november,in purchasing a glock handgun for his uncle in pennsylvania,bruce james abramski,assured the firearms dealer in virginia that he was the actual buyer of the handgun.abramski was thereafter charged with being an illegal straw purchaser of the firearm.pursuant to conditional pleas of guilty,abramski was convicted in the western district of virginia on june,for two firearm offenses making a false statement that was material to the lawfulness of a firearm sale,in violation of a and making a false statement with respect to information required to be kept in the records of a licensed firearms dealer that is,that he was the actual buyer of the firearm,when in fact he was buying it for someone else in contravention of a a.
prior to his guilty pleas,the district court denied abramski motions to dismiss the charges and suppress evidence.abramski appeals from the criminal judgment,maintaining that the court erred in two respects.first,he argues that the court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment because his conduct was beyond the purview of a and a a,in that both he and his uncle were legally entitled to purchase and own the glock handgun.second,he contends that the court erred in denying his motion to suppress on the ground that inculpatory evidence had been unconstitutionally seized from his residence.as explained below,we reject abramski contentions of error and affirm.
the facts underlying abramski convictions are undisputed.prior to november,abramski,who lived in franklin county,virginia,and his uncle,angel alvarez,who resided in pennsylvania,had several conversations concerning alvarez desire to obtain a glock handgun.abramski offered to purchase a glock for alvarez because,as a former virginia police officer,abramski could obtain a favorable price from a firearms dealer that catered to police officers in collinsville,virginia.before purchasing the handgun,abramski spoke with three licensed federal firearms dealers and discussed how to legally conduct such an acquisition.the dealers apparently advised abramski,in essence,that a licensed dealer in pennsylvania could complete the transfer to his uncle after the handgun had been purchased by abramski in virginia.in order to implement the transaction,alvarez sent abramski a check for on november.the term glock handgun was written in the memo line of the check.
on november,abramski went to the firearms dealer in collinsville and purchased a glock handgun,among other items,paying for them with more than in cash.in conducting the transaction,abramski completed bureau of alcohol,tobacco,firearms and explosives atf form,which contained several questions about the purchase of firearms,to be answered by checking boxes marked yes or no.of importance here,question.on the atf form stated 
are you the actual of the firearm s listed on this form warning you are not the actual buyer if you are acquiring the firearm s on behalf of another person.if you are not the actual buyer,the dealer can not transfer the firearm s to you.
emphasis on form abramski checked the answer yes to question.three days later,on november,the check from alvarez was deposited in abramski bank account,and the next day abramski transferred the glock handgun to alvarez at a licensed federal firearms dealer in easton,pennsylvania.at that time,alvarez gave abramski a receipt confirming the transfer,reflecting that alvarez had purchased the glock handgun for.
meanwhile,on november,a bank robbery occurred at franklin community bank in rocky mount,virginia.an investigation of the robbery led the fbi to suspect abramski.abramski had been fired from the roanoke police department in,looked similar to the masked bank robber,and was down on his luck abramski and his wife had recently separated and their home was in foreclosure.
abramski was arrested in early july on state law charges relating to the bank robbery.in connection therewith,two fbi agents investigating the robbery sought and secured search warrants relating to the investigation.the first warrant was issued on july,for the search of a home on highland farm road in calloway,virginia,where abramski parents lived,and where abramski had moved a short time earlier.the items to be seized included things believed to be related to the bank robbery,such as a black square duffle bag,a black ski mask,firearms,and the phrase covering a ny and all articles that appear to be relevant to the commission of a robbery.the second search warrant was obtained about three weeks later,on july,for a home on iron ridge road in rocky mount,virginia,which was abramski marital residence.this warrant specified some of the same items as the first warrant and also included the same phrase.in executing the search warrant for the iron ridge road property,agents found and seized a green franklin community bank zippered bag containing the written receipt confirming the transfer of the glock handgun from abramski to alvarez on november.
the federal authorities have never charged abramski with bank robbery,and the state bank robbery charges against him were dismissed on october.on november,however,the federal grand jury indicted abramski for the firearms offenses underlying this appeal.a corrective superseding indictment that apparently only deleted information about the firearms dealer was returned on may.the superseding indictment hereinafter the indictment charged abramski,in count one,with making the false and fictitious statement on the atf form that he was the actual buyer of the glock handgun,in violation of a and a count two of the indictment charged abramski with making a false statement with respect to information required to be kept in the records of a licensed firearms dealer,in violation of a a in both charges,the prosecution relied on the theory that abramski was merely a straw purchaser of the firearm that was immediately transferred to alvarez 
on march,abramski moved to dismiss both counts of the indictment the first dismissal motion,contending that,because the firearm was legally transferred to alvarez and abramski made no material misrepresentations to the virginia firearms dealer,the firearms statutes were never intended to punish his conduct.also on march,abramski moved to suppress the receipt found in the money bag in his home,arguing that its seizure was unconstitutional under the fourth amendment the district court denied both these motions from the bench on march.see.the court ruled,first of all,that u.a and a a were violated when a false or fictitious statement is made on an atf form,and,second,that the search warrant for abramski home was amply supported by probable cause.in any event,according to the court,seizure of the receipt was proper under the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.
on april,after the court had denied his first dismissal motion and his initial motion to suppress,abramski filed a second motion to dismiss the indictment the second dismissal motion.he therein contended that question.on the atf form is not required by law but was created by the atf and that,inasmuch as the atf itself decided that the actual buyer of a firearm must be ascertained at the time of acquisition,the atf had failed to comply with the notice and comment procedures required by the administrative procedure act.after conducting a hearing on the second dismissal motion on april,the district court rejected that motion by a published decision filed on april.see united states abramski,d,determining that disclosure of actual firearm purchaser is required by law.notably,abramski does not appeal the court denial of the second dismissal motion on june,abramski filed a second motion to suppress,asserting that,after the denial of his first motion to suppress,he discovered evidence that undermined the credibility of a witness who had provided information concerning the search warrants.see.the court denied this suppression motion from the bench following an evidentiary hearing conducted on june,and the second motion to suppress is not relevant to this appeal.see j.
on june,pursuant to a plea agreement with the united states attorney,abramski entered conditional guilty pleas,pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of criminal procedure,to both charges in the indictment on october,the court sentenced abramski to five years of probation on each offense,to run concurrently.abramski thereafter filed a timely notice of appeal.
we review de novo legal issues relating to statutory construction.united states broncheau,cir.in evaluating a district court denial of a motion to suppress evidence,we review the court factual findings for clear error and its legal determinations de novo.united states doyle,cir.in evaluating a probable cause issue with respect to a search warrant,we assess whether the magistrate judge had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed.illinois gates,d.
we must first address a potential procedural defect that could impact our jurisdiction in this appeal.this court has recognized that,pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of criminal procedure,the direct review of an adverse ruling on a pretrial motion is available only if the defendant expressly preserves that right by entering a conditional guilty plea.see united states bundy,cir quoting united states wiggins,cir.indeed,we have observed that,a bsent a valid conditional guilty plea,we will dismiss a defendant appeal from an adverse pretrial ruling on a issue.bundy,at.
in order for a defendant to pursue an appeal after a rule a conditional guilty plea,the relevant agreement must be in writing and must identify the specific pretrial rulings that the defendant intends to appeal.these requirements serve to document that a particular plea was in fact conditional,and identify precisely what pretrial issues have been preserved for appellate review.advisory committee note.as we have explained,the conditions must be expressly described in writing,or at least so clearly shown on the record that there is no doubt that a conditional plea was agreed to.bundy,at.
abramski plea agreement identifies only one adverse ruling that he intends to appeal,and that ruling was made on june,the day prior to his guilty pleas.the plea agreement describes the conditional nature of his guilty pleas as follows 
i understand that the united states consents to my making of a conditional plea of guilty in this case in accordance with rule a of the federal rules of criminal procedure.i reserve the right to appeal any and all adverse rulings of the court to date,to specifically include the court oral ruling at a charge conference in chambers yesterday,june,that the subsequent legal transfer of the firearm in question from the defendant abramski to his uncle angel danny alvarez,in pennsylvania,does not negate the illegality of the defendant acts in acquiring the firearm from a federally licensed firearm dealer in virginia.
handwritten additions emphasized.although the issue resolved by the first dismissal motion is fairly framed in the plea agreement,the agreement misidentifies the ruling at the june charge conference,rather than the court denial of the first dismissal motion,as the issue sought to be appealed.perhaps more significantly,an appeal of the suppression rulings is not mentioned in the plea agreement.
during the plea hearing,the issues reserved for appeal were not specified on the record,although the district court and the prosecutors briefly discussed alterations of the plea agreement,presumably for the purpose of specifying issues that could be appealed.the court suggested the following 
if it makes it any simpler,why do you just change the conditional plea to read that the defendant reserves the right to appeal all pretrial legal rulings that the court has made why is it necessary that we have more complicated language could you just agree to that 
in response,the government agreed to the court suggestion.based on this dialogue,it is evident that the parties anticipated that the defendant could appeal court rulings other than the single one specified in the plea agreement.rule a and our precedent are clear,however,that the issues to be appealed after a conditional guilty plea should be specified in writing,or,at the very least,clearly stated on the record.nevertheless,because the court and the government orally agreed in broad terms to abramski conditional pleas,we are satisfied to address the merits of his appeal on the first dismissal motion and the first motion to suppress.accordingly,we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
abramski first contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the charges in the indictment,and in ruling that abramski purchase of the glock handgun constituted a straw purchase that violated a and a a.abramski maintains that,because he and alvarez were both legally entitled to purchase such a firearm,he was not a straw purchaser and his yes answer on the atf form representing that he was the actual buyer thereof was not material and was never intended to be punished by the gun control act of,or by a or a a.indeed,abramski asserts that congress intent in enacting those statutes was to make it possible to keep firearms out of the hands of those not legally entitled to possess them.br.of appellant.under abramski theory,he could only be prosecuted for his virginia acquisition of the glock handgun if alvarez had been ineligible to possess a firearm,a convicted felon,thereby rendering the actual buyer question on the atf form material to the lawfulness of the sale.see a.on the legal proposition pursued by abramski,there appears to be a split in the courts of appeals.at least three of our sister circuits have heretofore addressed the issue,and one of them seems to agree with abramski.
in support of his position,abramski relies on the fifth circuit decision in united states polk,cir.in that case,the court of appeals assessed whether a liability attached where the true purchaser here,alvarez can lawfully purchase a firearm directly.id.at.the fifth circuit determined that it did not,ruling that 
the plain language of the statute compels the conclusion that a criminalizes false statements that are intended to deceive federal firearms dealers with respect to facts material to the lawfulness of the sale of firearms thus,if the true purchaser can lawfully purchase a firearm directly,a liability under a straw purchase theory does not attach.
id.emphasis in original.
put simply,we are unable to agree with polk.it is clear to us that the prohibition against false and fictitious statements in a is not limited to those persons who are prohibited from buying or possessing a firearm.to establish a violation of a,the prosecution is obligated to prove four elements the defendant knowingly made a false or fictitious oral or written statement that was material to the lawfulness of the sale or disposition of a firearm,and was intended to deceive or likely to deceive a firearms dealer.united states harvey,cir.the straw purchaser issue goes directly to the third of these essential elements materiality.
abramski contention that a does not apply to a firearm transaction involving two eligible purchasers was recently rejected by the sixth circuit in united states morales,cir.in that case,the court also took issue with the reasoning of polk and agreed with the eleventh circuit decision in united states frazier,cir.in frazier,the court of appeals had likewise rejected polk,explaining its decision in language that we readily approve 
t o say that the identity of the actual purchaser is material to the lawfulness of one sale but not to another,is counterintuitive.although polk focused on whether one identity affected the lawfulness of a sale under a,we focus on whether one identity is a fact that is material to the lawfulness of a sale.the identity of the purchaser is a constant that is always material to the lawfulness of the purchase of a firearm under a.thus,it can be reasoned that although the lawfulness of a sale may change depending on the identity of the purchaser,the fact that the identity of the purchaser is material to the lawfulness of the sale does not.
id.emphasis added.
in denying abramski first dismissal motion from the bench on march,the court relied on the frazier case,expressing concern that abramski theory creates an extr
