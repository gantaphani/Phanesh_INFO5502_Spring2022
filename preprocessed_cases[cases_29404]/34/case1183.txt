opinion of the court 
in nearly all circumstances,we require police officers to obtain a warrant supported by probable cause before engaging in a search or seizure of a person,their house,their papers,or their effects.one of the few exceptions to this rule allows police to conduct a warrantless search or seizure when exigent circumstances require them to act with such alacrity that requiring them to first obtain a warrant would be unreasonable.the question at the heart of this case requires us to determine whether an exigency has abated such that officers are no longer excused from the warrant requirement.
in the late evening and early morning hours of january and,kamaal mallory and his stepbrother ismail abu bakr were at the home of delaine abu bakr,ismail mother and mallory stepmother,who resided at old york road in philadelphia,pennsylvania.at the time,both mallory and were employed as emergency medical technicians for the northwest care ambulance company.mallory did not live with delaine,but he and his two daughters often stayed with her on weekends,and planned to do so on the weekend of january through the.
between about and on the,mallory and ismail were standing with friends in front of a neighbor home.officer eric enders approached them in a police cruiser,shined a spotlight on them,and ordered them to disperse.although they complied with this order,ismail cursed at officer enders,telling him to stop shining the spotlight in his face.officer enders and his partner then detained ismail for disorderly conduct,placing him in the backseat of the cruiser,and driving around the corner.
meanwhile,mallory returned to his stepmother house where his stepsister,siddiqah abu bakr,let him in.siddiqah had observed through a window the situation unfolding outside,and awoke her mother to tell her what was happening.after siddiqah returned to the window,she saw ismail being placed into the cruiser,which had left by the time delaine came downstairs.officer enders detained ismail for a few minutes before removing his handcuffs and releasing him.ismail walked back toward his mother house,seeing two police cruisers out front.
at,officers richard hough and william lynch,received a dispatch advising them that there was a group of men outside on the block of old york road,and that one of them was armed with a gun.the allegedly armed man was a black male wearing a brown leather jacket over a black hooded sweatshirt.the officers arrived at old york road about five minutes after receiving the dispatch.
delaine,who by this time was standing outside on her porch,approached the driver side door of the second cruiser to speak with officers hough and lynch.she asked them whether they had arrested ismail.while they were speaking,officer hough noticed a man standing nearby who matched the description of the suspect.this man was later identified as mallory.the district court observed that it remains unclear precisely where mallory was standing in relation to delaine,but it is undisputed that mallory was outside and in view of the officers.
at one point,mallory spoke with officers hough and lynch,and as he did so his jacket lifted to reveal a revolver stuck in his waistband.when officer hough observed this,he exclaimed gun in order to alert his partner to the presence of a weapon.officer hough exited the vehicle and ordered mallory to stop,but mallory instead ran into delaine house,shutting the door behind him.
the officers gave chase.siddiqah,who had come outside,briefly blocked the officers entry,shouting that they had no right to enter without a warrant.they pushed her aside and officer hough kicked the door,breaking the latch.someone inside blocked the door from opening,and officer hough kicked the door several times,breaking loose a lower panel on the door the person holding the door shut relented and officer hough opened the door,which,when one faced it from outside,swung in and to the left.
it was dark inside the house.the officers entered with weapons drawn,followed inside by siddiqah and delaine.siddiqah was distraught,and the officers told them both to exit the house.it was then that another of mallory stepsisters,tazkeyah abu bakr,came down the stairs.one of the officers pointed his weapon at her and told her to leave the house,and tazkeyah joined delaine and siddiqah on the front porch.
while officer hough was kicking in the door,officer lynch had called for backup.when officers kevin gorman and kevin robinson arrived shortly thereafter,officers hough and lynch had already entered the house and were awaiting them in the first floor living room.officer hough ordered officers gorman and robinson to stay on the first floor,with instructions to prevent the family from reentering the house.officers hough and lynch then began searching the home for mallory,beginning on the top floor and working their way down.they searched for mallory in places where a person could hide,such as rooms and closets.they also searched for the firearm in places where a firearm could be hidden,like inside drawers and under pillows.during the search,ismail returned and briefly argued with one of the officers before delaine persuaded him to join the rest of the family on the front porch.
during the search of the house,supervising officer sergeant marc hayes arrived he spoke with delaine,who explained that the family had been instructed to wait on the porch while the officers searched the house,but that it was cold outside.sergeant hayes allowed the family to wait in the living room,but when officer hough came back downstairs and saw this he explained to the sergeant that he did not want the family in the house until the officers had recovered the firearm.the family was sent back outside.
the officers eventually located a locked bathroom on the first floor,which they had at first overlooked because they thought it was an exterior door.believing that mallory was hiding in the bathroom,the officers asked delaine if she had a key,which she did not.no response came from within the bathroom when delaine asked mallory to come out.the officers used a crowbar to pry open the door,finding mallory inside.they arrested and handcuffed him,and began to escort him through the first floor to the front door.
as the officers proceeded with mallory from the rear of the house to the front door,one of them asked whether the area behind the opened front door had been searched officer hough then recovered a revolver from under or behind umbrellas located on the left side of the foyer behind the front door,which had been swung open into the house.united states mallory,wl,at.
mallory was indicted in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania on one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,in violation of g and e.he moved to suppress the gun.the district court held a suppression hearing and heard testimony from one witness for the government officer hough and five witnesses for the defense ismail,delaine,siddiqah,tazkeyah,and richard thomas,iii,a friend of mallory.
the district court granted the motion to suppress.it held first that mallory had a legitimate expectation of privacy in delaine home because,although he did not reside there,he and his daughters spent weekends there and were staying there the night of his arrest.accordingly,he had standing to challenge the legality of the search.mallory,wl,at.the government does not challenge this holding on appeal.
on the merits,the district court concluded that the officers had probable cause to believe that mallory had committed the crime of carrying a firearm upon the public streets of philadelphia,in violation of.ann,and that their warrantless entrance into the home was justified under the exigent circumstances doctrine because they were in hot pursuit of a fleeing mallory.mallory,wl,at.this exigency allowed the officers not only to enter the home and search for mallory,but also to search places too small for a person to hide in order to recover the firearm.id.at.however,once the police had found and secured mallory,the exigency justifying their warrantless search hot pursuit of an armed suspect no longer existed.the district court disagreed with the government that officer hough search was justified to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence,another of the recognized exigencies that may render a warrantless search reasonable.because exigent circumstances no longer existed,the district court concluded,officer hough warrantless search behind the door to recover the gun was illegal and suppression was required 
the district court order granting suppression was signed on march,and was entered on the docket on march.the government filed a notice of appeal on april,which stated that it was appealing the order of the district court entered on march.sa at.the government failed to certify that the appeal was not taken for purpose of delay and that the evidence suppressed is a substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding,as required under.realizing its mistake,the government filed an amended notice of appeal the next day that included the required certification.
before we proceed to the merits,we must resolve disputes over both our jurisdiction and the appropriate standard of review.
mallory argues that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal because the government failed to timely comply with the certification requirement of.his argument proceeds in three steps first,that compliance with is a jurisdictional prerequisite second,that the window within which the government must file its appeal under also applies to the certification requirement and third,that the time limit begins on the date that the suppression order was rendered,not the date that it was entered on the docket,which in this case would mean that the government missed the deadline by a single day.
section grants this court appellate jurisdiction over government appeals from certain adverse rulings in a criminal case.of relevance here,states 
an appeal by the united states shall lie to a court of appeals from a decision or order of a district court suppressing or excluding evidence if the united states attorney certifies to the district court that the appeal is not taken for purpose of delay and that the evidence is a substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding.
the federal rules of appellate procedure require that the government,when entitled to appeal in a criminal case,must file notice of its appeal within thirty days after the entry of the order being appealed,fed.b b i emphasis added,and an order is entered for purposes of this rule b when it is entered on the criminal docket,fed.b.section,on the other hand,states that t he appeal shall be taken within thirty days after the decision,judgment or order has been rendered.emphasis added.mallory claims that the difference in language is important a decision is rendered when it is announced,either orally or in writing,by the judge it is entered when it is recorded on the docket.mallory br.at quoting black law dictionary,ed.in his view,then,the clock began ticking when the district court suppression order was signed on march,and the government amended notice of appeal which included the certification was filed one day late,on april.the government disputes this,arguing that the period began when the order was entered on the docket on march,meaning that its amended filing was timely.
we conclude that the government amended notice of appeal,filed on april,was timely under both rule b b and.in united states midstate horticultural,the supreme court interpreted the language of a predecessor to.that statute filing deadline for government appeals was in haec verba with filing deadline,requiring that t he appeal shall be taken within thirty days after the decision or judgment has been rendered ed.emphasis added.in midstate,the district court had filed the opinion from which the government appealed on june,but had not entered the order until july.at.the government filed its appeal on july,which was eighteen days after entry of the final order but more than thirty days after the opinion was filed.id.the defendant sought to dismiss the appeal for failure to comply with the deadline,but the court summarily dismissed this argument,concluding that t he appeals were from the judgments and orders of july,and not the previous written opinion.id.
midstate establishes that the limitations period of began to run on the date that the district court order was entered on the docket,and under that calculus the government certification was timely.we are not persuaded that congress intended that there be a different operative date for appeal deadlines between rule and,notwithstanding the slight difference in language.see in re hurley mercantile,cir observing that in the scheme of federal appeals we believe the statutes have used the terms rendition and entry interchangeably rather than with technical accuracy.the certification requirement ensures a conscientious analysis by the responsible prosecuting official.united states smith,cir quoting united states carrillo bernal,cir.that purpose is not served by artificially restricting the time that the government has to determine whether it should appeal because we conclude that the government certification was timely,it is unnecessary for us to decide whether the day limitations period applies to the certification requirement,or whether that requirement is jurisdictional 
we review the district court order granting a motion to suppress for clear error with respect to the underlying factual findings,but we exercise plenary review over legal determinations.united states lewis,cir.the parties disagree,however,on how that standard applies in this case.the government claims to have no quarrel with the district court factual findings and asserts that it is challenging only the legal conclusion that the exclusionary rule applies.it urges us to review this decision de novo.mallory,however,reads the government appeal as a challenge to the factual finding that any exigency justifying warrantless entry into the home dissipated after mallory was taken into custody,a conclusion that he contends we should review for clear error.mallory argument rests on united states coles,in which we stated that t he presence of exigent circumstances is a finding of fact,which we review for clear error,cir.the government asserts that this statement is unsupported dictum that is not binding on this panel.
although a precedential opinion of this court can be overruled only by the court sitting en banc or the supreme court,it is well established that a subsequent panel is not bound by dictum in an earlier opinion.mariana fisher,cir citing cir.iop and burstein ret.account plan for emps.of allegheny health educ.and research,cir.we have defined dictum as a statement in a judicial opinion that could have been deleted without seriously impairing the analytical foundations of the holding that,being peripheral,may not have received the full and careful consideration of the court that uttered it.in re mcdonald,cir internal quotation marks omitted quoting sarnoff am.home prods,cir.
the statement in coles is dictum because the existence of an exigency was not a contested issue in that case,a fact that becomes apparent when the statement is read in context 
the presence of exigent circumstances is a finding of fact,which we review for clear error.the district court found that exigent circumstances the possibility of evidence being destroyed existed after the officers knocked on the hotel room door and demanded entry.coles does not challenge that finding on appeal.he asks us to review only whether the police improperly created the exigency.our attention is thus focused upon this second prong for the remainder of our discussion.
at first emphasis in original citation and footnote omitted.the court then considered whether the police had created the exigency upon which they relied to justify their warrantless entry into a hotel room,taking as established that an exigency existed.id.at.the statement regarding the standard of review served no part in the analysis and thus could be deleted without seriously impairing the court reasoning.mcdonald,at.accordingly,we conclude that the statement in coles is nonbinding dictum and that we must determine in the first instance whether a district court finding on the presence or absence of exigent circumstances is subject to clear error or de novo review.
which standard of review is appropriate in a given circumstance depends on which judicial actor the trial judge or the appellate panel has a comparative advantage in resolving the issue at hand.in united states brown,we adopted a functional analysis for determining the appropriate standard of review for mixed questions of law and fact,an analysis that reflects the relative institutional competencies of district courts and courts of appeals,cir.when there is a need to control and clarify the development of legal principles through the collective judgment of appellate courts,de novo review is appropriate.id.at citing ornelas united states,d.on the other hand,trial judges are better positioned to assess such questions as witness credibility and juror bias because these matters turn on evaluations of demeanor,and therefore we overturn such findings only if they are clearly erroneous.id.we explained the dichotomy further 
if application of the rule of law to the facts requires an inquiry that is essentially factual one that is founded on the application of the tribunal experience with the mainsprings of human conduct the concerns of judicial administration will favor the district court,and the district court determination should be classified as one of fact reviewable under the clearly erroneous standard.if,on the other hand,the question requires us to consider legal concepts in the mix of fact and law and to exercise judgment about the values that animate legal principles,then the concerns of judicial administration will favor the appellate court,and the question should be classified as one of law and reviewed de novo.

when a district court makes factual findings supporting a conclusion that exigent circumstances existed,it makes the type of credibility determinations that district courts are best suited to make,and accordingly we will defer to them unless they are clearly erroneous.but whether the historical facts of a warrantless search or seizure meet the legal test of exigency is the type of question that involves the careful consideration of legal precepts and the values that underlie them,questions that favor de novo review.it is a cardinal principle that searches conducted outside the judicial process,without prior approval by judge or magistrate,are per se unreasonable under the fourth amendment subject only to a few specifically established and exceptions.united states harrison,cir quoting california acevedo,d.nowhere is this more true than in the home,the threshold of which may only be crossed without a warrant or consent when exigent circumstances exist.see payton new york,d id.at t he physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the fourth amendment is directed.internal citation and quotation marks omitted see also kirk louisiana,d as payton makes plain,police officers need either a warrant or probable cause plus exigent circumstances in order to make a lawful entry into a home.de novo appellate review of district court decisions regarding the existence of exigent circumstances is appropriate to carefully police the boundaries of this exception and to ensure that it does not erode the protections of the fourth amendment.
we conclude that,on appeal from a decision involving the presence or absence of exigent circumstances justifying a warrantless search or seizure,this court will review the district court findings of fact for clear error,but will review its conclusion that those facts establish a legal exigency de novo.this decision is consistent with the law in every other circuit and it is consistent with our own decisions regarding mixed questions of law and fact.see,united states perez,cir stating that,on appeal of denial of a motion to suppress,we review the underlying facts for clear error and the application of law to the facts de novo.likewise,we will review de novo a district court conclusion that a exigency has dissipated.
it is undisputed that the officers had probable cause to believe that mallory had committed a crime and that exigent circumstances justified their warrantless entry into the home and subsequent search for him.we must determine whether,after police had located and secured mallory,an exigency remained that justified officer hough search behind the door,which produced the revolver.the government argues that two exigent circumstances justified the search first,that it was necessary to secure the firearm to protect the safety of the officers and to prevent escape,and second,that it was necessary to recover the weapon to prevent it from being moved and hidden while a warrant was being procured 
the fourth amendment protects the people from unreasonable searches and seizures.const.amend.iv.warrantless searches of the home are presumptively unreasonable unless the occupants consent or probable cause and exigent circumstances exist to justify the intrusion.coles,at emphasis in original citing steagald united states,d payton,at.we evaluate whether exigent circumstances existed by an objective standard the subjective intent of the officer is irrelevant.brigham city,utah stuart,d.the government bears the burden of demonstrating that exigent circumstances justified a warrantless search,and that burden is heavy.welsh wisconsin,d.

the government primarily contends that the search was justified by a need to protect officer safety and to prevent mallory escape.in support of this argument,it relies on warden hayden,d.in hayden,police entered a home without a warrant after receiving a report that a man who had just committed an armed robbery had run into the residence.id.at.multiple officers searched the basement,first,and second floors of the home,finding hayden feigning sleep in an upstairs bedroom.id.at.at the same time that hayden was located,the officers found a shotgun and a pistol in the flush tank of a toilet,ammunition in a bureau drawer in hayden room,and evidence of the robbery in a washing machine.id.the supreme court upheld the legality of the officers entry into the home and their search,explaining that 
the fourth amendment does not require police officers to delay in the course of an investigation if to do so would gravely endanger their lives or the lives of others.speed here was essential,and only a thorough search of the house for persons and weapons could have insured that hayden was the only man present and that the police had control of all weapons which could be used against them or to effect an escape.
id.at.the court held that t he permissible scope of search must be as broad as may reasonably be necessary to prevent the dangers that the suspect at large in the house may resist or escape.id.at.
in the government view,officer hough search was legal under hayden because it occurred as the officers escorted mallory out the door in order to maintain control of mallory and prevent any access to a weapon by either him or anyone who would aid him.gov t br.at.but critical to hayden reasoning was the fact that the seizures occurred prior to or immediately contemporaneous with hayden arrest,as part of an effort to find a n armed suspected felon.id.at emphasis added.this case differs from hayden because the gun was n
