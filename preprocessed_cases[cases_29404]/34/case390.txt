dissenting from the denial of en banc review.in this case,defendants challenge their convictions under the maritime drug law enforcement act mdlea.the coast guard found a large quantity of drugs banned under united states law on board the defendants bolivian vessel in the caribbean,en route from colombia to the dominican republic.neither the defendants nor any other crewmembers are nationals,and there is no other specific suggestion of any tie to the united states.i dissent from the denial of en banc review on two grounds set forth below.
sufficiency 
up to now,the rule in this circuit has been that a defendant mere presence at the scene of a discovery of a quantity of illegal drugs is,without additional evidence,insufficient to establish a defendant knowledge of the presence of those drugs.united states steuben,cir.as a result of the panel opinion,that rule is now substituted by one that allows a jury to speculatively link presence to entrustment,and then link entrustment to knowledge.united states,cir torruella,dissenting.i would grant en banc rehearing as to this issue as to crewmembers and to correct this error.
ii.extraterritorial jurisdiction 
additionally,i would grant en banc rehearing as to all defendants to allow this court to reexamine and correct our law on the extraterritorial reach of the mdlea.the defendants,foreign nationals on a ship in waters not subject to jurisdiction,have challenged the application of the mdlea to them in this prosecution.in the panel decision,i concurred in this application,because our circuit precedent clearly forecloses their argument.id.at.
but our precedent has missed an important logical link in its decision to uphold the mdlea against a due process challenge on similar facts.and,as explained below,a convincing argument can be made that due process aside,congress lacks the power to proscribe the instant conduct,which lacks a nexus with the united states.both legal strands lead to the same conclusion we should follow the ninth circuit and impose a requirement that a prosecution under the mdlea establish a nexus between the criminal conduct and the united states.
due process 
in an earlier decision addressing whether the mdlea included a nexus requirement,united states cardales,we agreed with the ninth circuit that mdlea defendants had a due process right not to be subject to this country law enforcement in a manner that was arbitrary or fundamentally unfair,cir citing united states davis,cir.but we concluded that the mdlea,even without a nexus requirement,was neither arbitrary nor unfair.id.we reasoned that through consent of the flag nation,the mdlea comported with the territorial principle of international law,which provides that a state has jurisdiction to prescribe and enforce a rule of law in the territory of another state to the extent provided by international agreement with the other state.id.quoting united states robinson,cir.we also rejected a nexus requirement as we found application of the mdlea consistent with the the protective principle of international law because congress has determined that all drug trafficking aboard vessels threatens our nation security.id.these conclusions are both suspect.the consent of the flag nation is not material to a due process analysis focused on our government power over a foreign individual defendant.and the protective principle is simply inapplicable on these facts.
the protective principle 
i will address the latter rationale first.justifying the reach of the mdlea under the protective principle is not convincing on facts where there is no nexus between the drug trafficking vessel and the united states.robinson,at breyer,observing problems with that principle and so relying only on the territoriality principle.since the drugs at issue in this case were heading for the dominican republic,not the united states,there is not the kind of direct threat to the united states required to trigger the protective principle.see united states perlaza,cir our circuit has recognized the protective principle as part of its consideration of whether nexus exists,not as a substitute for it.
the only response to this argument is that drug trafficking,generally,is such a global threat that the united states is justified in protecting itself by prosecuting traffickers anywhere,regardless of the destination of the drug shipment.see generally finding trafficking to be a threat to the united states.but this broad proposition is not consistent with international law.see restatement third of foreign relations law cmt.f defining the scope of the protective principle as allowing prosecution of offenses directed against the security of the state or other offenses threatening the integrity of governmental functions that are generally recognized as crimes by developed legal systems,such as counterfeiting currency.relying on the protective principle without any nexus would be to conclude that congress could allow for arrests and prosecutions of drug traffickers on the other side of the world,even without consent.this can not be and is not the correct result the protective principle requires a showing that the particular conduct endangered the united states.eugene kontorovich,beyond the article i horizon congress enumerated powers and universal jurisdiction over drug crimes,rejecting,in the context of analyzing congress article i powers,the argument that the mdlea could be justified under the protective principle because drugs not destined for united states markets do not fall into the limited class of offenses directed at the security of the state,since that principle refers to the safety and integrity of the state apparatus itself its government functions or state interests,not its overall physical and moral see also robinson,at identifying,but not resolving,this argument.such interpretation would result in a protective principle which swallows the principle of universal jurisdiction.kontorovich,beyond the article i horizon,supra,at.
the territorial principle 
relying on the consent of the flag nation,the territorial argument could justify our government exercise of power under international law.but this does not mean that all due process concerns are automatically satisfied.in other words,we erred in cardales,and subsequent precedent,by assuming due process was satisfied if international law was satisfied 
rather,compliance with international law is necessary but not sufficient.under the doctrine of personal jurisdiction,principles of due process and comity between the states preclude one state from exercising jurisdiction over individuals where that person lacks sufficient contacts with the forum state.see helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,finding no personal jurisdiction over a foreign defendant in a suit based on a foreign helicopter crash where there were no certain minimum contacts with the forum such that the maintenance of the suit did not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.quoting int l shoe washington.the same result should be applied when our government attempts to exercise criminal jurisdiction over foreign process limits one state power to seize the citizen of another state,absent a nexus between the seizing state and the seized individual.see perlaza,at the nexus requirement is a judicial gloss applied to ensure that a defendant is not improperly haled before a court for trial it serves the same purpose as the minimum contacts test in personal jurisdiction.internal quotation marks om
