opinion of the court 
appellant carl mcbane challenges jury verdicts convicting him of one count of selling a stolen firearm in violation of j and one count of making a materially false statement to a federal agency in violation of.mcbane also seeks resentencing in light of the supreme court decision in united states booker,d.for the reasons set out below,we will uphold the jury verdicts on both the firearm and false statement charges,and we will remand the case to the district court for resentencing.
carl mcbane was employed as a police officer,with the rank of sergeant,for the borough of mckees rocks in allegheny county,pennsylvania at all times relevant to the events described herein.on july,three members of the mckees rocks police department arrested mark suchoza.suchoza was booked and his personal belongings confiscated.among those belongings was a henry model survival caliber rifle.though suchoza was not charged with any crime in connection with owning or possessing the rifle,it was not returned to him when he was released from custody after paying a fine for public intoxication at the time,mcbane was one of two weapons specialists in the department who dealt with firearms brought into the station as evidence or as confiscated personal items.
gerald smith was a local constable for mckees rocks and adjacent municipalities.he was also an informant for the federal bureau of investigation fbi who was cooperating in investigations into public corruption in the municipalities in which he worked.smith testified that he was good friends with mcbane,and that the two both worked security at bingo events held at a local booster club.one night during the summer of,while the two were working together,mcbane showed smith suchoza rifle.smith testified that when asked by smith where he got it,mcbane referred to suchoza,then h e said,well,this rifle was his.he said,we did give it back.i said,what are you going to do with it.he said,i am going to sell it.mcbane then sold the rifle to smith for.smith notified the fbi that he had purchased the rifle from mcbane,and the fbi initiated an investigation.
at the time smith informed the fbi about the rifle,federal agents had already received information from a dispatcher at the mckees rocks police department that mcbane had sold the rifle.the fbi received the information from both sources in june of.thereafter,mcbane attempted to his removal and sale of the rifle and another gun,a caliber handgun he told smith that the fbi was asking questions about the guns and that he needed to get them back and return them to his office at the department.smith agreed to give the guns back to mcbane,but first,and without mcbane knowledge,smith gave them to fbi special agents who photographed them as part of the investigation.the agents then arranged to electronically surveil smith returning the guns to mcbane.in the meantime,mcbane reimbursed smith for the price of the guns.
on august,smith met mcbane and returned the guns to him while wearing a recording device and under surveillance by the fbi.during that encounter,mcbane made the comment to smith that he could now let the fbi come into his office and see the guns.
on september,the same two fbi special agents who had been dealing with smith went to mcbane house and asked him a series of questions focused on the guns mcbane had sold to smith.mcbane told the agents that the guns had never been sold and had remained in the physical custody of the department.mcbane further stated that the guns were stored in his office and that he could show them to the agents.later that day,mcbane showed the agents the guns in his office at the department.that evening,in another recorded conversation with smith,mcbane told smith that he had spoken to the agents and told them that the guns had never left his office.mcbane eventually admitted selling both guns to smith and orchestrating the return of the guns to the office.he also admitted to lying to the agents about the sale of the guns.
mcbane claims that he first became aware of the rifle in late summer and that,weeks later,he removed it from the filing cabinet on which it was sitting and put it in his office.he also contends that he asked several individuals about the rifle origins but got no knowledgeable response and that,sometime later,he ran a computer check on the rifle to determine if it had been stolen and found that the rifle was not in the system.mcbane kept the rifle in his office for two years and removed it in the summer of in order to sell it to smith.
mcbane was charged in a indictment returned on september.counts one and two charged mcbane with selling stolen firearms in violation of j and a and count three charged him with making a materially false statement in violation of a a superseding indictment was filed on march.mcbane pled not guilty,and a jury trial ensued which lasted from april to april,a jury convicted mcbane on count one for selling the rifle to smith and on count three for making the materially false statements to the fbi.he was acquitted of selling the handgun.
the district court denied mcbane motion for judgment of acquittal on april.on july,under the,mandatory regime of the united states sentencing guidelines hereinafter guidelines,mcbane was sentenced to months for each count,to run concurrently,followed by two years of supervised release.mcbane offense level under the guidelines included enhancements for his role in the offense and for the fact that the rifle was stolen mcbane filed a timely appeal challenging the judgments of conviction and his sentence.
as to his convictions,mcbane challenges the jury verdicts as not supported by the evidence.thus,his appeal requires us to decide two issues whether the jury verdict that mcbane knowingly sold a stolen rifle is supported by substantial evidence,and whether the jury verdict that mcbane false statements to fbi special agents were material under is supported by substantial evidence.where a petitioner challenges the sufficiency of the evidence against him as to particular charges and believes that the district court erred as a matter of law in allowing the verdicts to stand,we must sustain the verdict s if there is substantial evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the government,to uphold the jury decision.united states beckett,cir.we do not weigh evidence or determine the credibility of witnesses in making this determination.id.furthermore,we must credit all available inferences in favor of the government in making our determination.united states riddick,cir.
we first address the jury finding that mcbane knowingly sold a stolen rifle to gerald smith in violation of j.most of mcbane argument on this point fails to attack the sufficiency of the government evidence as such.instead,mcbane merely rehashes trial evidence which he views as favorable to him.specifically,mcbane cites evidence he presented at trial indicating that the rifle was legitimately seized originally its owner did not request its return there are no written procedures in mcbane department for disposal of seized property that is not evidence mcbane subjectively knew neither when his ownership of the rifle occurred nor the law of abandoned property.based on these aspects of his case at trial,mcbane asserts that the government presented insufficient evidence that the rifle was stolen or that mcbane knew or should have known it was stolen.
the evidence mcbane presents,however,does little to undermine the government case.the assertions that the rifle was properly confiscated originally and that suchoza never asked for its return do not help mcbane.mcbane was not involved in the rifle lawful confiscation,and,at all events,the issue is whether the rifle was unlawfully kept from taken from the police it was lawfully confiscated.mcbane never sought to return the rifle to suchoza.he sold the rifle for profit without suchoza knowledge or consent,without registering the gun in his own name,and without obtaining the consent of the police department to sell it 
similarly,mcbane defense that he lacked subjective knowledge that the rifle was stolen fails even to address the language in j indicating that mcbane is liable if he ha d reasonable cause to believe the rifle was stolen his assertion that he did not subjectively know it was stolen begs the question of whether he should have known.
for its part,the government presented extensive evidence at trial to support the j charge.as to the theft of the rifle,the government offered,inter alia,mcbane own words from gerald smith testimony at trial 
smith w here did you get the rifle 
mcbane y ou remember suchoza 
smith y eah.
mcbane w ell,this was his w e did give it back.
smith w hat are you going to do with it 
mcbane i am going to sell it.
based on this exchange,a jury could reasonably infer that the rifle did not rightfully belong to mcbane,that mcbane knew as much,and that he intended to sell the rifle anyway.the record clearly establishes that mcbane sold the rifle.as we have indicated,our standard of review precludes us from assessing the credibility of smith testimony.the above evidence alone,taken in the light most favorable to the government,might well be enough to sustain the jury verdict as to mcbane knowing sale of a stolen rifle.
the trial record,however,provides additional evidence that supports the jury verdict.the mckees rocks public safety director testified that mcbane did not take the only lawful step he could have taken to register the gun in his make it his,getting a court order to that effect.the director further testified that mcbane knew he should have taken that step.the government also produced evidence indicating that mcbane had received training in the lawful transfer of firearms and in the proper confiscation and logging of evidence.mcbane himself testified that he was familiar with the policies operative in the department for dealing with confiscated property.finally,the director testified that,in spite of his knowledge of proper procedure,mcbane proceeded to sell suchoza rifle to smith without the consent of the director or suchoza himself,indeed without attempting to get the consent of either all of the above evidence is probative of the finding that mcbane knowingly stole the rifle and sold it.
applying the relevant language from j,and evaluating the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,smith with the testimony of the director and the admissions and testimony of mcbane reasonably could be construed as proof that mcbane sold a stolen rifle that he knew or should have known was stolen.we hold that substantial evidence supports the jury verdict that mcbane sold a stolen rifle to gerald smith in violation of j.
we now turn to the jury finding that mcbane false statements to the fbi special agents were material.the supreme court articulated the definition of materiality under in united states gaudin,d to be material,t he statement must have a natural tendency to influence,or be capable of influencing,the decisionmaking body to which it is addressed.we acknowledged and applied that precise language in united states mclaughlin,cir thus,the language of the standard for materiality is well settled.it is also clear that a statement may be material even if no agency actually relied on the statement in making a decision.see,in re cohn,cir.equally clear is that a statement is material if it is capable of influencing a particular decision of the agency in question.see mclaughlin,at.the dispositive question on this issue is whether the test for materiality necessarily requires that a false statement be capable of influencing an actual,particular decision of the agency at issue,or whether the test requires only that a statement be of a type that would naturally tend to influence a reasonable decisionmaking agency in the abstract.
mcbane argues that because the fbi investigation was essentially complete when the agents spoke to mcbane about the guns,his false statements added nothing.as such,the statements were not material because they were not capable of influencing the particular decisions or actions taken by the fbi agents in this case.the government concedes that mcbane false statements did not influence and were not capable of influencing the decisions or actions of the particular agents to whom mcbane made those statements.the government counters,however,that mcbane false statements were still material because they were of a type that would naturally tend to influence a reasonable decisionmaker.
though we acknowledge that a false statement that actually affects or is capable of affecting a specific decision by an agency makes for an easier materiality determination,we agree with the government that both the language of the materiality standard and the decisions applying that standard require only that the false statement at issue be of a type capable of influencing a reasonable decisionmaker.the language of the materiality standard indicates that a statement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence,or is capable of influencing,the decisionmaking body to which it is addressed.gaudin,at.emphasis added.in our view,the phrase natural tendency connotes qualities of the statement in question that transcend the immediate circumstances in which it is offered and inhere in the statement itself.
supreme court precedent supports this interpretation of the materiality language.kungys united states,d,provides the clearest interpretation of the standard for materiality at the supreme court level.specifically interpreting the phrase natural tendency to influence,justice scalia opinion for the court stated that,rather than letting the infinite variety of factual patterns that may emerge around a statement drive the materiality question,the safer method is to fix as our guide the central object of the inquiry whether the misrepresentation or concealment was predictably capable of affecting,had a natural tendency to affect,the official decision.id.at.emphasis added.in other words,the court judged the relevant inquiry to be whether the falsehood was of a type that one would normally predict would influence the given decisionmaking body.
brogan united states,d,provides further support for the view that materiality does not turn on whether the fbi believed mcbane statements or whether they influenced the investigation.interpreting an earlier version of,the supreme court stated 
it could be argued,perhaps,that a disbelieved falsehood does not pervert an investigation.but making the existence of this crime turn upon the credulousness of the federal investigator or the persuasiveness of the liar would be exceedingly strange such a defense to the analogous crime of perjury is certainly unheard of.
id.at.emphasis in original.the court continued that the possibility of perversion of function exists whenever investigators are told a falsehood relevant to their task.id.at.emphasis added.
additionally,our own decisions have affirmed the government position on materiality,albeit not in the context.in in re cohn,we cited kungys for the proposition,regarding materially false disclosures in the bankruptcy context,that a statement can still be material if it is so substantial that a reasonable person would have relied upon it,even if the creditor did not in fact rely upon it in the case at hand.in re cohn,at first emphasis added.similarly,in mclaughlin,after citing in re cohn for the proposition that actual reliance on the statement is unnecessary to establish materiality,we stated that the relevant inquiry is whether the false information is of the type that is capable of influencing a decision by an agency mclaughlin,at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.
other courts of appeals that have had occasion to interpret the materiality standard have reached the same conclusion.most clearly,the ninth circuit,citing and discussing the above language from kungys in united states service deli,cir,indicated that the test for materiality is the intrinsic capabilities of the statement itself,rather than the possibility of the actual attainment of its end as measured by collateral circumstances.id.at emphasis in original internal quotation marks omitted.
similarly,in united states edgar,cir,the first circuit applied an objective materiality test in a case with i
