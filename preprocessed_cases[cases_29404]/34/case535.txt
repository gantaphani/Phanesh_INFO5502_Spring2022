rocco desimone appeals from his conviction after a jury trial for filing a false tax return,in violation of.he contends that the district court committed prejudicial errors in excluding and admitting evidence at his trial.we affirm desimone conviction.
background and facts 
on august,a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging desimone with wire fraud,in violation of counts and,and making and subscribing a false tax return,in violation of count.at the ensuing trial,the jury acquitted him of wire fraud but found him guilty on the false tax return count.the latter alleged that the false return reported long term capital gains in the amount of,on schedule d,part ii,line item,whereas desimone then and there well knew and believed that he had not earned such long term capital gains but had,instead,earned ordinary income substantially in addition to the amount reported,all in violation of.
the evidence at trial included the following.desimone was an art broker.a mutual friend had introduced desimone to janet salz,an art dealer.she agreed to let desimone sell two of her paintings canal at zaandam by claude monet and les mouettes by henri matisse.according to her testimony,she told desimone she wanted to sell the monet for million and would give desimone a ten percent commission.while he was looking for a buyer,desimone kept salz two paintings at his house.although salz could not identify precisely when she handed desimone the paintings,she testified to doing so not long before the sale and not more than a year.
desimone found a buyer for salz two paintings,as well as for a third painting he had been asked to sell by another owner jeune fille blonde by pierre auguste renoir.james dorcey introduced the buyer,his neighbor michael joyce,to desimone,and the three men met at desimone house in august to view the paintings and negotiate a deal.there was evidence desimone originally told joyce that he was selling the monet for million and the renoir for million,but that he could arrange a lower price if joyce bought all three paintings.joyce agreed to do so,and desimone reduced the asking price of the monet to million and the renoir to million.including the matisse,the package totaled million.
according to salz,desimone contacted her and told her that his buyer would pay only million for the monet,and she agreed to sell it at that price.regarding desimone commission,salz testified that desimone told her that he was going to take any money,because he did give me enough money.
joyce first wired a of to the client escrow account maintained by richard corley,desimone attorney,and subsequently wired to corley same account the second payment of.on desimone instructions,attorney corley paid salz million for the monet and for the matisse.corley also disbursed funds to the owner of the renoir,to another art broker as a commission for the sale of the renoir and the matisse,and to dorcey.other checks written from the joyce deposits in corley escrow account included a total of to desimone,a payment of to corley for his fees,and a payment of to one allen williams to settle a lawsuit that williams had brought against desimone and another man,alleging,inter alia,fraud in connection with an unrelated art transaction.desimone signed over one of the checks that corley had written to him for to donald morin as partial payment towards the settlement of another lawsuit that arose from desimone sale of two ferrari automobiles to morin.
according to irs agent robert ferraro,who testified extensively at trial,desimone net profit was,after deducting certain offsetting expenses but without deducting the payment to williams.contrary to the defense suggestion,the agent did not believe the williams settlement could properly be deducted as a business expense for tax purposes from desimone income.according to ferraro testimony,desimone return should have reported a net profit from the sale of the paintings of and should have resulted in an additional tax payment of.
desimone accountant for about seventeen years was one michael corrado.corrado prepared desimone tax returns based on records that desimone turned over to him.these records included bank statements,check stubs,and checkbook sheets,which recorded cash receipts and disbursements.over the years,corrado had discussed income classifications with desimone,who understood the difference between ordinary income earned from his,which was to be reported on schedule c of a federal income tax return,and capital gains,which were to be reported on schedule d,as well as the classification and implications of versus capital gains.
some time before october,corrado and desimone discussed the sale of some paintings,and,according to corrado,desimone told him that he expected to earn o ne million dollars or better.the two discussed the need to determine the holding period for purposes of properly classifying the gain.corrado explained to desimone that the holding period determined which tax rates applied.
after obtaining two extensions for filing desimone tax return,corrado finally received the pertinent information from desimone and reviewed the documents.the checkbook revealed that desimone had received a towards a commission,which corrado reported on schedule c as income.the same sheet also included an entry of the receipt of a of million.because the paperwork was unclear as to how to classify that income,corrado telephoned desimone on october,and asked him about it.according to corrado,desimone responded that he had sold three paintings from his collection that he owned,and,in response to corrado question,stated that he had owned them for more than one year.during that same conversation,desimone told corrado that dorcey was entitled to a commission on this painting,which entitled desimone to a deduction on his capital gain.
corrado then completed desimone tax return.he reported on schedule d a million capital gain,offset by the payment to dorcey,based on the information that desimone had provided,and listed the acquisition date of the assets as august,which he supplied as an arbitrar y date on his own.although corrado had records for business expenses that were properly listed on schedule c showing a net income of,he had none in connection with the sale of the three paintings,and desimone never told him of any with the exception of the single dorcey payment.corrado did not know that desimone had personally received a net of more than million from the proceeds of the art sale and was unaware that desimone had paid to williams from those proceeds to settle an unrelated lawsuit.desimone and his wife signed the return on october,and it was filed with the irs.
the total tax shown and paid was.after learning that a federal investigation of his tax return was taking place,and that corrado had testified before a grand jury,desimone filed an amended return on april.in this return,he reported million on schedule c as a part of his gross income rather than as a capital gain.the amended return indicated an additional tax due of,for a total tax owed for the year of 
irs agents,including ferraro,first approached corrado about desimone initial tax return on march,five months after corrado had prepared it.they discussed the october telephone conversation in which desimone had allegedly told corrado that he had owned the paintings for more than one year,and the agents served corrado with a grand jury subpoena.corrado had no idea whatsoever that the agents were looking into schedule c versus schedule d income or desimone itemized deductions.
corrado first grand jury appearance was in august.he told the grand jury,as he had the agents in march,that desimone had advised him that he had owned the three paintings for more than a year.more than a year after that grand jury appearance,corrado testified that he had entered upon a period of uncertainty,during which he questioned the classification of the profits from the sale of the paintings.those doubts stemmed from desimone frequent telephone calls to corrado about corrado grand jury testimony and the status of the investigation,and a meeting between corrado and desimone lawyer,corley.in preparation for that meeting,corrado prepared some handwritten notes in which he again reiterated that desimone had told him that he had the paintings for more than one year,but that corrado never asked desimone whether he owned the paintings.he concluded in his notes that rocco was in no way attempting to misrepresent this transaction,and that the issue that has arisen has arisen from nothing more than a miscommunication.
on march,desimone lawyer faxed an affidavit to corrado for his signature,in which he would attribute the misclassification of the profit to his own mistake and error.corrado changed those words to this misunderstanding as to ownership of the art,but the attorney never incorporated corrado changes.at the same time,desimone told corrado that,based upon their longstanding relationship,he did want to have to take legal action against me,which corrado interpreted as a threat of a malpractice suit.corrado then signed the unedited affidavit on april,and desimone signed,on the same day,a document releasing corrado from liability for his role in preparing the tax return.the signed affidavit still incorporated corrado statement that desimone has told him that he had the artwork for more than one year.
agent ferraro reinterviewed corrado on september,armed with the affidavit and corrado grand jury testimony from august.in a stern and raised voice and very assertive manner,ferraro told corrado that it was a crime to lie to a grand jury and a federal agent.in response,corrado claimed that he did not read the affidavit closely,was guilty of no more than a failure to read,and had signed the affidavit to make the whole thing go away.on during trial,corrado conceded that he never asked desimone what he had paid for the paintings or when he had purchased them.he admitted that he simply made up the acquisition date which he entered on schedule d.he did not ask for any documentation.on redirect,corrado was permitted to describe his prior testimony to the grand jury that desimone had told him he had owned the paintings for more than a year.
discussion 
desimone concedes that his initial tax return for,which he signed,should not have categorized the proceeds he received from the sale of the paintings as a capital gain on schedule d but should have instead reported them on schedule c as business income.he also concedes,see note,supra,that whatever the viability of the settlement payments as business expenses,they could not be treated as part of the basis for the sale of art.he denies,however,that the mistakes made in his return were willful,contending instead that they stemmed from his innocent misunderstanding and from mistakes attributable to his accountant corrado,who prepared the return.
in this appeal,desimone argues that the district court committed reversible error by excluding testimony that would have been probative of his lack of willful intent to make a false tax return.additionally,desimone contests the district court admission of evidence he says wrongfully bolstered corrado credibility and a summary chart showing desimone net profit from the sale of the paintings,accompanied by testimony that the williams lawsuit had alleged fraud.we turn to these contentions.
exclusion of evidence of corley testimony concerning desimone request that he call corrado 
we first consider whether the district court erred in refusing to admit testimony by attorney richard corley regarding desimone request that he call desimone accountant,corrado,in connection with whether the payment of to williams in settlement of an unrelated lawsuit should be made from corley client account or from desimone personal account.this request occurred,corley said,just before he remitted to williams the settlement check from the art sale proceeds held in the client escrow account.
attorney corley was called initially as a prosecution witness.during,desimone counsel asked him about such a conversation.the government objected that corley response would be hearsay.the court overruled the objection and permitted desimone counsel to elicit from corley that he had a consultation with my client.he asked me to call his attorney sic concerning the tax ramifications of the williams settlement.defense counsel then sought unsuccessfully to inquire if the heart of the conversation between corley and desimone had gone to whether corley could write the williams check directly from corley client account or whether it needed to be written from desimone checking account.the government persisted in its hearsay objection,and after counsel failed to rephrase the question in a manner satisfactory to the court,the court called for a sidebar conference.
counsel for desimone asserted at the sidebar that corley would testify that,as the sale of the paintings was winding up,desimone asked corley whether he thought the settlement was a expense and whether he could pay williams directly from corley account because the money was there and corley was writing checks,or whether the money needed to go into his personal checking account so that he could pay it from there.defense counsel represented t he allegation by the government is incredibly important that this was used to pay a personal debt,and it was paid out of here so that there would be no record of it and no one would ever see it.and corrado told corley,this was in consultation with my client,which i never get into,that it was a wash.counsel continued this was money he desimone had earned as a result of his business enterprises,and this was money that he was paying to settle a dispute in connection with his business affairs and,therefore,the words used was a wash.
the government objected that the conversation was hearsay,submitting that it did not qualify as party opponent hearsay under.d.defense counsel responded,i am asking him not for the truth.when the district court challenged this rationale,defense counsel argued instead that the testimony could go to the receiver state of mind.there could be things,judge,that would be relevant but go to the receiver of the statement state of mind as to why he did certain things.the district court sustained the government hearsay objection for now and granted its motion to strike.the court offered to reconsider its ruling if desimone counsel could come back to the matter at a break and show the court why i wrong on that.desimone counsel never did so.
a week later,corley again took the stand,this time as a witness for the defense.the defense again sought unsuccessfully to introduce his testimony about the phone call to corrado.the government once more objected.by then,the accountant,corrado,had testified,i do recall ever speaking to attorney corley in response to questions that included specific reference to the occasion of the williams settlement.the government took vigorous exception to an anticipated defense argument that corley testimony about corrado should be admitted as a prior inconsistent statement,inconsistent with corrado testimony that he did recall speaking to corley about the williams settlement.the court ruled that corley testimony was not inconsistent with that of corrado,because the accountant did not deny that the conversation took place but simply did not recall it.
admissibility of desimone request that corley call corrado 
we first consider whether the court erred in refusing to admit corley testimony regarding desimone request to call corrado.we reserve until later our consideration of the admissibility of corley evidence of corrado alleged response during the call.
the government concedes that evidence of desimone request to corley to make a call to corrado in order to determine whether payment of the williams settlement could be made from the escrow account would have been admissible as nonhearsay circumstantial evidence of desimone state of mind at the time,see,united states murphy,cir instructions were not hearsay but offered simply to show that they were given,or else under the hearsay exception for desimone state of mind.but the government points out that desimone never told the district judge at any time during the trial that those were grounds for admitting corley testimony.this was so even though the court invited the defense to revisit the matter and show it why its exclusionary ruling was wrong,and even though,after the first exclusionary ruling,the defense had a week to research possible legal bases for admitting the evidence before that issue was again discussed during corley renewed testimony.because the trial court was never advised of the above viable grounds for admission,the government contends we may review the court exclusionary ruling for at most plain error we agree.
at trial,desimone counsel initially provided the judge with no specific basis for overruling the government hearsay objection.thereafter,defense counsel said the proffer went to the receiver state of mind,and,a week later,argued that it would show specifically corley state of mind and that the settlement payment was a valid business deduction.that the evidence would show not corley but desimone state of mind is a proposition that seems first to have been advanced after the conclusion of the trial,when the court heard argument on desimone motion for bail pending appeal.the district court correctly noted then that the ground had not been presented at trial 
as the district court was not advised during the trial that corley testimony that desimone asked him to call corrado would be admissible on the theories now proposed,we reject the claim of error based on them.see united states piva,cir defense counsel failure to tell the trial judge why an apparently exception to the hearsay rule arguably did not apply precluded defendant from raising the argument on appeal broun et,mccormick on evidence ed.without timely knowledge of the relevant evidentiary purpose,the trial court can not be held accountable on appeal for not applying the unreferenced grounds.united states whiting,cir.e xplaining the purpose for which disputed evidence is offered is normally required to preserve the issue on appeal a general reference to fighting fire with fire is hardly much help to a district judge trying to make rulings in the middle of a hectic trial.citation omitted,cert.denied,d.
the failure of counsel to have informed the trial court of the correct evidentiary theory under which evidence is sought to be admitted is ordinarily a waiver of the right to argue that theory on appeal.mccormick on evidence.in exceptional circumstances,such a failure might conceivably amount to a forfeiture rather than a waiver,reviewable on appeal for plain error.see jack weinstein margaret berger,weinstein federal evidence ed.but here the exclusion of corley testimony did not rise to the level of a plain error,what may be described as a blockbuster exclusionary ruling that was not only wrong but went to the fairness,integrity and public reputation of the trial.united states,cir united states griffin,cir,cert.denied,d.while desimone request that corley speak to corrado on the matter presented,had it been admitted,might have provided a further talking point for the defense,it was not a matter of such fundamental importance.
desimone overstates the purport of his counsel proffer and the persuasiveness of the argument he says he would have made based thereon.the proffer said nothing about whether and what corrado was told of the source of the sums on deposit in corley client account.while counsel initially said desimone wished him to ask corrado about the tax ramifications of the williams settlement,the heart of the inquiry,as it was portrayed,was not taxes per se but whether corley could write the williams settlement check directly from corley client account,as would be most convenient because the money was there and corley was writing checks,or whether the williams check needed to be written from desimone personal checking account.desimone would have the jury infer from this that corley was investigating whether the art sale proceeds were themselves business income that he was obtaining tax advice relevant to that question,and that this would help convince the jury that desimone had acted in good faith more than a year later when he signed the erroneous tax return mischaracterizing the sale of the paintings as a capital gain.but this argument,assuming arguendo it were supported by the thin evidence in the proffer,seems as likely to imply bad faith as it does good faith the more desimone had personally looked into the tax situation and learned the art transactions involved only business income,the less credible his claim of innocent mistake when he later signed the tax return showing a capital gain.
the excluded evidence lacked fundamental probative value for other reasons.the alleged conversation between desimone and corley took place in august or september of,and desimone made the alleged misrepresentation to corrado about holding the paintings for more than a year and signed the fraudulent return more than a year later in october.any link between desimone state of mind at the time he asked corley to make the call to corrado and the time he committed the alleged crime was tenuous.united states cianci,cir to be admissible under this exception,a declaration,among other things,must mirror a state of mind,which,in light of all the circumstances,including proximity in time,is reasonably likely to have been the same condition existing at the material time.quoting colasanto life ins.of north america,cir.even had desimone been thinking of reporting the profit as ordinary business income in august or september,further reflection could easily have led him to a different cast of thought a year later as he meditated upon the difference between the tax rates for ordinary income and capital gains and the fact that his taxes were coming due.further,the offers of proof never linked desimone inquiry to his receipt of the monies from joyce or suggested that his question was somehow premised on the fact that the income was unrelated to the expense.
we do not find plain error in the district court exclusion of desimone alleged request for corley to call corrado.
corrado replies to corley 
desimone also contends,separately,that the evidence of corrado replies to corley in which corrado supposedly said that the defendant income and the williams settlement were a wash was admissible to show desimone good faith reliance on his accountant advice and as a prior inconsistent statement impeaching corrado testimony.the first ground,however,depends upon the exceptions for desimone state of mind already discussed,see supra,section a.that basis was not preserved at the trial because it was never presented to the court.nor was omission of the testimony for that purpose plain error,again for reasons already mentioned.
we add that insofar as corrado reference to a wash was supposed to show desimone good faith by indicating the seeking and receipt of correct advice from his accountant,the argument suffers from a further weakness.to be used defensively in a tax case,the advice of an accountant calls for a showing that the information necessary to the accountant advice was known to the accountant before rendering the advice.compare united states bishop,cir,cert.denied,d.but here there was no evidence in the proffer or elsewhere in the record that desimone or corley at this time provided corrado with information about the sources of the client funds,viz.the sale of the paintings and who had owned them,or about the nature and deductibility of the sum paid in settlement of the unrelated williams lawsuit.nor was corrado asked at this time for advice as to how desimone proceeds from the sale of the paintings would be reportable,either as business income,a capital gain or otherwise.we see little strength in the good faith reliance argument as now described.
desimone argument that the evidence was admissible as a prior inconsistent statement to impeach corrado testimony likewise fails.corrado testimony was that he did not recall whether corley had called him about the williams payment.such testimony was not necessarily inconsistent with corley proffered testimony about the conversation.see united states winchenbach,cir rule b of the federal rules of evidence applies when two statements,one made at trial and one made previously,are irreconcilably at odds.although s tatements need not be directly contradictory in order to be deemed inconsistent within the purview of rule b,udemba nicoli,cir,the decision whether an inconsistency exists lies within the sound discretion of the district court.id the district court did not abuse its discretion here.corrado never denied that the conversation took place.rather,he stated that he did not recall it.his asserted inability to recollect it was not implausible given the lapse between the time the conversation allegedly took place and corrado trial testimony.his purported lack of recollection also finds some support in corrado telephone call to desimone in october,more than a year after the corley conversation,seeking to determine the source of the million in income.
desimone argues that corrado wash statement to corley was inconsistent with corrado testimony that desimone never told him that he used the proceeds from the art sale to make the williams settlement payment.but as it was corley,not desimone,who spoke to corrado,and as it was not indicated that corley informed corrado about the source of the escrow account funds,the proffer did not indicate that desimone told corrado that the proceeds from the art sale were being used to make the williams settlement.corrado purported reference to a wash was therefore not inconsistent with desimone not having told corrado about the use of the art sale proceeds.
desimone additional argument that corrado alleged conversation with corley was inconsistent with the substance of corrado testimony that desimone told him to treat the proceeds as a capital gain also reads too much into the corley offer of proof.the proffer,even when interpreted in the light most favorable to desimone,said nothing about the source of the business income against which the deduction could be taken and was,therefore,not at variance with corrado testimony that desimone told him that he sold the paintings from his collection and had owned them for more than a year.desimone argues that this interpretation of the proffer is too literal because the only account with sufficient funds was the business account,thus implying that desimone must have believed in good faith that the profit from the paintings was business income and hence signed the return through oversight or for some reason other than willfulness.but the record indicates little more than that desimone wanted corley to write a check to williams attorney because the money was there and corley was writing checks.
in the circumstances,we find no breach of discretion in the court exclusion of corrado alleged response to corley during the conversation.
ii.admission of grand jury testimony as prior consistent statement 
desimone contends that the district court erred in admitting corrado grand jury testimony given in august as a prior consistent statement during his testimony at trial.desimone insists that the testimony did not meet the foundational requirements of.d b evidence offered to rebut an express or implied charge of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive.desimone argued at trial,inter alia,that corrado had a motive to lie when he testified before the grand jury in august,as well as later,and that the claim of fabrication was insufficiently recent to justify admission of the prior consistent statement.we find no merit in any of these arguments.
a major flaw with desimone argument is that his own counsel,during,elicited from corrado the substance of the very same grand jury testimony that desimone now claims was later improperly admitted as a prior consistent statement thus even if the court were to have erred in allowing the evidence as a prior consistent statement,we see no harm.but,in fact,the court evidentiary ruling was not a breach of its discretion.
to start at the beginning during of corrado,defense counsel attempted to discredit corrado direct testimony that desimone had told him during their october telephone conversation that he had sold three paintings that he had owned for more than a year.to show that corrado testimony was false,defense counsel pointed to corrado signing on april,of the affidavit in which he took personal responsibility for making a mistake and error in preparing the tax return.defense counsel also elicited from corrado that in,before the federal grand jury,he had testified along the same lines as he had just done on direct.
q you testified under oath before a federal grand jury in is that correct 
q and at that time,is it accurate to say you testified consistent with the testimony you given today on direct examination is that correct 
government counsel objection,your honor.it overbroad.
court overruled.
the jury was thus apprised,then and there,by the questioning of the defense,that in corrado had testified consistently with the direct testimony they had just heard.as noted,this was the very testimony desimone later objected to as inadmissible under the prior consistent statement rubric.
the court contested ruling followed vigorous of corrado on the subject of agent ferraro visit to corrado office.the visit took place several months after april,when corrado had signed the affidavit taking greater responsibility for the faulty tax return.ferraro brought along the affidavit and corrado prior grand jury testimony.desimone attorney elicited testimony that ferraro warned corrado that it was a federal crime to lie to a grand jury,and that it was a federal crime to lie to a federal agent in the course of his conducting his duties.corrado acknowledged that ferraro was very assertive,stern in his voice,and spoke with a raised voice at times.
during the government redirect examination,corrado testified,without any objection,that he told ferraro during a first interview in march that the taxpayer informed me that he had owned those paintings and had owned them for greater than one year.but when the prosecutor subsequently returned to the topic of corrado august grand jury testimony,defense counsel objected to corrado being allowed to answer the prosecutor question about the substance of the testimony,claiming that there was no allegation of a recent fabrication my understanding,respectfully,judge,of what a recent fabrication is is when you are alleging that the witness sic,i mean,recent,as in very recent,we talking about.this is.the court observed that defense counsel had essentially alleged that his corrado testimony in this trial was a fabrication.defense counsel countered right.respectfully,judge,the recent fabrication as it relates to this type of rehabilitation with a prior consistent statement has a very specific meaning.and the meaning is that i have to be alleging that the witness is changing his testimony at the moment,i mean,as in inconsistent with all of his prior statements.
the government argued in response that the prior testimony rebutted a claim of recent fabrication,and improper influence and motive,because defense counsel suggested that corrado changed his story back after a visit from robert ferraro in.the district court agreed.
corrado then testified that he previously had testified before the grand jury in,under oath and under penalty of perjury,that the paintings were owned by desimone and that he owned the paintings and owned them for a period of greater than one year.defense counsel returned to the topic during.in response to questioning,corrado testified that he had previously testified twice to the grand jury that desimone owned the paintings for more than one year,that he told the same facts to a federal agent,and that lying to either is a federal crime.
as we have already indicated,any error in admitting corrado grand jury testimony under.d b would be harmless given that defense counsel had himself earlier brought out the substance of that testimony.but even were that not so,the court ruling was plainly proper.the district court decision to admit a prior consistent statement is reviewed for abuse of discretion.united states washington,cir.whether,in particular,the prior statement rebuts a charge of recent fabrication or improper motive or influence is reviewed for clear error.piva,at.there was neither abuse of discretion nor clear error here.
a prior consistent statement is not hearsay if it is consistent with the declarant testimony and is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive.d b.in interpreting the rule,the supreme court has held that the prior consistent statement must have been made before the alleged influence,or motive to fabricate,arose.tome united states,d.
corrado grand jury testimony in august,predated one of the main events defendant asserts constituted an influence or motive to fabricate,namely,ferraro september interview with corrado at which he pressured corrado to retract his affidavit accepting blame for the erroneous tax return.during,defense counsel attempted to establish that the version of events recounted in corrado affidavit that the erroneous tax return was the result of corrado error was correct,and that corrado different testimony in before the grand jury and at trial had resulted from agent ferraro threats during the september interview.desimone attorney emphasized the stern warning ferraro had given to corrado of the criminal penalties for lying to the grand jury and to federal agents.corrado said he felt so intimidated during the interview that he offered the rationale that he had not read the affidavit very carefully before signing it and that he was merely guilty of a failure to read.during summation,defense counsel later discussed at length the issue of corrado rejection of the contents of his affidavit.counsel contended that ferraro had read corrado the riot act.he asserted that corrado direct testimony at trial was the result of his need to preserve himself,especially given his earlier statements along the same lines in.
corrado did not have a comparable motive to lie in august when he first testified before the grand jury,doing so in a manner consistent with his later grand jury and trial testimony.corrado testified that he was unaware of the nature of the investigation when ferraro first approached him in the months before his grand jury appearance.there was no suggestion that at that time ferraro pressured him to implicate desimone or to shape his testimony to a version of events.
desimone argues that corrado acquired a different motive to lie early on.this motive arose,desimone says,as soon as corrado learned the irs agents were investigating the incorrect return he had prepared,since the mistakes in the return would open him to a malpractice suit.but it was not a clearly erroneous factual finding for the court to conclude that the improper influence particularly emphasized by the defense,agent ferraro threats made in september,did not exist at the earlier time.piva,at.the possible existence of an earlier and different motive to lie would not prevent the admission of a prior consistent statement designed to rebut a subsequent different claim of fabrication.nor do we see anything in the lengths of time between and and that would call the ruling into question.
we conclude,therefore,that the court ruling of admissibility under.d b was not clearly erroneous.and as earlier noted,the fact defense counsel himself elicited the same information makes the issue largely academic.
iii.admission of summary chart 
desimone argues that the district court abused its discretion in admitting into evidence a summary chart prepared by agent ferraro itemizing desimone receipt of payments and net profits relative to the sale of the paintings.we find no abuse of discretion.
background 
agent ferraro was the main government witness testifying to desimone tax obligations.ferraro began his testimony by describing his own qualifications and expertise,developed during years as a special agent with the criminal investigation division of the irs and eleven years as a revenue officer and revenue agent.he testified to having investigated desimone to determine if his tax return,especially schedules c and d,was accurate.he said he had analyzed relevant documents in the case and had observed the trial.
ferraro testified to having prepared a determine desimone total net profit from the sale of the paintings.marked as government exhibit,the document had entries comprising the total deposits in corley client account,expenses,and disbursed net profit.the prosecutor asked ferraro whether the worksheet fairly and accurately summarize d your analysis of the transaction regarding the sale of the monet,the matisse,and the renoir,and ferraro responded that it did.the district court admitted the document over defense objection,observing that it a summary.everything listed here has been admitted.defense counsel argued that he was not objecting on the ground that the underlying documents were not in evidence,but that the exhibit was a worksheet and not a summary.he conceded that i f counsel wants to call it something else,then it may be admissible.the court overruled the objection.defense counsel did not seek any instruction limiting the jury use of the document.
discussion 
we review the admission of an exhibit like the summary chart for abuse of discretion.united states sawyer,cir.it is hard to imagine an issue on which a trial judge enjoys more discretion than as to whether summary exhibits will be helpful.fraser major league soccer,cir,cert.denied,d.
the court here did not identify the particular rule under which it admitted the summary chart.in its submission,the government had advocated the chart admission under,a rule addressing the summary admission of materials too voluminous to be introduced individually.in its appellate brief,the government argues the chart was properly allowed pursuant to.a,which authorizes the court to exercise reasonable control over the mode of presenting the evidence so as to make the presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth,and avoid needless consumption of time.desimone contests both grounds for admission.in a letter submitted pursuant to fed.j,the government now suggests the chart was properly admitted pursuant to,which provides for the admission of materials on which expert testimony relies.
our court has recently considered the interrelationship of the foregoing three rules in united states milkiewicz,cir.much of what was said there is relevant here and need not be repeated.the rules are not mutually exclusive and often may be read together in a common sense manner.id.desimone insists that the chart did not summarize underlying documents that had been made available to the opposing party and was not accurate and as required under rule that it did not fit within rule a and that as ferraro was not qualified as an expert,the chart could not be introduced under rule.without necessarily discounting the relevance of rules and a,we find rule dispositive in validating admission of the chart here.
rule allows a court to provide the jury,in appropriate circumstances,with the facts or data underlying an expert opinion,and such material may be presented in the form of a summary chart.milkiewicz,at.contrary to desimone contention,ferraro was qualified to testify as an expert.at the outset of his testimony,ferraro testified to his special knowledge and experience in the taxation field.in comparable instances,we have said that an irs agent is qualified to express an opinion on the tax consequences of a transaction.id.at citing united states mikutowicz,cir an irs agent presumably is qualified to testify as an expert regarding the amount of an outstanding tax liability.
