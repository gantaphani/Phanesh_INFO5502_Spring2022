opinion of the court 
appellant nelson diaz was convicted by a jury of possession of a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking o n or about march,in violation of c count i,app.at possession with intent to distribute heroin i n or about november,through march,in violation of a count ii,app.at and an additional possession of a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking i n or about january and before march,in violation of c count iii,app.at.the district court sentenced diaz to a term of months sum of consecutive sentences of months for each firearm count and months for possession with intent to distribute heroin.
diaz appeals on two grounds.first,he contends that his convictions and consecutive sentences for the two firearm charges violate the double jeopardy clause.second,diaz asserts that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motions for a mistrial which he filed because the court admitted the testimony of three government witnesses that they feared retaliation for their testimony.
factual backgrounda.the shooting of albert pierce 
the underlying facts are not contested.diaz sold heroin at the hall manor housing project in harrisburg beginning in november and continuing through late march,at a price that undercut that of albert pierce,another drug dealer operating out of hall manor.in march,pierce physically assaulted diaz,and soon thereafter,on or about march,diaz and others confronted pierce.shots were fired by several people,including diaz,and pierce was fatally wounded.it is not known who fired the fatal shot 
diaz was indicted in april on one count that he possessed,carried,and used a firearm in furtherance of a offense,in violation of c,on or about march,and a second count of possession with intent to distribute heroin,in violation of a.a superseding indictment filed five months later retained the two original counts and added,as a third count,another c charge that diaz possessed,carried,and used a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense i n or about january and before march,app.at.diaz pled not guilty to the superseding indictment,and the case proceeded to trial.
b.the trial proceedings 
in its jury instructions,the court explained that the jurors had to first consider whether diaz had committed the underlying offense contained in count ii of the superseding indictment.the court further instructed that if the jury found in the affirmative as to that question,it could then consider whether diaz committed the firearm charges in counts i and iii.the government sought to prove at trial that diaz had used firearms for different purposes throughout his activities,but aside from the separate dates contained in counts i and iii,the court jury instructions did not specify distinct purposes with regard to the separate c charges the jury quickly returned a guilty verdict on all three counts.
on appeal,diaz does not contest the facts alleged in the indictment.in other words,he concedes there was sufficient evidence to support the heroin distribution count and that he possessed a firearm on at least two occasions,one each during the dates specified in counts i and iii.instead,he raises a legal challenge to his convictions on the two firearms counts.he also contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a mistrial on the ground that the testimony of three government witnesses that each feared becoming known in their community as a snitch,app.at,prejudiced the jury by implying that diaz had threatened the witnesses.
c.the sentence 
in the presentence report psr,the probation office found that diaz was a career offender,that the sentencing guidelines provided for a sentence in the range of to months for the violation in count ii,and that counts i and iii mandated an additional consecutive sentence of months for count i and months for count iii,for a total recommended range of months.the calculation regarding the firearm offenses was based on,and c a i c i,which require a minimum sentence of five years months for one c violation,a minimum consecutive sentence of years months for each subsequent c violation,and that these sentences run consecutively to the term imposed for the underlying drug offense.
diaz objected to the psr on the ground that punishing him under c with a five year term for one of the firearm offenses and an additional year term for the second firearm offense based on the same predicate offense subjected him to successive punishments for the same offense in violation of the double jeopardy clause.the district court agreed,relying on the weight of authority from other circuits and referring to this court opinion in united states casiano,cir the district court predicted that we would require convictions on separate predicate offenses before a district court could constitutionally find a second or subsequent conviction and impose a year consecutive sentence under c c.
although the district court sustained diaz objections to the psr and agreed not to impose an additional year sentence under c c,it nonetheless imposed two ten year consecutive sentences for the c convictions.diaz argued that the court was still improperly imposing multiple penalties for a single offense,but the district court was unpersuaded.it stated that double jeopardy principles merely precluded counting multiple c offenses charged in connection with a single predicate offense as second or subsequent convictions under c c,which would automatically trigger additional year consecutive sentences.on appeal,diaz raises as his principal issue whether the district court may impose two consecutive sentences for firearm possession in furtherance of drug trafficking when he was convicted on only one predicate drug trafficking offense.
jurisdiction and standards of review 
the district court had jurisdiction under.this court has jurisdiction under and.this court review of a district court interpretation of the federal sentencing guidelines and constitutional questions is plenary.united states mckoy,cir.we review the district court denial of diaz motions for mistrial for abuse of discretion.united states rivas,cir.moreover,such discretion is construed especially broadly in the context of rule.united states kemp,cir.
discussiona.double jeopardy and c 
we turn first to diaz argument that his sentence to two consecutive terms of months each for the c convictions is greater punishment than the legislature intended,and is thus prohibited by the double jeopardy clause.appellant br.at quoting missouri hunter.
the constitutional question in this the c convictions and consecutive sentences violate the double jeopardy on legislative intent.with respect to cumulative sentences imposed in a single trial,the double jeopardy clause does no more than prevent the sentencing court from prescribing greater punishment than the legislature intended.hunter,at.it is thus incumbent on us first to analyze the statutory text.
section c provides,in pertinent part 
a ny person who,during and in relation to any drug trafficking crime uses or carries a firearm,or who,in furtherance of any such crime,possesses a firearm,shall,in addition to the punishment provided for such drug trafficking crime be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than years and if the firearm is a rifle,shotgun,or semiautomatic assault weapon,to a term of imprisonment of not less than years and if the firearm is a machinegun,to a term of imprisonment of not less than years in the case of a second or subsequent conviction under this subsection,the person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than years n o term of imprisonment imposed on a person under this subsection shall run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment 
c a i,b i,b ii,c i d ii.
our analysis must begin by deciding what is the proper unit of prosecution for c.see united states pollen,cir.most of the courts of appeals that have addressed this issue agree with diaz that it is the underlying predicate crime,the drug distribution count.indeed,nine courts of appeals have so held.see,united states rodriguez,cir united states baptiste,cir.the government differs,arguing that
