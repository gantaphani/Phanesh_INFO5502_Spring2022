plaintiff sharon kaytor appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut,dominic squatrito,judge,dismissing her complaint alleging principally that defendant electric boat electric boat or the company,her former employer,discriminated against her on the basis of gender by maintaining a hostile work environment and retaliated against her for complaining about sexual harassment by her supervisor,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,et title vii,and state law.the district court granted summary judgment dismissing the complaint,concluding,inter alia,that kaytor failed to adduce evidence that would permit inferences that the incidents of which she complained were sufficiently pervasive or severe to create a hostile work environment,were,or were retaliation for her protests against sexual harassment.on appeal,kaytor contends that summary judgment was inappropriate because there were genuine issues of material fact to be tried as to each of her claims.for the reasons that follow,we agree that summary judgment was inappropriate with respect to kaytor claims of hostile work environment and with respect to one aspect of her claims of retaliation,and we remand for further proceedings with respect to those claims.as to kaytor other claims,we affirm the judgment of dismissal.
background 
electric boat designs and builds nuclear submarines for the united states navy in groton,connecticut.kaytor worked at electric boat from until her employment was terminated by the company in january.her claims of gender discrimination center on her treatment by daniel mccarthy,one of the managers in the engineering department,from through april.the following description,taken largely from kaytor deposition testimony in the present action kaytor dep.and from,to an extent,electric boat investigative report dated july,eb report or report,with respect to kaytor complaints about mccarthy,sets out the evidence in the light most favorable to kaytor as the party against whom summary judgment was granted.
a.the events involving mccarthy 
from until late january kaytor was an administrative assistant in electric boat engineering department,and from until she was secretary to mccarthy.his branch of the department included several dozen engineers,whose work was overseen by six supervisors who reported to him.kaytor testified that her job with mccarthy included ordering supplies for the entire engineering department,which included engineers.see kaytor dep.this entailed some degree of discretion.mccarthy would give her a budget and have her determine,based on her knowledge and experience,what should be ordered kaytor would send mccarthy information as to whatever she was ordering,and he would routinely approve.see id.at.kaytor testified that during the first several years in which she worked directly for mccarthy,their relationship was suitably businesslike.see id.at.
in and,however,mccarthy was having problems,going through a divorce id.at see id.at,eb report at,and seemed to undergo a change of character see kaytor dep.although he never touched kaytor in a violent or sexual way,never asked her for sex,and never asked her out on a date see id.at,in mccarthy began making inappropriate comments to her and engaging in sexually suggestive behavior.although he frequently made fun of women,especially of their weight,and made comments about their bodies see id.at,mccarthy paid kaytor compliments on her clothing see id.at and told her she looked good for a woman her age see eb report at.some of his comments were not in and of themselves offensive,but on many occasions kaytor perceived mccarthy to be staring at her body and leering at her see kaytor dep.she testified that her reaction was to ignore the look id.at.on one occasion,mccarthy entered kaytor office and complimented her on two scarves that were lying on her desk.he then picked them up,brought them to his nose and he sa id,umm,they smell like you.id.at.mccarthy then approached kaytor more closely,apparently smelling her hair kaytor became nervous,turned her back,and started typing until mccarthy departed.see id.
kaytor testified that she believes mccarthy had designs on her and that when things did not go his way,the relationship became sour and he would make many comments to me,such as stating you have a flat ass.kaytor dep.see also id.at i believe mccarthy was very bitter because i would not associate with him outside the workplace or fall for his advances.mccarthy initial flat ass comment,which he promptly repeated,came out of the blue while kaytor was talking to one of the supervisors all of a sudden out of the blue mccarthy yells out at the top of his lungs and everybody could hear,you have a flat ass.id.at.
mccarthy also threatened kaytor with physical harm see kaytor dep.and often wished her dead,saying i like to see you in your coffin id.at.on at least six occasions,mccarthy said he wanted to choke kaytor,id.at.coworkers who overheard these comments would come up to kaytor and say,do you realize what he saying,sharon you should start thinking about taking it more seriously.id.at.kaytor testified that,instead,she would brush it off time and time again.id.at.kaytor did not complain to the company human resources department hr about the choking comments but did complain to her union counselor,who told her to cut mccarthy some slack because he was going through a divorce so she kept brushing it off thinking he does mean it but the more he kept saying it,she became a little bit nervous.id.at.kaytor testified that on one occasion,mccarthy called me into his office and he said out of the blue,i wish you were retired.and i said,why and he said,so i could come to your home and choke you.id.at.
kaytor also described an incident in which she had informed mccarthy that she needed to leave the office at a certain time for a doctor appointment,and she and some of her female coworkers had discussed that she was to have her annual checkup with her gynecologist.mccarthy apparently overheard that discussion and as kaytor was leaving,walking down the hallway,mccarthy yelled,in the presence of several coworkers,you are going where every man wants to be.kaytor dep.on another occasion,mccarthy stated that kaytor was spreading her legs for the doctor.id.at.
kaytor complained about some of these events to her union representative but until april,she had not complained to electric boat higher management.in early,kaytor had told mccarthy that if he did not cease his comments she was going to report his remarks to a company vice president in response,mccarthy got a horrid look on his face and he said i kill you.kaytor dep.s cared to death by this response,kaytor went back to her office and said to herself,oh boy,i better never do that.id.at.
the incident that finally led kaytor to complain to electric boat higher management occurred in late april,on administrative assistant day.it was a custom in the company engineering department for supervisors to recognize that day by giving their administrative assistants or secretaries gifts.in the years prior to,mccarthy had given kaytor nice flowers or gifts of or.see kaytor dep.on april,mccarthy gave kaytor an unattractive potted bush and a card that kaytor believed were intended to be derogatory and sexual.id.at.the handwritten message on the card read,i wish you the best and thank you for your help this past year.the plant be planted outside and i hope bring s you pleasure in the years ahead.kaytor dep.exhibit emphases in original.kaytor found the card offensive because of the nature of the plant see kaytor dep.the plant was a variety of salix commonly known as a pussy willow.
b.the company response to kaytor protest 
a fter the pussy willow incident,kaytor could take any more.kaytor dep.she complained to the company ombudsperson and,within a week or two of the incident a delay because she was scared id.at,she complained about mccarthy to hr.the pussy willow bush was apparently the talk of the office.kaytor testified that an hr employee,cheryl stergio,told her that people were talking about it throughout the plant id.at,and that stergio said coming in to work,and just walking down the hall,she could hear people talking about what mccarthy did to kaytor,the pussy willow bush and the flat ass comment id.at.bryan burdick,a staff engineer who had been away when kaytor received the plant,heard talk on the floor about it from about a half dozen people when he returned.eb report at.
hr conducted an investigation of kaytor complaints,interviewing kaytor,mccarthy,burdick,several of kaytor coworkers,and al crogle,a supervisor who reported to mccarthy.the eb report described,inter alia,statements from coworker linda christie who had heard mccarthy make the flat ass comment.eb report at.christie said that mccarthy used crass language with everyone,regardless of gender.she said that on one occasion she had gone to mccarthy office to ask where sharon kaytor was,and mccarthy replied she spreading her legs for the doctor.id.at.when asked about the pussy willow bush incident,christie said she believed that mccarthy intended to annoy kaytor with the plant by its underlying sexual connotation.she added,however,if anyone else got the same plant as a gift i do think that it would have had the same effect of underlying sexual connotation.id.emphasis in report.another coworker,sheryl williams,said she had seen the bush and found it to be a poor specimen in ordinary circumstances,she would have considered it simply a poor choice of a gift.id.at emphasis in report.however,williams,said that kaytor had relayed to her incidents where dan had harassed kaytor.if those stories are true,williams could see the plant having a sexual connotation based on the name id.emphasis in report.
mccarthy,in his hr interview,ascribed kaytor accusations to her displeasure with him because she believed he had not supported her in a workers compensation claim.see eb report at.he admitted making a flat ass comment in a conversation with kaytor in his office,but he stated that he had simply been repeating a doctor remark that kaytor herself had relayed to mccarthy several times eb report at remarks and conversations that kaytor a bsolutely denied had ever occurred kaytor dep.mccarthy also stated that kaytor had initiated conversations with him about her breast size and sex life see eb report at an assertion that kaytor testified was entirely untrue kaytor dep.
when asked specific questions regarding the allegations made by kaytor eb report at,mccarthy responses were,inter alia,that he d id not recall telling kaytor he wanted to choke her that he ha d no recollection of saying he wanted to see kaytor in her coffin or that he wanted to come to her home and choke her that he had no recollection of picking up a scarf from kaytor desk and smelling it and that he had no recollection of making a comment as to kaytor spreading her legs for the doctor.id.at emphases in report.
on may,the day after the hr investigation was begun,kaytor was transferred away from mccarthy within an hour of her first interview with hr,the company packed up her belongings and moved her to an office down the hall see kaytor dep.she was reassigned to work for crogle,a supervisor with whom she had previously had a friendly relationship see,id.at,crogle was supervised by mccarthy.on the day after that reassignment,hr offered kaytor the opportunity to be retransferred to her old job with mccarthy.see id.at.she considered it but eventually declined.see id.at.she was not offered an opportunity to work in a different company building or to work for anyone who was not supervised by the manager who had harassed her.see id.at.
kaytor testified that although her compensation remained the same after her transfer to crogle,she was treated poorly.she was placed in an office in which paint chips containing lead were underfoot and regularly fell on her desk and on a day when electric boat announced a rule that anyone using certain internet websites could be fired,the company gave her a computer that was loaded with prohibited programs that she could access accidentally and be fired.see id.at.kaytor testified that although crogle treated her normally at first,after a couple of months retaliation started.id.at.her work hours were changed see id.at and whereas under mccarthy she had been responsible for ordering supplies for the entire engineering department see id.at,when she was transferred to work for crogle that job was taken away from her see id.at.under crogle,she testified,i sat there with no work to do.id.at.yet,continually on a daily basis,she was harassed by al crogle who would scream and yell at her for the whole department to hear.id.at.kaytor testified that t here was some harassment from some coworkers id.at,and she was ostracized id.at.
c.the present litigation 
after filing administrative charges with the connecticut commission on human rights and the united states equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,kaytor commenced the present action in december,alleging gender discrimination in violation of title vii and the connecticut fair employment practices act.et.the original complaint alleged that kaytor had been subjected to a hostile work environment based on mccarthy ongoing and continuous sexual harassment by means of his insulting and degrading remarks and actions and his threats to kill kaytor that after complaining to the company about mccarthy,kaytor was subjected to a pattern of continuous retaliation for having complained and that these events had caused kaytor severe emotional distress and physical illness.
in february,kaytor filed an amended complaint repeating the above allegations and adding that in january,shortly after the december commencement of the present action,electric boat terminated kaytor employment in retaliation for her filing the action.it alleged that electric boat began its retaliation on january by ordering kaytor to undergo a psychiatric examination and although kaytor had schedule such an examination,electric boat terminated her employment eight days later on the ground that she had not done so.kaytor also claimed that electric boat ultimatum that she undergo the psychiatric examination constituted an intentional infliction of emotional distress in violation of state law.
following a period of discovery,electric boat moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint,arguing principally that the incidents of which kaytor complained did not create conditions so severe or pervasive as to permit an inference of a hostile work environment.it also argued that its instruction that kaytor submit to a psychiatric examination was not based on any goal of retaliation but rather was based on indications,supported by medical evidence,that she may have been suffering from paranoia see part,below.
in a memorandum of decision and order dated march,see kaytor electric boat,wl,kaytor i,the district court granted summary judgment to electric boat,dismissing the complaint in its entirety.the court found that kaytor had not adduced evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie case of hostile work environment because she had alleged only a few incidents that spanned a number of years.she herself discounts some of these incidents as not being offensive or sexual in nature.kaytor i,wl,at.the court found that the alleged incidents that were explicitly sexual were episodic over a number of years,and are not sufficiently severe to overcome their lack of pervasiveness.id.the court found that 
mccarthy gift of a pussy willow was not necessarily sexual in nature at all,and the court sees no evidence that it was meant to be so.the letter given with the pussy willow contains no sexual references,and the fact that the plant name is similar to a slang term for female genitalia is not sufficient to demonstrate that the gift was,in fact,sexual in nature.
the court found that mccarthy threats to choke or kill kaytor did not contribute to her hostile work environment claim.although it had noted that kaytor maintained that mccarthy at least six times from to told her that he wanted to choke her,and on six more occasions,that he wanted to see her in a coffin,kaytor i,wl,at,the court stated that 
t here is a question as to how many times mccarthy did this the plaintiff could only recall one instance where he threatened to kill her and one instance where he threatened to choke her.in the court view,the plaintiff has not offered any facts from which a reasonable jury could infer that these threats were made because of the plaintiff sex.
id.at.it concluded that,absent those threats of violence,the conduct in question was not pervasive enough to alter the plaintiff s working environment,nor were the alleged incidents,when taken individually or viewed cumulatively,severe enough to alter the plaintiff s working environment.id.at.
the court also dismissed the complaint insofar as it asserted a claim under connecticut law for intentional infliction of emotional distress.it noted that,to establish such a claim,a plaintiff must show that a defendant actions were atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community,id.at and it concluded that kaytor had not met that standard,see id.
as to kaytor claims of retaliation,the court found that because of the temporal proximity between her filing of the present lawsuit and the company termination of her employment,kaytor had established a prima facie case with respect to the claim that her termination was retaliatory.see id.at.however,the court found that electric boat had proffered a nondiscriminatory explanation for her termination,kaytor refusal to submit to a psychiatric examination after exhibiting signs that she might not be fit for duty,see id.noting the medical testimony proffered by electric boat,the court concluded that kaytor had not come forward with any evidence that would permit a reasonable jury in this case to find that the referral for a psychiatric examination,and the plaintiff subsequent termination for refusing to go to it,were pretext for unlawful retaliation.id.at.
in dismissing the complaint,the district court did not discuss kaytor assertions that she had suffered retaliation in the conditions of her employment before she was terminated.the court stated that the only protected activity argued was the december filing of the lawsuit and that it consider ed all arguments based on any other potential protected activities to be abandoned.id.at.in a subsequent memorandum of decision and order dated june,denying a motion by kaytor for reconsideration,see kaytor electric boat,wl.june,kaytor ii,the court stated that even if not abandoned,kaytor claim that she suffered retaliation prior to the termination of her employment was properly dismissed.it noted that the transfer of kaytor from mccarthy to crogle was plainly intended to separate kaytor from mccarthy while the investigation of her harassment claims w as pending,kaytor ii,wl,at,and that d espite kaytor personal feeling that she was transferred to a less desirable position,or her personal feeling that she was isolated,she has presented no evidence that a reasonable employee would hold the same beliefs,id.at.
ii.discussion 
on this appeal,kaytor contends that there are genuine issues of material fact to be tried as to each of her claims.electric boat argues that the district court correctly determined as a matter of law that mccarthy alleged statements and conduct did not create an actionable hostile work environment and that there was no triable issue of fact as to the claimed retaliation.
the eeoc has filed a brief as amicus curiae,taking no position as to most of kaytor claims but urging that we reverse the dismissal of the title vii hostile work environment claim.the eeoc argues principally that to establish such a claim,a plaintiff need show only that the conditions were either pervasive or severe,not both and that,even if the sexual harassment of an employee is not pervasive,the threat to kill such a person may constitute the requisite severity.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that summary judgment was inappropriate with respect to kaytor claims of hostile work environment and her claims of retaliation following her protest of the pussy willow bush incident,and we remand for trial with respect to those claims.we affirm the dismissals of kaytor claims of retaliatory termination and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
summary judgment principles 
a motion for summary judgment may properly be the grant of summary judgment may properly be where there is no genuine issue of material fact to be tried,and the facts as to which there is no such issue warrant the entry of judgment for the moving party as a matter of law.see.c see,jasco tools,dana,cir jasco tools.the function of the district court in considering the motion for summary judgment is not to resolve disputed questions of fact but only to determine whether,as to any material issue,a genuine factual dispute exists.see,anderson liberty lobby,liberty lobby.
in determining whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,see generally id.at same standard governs summary judgment and judgment as a matter of law during or after trial jasco tools,at same,or whether instead there is sufficient evidence in the opposing party favor to create a genuine issue of material fact to be tried,the district court may not properly consider the record in piecemeal fashion,trusting innocent explanations for individual strands of evidence rather,it must review all of the evidence in the record,reeves sanderson plumbing products.this is especially so in considering claims of hostile work environment,see part.below.and in reviewing all of the evidence to determine whether judgment as a matter of law is appropriate,the court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,reeves,at emphasis added,even though contrary inferences might reasonably be drawn,jasco tools,at quoting continental ore union carbide carbon.summary judgment is inappropriate when the admissible materials in the record make it arguable that the claim has merit,see,jasco tools,at quoting quinn syracuse model neighborhood,cir,for the court in considering such a motion must disregard all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe,jasco tools,at quoting,with emphasis,reeves,at.
in reviewing the evidence and the inferences that may reasonably be drawn,the court may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence credibility determinations,the weighing of the evidence,and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions,not those of a judge.reeves,at quoting liberty lobby,at emphases ours see,agosto ins,a district court generally can not grant summary judgment based on its assessment of the credibility of the evidence presented.where an issue as to a material fact can not be resolved without observation of the demeanor of witnesses in order to evaluate their credibility,summary judgment is not appropriate.e advisory committee note.
in sum,summary judgment is proper only when,with all permissible inferences and credibility questions resolved in favor of the party against whom judgment is sought,there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict,liberty lobby,at,it is quite clear what the truth is.poller columbia broadcasting system,internal quotation marks omitted.

b.the title vii hostile work environment claim 
title vii prohibits discriminat ion against any individual with respect to his or her compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of,inter alia,such individual sex.a.
t his language is not limited to economic or tangible discrimination.the phrase terms,conditions,or privileges of employment evinces a congressional intent to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women in employment,which includes requiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment.
harris forklift systems,quoting meritor savings bank,fsb vinson,meritor.
title vii does not set forth a general civility code for the american workplace.burlington northern santa fe ry.white,quoting oncale sundowner offshore services.but w hen the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment,title vii is violated,harris,at quoting meritor,at,emphasis ours so long as there is a basis for imputing the conduct that created the hostile environment to the employer,see,perry ethan allen,cir perry karibian columbia university,cir,cert.denied,kotcher rosa sullivan appliance center,cir.absent certain defenses that are not at issue on this appeal,an employer is presumed to be responsible where the perpetrator of the harassment was the plaintiff supervisor.see,burlington industries,ellerth,faragher city of boca raton,perry,at.
as to whether an environment is hostile or abusive,harris stated that that matter can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances.at emphasis added.
these may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.the effect on the employee psychological is,of course,relevant to determining whether the plaintiff actually found the environment abusive.but while psychological harm,like any other relevant factor,may be taken into account,no single factor is required.
id.emphases added.because the analysis of severity and pervasiveness looks to the totality of the circumstances,the crucial inquiry focuses on the nature of the workplace environment as a whole,and a plaintiff who herself experiences discriminatory harassment need not be the target of other instances of hostility in order for those incidents to support her claim.cruz,at emphases added see,perry,at.
harris also established that both an objective and a subjective standard must be met to prove the existence of a hostile work environment violative of title vii 
conduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or beyond title vii purview.likewise,if the victim does not subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive,the conduct has not actually altered the conditions of the victim employment,and there is no title vii violation.
isolated incidents generally will not suffice to establish a hostile work environment unless they are extraordinarily severe.see,howley town of stratford,cir howley quinn green tree credit,cir torres pisano,cir of course,even a single episode of harassment,if severe enough,can establish a hostile work environment.however,even if overtly discriminatory conduct is merely episodic and not itself severe,the addition of physically threatening behavior may cause offensive or boorish conduct to cross the line into actionable sexual harassment.cruz,at.
it is axiomatic that to prevail on a claim of hostile work environment based on gender discrimination,the plaintiff must establish that the abuse was based on her gender.see,raniola bratton,cir raniola howley,at.the harassing conduct need not be motivated by sexual desire,however,so long as it was motivated by gender.raniola,at quoting oncale,at emphasis ours see,howley,at.further,
f acially neutral incidents may be included among the totality of the circumstances that courts consider in any hostile work environment claim,so long as a reasonable could conclude that they were,in fact,based on sex.but this requires some circumstantial or other basis for inferring that incidents on their face were in fact discriminatory.
alfano costello,cir.circumstantial evidence that facially incidents were part of a pattern of discrimination on the basis of gender may consist of evidence that the same individual engaged in multiple acts of harassment,some overtly sexual and some not.id.at.in raniola,for example,we concluded that,given proof of instances of overt gender hostility by the supervisor of the female plaintiff,a rational juror could permissibly infer that his entire alleged pattern of harassment against her was motivated by her gender,even though some of the harassment was not facially.see at.thus,the relevant circumstances in raniola included not only offensive remarks,but also,inter alia,one dire facially threat of physical harm by the supervisor who had made those remarks.see id.at.in fitzgerald henderson,cir,cert.denied,we held that a claim of hostile work environment as well as an embedded claim of retaliation may be premised on evidence that a supervisor heaped abuse on the plaintiff because she had rejected his sexual advances.see at see also howley,at factfinder would be permitted to conclude that even facially harassment of female firefighter by a coworker was motivated by sex given that that coworker had previously engaged in explicitly harassment.so long as there is some evidentiary basis for inferring that facially incidents were motivated by the plaintiff gender,the ultimate question of whether such abuse was because of the plaintiff gender,a,is a question of fact for the factfinder.see,raniola,at howley,at cruz,at.
in sum,the question of whether considerations of the plaintiff sex caused the conduct at issue often requires an assessment of individuals motivations and state of mind,brown henderson,cir,and an invidious discriminatory purpose may often be inferred from the totality of the relevant facts,washington davis.thus,especially in the context of a claim of sexual harassment,where state of mind and intent are at issue,the court should not view the record in piecemeal fashion,fitzgerald henderson,at,and s ummary judgment should be used sparingly,distasio perkin elmer,cir.
in the present case,in light of the above substantive and procedural principles,we have several difficulties with the district court summary dismissal of kaytor hostile work environment claim.first,in assessing the evidence as to whether there was an abusive environment resulting from discrimination based on gender,the court indicated that it was disregarding some evidence that would doubtless be admissible at a trial.for example,the fact that some of the mccarthy conduct and comments described by kaytor were not directed at kaytor or were not sexual in nature,kaytor i,wl,at as his making fun of other women and discussing their not mean that that conduct and those comments were irrelevant.even if they did not evince sexual desire,a factfinder would be entitled to take them into consideration in assessing the work environment and in determining whether the abuse to which mccarthy subjected kaytor was motivated by her gender.
more importantly,the court should not have excluded from consideration kaytor testimony as to mccarthy stated desires to choke her,to see her in a coffin,and to kill her.according to kaytor testimony,which must be credited on a motion for summary judgment against her,the threats were uttered by one who had had designs on kaytor and who was miffed that she would not fall for his advances kaytor dep.a rational juror could permissibly infer that mccarthy harsh treatment of kaytor was the result of his spurned advances.
a rational juror could also infer from mccarthy overtly sexual comments that the facially threats he directed at kaytor were,in fact,because of her sex.see a.in alfano costello,there were four incidents that had overtly sexual overtones but were perpetrated by someone other than the defendant we held that those incidents provided no basis for inferring that wholly different facially incidents involving the defendant were part of a campaign by the defendant to harass the plaintiff on the basis of her sex.see at.here,unlike alfano,a rational juror could permissibly infer from mccarthy sexual comments that his physical threats were also motivated by kaytor sex.
electric boat suggests that mccarthy threats to choke kaytor were in fact because mccarthy allegedly made such comments to at least one other male employee electric boat brief on appeal at.this suggestion provides no support for a judgment in favor of electric boat for several reasons.for one thing,the only such alleg ation we have seen in the record is the eb report description of a statement by mccarthy himself.and although mccarthy told hr that he had jokingly told crogle he would like to choke crogle see eb report at,no such conversation about choking is reflected in the report description of the hr interview with crogle,who said that when mccarthy was displeased with crogle work,mccarthy would jokingly threaten to fire him id.at.
in contrast,the report notes that linda christie stated in her hr interview that,although she had not taken it seriously,mccarthy had once told her he would like to choke her see eb report at.thus,the record permits an inference that mccarthy threats to choke were directed only at women,not at men.more importantly,
the inquiry into whether ill treatment was actually discrimination can not be by the mere fact that both men and women are involved it would be exceedingly perverse if a male supervisor could buy his company immunity from title vii liability by taking care to harass sexually an occasional male worker,though his preferred targets were female.
brown henderson,at internal quotation marks omitted.
finally,while we in no way suggest that threats of physical harm could ever be justified by evaluations of an employee work performance,we note that we have seen in this record no evidence that mccarthy statements to kaytor that he would like to see her in a coffin,kill her,or choke her were related to any deficiencies in her work performance.to the contrary,the record suggests that mccarthy desire to choke kaytor was distinctly not,for mccarthy told kaytor he wish ed she were retired so that he could come to her home and choke her kaytor dep.emphases added.in sum,mccarthy threats and statements wishing kaytor physical harm are material to her claim that she was subjected to a hostile work environment.
second,the district court impugned kaytor credibility as to the frequency of mccarthy threats and thereby inappropriately assumed the role of factfinder.while noting that kaytor testified that mccarthy had threatened her repeatedly,the court stated that t here is a question as to how many times mccarthy did this,because kaytor could only recall one instance where he threatened to kill her and one instance where he threatened to choke her.kaytor i,wl,at emphasis added.although kaytor at her deposition could not recall dates or details of the other instances,her testimony that in fact there were many such instances would be admissible at trial.electric boat would of course be entitled to her as to details,and kaytor ability or inability to recall details would doubtless affect the weight that would be given to her testimony.but the weighing of the evidence is a matter for the factfinder at trial,not for a court considering a motion for summary judgment,and the district court was not entitled to question the credibility of kaytor testimony that there were many such instances.thus,the question highlighted by the court was not,on the motion for summary judgment,a proper consideration.
third,the district court,in stating that kaytor had alleged only a few incidents that spanned a number of years,id.at expansive temporal impression that electric boat attempts to enhance by describing the period complained of as see electric boat brief on appeal at,did not view the evidence in the light most favorable to kaytor,either with respect to the relevant period or the number of incidents.as to the relevant period,kaytor testified that the bad years were and see,kaytor dep,and she has not alleged any harassment by any as contrasted with retaliatory harassment by anyone else at the mccarthy gift of the pussy willow bush on april.accordingly,at its longest,the period during which kaytor complained of a hostile work environment was not several years,but rather months.as to the number of incidents,the court was required,as indicated above,to take into consideration mccarthy physical threats to kaytor,and it had noted that mccarthy said he wanted to choke kaytor on at least six occasions,told her he would like to see her in her coffin on six other occasions,and told her he wanted to kill her on three or four occasions.kaytor i,wl,at.in addition to those or more incidents,kaytor testified that mccarthy made complimentary,but unwelcome,comments about the way she smelled that he approached her closely enough to smell her hair,making her uncomfortable and that she caught him leering at her body m any times kaytor dep.and,of course there is the evidence described above as to the several incidents in which mccarthy made explicit or implicit references to kaytor ass or genitalia and gave her the pussy willow bush.if a jury were to view the evidence in the light most favorable to kaytor,it could easily conclude,permissibly,that there occurred a plethora of incidents in the relevant period and that the abuse was severe pervasive.
we note that the district court pointed out that kaytor,in her deposition,stated at times that mccarthy threats were out of character see kaytor dep,and the court inferred that that phrase indicat ed that they were not pervasive,kaytor i,wl,at.this inference as to what kaytor meant also failed to view the record in the light most favorable to kaytor.we do not see that kaytor was ever asked at her deposition precisely what she meant when she said that mccarthy was acting out of character.having testified that she and mccarthy had an amicable,businesslike relationship during the early years of their working together,kaytor could well have meant that mccarthy harassing behavior from through april was simply inconsistent with the way he had behaved for the prior five or six years.the court inference that by out of character kaytor instead meant sporadic or not pervasive also seems unwarranted in light of her testimony that one of mccarthy threats to kill her was made w hen he was acting out of character,and was one of the many harassing incidents kaytor dep,and in light of her use of that phrase with respect to crogle,stating that f or two years crogle acted out of character id.at emphasis added.
finally,the district court analysis of the pussy willow gift plainly viewed that incident in isolation.the court stated that 
mccarthy gift of a pussy willow was not necessarily sexual in nature at all,and the court sees no evidence that it was meant to be so.the letter given with the pussy willow contains no sexual references,and the fact that the plant name is similar to a slang term for female genitalia is not sufficient to demonstrate that the gift was,in fact,sexual in nature.
