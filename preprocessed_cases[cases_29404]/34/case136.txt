after a jury trial,the appellant,steven soto,was convicted on all counts of a indictment charging mail fraud,wire fraud,bank fraud,and aggravated identity theft on appeal,soto argues that the trial court violated his sixth amendment right to confront the witnesses against him by admitting testimony of a forensic examiner about another examiner prior examination.soto also challenges the sufficiency of the government evidence for his aggravated identity theft convictions.for the following reasons,we uphold soto convictions on all counts.
sufficiency of the evidence on the aggravated identity theft counts 
factual background 
we begin with soto second argument because it allows us to describe the fraudulent scheme behind all of the charges.soto contends that there was insufficient evidence that he knew that the identification he fraudulently used to purchase four motorcycles actually belonged to another person.because soto challenges the sufficiency of the government proof at trial,we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.united states.valerio,cir.
on march,soto brought his girlfriend,yessica amaro,to motorcycles of manchester mom in new hampshire.soto purchased a suzuki motorcycle for amaro,who was posing as christine escribano.soto told the office manager at mom that he would bring escribano license when he came to pay and retrieve the motorcycle the next day.although soto neglected to produce escribano license,mom completed the sale in the name of christine escribano on march.on april,soto and amaro repeated the scheme at kelly power sports in danvers,massachusetts.this time they produced escribano driver license,which a salesperson photocopied,and they purchased another suzuki motorcycle.on april,soto and amaro continued the charade at north reading motor sports in north reading,massachusetts,once again using escribano driver license to purchase two honda motorcycles.the manager at north reading motor sports made a photocopy of escribano license for his records.
soto paid for the motorcycles with counterfeit cashier checks,and the dealerships applied for title and registration for the motorcycles with the massachusetts registry of motor vehicles rmv in escribano name.soto then sent counterfeit notarized to the rmv,transferring the titles to the motorcycles to either his uncle,salvador shower,or his friend,abraham dominguez.soto intercepted the clean titles issued by the rmv from the mail of shower and dominguez.once soto had the titles,another friend posed as either shower or dominguez and sold the motorcycles to innocent third parties.
christine escribano testified that she had lost her driver license,and she identified her license from the photocopy made by one of the motorcycle dealerships.
soto also purchased three automobiles posing as gregory bradley,a friend of soto who was incarcerated at the time.soto produced bradley driver license to buy the cars and to obtain financing for the car purchases.because soto is not contesting the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the charges related to the car purchases,we need not describe this scheme in detail.
at the conclusion of the government,soto moved for a rule judgment of acquittal,arguing in relevant part that there was insufficient evidence that he knew that escribano was a real person.the district court orally denied the motion.soto renewed the motion at the close of the evidence,and the district court again denied the motion.
standard of review and relevant law 
we review the district court denial of a rule motion de novo.valerio,at.we must uphold the denial if,taking the evidence at trial in the light most favorable to the jury verdict,a rational factfinder could find that the government proved each essential element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.soto was convicted under,which states 
whoever,during and in relation to any felony violation enumerated in subsection c,knowingly transfers,possesses,or uses,without lawful authority,a means of identification of another person shall,in addition to the punishment provided for such felony,be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of years.
a.under this statute,the government was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that soto knew that the means of identification that he used belonged to another person.flores figueroa united states.the government need not have direct evidence of knowledge circumstantial evidence can be sufficient.valerio,at.
soto argues that the evidence proved only that he possessed the license,not that he knew that the license was that of another person.viewed cumulatively,the government circumstantial evidence was sufficient for a rational jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that soto knew that the license belonged to another person.
first,the government introduced the photocopy of escribano license made by north reading motor sports into evidence.the driver license contains a banner with the word massachusetts and the state silhouette and seal.the license has a number,date of birth,vehicle classification,height,sex,address,and expiration date.the license bears escribano signature and contains two photographs one larger and the second lighter and smaller,obviously some type of security feature.the license also bears the signature of the registrar running up the side of the larger photograph.the license bears a small heart,designating an organ donor.nothing about the license suggests it is counterfeit or fake.a modern massachusetts driver license is a sophisticated identification document with a number of security features.unlike social security cards or birth certificates printed on card stock or paper a massachusetts driver license can not be easily forged.we believe that the license alone provides strong evidence of its own authenticity.soto,himself a massachusetts resident and driver,would have been familiar with the features of an authentic massachusetts driver license.
second,soto willingness to use escribano license to purchase expensive vehicles suggests that he knew that the document was authentic.two of the dealerships actually copied the license for their files.the fact that soto knew that the license might be subjected to scrutiny by the dealerships supports the inference that he knew that the license belonged to a real person.see valerio,at defendant willingness to subject means of identification to government scrutiny evidence of defendant knowledge.
finally,the government produced evidence at trial that all of the other people who soto involved in his schemes were real people.soto forged the notary stamp from a notary he previously used he assigned titles to his uncle and his friend he purchased automobiles using his friend gregory bradley identity.the jury could have reasonably inferred that soto modus operandi was to involve people whom he knew to be real.
the government produced evidence beyond the mere possession of escribano license.cumulatively,the evidence was sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that soto knew escribano license actually belonged to another person.we affirm the district court denial of soto rule motion.
ii.the crawford challenge 
procedural background 
the day before trial,soto moved to suppress incriminating evidence found on a laptop computer seized in an inventory search of one of the automobiles soto purchased using bradley identity.soto argued in his motion that the seizure violated his fourth amendment rights.the district court held a hearing and denied the motion.
at trial,special agent michael pickett of the united states secret service testified about a computer forensics examination he had conducted on the seized laptop.agent pickett first testified generally about how a forensics examination is conducted and then identified exhibit as the hard drive removed from the laptop.agent pickett explained that another forensics examiner,john murphy,had done a forensics examination before him.agent pickett testified i took the hard drive out of this laptop,i made my own image and i examined the image of the hard drive and i confirmed that everything that was in john murphy report was exactly the way he said it was.
agent pickett identified exhibit,which consisted of several documents that were found on the hard drive of the laptop and he testified 
prosecutor after you made an image of the hard drive from exhibit,the laptop computer,were you able to print out certain documents that appear on the hard drive 
agent pickett i did not make a hard copy printout however,i used the forensic program called encase to find this document,and it was contained in the same folder that john murphy had said that he had found it in.
prosecutor so am i correct in understanding that each of the pieces of paper in exhibit are hard copies of stuff you confirmed were in the hard drive that was in exhibit 
agent pickett yes.i saw this document,this file,looking in encase and confirmed that it was on the image of the hard drive that i made.
the government then offered exhibit,and soto counsel stated judge,for the record i have to object pursuant to a previous motion i made to the court,but i do that only for the record.the court admitted exhibit into evidence.
on,agent pickett testified 
counsel just so we clear,you were the second secret service agent to perform forensic work on the laptop,correct 
agent pickett that is correct.john murphy was the original examiner,and then i it.
counsel why did you it 
agent pickett i was asked to.
counsel by whom were you asked to 
agent pickett by attorney capin.
counsel and what was the reason why you were asked to 
agent pickett to confirm that everything on john murphy report was exactly the way he said it was.
at the end of his testimony,agent pickett testified 
prosecutor and just one last question.you were asked a number of questions about the original agent,i think murphy,who analyzed this.do you know why murphy is here today 
agent pickett that is correct.john murphy has,as part of our normal career transition,has gone on to washington,he now part of what called our technical security division.he in charge of the alarms and electronic security at the white house.
standard of review 
because soto did not raise a contemporaneous sixth amendment objection to agent pickett testimony,we review the district court admission of agent pickett testimony for plain error.see.b,b united states mercado,cir thus,on appeal soto must show 
error,that is plain,and that affect s substantial rights.johnson united states.if he is able to satisfy all three elements,this court,in its discretion,may notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states borrero acevedo,cir.

relevant law 
the sixth amendment states in all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him const.amend.vi.in crawford washington,the supreme court held that the sixth amendment bars the admission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify and the declarant had had a prior opportunity for.
a critical part of the crawford holding 
is the phrase testimonial statements.only statements of this sort cause the defendant to be a witness within the meaning of the confrontation clause.it is the testimonial character of the statement that separates it from other hearsay that,while subject to traditional limitations upon hearsay evidence,is not subject to the confrontation clause.
davis washington,internal citation omitted.as we have previously explained 
thus far,the supreme court has declined to supply a comprehensive definition of testimonial.crawford,at see also davis,at.the court has,however,provided an illustrative list of the core class of testimonial statements.crawford,at.it includes ex parte testimony or its functional equivalent that is,material such as affidavits,custodial examinations,prior testimony that the defendant was unable to,or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially,extrajudicial statements contained in formalized testimonial materials,such as affidavits,depositions,prior testimony,or confessions,and statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted mindful of crawford bottom line,this court,in determining whether a statement is testimonial,inquires whether an objectively reasonable person in the declarant shoes would understand that the statement would be used in prosecuting the defendant at trial.united states earle,cir.
united states phoeun lang,cir.
in melendez diaz massachusetts,the supreme court held that an affidavit reporting the results of the state drug analysis falls within the core class of testimonial statements,and the defendant must be afforded his constitutional right to confront the analysts.in bullcoming new mexico,the court held that a certified blood alcohol content report can be used against the defendant only if the defendant has the opportunity to confront at trial the analyst who performed,observed,or supervised the forensic examination.the court explained in short,when the state elected to introduce the analyst certification,the analyst became a witness bullcoming had the right to confront.id.at.the sixth amendment was not satisfied by a surrogate witness who was familiar with the lab practices but who had formed no independent opinion concerning the forensic examination results.id.at see also united states.ramos gonzález,cir.accordingly,the analysts who write reports that the prosecution introduces must be made available for confrontation bullcoming.at.
finally,in williams illinois,the supreme court tackled the constitutionality of allowing an expert witness to discuss a expert statements when the expert statements are not admitted in evidence.justice alito,chief justice roberts,justice kennedy,and justice breyer reasoned that the expert statements could be discussed by the testifying expert because the expert statements were not offered for their truth,but only to explain the assumption on which the testifying expert based her opinion.id.at.in dissent,justices kagan,scalia,ginsburg,and sotomayor concluded that the expert statements were being offered for their truth and were testimonial,and thus found a confrontation clause violation.id.at kagan,dissenting.in a concurring opinion,justice thomas agreed that the expert statements were offered for their truth but concluded that they lacked the requisite formality and solemnity to be considered testimonial for purposes of the confrontation clause.id.at thomas,concurring,
soto argument on appeal is that agent pickett testified as a surrogate witness and a conduit for agent murphy report in violation of the confrontation clause.he also argues that allowing agent pickett to testify about agent murphy conclusions subverted his right to confront agent murphy and unfairly bolstered the government evidence by indicating that the forensic results were verified by two agents.
agent pickett did not testify as a surrogate witness for agent murphy.bullcoming provides guidance.bullcoming was pulled over and arrested for driving while intoxicated.at trial,the government introduced into evidence a laboratory report certifying that bullcoming blood alcohol content was above the legal limit.the report was authenticated at trial by an analyst who was familiar with the laboratory testing procedures but otherwise had nothing to do with the test.bullcoming.at.the court explained that the testifying analyst provided impermissible surrogate testimony because the testifying analyst had no knowledge about the test of bullcoming blood alcohol content or the analyst who performed the test.id.at.nor did the state assert that the testifying analyst had any independent opinion concerning bullcoming bac.id.at 
unlike in bullcoming,agent murphy forensic report was not introduced into evidence through agent pickett.agent pickett testified about a conclusion he drew from his own independent examination
