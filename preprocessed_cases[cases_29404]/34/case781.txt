andrew zayac was convicted after a jury trial on several counts arising from his involvement in the kidnapping,robbery,and murder of a drug dealer.after rejecting his motion for a new trial and acquittal,the district court janet hall,judge sentenced zayac principally to two concurrent terms of life imprisonment.on this appeal,zayac challenges the sufficiency of the evidence presented against him as to several of the counts of conviction,two of the district court evidentiary rulings,and the court refusal to instruct the jury regarding the affirmative defense of duress to the kidnapping and robbery charges.because we conclude that zayac has failed to identify any error in his conviction,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the evidence presented at trial established that on the evening of february,zayac drove from new rochelle,new york,to the bronx to pick up edward rivera,a man from whom zayac had previously purchased substantial quantities of marijuana for resale.also in the car was zayac sometime,heriberto gonzalez.zayac would later tell police that he had agreed with rivera to purchase more than worth of marijuana on this occasion.
rivera left his building to meet the two men,carrying two duffel bags containing some sixty pounds of marijuana.after placing the bags in the trunk of zayac blue jeep,rivera got into the back seat,and the three men drove away.
at some point thereafter,rivera was shot twice at close range as he sat in the jeep.zayac and gonzalez drove to the padanaram reservoir in danbury,connecticut.it was there that rivera pound body was eventually discovered,having apparently been pushed and dragged to the bottom of a hill,some distance from the road.
after disposing of the body,zayac and gonzalez drove to the home of zayac girlfriend in new rochelle,where they transferred the drugs to a vehicle that she leased.the two men then drove the jeep to gonzalez residence in the bronx,where they picked up gonzalez car.surveillance video obtained from a nearby oil company showed the jeep being set on fire soon afterward,in the early hours of the morning following the murder.both zayac and gonzalez suffered severe burns that night.zayac later instructed his girlfriend to report the jeep,which was registered in her name,stolen and to identify him as kevin hill in her communications with police.she did so.
on march,agents of the united states drug enforcement administration and other federal law enforcement personnel executed a search warrant at the home of zayac parents in scarsdale,new york.in the course of the search,agents discovered three large bags of marijuana concealed behind wall panels,as well as medical supplies for treating burns and documents indicating that zayac had consulted a plastic surgeon.zayac and his girlfriend were present at the search.he agreed to speak with investigators,and was taken to a local police station for that purpose.
zayac met with investigators three times in the days immediately following the search.he met with them again in december.his account of what transpired on the night of rivera murder changed each time,but he eventually settled on a narrative that put the blame for rivera killing and the destruction of the evidence squarely on gonzalez.
although zayac did not testify at trial,a government witness recounted the version of events he gave investigators.because that account is relevant to part of our analysis,we briefly recite the pertinent details.according to zayac,sometime after rivera got into the jeep,gonzalez produced a small semiautomatic handgun from his backpack,along with some zip ties.gonzalez then ordered rivera at gunpoint to put the zip ties on himself.moments later,as zayac drove the vehicle northward,gonzalez shot rivera in the chest.gonzalez then told zayac to be happy it was not him who was shot.once near the padanaram reservoir in danbury,zayac turned down a secluded road and stopped on the shoulder.gonzalez insisted that zayac help him pull rivera body from the car.zayac told investigators that he then returned to the driver seat of the jeep while gonzalez disappeared down the roadside hill with the body for several minutes.when gonzalez reappeared,the two men drove back to new york,where they proceeded to stow the marijuana at the home of zayac girlfriend before burning the jeep.
the proceedings in the district court 
zayac was tried before a jury and convicted of kidnapping,see a felony murder,see id,c,j robbery,see id,a possession of marijuana with intent to distribute,see id.a,b d conspiracy to use or possess a firearm in furtherance of a violent felony or drug crime,see o three counts of destroying or concealing evidence,see id.and one count of conspiracy to destroy or conceal evidence,see id.gonzalez was tried separately.
zayac defense focused on his attempt to pin responsibility for the crimes on gonzalez.to that end,zayac sought to enter into evidence an empty holster and magazine recovered from gonzalez home during a consensual search.the defense argued that these items suggested that gonzalez may have possessed a firearm,and that this tended to corroborate zayac claim that gonzalez had killed rivera.the district court refused to admit the proffered exhibits on the grounds that they would invite the jury to draw speculative inferences.
for its part,the government introduced the inconsistent statements zayac had made to investigators.the defense sought to mitigate the effect of these inconsistencies by proffering the testimony of an attorney who had advised zayac at the time the statements were made.the court heard the proffered testimony out of the presence of the jury.zayac former attorney recounted that zayac had apologized to him for lying to investigators and explained that he had done so because he feared gonzalez.the court concluded that the testimony was irrelevant,and declined to admit the evidence.
toward the close of trial,zayac requested that the court instruct the jury regarding the affirmative defense of duress with respect to the kidnapping,robbery,and destruction of evidence counts.the court declined to do so,concluding that zayac defense failed as a matter of law because no reasonable juror could find that he lacked a reasonable opportunity to escape during the course of the criminal conduct.
after trial,zayac moved for acquittal and a new trial,which the court denied.on november,the court sentenced zayac to concurrent terms of life in prison on the kidnapping and murder counts,as well as lesser terms of years on seven other counts.this appeal followed.
discussion 
the propriety of the district court refusal to provide requested jury instructions is a question of law,which we review de novo.united states nouri,cir,cert.denied.we also review challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence underlying a criminal conviction de novo,united states mi sun cho,cir per curiam.the district court decision to exclude evidence is subject to review for abuse of discretion.united states kozeny,cir,cert.denied.
sufficiency of the evidence 
we begin with zayac contentions regarding the sufficiency of the evidence underlying his convictions on the kidnapping,robbery,firearms and murder counts.a defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence faces an uphill battle,and bears a very heavy burden.mi sun cho,at internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted.although our review is de novo,the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the government,with all reasonable inferences drawn in its favor.the question is not whether this court believes that the evidence at trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,but rather,whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.internal quotation marks,brackets,and citations omitted emphasis in original accord united states howard,cir.we resolve all inferences from the evidence and issues of credibility in favor of the verdict,cert.denied.moreover,the jury verdict may be based on circumstantial evidence,and the government is not required to preclude every reasonable hypothesis which is consistent with innocence.united states ogando,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted accord united states glenn,cir t he prosecution may prove its case entirely by circumstantial evidence so long as guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt.
zayac claims that his presence in the jeep and his association with gonzalez,even coupled with his just acquired knowledge of gonzalez murderous and felonious intent,is insufficient to show knowing participation in the kidnapping,robbery,firearms offenses,and murder.appellant br.but the convictions here did not rest only on evidence of zayac presence in the jeep.the trial record contains extensive evidence from which the jury could properly have inferred zayac knowing participation in these crimes,including a zayac appeared to lure rivera into a trap by offering to pay an price for the marijuana and telling him not to involve any of his associates in the transaction b zayac and gonzalez set about methodically destroying all evidence of the murder together and left the marijuana in zayac hands for safekeeping and c zayac actively sought to conceal his involvement in the crimes,including by instructing his girlfriend to lie on his behalf and by repeatedly lying to the government regarding his role.we conclude that the jury could properly have found that zayac either committed the charged offenses himself or that he joined in gonzalez specific venture and shared in it,and that his efforts contributed to its success,or,in other words that he otherwise consciously assisted the commission of the charged crime s in some active way.ogando,at internal quotation marks omitted.we therefore reject zayac contention that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.
ii.the district court evidentiary rulings 
we also reject zayac challenges to the district court evidentiary rulings.under rule of the federal rules of evidence,a trial court may refuse to admit evidence the probative value of which is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice,confusing the issues,or misleading the jury.it is well established that so long as the district court has conscientiously balanced the proffered evidence probative value with the risk for prejudice,its conclusion will be disturbed only if it is arbitrary or irrational.united states.awadallah,cir.
the record reveals that the court in this case engaged in just such a conscientious balancing when it declined to admit the holster and magazine recovered from gonzalez house.the district court determined that this evidence,if introduced,risked leading the jury to conclude that gonzalez owned a gun and that this gun was the murder weapon.this chain of inferences,the district court found,would have been based on speculation rather than reasoned deduction from the evidence,since the holster was empty when it was recovered,the murder weapon was not found,and forensic testing had failed to establish with precision what kind of firearm was used to kill rivera.in light of the high risk that the jury would engage in speculation,the district court concluded that the potential for prejudice outweighed the probative value of this evidence.because we find this determination neither arbitrary nor irrational,we will not disturb it.
we also reject zayac challenge to the district court refusal to admit testimony of zayac former attorney to the effect that zayac lied to investigators because he feared retaliation from gonzalez.this testimony ordinarily would be inadmissible hearsay.see.c.in this case,however,zayac argued,among other things,that the testimony was admissible to show his state of mind at the time he lied to the authorities and thereby to contradict the inference of guilt which the government sought to elicit by introducing zayac false exculpatory statements.see fed evid.
we need not decide whether the district court erred by refusing to admit this testimony because any such error would have been harmless.see,united states miller,cir e ven where we conclude that an evidentiary ruling was manifestly erroneous,we will nonetheless affirm if the error was harmless that is,if we can conclude that the error did not affect substantial rights.internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied.a.under harmless error review,we ask whether we can conclude with fair assurance that the errors did not substantially influence the jury.united states oluwanisola,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a government witness twice told the jury that zayac had indicated to investigators that he was afraid of gonzalez.zayac stated fear was therefore in the record,and his counsel was free to argue that this fear mitigated any inference of guilt from his inconsistent statements.we therefore find no error affecting zayac substantial rights and no reason to reverse the district court determination.see united states gupta,cir the fact that the excluded statement did no more than confirm undisputed facts also contributes to our conclusion that,if the limitation on witness testimony was error,the error was harmless.internal quotation marks omitted oluwanisola,at stating that,to determine whether error was harmless,we consider,among other factors,whether the excluded material was cumulative of other evidence and the extent to which the defendant was otherwise permitted to advance the defense.
iii.zayac entitlement to a duress instruction 
finally,we consider whether zayac was entitled to an instruction on the affirmative defense of duress with respect to the kidnapping and robbery charges counts one and four,respectively we will reverse a conviction on the ground that the district court refused to give a requested jury instruction only if the requested instruction is legally correct,represents a theory of defense with basis in the record that would lead to acquittal,and the theory is not effectively presented elsewhere in the charge.united states kerley,cir quoting united states doyle,cir,cert.denied.a defendant is entitled to an instruction on an affirmative defense only if the defense has a foundation in the evidence.united states gonzalez,f d,cir quoting united states podlog,cir internal quotation marks omitted accord united states hurtado,cir.a defense theory must be charged so long as it has some foundation in the proof,no matter how tenuous that defense may appear to the trial court.internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied.but i f,after a hearing,the court finds that the defendant evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to establish the defense,the court is under no duty to give the requested jury charge or to allow the defendant to present the evidence to the jury.united states paul,f d,cir.
criminal liability ordinarily requires the concurrence of an mind with an evildoing hand.morissette united states.the affirmative defense of duress excuses criminal conduct committed under circumstances from which a jury may infer that the defendant hand was guided not by evil intent,but by the imminent threat of grievous bodily harm.the defense does not necessarily negate mens rea,but it negates a conclusion of guilt under the circumstances.dixon united states,emphasis added.
a defendant invoking a duress defense must establish that,at the time of his criminal conduct,he faced a threat of force sufficient to induce a fear of impending death or serious bodily injury,and he lacked a reasonable opportunity to escape harm other than by engaging in the illegal activity.gonzalez,at.a defendant is entitled to a jury instruction regarding duress only if he makes some showing on each element of the defense.accord united states bakhtiari,cir,cert.denied.the district court here denied zayac requested instruction on the ground that he failed to make the requisite showing with respect to the third element,that the defendant take reasonable steps to avail himself of a reasonable opportunity to escape,whether by flight or by seeking the intervention of the appropriate authorities.united states.alicea,cir,cert.denied.
the court began by considering the trial testimony of special agent rodney george of the united states drug enforcement administration,who related the statements zayac had made over the course of his meetings with inve
