joseph poole appeals from a judgment entered after a bench trial,in which the district court found him guilty of four counts of aiding in the preparation of false tax returns in violation of.to obtain these convictions under,the government was required to prove that poole willfully aided,assisted,or otherwise caused the preparation of a tax return that was fraudulent or false with regard to a material matter.see united states hayes,cir united states aramony,cir.
poole makes three principal arguments in his challenge to his convictions the district court unlawfully based its verdict on the guilty pleas of his,which were not evidence in the case,thereby depriving poole of his due process right to a fair trial the district court improperly credited testimony by the government key witness that poole contends was false and the evidence was insufficient to prove that poole knew that the tax returns he prepared were fraudulent,and that he acted willfully in violation of.we conclude that these arguments are without merit,and we affirm the district court judgment.
between and,poole worked as an accountant for bay area accounting management,an accounting firm owned by poole wife.in his capacity as an accountant,poole provided accounting services to fidelity home mortgage corporation fidelity home,a mortgage brokerage firm with headquarters located in baltimore,maryland.stilianos mavroulis was the sole shareholder of fidelity home,and his son,kyriakos mavroulis,was the supervisor of the company accounting department.
during the years in question,poole prepared various financial documents for fidelity home.these documents included financial statements and informational tax returns that were filed with the internal revenue service irs.poole also prepared personal financial statements for stilianos mavroulis,and joint income tax returns for stilianos mavroulis and his wife.
in,the irs received information from a former employee of fidelity home that stilianos mavroulis may have been filing fraudulent income tax returns.following an investigation by the irs,a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging stilianos mavroulis,kyriakos mavroulis collectively,the mavroulises,and poole with conspiracy to defraud the united states,in violation of.the mavroulises also were charged with filing fraudulent tax returns,in violation of.the indictment separately charged poole with four counts of aiding and assisting in the preparation of false tax returns,in violation of.
on the defendants motion,the district court severed the trial of the mavroulises from the proceedings against poole.stilianos mavroulis later pleaded guilty to one count of filing false tax returns,and kyriakos mavroulis pleaded guilty under a superseding indictment to one count of willfully failing to file an income tax return,in violation of.in a separate proceeding before the same district court judge,poole entered a plea of not guilty.
the case proceeded to a bench trial,in which the government sought to prove that poole conspired with stilianos mavroulis mavroulis in preparing false income tax returns that materially underreported mavroulis taxable income from fidelity home.the district court acquitted poole of the conspiracy charge,but found him guilty of the four counts of aiding in the preparation of false tax returns.poole later filed motions for a judgment of acquittal under federal rule of criminal procedure,and for a new trial pursuant to rule.the district court denied these motions,and sentenced poole on the four counts to a total term of two years imprisonment and to one year of supervised release.
we first consider poole argument that the district court erroneously based its judgment on the mavroulises guilty pleas,which were not admitted into evidence.poole relies primarily on three references that the district court made to the pleas during the trial and in the court memorandum opinion.
we consider these statements by the district court in the context in which they were made.during the government,the district court interrupted poole counsel as he the government key witness,irs agent richard wallace.the district court suggested that poole counsel spend less time eliciting from agent wallace the details of the tax returns at issue,stating 
i just want to make sure we stay focused on what the issues are.stanley mavroulis has pled guilty.kirk mavroulis has pled guilty the issue is the knowledge and intent of poole with respect to whether he knowingly aided and abetted the filing of false tax returns and whether or not he engaged in a conspiracy.and so to the extent we going to spend a great deal of time trying to justify the particular tax returns,it fine up to it certainly important in terms of the understanding that someone has when they looking at the return.but my point is that the mavroulises are not on trial here right now and the issue is not the matter of the legitimacy of all these tax returns.they pled guilty to tax offenses with respect to these returns.so i just trying to make sure we stay focused i not trying to limit the in terms of attacking or trying to support and justify all the tax returns.but if you want to try to establish that all these returns were perfectly legitimate and that no wrong doing was undertaken,then that certainly contrary to what i got in these other cases.emphases added.
the second statement by the court occurred after the government rested its case and poole filed a motion for a judgment of acquittal.during a hearing on that motion,counsel for poole argued that although the government had presented a strong case against mavroulis,there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction of poole.the district court interjected,suggesting that counsel did not need to evaluate the strength of the government case against mavroulis because he had already pled guilty.
the third reference relied on by poole occurred in footnote three of the district court memorandum opinion.there,the district court stated that to the extent poole claimed that the tax returns at issue did not violate federal tax laws,that defense was belied by agent wallace testimony and by the simple fact that stilianos mavroulis had pled guilty on the advice of his attorneys to four separate counts of filing tax returns in violation of.the district court made a substantially similar statement when it announced its verdict in open court 
poole asserts that these statements by the district court demonstrate that the district court prejudged the issue of the falsity of the tax returns and the willful nature of poole conduct,thereby effectively relieving the government of its burden to prove these elements of beyond a reasonable doubt and denying poole his due process right to a fair trial as an example of this alleged bias,poole argues that the district court mistakenly thought that mavroulis pleaded guilty to four counts of tax fraud,and was influenced by that factual error in finding poole guilty by association of four counts of aiding in the preparation of false tax returns.
before we consider the merits of these arguments,we must resolve the parties dispute regarding the proper standard for our appellate review.at the outset,we observe that the district court comments constitute error,because the court apparently gave some consideration to matters that were not in evidence in the case.when a district court commits an evidentiary error,even one that implicates a defendant constitutional rights,we ordinarily review that error for harmlessness.chapman california,bauberger haynes,cir.poole maintains,however,that harmless error review is inappropriate in this case.he contends that the district court repeated references to the mavroulises guilty pleas demonstrate that the error in this case affected the entire course of his trial,from beginning to end,depriving him of his due process right to a fair trial.thus,poole asserts,the district court alleged reliance on the pleas,which were not admitted into evidence,constitutes structural error,requiring automatic reversal of his conviction of the four charges.
to warrant such automatic reversal as structural error,however,an error must implicate a defendant constitutional rights and affect the very framework in which a trial proceeds.see neder united states,arizona fulminante,united states higgs,cir united states curbelo,cir united states blevins,cir.the supreme court has described structural errors as defects in the constitution of the trial mechanism that defy analysis by standards,because those defects are necessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate.sullivan louisiana,quoting fulminante,at curbelo,at.
the supreme court has found structural error in only a very limited class of cases involving errors that affect constitutional rights and that are so intrinsically harmful to the proceeding that the errors render the trial an unreliable vehicle for determining innocence or guilt.see tumey ohio,biased trial judge vasquez hillery,racial discrimination in selection of grand jury mckaskle wiggins,denial of at trial sullivan,at defective instruction.thus,the vast majority of constitutional errors are not structural,but are trial errors that are subject to harmless error review.
we explained the difference between structural and trial errors in united states blevins,a case involving a jury trial.in that case,the district court allowed the introduction into evidence of guilty pleas entered by codefendants.at.on appeal,this court assumed that the defendant timely objected to this evidence and concluded that although the district court error was of constitutional dimension,it was not a structural error,because the error did not affect the entire conduct of the trial from beginning to end.id.at.we held instead that the district court improper admission of the guilty pleas into evidence was a trial error subject to harmless error review,because the error occurred during the presentation of the case to the jury and could be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether the admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.id.
we will assume,without deciding,that the district court repeated references to the guilty pleas implicated poole constitutional rights.nevertheless,we hold that the district court error is a classic example of a trial error subject to harmless error review.the effect of the district court statements about the mavroulises guilty pleas,which occurred at various discrete times during the presentation of the case and in the court memorandum opinion,can be measured against the other evidence that was properly admitted during the trial.see id.at.thus,we disagree with poole contentions that the cumulative effect of the error renders it structural in nature,and that the repetition of the remarks demonstrates bias on the part of the district court.the repetition of this error does not change its fundamental nature,because we can still evaluate its impact along with the properly admitted evidence in the case.see id.at.
having rejected poole claim of structural error,we apply harmless error review to the district court several references to the guilty pleas by the mavroulises.id.at.accordingly,we determine whether the impact of the references to those pleas was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,such that it is clear that a rational fact finder would have found poole guilty absent the error.chapman,at.
relying on our prior decisions involving jury trials,poole contends that the district court references to the mavroulises guilty pleas were presumptively prejudicial.these decisions,however,are inapposite to the consideration of such error in the context of a bench trial.as we explained in blevins,when a defendant is tried by a jury,there are two dangers inherent in a jury being permitted to consider a guilty plea of a who does not testify.a defendant in such a case can not probe the motivations for the guilty plea through,and a reviewing court can not be certain that a conviction rests on an assessment of the defendant own culpability rather than the disposition of the charges against the.blevins,at.
in contrast,when a district court finds a defendant guilty after a bench trial,appellate courts generally presume that the conviction rested only on admissible evidence.see united states smith,cir ordinary presumption in cases is that trial judge relied only on the evidence that properly was admitted united states cardenas,cir judge,sitting as a trier of fact,is presumed to have rested decision only on admissible evidence and to have disregarded inadmissible evidence.moreover,in the present case,the district court addressed poole challenge to footnote three of the memorandum opinion during proceedings and expressly disavowed any reliance on mavroulis plea,stating that the plea had no effect at all on the court judgment.emphasis added.
in the proceedings,the district court further explained that its judgment rested solely on the government overwhelming evidence that the tax forms prepared by poole failed to report portions of mavroulis taxable income.the district court also stated that it rejected poole defense that he was merely incompetent,rather than willful,and found that poole deliberately avoided learning that the financial records provided to him by the mavroulises were materially false.
we agree with the district court characterization of the evidence in this case as overwhelming.as discussed in greater detail below,the various financial documents prepared by poole contained large discrepancies,supporting a conclusion that poole deliberately avoided learning of materially false representations in mavroulis income tax returns.for example,in,poole prepared both an informational tax return for fidelity home indicating that the business paid in compensation to mavroulis,and a personal income tax return for mavroulis that resulted in mavroulis receiving an earned income tax credit,a credit available to individuals earning low wages.therefore,based on our review of the record,including the district court explanation of the bases for its judgment,we conclude that the district court various references to the mavroulises guilty pleas did not contribute to the verdict and,accordingly,were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.see chapman,at see also eplus,aboud,cir.
we next address poole claim that the district court erred in crediting certain objectively flawed testimony by agent wallace,who was qualified by the district court as an expert witness in forensic accounting and income tax computation.poole maintains that agent wallace did not understand rules for transactions,and that he failed to consider the impact of certain deductions on the calculation of mavroulis personal tax liability.based on these alleged mistakes,poole contends that agent wallace testimony was too unreliable to be considered as evidence of poole guilt.
practically speaking,however,poole asks us to accept his own calculations of mavroulis tax liability in place of the numbers and conclusions drawn by agent wallace.we decline poole request,because it effectively asks us to reverse a credibility determination by the district court and to reweigh the evidence presented at trial.
in qualifying agent wallace as an expert witness,the district court determined that his testimony was the product of reliable principles and methods.see.moreover,any purported factual mistakes by agent wallace or alleged weaknesses in his methodology were subject to at trial.based on the questions posed by poole counsel on,the district court was aware of the asserted problems regarding agent wallace testimony,and nonetheless accepted that testimony as credible and reliable.we defer to this credibility determination by the district court.united states abu ali,cir see united states murray,cir.
poole next argues that the government failed to prove that he acted willfully,and with knowledge that the tax forms he prepared contained materially false information we consider this argument under an established standard of review.in examining the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a conviction,an appellate court must affirm the district court judgment if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states madrigal valadez,cir quo
