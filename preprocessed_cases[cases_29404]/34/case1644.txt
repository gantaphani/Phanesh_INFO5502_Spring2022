james washington pled guilty to possessing a firearm as a convicted felon in violation of g.the armed career criminal act acca provides minimum sentences for g violators with three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses.e.washington admits two such convictions,but appeals the district court finding that a november maryland conviction for possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance counts as his third.
maryland possession with intent to distribute offense is ambiguous for acca purposes some underlying controlled substances trigger a sufficiently high maximum sentence to qualify as acca predicates,but others do not.as a result,the sentencing court had to find facts about washington november conviction.it found by a preponderance of the evidence that washington conviction qualified as an acca predicate because it involved cocaine.
washington throws up numerous objections to what in reality is nothing more than straightforward trial court within the framework of shepard united states.washington contends,however,that shepard,as well as the sixth amendment and due process,require proof beyond a reasonable doubt in making such determinations.but shepard defines the universe of records the government may use to demonstrate facts about prior convictions,not the standard of proof required to prove them,and our precedents bar washington broader claims.because the district court properly relied on sources in making its factual determination that washington november conviction qualified as an acca predicate,we affirm.
on november,a car carrying two baltimore police department officers stopped at a traffic light.the officers noticed that washington,the driver of the car next to theirs,was drinking malt liquor.one of the officers approached washington car to speak with him,but he quickly drove away.the officers caught up with him at another stoplight,but when one yelled police he sped off again,this time by putting his car in reverse and driving backwards into oncoming traffic.washington spun his car around,raced forward,and ultimately crashed into a car stopped at another stoplight.the pursuing officers saw that washington who by now had exited his damaged vehicle and was running holding a gun.they caught up with washington and finally subdued him,recovering his loaded mm handgun.
as a result of this incident,washington pled guilty to violating g,which prohibits anyone convicted of a crime punishable by more than one year imprisonment from possessing firearms or ammunition.under the acca,those who violate g and have three previous convictions for violent felon ies or serious drug offense s must receive at least a sentence.e.washington report described six possibly qualifying convictions,and he accepted that two of and november convictions for possessing narcotics with intent to manufacture or.but he argued the government could not sufficiently demonstrate a third.
to that end,the government introduced evidence regarding washington april convictions for assault and resisting arrest,his june conviction for assault,and his november conviction for possession with intent to manufacture or distribute.the district court addressed only washington november conviction,finding that the government had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that this conviction qualified as an acca predicate.in a straightforward exercise of its responsibilities,the district court noted that the government documents were not a model of clarity by any stretch of the word but said as follows 
it is clear from the circuit court for baltimore city documentation the docket entries that there was a conviction on count charging possession with intent to distribute apparently mislabeled as heroin although cocaine was charged.the rule in federal court is that,to be satisfactory,an indictment need not charge the precise drug,but need only charge a proscribed narcotic.so here it clear that there was a felony conviction for possession with intent to distribute a proscribed narcotic,which means that the predicate offenses are satisfied,and washington is properly denominated as an armed career criminal.
accordingly,the district court sentenced washington to months,a small downward departure from his enhanced guidelines range of to months.absent acca and career offender enhancements,washington would have faced a guidelines sentencing range of to months and,under a,a statutory maximum of months.
washington contends that the district court erred in applying a preponderance of the evidence standard in evaluating whether his november conviction triggered his acca sentence.to assess this argument,we begin by describing the acca definition of a serious drug offense,the maryland law at issue in washington november conviction,and the judicial process used to determine whether that conviction qualifies.
as it relates to washington case,the acca defines a serious drug offense as an offense under state law,involving manufacturing,distributing,or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute,a controlled substance,for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.e a ii.at the time of washington conviction,maryland law included a generic offense of possession of a controlled dangerous substance with intent to distribute 
i t is unlawful for any person t o manufacture,distribute,or dispense,or to possess a controlled dangerous substance in sufficient quantity to reasonably indicate an intent to manufacture,distribute,or dispense,a controlled dangerous substance 
ann,a west subsection divisions omitted.the penalties for violating this provision depended on the controlled dangerous substance at issue.if the substance was a schedule i or ii narcotic such as cocaine or heroin,a maximum applied.ann,b see also id.a b heroin b a cocaine.however,for certain other drugs,such as marijuana,only a maximum applied.ann,b 
it is thus impossible to tell whether a defendant conviction qualifies as an acca predicate from the statutory elements alone cocaine and heroin convictions do qualify,but marijuana convictions do not.as a result,sentencing courts addressing whether maryland possession with intent to distribute offenses qualify under the acca have to go beyond the preferred categorical approach,which looks only to the offense statutory elements.see taylor united states.instead,they must use the modified categorical approach,which looks to a larger but still circumscribed range of documents to determine the nature of a conviction for acca purposes.see shepard,at united states rivers,cir noting that the modified categorical approach is appropriate when different types of behavior satisfy an element of the offense and the proscribed behaviors constitute at least two separate crimes for acca purposes united states brandon,cir applying the modified categorical approach to ambiguous serious drug offenses.here,the district court had to determine whether washington november conviction involved a narcotic triggering the acca,or instead some other,drug.
washington argues that this kind of judicial can only take place under a heightened standard.most creatively,he argues that shepard itself requires the heightened standard.he notes that shepard instructs courts applying the modified categorical approach to use only conclusive records,shepard,at,ones which approach the certainty of those used in determining whether a conviction qualifies under the categorical approach,id.at.conclusive and certain,he insists,are adjectives that do not properly describe a mere preponderance test,but instead require something more.
to begin with,our precedent does not run in washington favor.in united states harcum,cir,this court discussed shepard and reiterated the preponderance standard in a modified categorical case.
we think the standard harcum applied was the correct one.harcum did not discuss shepard,however,in the standard of proof context,and on that point we think washington argument misreads shepard and ignores the issue it actually addressed.the government there sought to prove that shepard prior plea conviction qualified him for an acca enhancement.see shepard,at.because his massachusetts burglary offense may or may not have qualified under the acca depending on its nature,the court had to extend taylor brief description of the modified categorical approach from the trial context to the plea context,see id.at,determining whether police reports and complaint applications sufficiently resembled the charging papers and jury instructions whose use was specifically approved in taylor,see id.at citing taylor,at.
viewed in context,the true meaning of the sound bites about certainty and conclusive ness that washington extracts from shepard becomes clear they define the universe of records the government may use in proving the nature of a prior conviction,not the burden of proof it faces in making its showing from those records.see united states palomino garcia,cir under the modified categorical approach,a court may determine the basis for the conviction by consulting a narrow universe of shepard documents.accordingly,shepard conclusive records language occurs as part of its rejection of the government request to use records from courts other than the court of conviction and records generated prior to charging.see shepard,at.
similarly,shepard approach the certainty language occurs during another discussion of records,one in which the court reasoned that accepting items like police reports would undermine taylor instruction to use a process as close to the pure categorical approach as possible.see id.at.in keeping with this focus on court records,the court subsequent references to shepard speak to the universe of records to be consulted the modified categorical approach permits a court to determine the basis for the conviction by consulting the trial charging documents,plea agreements,transcripts of plea colloquies,findings of fact and conclusions of law from a bench trial,and jury instructions and verdict forms.johnson united states,citing shepard,at.in other words,shepard simply does not mean what washington says it does.
moreover,if washington interpretation were correct,shepard would be curiously silent about its important reworking of the law.shepard majority opinion never mentions a preponderance standard,a heightened standard,or any of the cases that applying a heightened standard would have overruled.see,united states kriens,cir applying a preponderance standard in a modified categorical case united states hill,cir en banc same.it would be strange for the supreme court to change the law so profoundly yet so quietly,and we should not strain to find that it has done so where there are more plausible interpretations of its handiwork.
finally,washington interpretation ignores one of the animating purposes of the line the desire to avoid extensive litigation about prior convictions at sentencing.taylor noted the practical difficulties of allowing recourse to trial transcripts and witness testimony at a sentencing hearing,taylor,at,and shepard referred to taylor conclusion as a pragmatic one,aimed in part at avoid ing evidentiary disputes,shepard,at.given this purpose,it is again more plausible to read shepard statements about certainty and conclusiveness as referring to a canonical set of records that will prevent sentencing from devolving into a retrial of the defendant prior convictions.
we thus disagree that shepard requires a departure from the preponderance standard.we also note that we are not alone.perhaps in recognition of shepard context,its silence about a heightened standard,and its desire to avoid,our sister circuits have explicitly or implicitly adopted this same reading of shepard by applying a preponderance standard in modified categorical cases.see,united states forrest,cir united states martin,cir united states rosa,cir united states dowd,cir.
washington contends also that the sixth amendment and the due process clause require at the very least a reasonable doubt standard where factual findings about the nature of a prior conviction are involved.this view,once again,is problematic on many fronts.the preponderance standard is the one traditionally applied in sentencing determinations,and we have consistently declined invitations to create exceptions.see harcum,at applying the preponderance standard in the modified categorical approach context united states grubbs,cir applying a preponderance standard to judicial that increases the advisory guidelines sentencing range.and rightly so shepard itself recognized a role for judicial under the modified categorical approach,see shepard,at,confined the sources of that to a circumscribed set of judicial documents,see id.at,and never once indicated that utilizing approved judicial sources was constitutionally required to be conducted under something other than the ordinary standards and burdens of proof.
moreover,shepard restrictions mitigate any sixth amendment problems that lurk in the modified categorical approach and judicial by a preponderance of the evidence.under shepard document limitations,courts can not look to sources that would allow them to rely on facts neither inherent in the conviction nor admitted by the defendant.united states alston,cir see also united states bethea,cir looking at whether charging documents and any judicial records necessarily show the defendant conviction qualified under the acca citing shepard,at.as a result,any acca enhancement stems only from information about the nature of a conviction that has passed through sixth amendment filters charging documents and jury instructions that indicate what the government must have proved,factual findings to which the defendant consented,and so forth.see alston,at shepard limitations render the modified categorical approach consistent with the sixth amendment by limiting to the defendant admissions and to facts inherent in a prior conviction.there is simply no sixth amendment or due process violation in judges finding facts about the nature of a prior conviction by a preponderance of the evidence,provided,however,they stay within shepard bounds.
washington next asserts that the district court erred in finding that the government met its burden of proof under the preponderance standard.he argues that inconsistencies in the records,as well as shepard limitations on which records could properly be considered,prove that the government could not reliably make its case.we review legal issues such as whether a defendant previous conviction counted as an acca predicate de novo,see harcum,at,and we review factual findings for clear error,see rivers,at united states wardrick,cir.we begin by summarizing the evidence introduced.
the government introduced a number of records designed to prove that washington had a november conviction for possession with intent to manufacture or distribute and that this conviction qualified under the acca.a charge summary from the district court for baltimore city district court listed two offenses,cds marihuana and cds dist narc,the first with a maximum penalty and the second with a maximum penalty.the statement of probable cause,submitted with the application for statement of charges filed with the district court,alleged that officers observed washington selling drugs and apprehended him with thirty rocks of crack cocaine.dated and including case and tracking numbers,the application charged washington with two counts first,possession of a controlled dangerous substance,to wit cocaine,in violation of,and second,possession of a controlled dangerous substance,to wit cocaine,in a quantity sufficient to indicate an intent to distribute,in violation of.
washington case was elevated to the circuit court of baltimore city circuit court by a criminal information.that information repeated the case and tracking numbers from the application and included a new circuit court criminal information number,but it also listed the date of offense as april,unlike the application reference to.the information charged washington in count with possessing a controlled dangerous substance,to wit cocaine,in sufficient quantity to reasonably indicate an intent to manufacture and distribute in violation of,and in count with possessing a controlled dangerous substance,to wit
