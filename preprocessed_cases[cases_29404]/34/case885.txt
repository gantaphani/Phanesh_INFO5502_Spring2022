background 
an exhaustive description of the facts of this case,including an analysis of various inconsistencies and contradictions within rojas account,is contained in the district court decision and order of october,granting the defendants motions for summary judgment.see rojas roman catholic diocese of rochester rojas ii,d,wl,at.for purposes of resolving this appeal,the following overview suffices.
rojas was employed by the diocese as its coordinator for hispanic migrant ministry for the brockport area from may,through november.her immediate supervisor was bernard grizard grizard,the diocese director for parish support ministries.rojas office was located on the campus of the church of the nativity of the blessed virgin mary church of the nativity or the parish,in brockport,new york.the church of the nativity is a separate corporate entity from the diocese,though it had an arrangement with the diocese allowing the hispanic migrant ministry to operate out of offices in its parish center.during the time that rojas was employed by the diocese,enyan boadu was the pastor of the church of the nativity.enyan boadu was not an employee of the diocese,but rather of the church of the nativity.in her complaint,rojas alleged that she was the victim of sexual harassment by enyan boadu,which created a hostile work environment,and that the diocese fired her in retaliation for her complaining about enyan boadu sexual harassment.
at the summary judgment stage,the critical issue was whether liability for enyan boadu alleged harassment could be imputed to the diocese.this depended on whether enyan boadu was a supervisor of rojas and whether she had made any complaints to the diocese such that the diocese knew or should have known of the alleged sexual harassment.as explained at length in the district court opinion,see rojas ii,wl,at,the only evidence suggesting that enyan boadu was rojas supervisor or that the diocese knew or should have known of the alleged harassment was rojas own testimony,in the form of an affidavit submitted in opposition to summary judgment,and excerpts from her depositions.this evidence,the district court found,contradicted the allegations in rojas complaints as well as other sworn statements that rojas had made during the course of discovery and in a separate criminal trial of enyan boadu,which had ended in his acquittal id.at.
rojas conflicting statements regarding enyan boadu supervisory status 
in her original complaint,rojas alleged that enyan boadu was her and referred to grizard as her supervisor.the district court subsequently granted in part a defense motion to dismiss with leave to replead.rojas roman catholic diocese of rochester rojas i,d.in its opinion,the district court noted that,at oral argument on the motion to dismiss,the court sua sponte raised the issue of whether the diocese could be held vicariously liable for the alleged hostile environment created by enyan boadu,where,according to the complaint,enyan boadu was plaintiff.id.at.despite the district court identification of the issue,in her amended complaint,rojas again alleged that enyan boadu was her and that grizard was her supervisor,and she persisted in characterizing enyan boadu and grizard in this manner in her sworn responses to defendants interrogatories.this characterization of enyan boadu and grizard respective roles was consistent with rojas earlier testimony at enyan boadu criminal trial.
in her papers opposing defendants motion for summary judgment,however,rojas contended that enyan boadu was,in fact,her supervisor,or at least one of her supervisors.to support this assertion,rojas relied on her own affidavit and certain portions of her deposition testimony.in her affidavit,rojas stated that i was never clear on who her sic boss was,as no one ever clarified it to me,and that i asked who my boss is and grizard said,grizard,jesus flores,another priest in the diocese,and father peter enyan boadu.similarly,during her april,deposition,rojas stated that she had asked grizard to clarify who is my boss and h e said that my boss is bernard grizard,jesus flores,and father peter enyan boadu.
rojas did not dispute that enyan boadu parish was a separate corporate entity from the diocese and that she was employed by the diocese,not the parish.
rojas conflicting statements regarding the diocese knowledge of the alleged harassment 
in three federal complaints one before the equal employment opportunities commission eeoc and two in the district court rojas alleged that she had made the following generalized complaints about enyan boadu to the diocese on october,she met with grizard and complained that father peter is making my life miserable and you need to take action.at an october,meeting with grizard and mary bauer,the diocese director of human resources,she started to explain to bauer about the hostile environment and work conditions in my work place but was interrupted on november,she wrote by to the department of human resources indicating that i wanted to discuss sexual misconduct.none of the three pleadings contained an allegation that rojas had complained specifically of sexual harassment by enyan boadu subsequently,in a sworn response to a defense interrogatory asking her to d escribe each occasion on which she complained to the defendants,rojas indicated that the only complaint she had made to the diocese was on october,when she met with grizard and told him that pastor peter is making my life miserable and you need to take action.consistent with these statements,rojas testified at enyan boadu trial that she had not made any specific complaints to the diocese about enyan boadu harassing behavior because she felt intimidated by enyan boadu.
rojas story changed when she was deposed by the diocese attorney on april.there,for the first time,she stated that she had complained to grizard during her annual performance evaluation on august,that enyan boadu was touching her she also testified that,at her october meeting with grizard,she accuse d father peter that sic he touching me and kissing me.rojas relied on this testimony,as well as her own affidavit,in her papers opposing summary judgment where she asserted that she had repeatedly complained about father peter and especially recalls telling the diocese and bernard grizard that she was being sexual sic assaulted by father peter.she would tell them,father peter was touching me and would constantly cry to them.pl.mem.opp.at,rojas ii,cv cjs,july,ecf.
while rojas relied solely on her own testimony to support these assertions the diocese supported its motion for summary judgment with affidavits and contemporaneous and meeting notes strongly suggesting that it had no knowledge of the alleged harassment until after rojas employment ended,when it was reported that enyan boadu had been arrested 
the district court opinion 
in a detailed,page opinion granting defendants motions for summary judgment,the district court catalogued the inconsistencies and contradictions described above among others and concluded that this case goes far beyond simple issues of credibility.rather,upon the entire record,plaintiff has changed key aspects of her prior version of events,set forth in pleadings,trial testimony,and sworn discovery responses,in an attempt to defeat the diocese summary judgment motion.rojas ii,wl,at having demonstrated the inconsistencies and contradictions in rojas account,the district court concluded that there were no genuine issues of material fact that would allow a reasonable jury to find in rojas favor on her title vii and nyshrl claims.id.at.after dismissing rojas federal claims,the district court declined,pursuant to c,to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over her common law assault and battery claim against enyan boadu.id.at.rojas appeals only the rulings entering summary judgment on her hostile work environment and retaliation claims against the diocese.
discussion 
we review the district court entry of summary judgment de novo.see gayle gonyea,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.a fact is material for these purposes when it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.anderson liberty lobby,d.an issue is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.id.the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff position will be insufficient there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.id.at emphasis added.in weighing the evidence on a motion for summary judgment,the judge must ask not whether the evidence unmistakably favors one side or the other but whether a jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented.id.the burden of demonstrating that no material fact exists lies with the moving party.see adickes kress,d.
the district court assessment of rojas testimony 
the district court granted summary judgment after concluding that rojas had offered sham evidence in opposition to the defendants motions.in other words,it concluded that no reasonable juror could believe certain of rojas factual averments in opposition to summary judgment,given contradictory statements she had made in prior sworn testimony and pleadings.although a district court generally should not weigh evidence or assess the credibility of witnesses,hayes city dep t of,cir,we have held that 
in the rare circumstance where the plaintiff relies almost exclusively on his own testimony,much of which is contradictory and incomplete,it will be impossible for a district court to determine whether the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff,and thus whether there are any genuine issues of material fact,without making some assessment of the plaintiff account.
jeffreys city of new york,cir quoting anderson,at.it appears from the record before us that this is such a case.
rojas opposition to summary judgment relied almost entirely on her own testimony,in the form of an affidavit and excerpts from her depositions in contrast,the diocese submitted competent and persuasive evidence,including contemporaneous letters and meeting notes suggesting that,to the extent rojas made complaints regarding her relationship with enyan boadu,they related to the general friction between the two and made no reference to sexual harassment.therefore,in order to determine whether there were any genuine issues of material fact to be tried by a jury,the district court was entitled to assess rojas factual averments.jeffreys,at.
the district court scrupulously detailed plain inconsistencies between the facts advanced by rojas in opposition to summary judgment and those alleged in her original and amended complaints,in sworn interrogatory responses,in portions of her deposition testimony,in her complaints before the eeoc,and in prior sworn testimony against enyan boadu at his criminal trial.see rojas ii,wl,at.in particular,the district court observed that rojas had repeatedly alleged that enyan boadu was her and not her employer or supervisor in her earlier sworn statements and in her complaints,only to abruptly describe him as one of her supervisors in her papers opposing summary judgment.id.at.in addition,the district court noted that,despite expressly testifying in enyan boadu criminal trial that she made no complaint about his sexual harassment of her to the diocese,and despite having made no allegation to the contrary in the civil complaints filed in the district court,rojas suddenly asserted in her opposition papers and portions of her deposition testimony that she had indeed made such a complaint on august.id.at.
these new allegations,directly contradicted by her prior sworn statements and judicial admissions,were properly rejected by the district court after a careful consideration of the record before it.see jeffreys,at affirming district court entry of summary judgment where the district court found nothing in the record to support plaintiff allegations other than plaintiff own contradictory and incomplete testimony,and the district court,even after drawing all inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,determined that no reasonable person could believe jeffreys testimony internal citation and alteration omitted see also bellafonte re ins.argonaut ins,cir a party assertion of fact in a pleading is a judicial admission by which it normally is bound throughout the course of the proceeding.accordingly,the district court properly disregarded universal affidavits seeking to controvert its own pleading.internal citations omitted.
in so holding,we do not suggest that district courts should routinely engage in searching,skeptical analyses of parties testimony in opposition to summary judgment.as we observed in jeffreys,if there is a plausible explanation for discrepancies in a party testimony,the court considering a summary judgment motion should not disregard the later testimony because an earlier account was ambiguous,confusing,or simply incomplete.at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.however,in certain extraordinary cases,where the facts alleged are so contradictory that doubt is cast upon their plausibility,the court may pierce the veil of the complaint factual allegations and dismiss the claim.id.at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.to hold otherwise,and require district courts to allow parties to defeat summary judgment simply by testifying to the allegations in their pleadings or,as here,to facts not alleged in their pleadings,would license the mendacious to seek windfalls in the litigation lottery.arrington united states,brown,concurring in part and dissenting in part.
here,rojas and her counsel were given ample opportunity to explain or reconcile rojas inconsistent and contradictory statements,but no such explanation was provided.rather,rojas simply maintained that credibility determinations are left to the jury.however,as explained above,in certain cases a party inconsistent and contradictory statements transcend credibility concerns and go to the heart of whether the party has raised genuine issues of material fact to be decided by a jury.this is such a case.therefore,the district court did not err in concluding,in effect,that the evidence introduced by rojas was not of such a character that it would warrant the jury in finding a verdict in favor of that party.anderson,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court ruling on plaintiff title vii and nyshrl claims 
having concluded that rojas failed to create a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the imputation of liability to the diocese,the district court proceeded to dismiss rojas hostile work environment and retaliation claims.once again,we find no error in the district court rulings.
hostile work environment claim 
under title vii,
a plaintiff claiming he or she was the victim of an unlawful hostile work environment must
