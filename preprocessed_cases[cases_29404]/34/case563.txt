background 
on july,at,police officer brame brame received a complaint from a woman identifying herself as mccarty.she told brame that she had recently been to mccarty apartment to retrieve her possessions,that mccarty was in possession of marijuana plants,and that mccarty had vaguely threatened her with a shotgun.brame told detective goss goss about the matter goss called the woman back,and asked her to come into the police station.after interviewing the woman and her sister and learning that mccarty had been recently institutionalized for mental illness,goss drafted a warrant application to search mccarty apartment.goss brought the warrant application to a state district attorney for approval,and then presented the application to a state complaint justice.while goss was seeking approval of the warrant,police officer rumsey rumsey contacted bureau of alcohol,tobacco,and firearms batf agent mcsweyn mcsweyn,and informed him that they would be executing a search warrant on an apartment thought to contain firearms.the state complaint justice issued the warrant at approximately a box on the warrant stated,this warrant shall be executed between the hours of am and pm.
brame,goss,rumsey,and three other police officers proceeded to mccarty apartment,arriving at.at,brame knocked on mccarty door,announced his identity,and stated that he had a search warrant.after gaining entry,the officers encountered mccarty,handcuffed him,and led him to a couch in his living room.the officers began to search the apartment at.the officers found marijuana and marijuana paraphernalia in the apartment.while searching behind the couch in mccarty living room,goss found a duffle bag containing a shotgun.when mccarty saw goss uncover the gun,he stated that it was an antique known as the old peacemaker,and that it was in the same condition as when it was manufactured.mccarty then asked the police officers for permission to smoke a cigarette,which he was allowed to do.upon returning to the apartment,mccarty complained that his handcuffs were too tight,and goss removed them.goss then seated mccarty at a table approximately four to five feet away from the duffle bag containing the gun.
mcsweyn arrived and conferred with goss.goss told mcsweyn that he had found a gun,and showed him the shotgun.when goss showed mcsweyn the shotgun,mccarty stated,that mine.it an old peacemaker.mcsweyn measured the gun,and determined that the barrel length was eleven inches.
mcsweyn then began to question mccarty.at this time,a member of the search team,police officer burbank,was standing next to mccarty.before asking him any questions,mcsweyn did not read mccarty any miranda warnings,but instead told mccarty that he was not under arrest,that he was free to leave whenever he wanted,and that he did not have to answer questions.mccarty nevertheless told mcsweyn that he had received the gun from his grandfather,that he had altered it to make it easier to fire and that he had in fact fired the weapon,and that he had not registered the gun with the batf.mccarty also repeated his assertion that the gun was an antique.the search concluded at,when all law enforcement officers left the apartment.
on february,a grand jury indicted mccarty on one count of possession of an unregistered firearm in violation of d and,and one count of possession of a firearm after having previously been committed to a mental institution in violation of g.mccarty was arrested on april.on may,mccarty filed a motion to suppress all evidence collected at his apartment because the search warrant was defectively executed when officers remained past,and to suppress all statements mccarty made to goss and mcsweyn because mccarty was not informed of his miranda rights the motion was referred to a magistrate judge,who recommended that it be denied.the district court accepted the recommendation of the magistrate judge and issued an order denying the motion to suppress.on october,mccarty pled guilty pursuant to a conditional plea reserving his rights to appeal the denial of the motion to suppress.
mccarty amended report psr calculated his base offense level at,a b the psr applied a enhancement under b because the offense involved a destructive device,resulting in a total offense level of.the psr also determined that mccarty had a criminal history category of 
mccarty raised seven objections to the psr,among them that the application of the b enhancement constituted impermissible double counting,and that in any case,he did not qualify for the enhancement because he did not possess a destructive device.the court denied the objections and applied the b enhancement.the court then applied a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,resulting in a total offense level of,which translates to a recommended sentencing guidelines range of thirty to months in prison.the court sentenced mccarty to months in prison on each count,to be served concurrently,followed by three years of supervised release.
ii.discussion 
motion to suppress evidence collected at mccarty apartment 
mccarty contends that the district court should have suppressed the evidence collected by the police at his apartment on july,because the search warrant obtained by police stated that it could only be executed between and,and police remained at his apartment until.we review a district court decision to deny a motion to suppress de novo as to legal conclusions and for clear error as to factual findings.united states vongkaysone,cir.
the fourth amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.even a search conducted pursuant to a warrant may be unreasonable given the manner in which the search has been conducted.see,united states ram√≠rez,d excessive or unnecessary destruction of property in the course of a search may violate the fourth amendment,even though the entry itself is lawful.united states young,cir nothing forbids continuing a search at night,at least when doing so is reasonable.
mccarty complains that the search of his apartment was unreasonable because it was conducted,in part,at night,whereas the warrant authorizing the search stated that the search could only be executed during the daytime.mccarty concern about nighttime searches is not unprecedented,see,jones united states,d i t is difficult to imagine a more severe invasion of privacy than the nighttime intrusion into a private home that occurred in this instance,but nighttime searches are not per se unreasonable rather,we apply a traditional reasonableness test to the search.young,at.
in this case,the search warrant provided that nighttime began at see also me.h a warrant shall direct that it be executed between the hours of and unless the judge or justice of the peace authorizes its execution at another time.the search warrant team gained entry to the apartment at and began its search at thus,even though they were cutting it very close,the police did in fact commence the search during daytime as defined by the warrant.the search continued until,but we have held that a search which began during the daytime but which continued through the nighttime is not necessarily unreasonable.young,at see also state sargent,me finding no grounds for suppression where a search began before but concluded at.in fact,the search of mccarty apartment was significantly less intrusive than the valid search conducted in young,which began in the morning,and continued throughout the night and for two additional days.at.
furthermore,we have stated that 
i n considering the question of reasonableness of a search,a court must assess the totality of the circumstances,including the scope of the particular intrusion,the manner in which it is conducted,the justification for initiating it,and the place in which it is conducted.
united states cofield,cir.here,there is no evidence that mccarty was roused from his sleep,or that the search was particularly intrusive.to the contrary,when the search team knocked on the door,mccarty roommate opened it,and the police found mccarty standing awake in his living room.mccarty was allowed a considerable degree of freedom during the search,which by all accounts was conducted in a very professional manner.finally,there is no dispute that the search was given the report of weapons and drugs by mccarty.
thus,we conclude that the search of mccarty apartment was reasonable,and that the district court was correct to have denied mccarty motion to suppress the evidence collected from his apartment 
motion to suppress mccarty statements 
mccarty argues that his statements to the police and the batf should be suppressed because they were obtained in violation of miranda arizona,d.we review the district court denial of mccarty motion to suppress de novo as to legal conclusions and for clear error as to factual findings.united states,cir.
in miranda,the court held that prior to interrogating a suspect who is in custody,that suspect must be advised of certain rights in order to protect his or her fifth amendment right against.at.thus,in order to claim a miranda violation,a suspect must be in custody,pasdon city of peabody,cir,and the suspect must have been interrogated,caputo nelson,cir.
mccarty made the first set of statements that he claims should be suppressed while he was handcuffed.as such,there can be no question that mccarty made those statements while he was in custody.see new york quarles,d finding that a suspect was in custody because he was surrounded by at least four police officers and was handcuffed when the questioning at issue took place.thus,we must determine whether an interrogation occurred.an interrogation occurs when there is express questioning,or any words or actions on the part of the police other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.rhode island innis,d.the facts of this case are similar to those in united states genao,where we found that no interrogation occurred when an officer showed a suspect drugs and guns seized from the suspect house and the suspect blurted out an inculpatory statement,cir.likewise,in the present case,officer goss revealed and inspected the shotgun in mccarty immediate presence.appellant br.at.after seeing the shotgun,mccarty blurted out that the gun was a peacemaker and began to tell goss about its origins.we find that goss removal of the gun from behind the couch was not interrogation,and accordingly,there can be no miranda violation.
similarly,the second set of statements that mccarty claims should be suppressed were not the product of interrogation.like the first set of statements,the police did not direct any questions to mccarty rather,goss simply showed the gun to agent mcsweyn,who proceeded to measure the gun in mccarty presence.mccarty then told the officers,unprompted,that the gun was his.given goss uncontradicted testimony that neither he nor mcsweyn cast so much as an inquiring glance at mccarty,we find that mccarty unsolicited statement was not the product of interrogation,and thus there was no miranda violation.
the third set of statements presents a different question.while police were concluding the search,agent mcsweyn asked mccarty questions about the origins and ownership of the shotgun.there is little debate that these questions were designed to elicit a response,and as such,they constitute interrogation.innis,at.however,before finding a miranda violation,we must determine whether mccarty was in custody.pasdon,at.in order to determine whether mccarty was in custody,we look to see if there is a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.california beheler,d.when mcsweyn began to question mccarty,mccarty was no longer handcuffed.although agent mcsweyn and one additional police officer remained in mccarty presence,mcsweyn explained to mccarty that he was not under arrest,that he was free to leave at any time,and that he did not have to answer any questions.it is clear that there was no arrest here and we conclude that this does not constitute a restraint on freedom of movement that would normally be associated with an arrest.see podlaski butterworth,cir finding that a suspect was not in custody where the defendant was not told he was under arrest was in a home familiar to him and police activity was consistent with investigatory questioning.accordingly,because mccarty was not in custody while being questioned by mcsweyn,there was no violation of miranda.because we have found no miranda violations,the district court did not err in denying mccarty motion to suppress.
application of b 
mccarty final salvo is that the district court incorrectly calculated his total offense level under the sentencing guidelines when it included the b enhancement for a destructive device.although the sentencing guidelines are now advisory rather than mandatory,see united states booker,d,we continue to emphasize their importance in sentencing decisions and require courts to correctly perform guidelines calculations.united states,cir in most cases,this will mean that the district court will have to calculate the applicable guidelines range including the resolution of any factual or legal disputes necessary to that calculation.we review guidelines calculations de novo as to legal conclusions,and for clear error as to the sentencing court factual findings.united states robinson,cir.
mccarty first argues that the application of the b enhancement is impermissible because it constitutes double counting,inasmuch as both the enhancement and the calculation of the base offense level,a b,are based on his possession of a shotgun.we have often said that double counting is less sinister than the name implies.see,united states lilly,cir quoting united states zapata,cir.this is because two or more guidelines will often rely on the same underlying facts,although accounting for different sentencing concerns.see,united states wallace,cir applying a b to account for unlawful possession of a weapon and to account for the way in which the weapon was used.thus,when 
neither an explicit prohibition against double counting nor a compelling basis for implying such a prohibition exists,clearly indicated adjustments for seriousness of the offense and for offender conduct can both be imposed,notwithstanding that the adjustments derive in some measure from a common nucleus of operative facts.
here,there is no explicit prohibition against double counting to the contrary,cmt.explicitly states a defendant whose offense involves a destructive device receives both the base offense level from the subsection applicable to a firearm listed in a,subsection a b,and a two level enhancement under subsection b.nor is there a compelling basis for implying such a prohibition.whereas the sentencing guideline for the base offense,a b,covers the wide range of weapons found in a,the b enhancement is intended to provide harsher punishment for destructive devices,a narrower set of more dangerous weapons.see cmt.such destructive devices pose a considerably greater risk to the public welfare than other national firearms act weapons.for example,possession of a silencer might qualify a defendant for the a b base offense level because a silencer is listed as a firearm in a,but would not qualify the defendant for the b enhancement because a silencer is not a destructive device.see f defining destructive devices.thus,because the guidelines for the base offense and the enhancement account for different sentencing concerns,we see no problem with using both guidelines to calculate mccarty total offense level.
