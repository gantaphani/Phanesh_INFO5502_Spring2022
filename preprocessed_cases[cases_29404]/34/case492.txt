we summarize here the relevant facts evidenced in the trial record.
on the morning of october,someone fired shots outside of the roxbury district courthouse in dudley square,roxbury,massachusetts.on the day of the shooting,maria sousa,a probation officer in the courthouse,was meeting with a client in her office.shortly before,she heard a gunshot outside her window.sousa looked out her window and saw several people including two men standing together.they stood approximately twenty to feet away from her office window.she had a clear view of the men and observed one of the them holding a silver revolver in his right hand.the man holding the revolver was approximately five feet eight inches in height,weighed approximately to pounds,had cornrow braids in his hair and a medium complexion,and wore a black sweatshirt,jeans,and sneakers.the other man was two or three inches taller and of medium build and complexion.he wore jeans,sneakers,and a light gray sweatshirt.
sousa saw the man holding the revolver fire it in the direction of the front of the courthouse.she then saw him run towards warren place.she saw the other man run but could not see in which direction.
martha holley,a construction landscaper,was working across the street from the courthouse at the corner of warren place and warren street when the shooting occurred.holley heard two to four loud bangs that sounded like gunshots come from the direction of the courthouse.she looked towards the courthouse and saw people running in all directions.she observed one man looking back at the commotion while crossing the street near her.the young man was dressed in a dark sweatshirt,light blue jeans,and sneakers.he wore cornrow braids in his hair,had light skin,and appeared to be.holley watched him run,with his hands in his sweatshirt pouch,down warren place and then up a driveway at warren place.
at around the same time,scott alden was working on the roof of the urban league building near the same intersection where holley saw the man.alden also heard gunshots.when he heard the shots,he looked in the direction of the courthouse and saw an male wearing jeans and a hooded sweatshirt run past.the man held a silver firearm in his right hand.alden lost sight of the man when he ran under the overhang of the building on which he was working.
boston police department bpd officers michael ross and juan seoane were in the courthouse the day of the shooting.both officers exited the courthouse when they heard two shots.outside the building,the officers observed twenty to thirty people running or laying on the ground.
holley and alden pointed the officers in the direction of warren place.holley directed the officers to the first house on the street,warren place,saying,he just went behind the new construction house,right there.three other individuals,a tow truck driver,a taxi driver,and a criminal defense attorney,also directed the officers toward warren place.when officer seoane arrived at warren place,construction workers on a nearby roof indicated to him that a man had run behind the new construction site at warren place.officer seoane arrived at warren place approximately thirty seconds to one minute after he exited the courthouse officer ross arrived approximately twenty to thirty seconds after he exited the courthouse.
an approximately chain link fence with an opening surrounded the front of the house at warren place.officer ross,who arrived first at the house,entered through the opening.he then noticed that the front door to the house was ajar and a gate to the backyard was open.he peered around an opening in the fence and saw pridgen walking toward him up the driveway from the rear of the house.officer ross observed that pridgen had cornrow braids in his hair and was wearing jeans and sneakers.he also observed that pridgen was wearing a white,which struck him as odd given that it was a cold october day.pridgen raised one hand and backed up a few steps when he saw officer ross.officers ross and seoane then detained pridgen.
after detaining pridgen,the officers searched the immediate area.the search revealed no evidence of another person in the vicinity.officer ross then went down the driveway to the backyard where he noticed a set of footprints leading to and from an approximately fence at the rear of the yard.he compared the footprints to the soles of pridgen sneakers they appeared to be consistent.officer ross then looked over the fence and saw a black sweatshirt about five to ten feet away from the fence.there was no debris on top of the sweatshirt.bpd detective greg gallagher recovered the sweatshirt.he discovered wrapped inside of it a silver smith wesson caliber revolver.the firearm contained four live rounds and two spent shells,indicating that the firearm had been fired twice.detective gallagher found only partial prints,insufficient to make an identification,on the firearm and one round of ammunition.
on december,a federal grand jury in the district of massachusetts returned an indictment charging pridgen with being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition,in violation of g.trial commenced on july.the government called sousa as its first witness.during her direct examination,sousa provided details regarding the two men she saw outside her window on october.she testified that the shooter was approximately five feet eight inches in height,weighed approximately to pounds,had cornrow braids in his hair and a medium complexion,and wore a black sweatshirt,jeans,and sneakers.she also testified that the man next to the shooter was two or three inches taller,had a medium build and complexion,and wore jeans,sneakers,and a light gray sweatshirt.
on cross examination,pridgen counsel questioned sousa about allegedly conflicting descriptions she had previously given.counsel asked sousa about two meetings with defense investigator alicia hutton during which she allegedly stated that the shooter was taller and wore a gray sweatshirt.sousa responded that she did not recall making the statements.
during,sousa testified that she made notes of the october events two days after the events occurred.she explained why she made the notes.she stated that she wanted to write something so that she could look back when the case came to court.familiar with the courts,she knew that cases sometimes take years to get to court.sousa testified that she did not review the notes before either meeting with hutton but reviewed them before trial.
defense counsel later tried to impeach sousa via extrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent statements pridgen called hutton to testify that sousa had previously told her that the shooter was the taller man wearing a gray sweatshirt.the district court,however,excluded the evidence,stating that not how you get a prior inconsistent statement into evidence and it does fit within the rules.
during her opening statement,defense counsel told the jury and the court about inconsistencies they would hear in sousa statements.the judge,however,excluded the evidence defense counsel planned to introduce to demonstrate the inconsistencies.notwithstanding the exclusion,defense counsel,in her closing argument,suggested to the jury that sousa had made inconsistent statements and perhaps had fabricated her trial testimony.
at trial,pridgen presented an innocent bystander defense.he argued that he was innocently walking down the driveway of warren place when officers ross and seoane came upon him.he also argued that the shooter escaped police by using an alternate exit from the backyard at warren place.the jury rejected his defense and returned a guilty verdict on july.the judge sentenced him to months,below the guidelines range.
the instant appeal followed.pridgen sole claim b
