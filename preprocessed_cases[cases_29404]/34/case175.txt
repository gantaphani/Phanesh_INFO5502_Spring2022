five days before the scheduled trial date,the district court advised the parties that due to a scheduling conflict,trial would be placed on the calendar and notified the parties that t he parties and counsel shall be ready to try this case with hours notice on or before january.order,united states romero lopez,ecf.in response to scheduling concerns voiced by defense counsel the court subsequently set a firm trial date of december.on december,the district court advanced the trial date by one day to december.on december,defense counsel filed a motion to continue trial to march,which was denied by the district court on the day it was filed.the following day,defense counsel filed a motion to reinstate the previously scheduled trial date of december,contending that changing the date of trial without prior notice,particularly if it cuts days for preparation,is a violation of due process.motion to reinstate trial original scheduling at,united states romero lopez,ecf.defense counsel also noted in the motion that he had a child custody hearing scheduled for december.id.this motion was also denied.
as scheduled,a jury trial commenced on december.however,during the course of the trial,on defense counsel motion,the court continued trial from december to december,due to severe health problems faced by defense counsel.
during trial,the government presented evidence that romero,along with his business partner,miguel reyes,also known as chino,operated two a legitimate sandwich shop and the other an illegal scheme designed to conceal the proceeds of illegal drug activity.the government presented the testimony of several witnesses to establish that romero and chino sent money by wire transfer to san diego,california to pay for marijuana.the government also established that after chino was murdered in,romero continued to wire transfer money to san diego.the government theory was that romero used his legitimate sandwich shop business to accomplish his scheme by having his sandwich shop employees wire transfer funds to san diego on his behalf after chino death.the period of the alleged conspiracy and illegal activity was from to,including both the period when romero sent wire transfers at chino behest and the period when romero transferred money after chino death.
among the government witnesses were two former employees of romero sandwich shop business,miguel rosa muriel rosa and luís díaz berríos díaz,who testified that romero had directed them to wire transfer money to san diego.according to rosa and díaz,following chino death,romero directed them to transfer a total of and,respectively.the government,through the testimony of an official from the treasury department of puerto rico,also introduced romero tax returns for through,which showed the income that he reported in those years from his sandwich shop business.the government argued that the limited revenues for the sandwich shop business shown on the returns were insufficient to explain the wire transfers.
romero was the sole witness for the defense.he testified that chino gave him money and directed him to wire transfer it to san diego,but that chino never told him the purpose behind the wire transfers or what type of business chino had in san diego.as to the wire transfers made after chino death in,romero testified that following chino death,chino cousin alexis came to him and told him that he had to continue sending money,and gave him the money to send.in short,the defense theory was that romero had no knowledge that the transfers were made to conceal illegal activity and that he was merely performing a favor for his friend and business partner,chino and later alexis.
on,the government inquired about the income that romero reported on his tax returns for through,which showed net incomes of only,negative,and,in,and,respectively.the government then asked romero about the money that he wire transferred to san diego,as well as the money that rosa and díaz had sent to san diego on romero behalf.the government theory apparently was that although romero was sending large sums of money to san diego,he reported only minimal income from his legitimate business,implying that the money that was sent to san diego was derived from his illegitimate business.following this line of questioning,the government then questioned romero about a trip that he took with his wife to san diego in which he was detained while carrying six money orders and in cash.the government elicited that the money was seized by federal agents,and that romero never attempted to claim the money after his release.
on december,the jury returned a verdict finding romero guilty of all counts,and finding that should be forfeited by romero.romero was sentenced to one hundred months of imprisonment and ordered to forfeit as proceeds derived from the offenses for which he was convicted.romero timely appealed.
on appeal,romero does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction.he argues only that he is entitled to a new trial due to three errors committed by the district court.specifically,he alleges that the district court erred by advancing the scheduled trial date by one calendar day,admitting evidence of his tax returns for to,and allowing the government to question him regarding his trip to san diego.we address each of romero claims in turn.
romero contends that his due process rights were violated when the district court advanced the scheduled trial date by one day from december to december.romero argues that he was prejudiced because his counsel had a custody hearing scheduled for december,though as we discuss below,this date is not reflected in the record,and his counsel trial preparation was therefore disrupted due to the stress involved in the scheduling conflict and the need to resolve it.we review the district court trial management decisions for abuse of discretion,as i t is the province of the district court to manage its docket,and,within that province,to decide what constitutes a reasonable period of time for preparation.united states ottens,cir internal citation omitted see also united states williams,cir reviewing the district court denial of a continuance for abuse of discretion.an abuse of discretion is found only where the court exhibited an unreasonable and arbitrary insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay.however,the district court discretion is limited by the defendant constitutional rights to effective assistance of counsel and to the testimony of defense witnesses.united states mangual santiago,cir alteration in original internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
although n ormally,one would expect a district court judge to grant a continuance of a trial in order to avoid an inadvertent scheduling conflict,united states flecha maldonado,cir,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in advancing trial by one day.trial had been originally scheduled to commence on november.from the time of the district court november order,defense counsel was fully aware that the case could proceed to trial at any moment and should have prepared accordingly.it was not until december,four days before the december trial date,that defense counsel informed the court of his conflicting custody hearing,which counsel asserted was scheduled for december,and not december,as romero now claims on appeal thus rescheduling trial to begin on december,rather than on december would not have alleviated counsel purported scheduling conflict.
furthermore,counsel has pointed to no way in which an additional hours of preparation would have made a significant difference.counsel appeared for the first day of trial and actively participated.the fact that counsel was apparently disciplined for failing to appear at the state court child custody hearing on that same date has no bearing on the propriety of the district court scheduling order.as we have previously noted,a defendant is generally not entitled to a new trial unless he or she can identify specific ways in which the court erroneous denial of a continuance prejudiced his or her defense.mangual santiago,at.we find no error in the district court decision to advance the trial date by one day.
we turn now to the two evidentiary issues.as with the district court scheduling decision,we review the district court evidentiary decisions for abuse of discretion.united states hall,cir.romero argues that the district court impermissibly admitted evidence as to his tax returns and testimony regarding his trip to san diego and detention by federal authorities as prior bad acts,which are prohibited to prove character by federal rule of evidence b 
rule b provides that e vidence of a crime,wrong,or other act is not admissible to prove a person character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.b.nonetheless,such evidence may be admissible for another purpose,such as proving motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,absence of mistake,or lack of accident.b.this court has previously explained that 
the admissibility of other acts evidence depends on a analysis.first,other acts evidence must be excluded if it is relevant only because it shows bad character,the proposed logical inference includes character as a necessary link.second,the district court must weigh the probative value of the other acts evidence against any unfair prejudice to the defendant and it is only when the risk of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs its probative value that the evidence is to be excluded.
united states shenker,cir citations omitted.we first address whether admission of the tax returns was impermissible under rule b.
romero asserts that the government offered his tax returns in order to show that he had failed to comply with reporting requirements required by the treasury department of puerto rico.however,the record is clear that the government reliance on romero tax records for years corresponding to those in which the conspiracy took place was primarily to establish,not that he failed to report income on his tax returns,but rather that the money that he was sending to san diego was not money derived from his legitimate sandwich shop business,but instead was the proceeds of illegal activity in responding to defense counsel objection to the admission of the tax returns,the government explained 
your honor,the tax returns go to the elements of the offense in the sense that he is charged with using drug money proceeds to promote and to further drug trafficking violations.and that is why that is the source we are going to the source of the funds.and,of course,what he reports as income is inextricably intertwined what sic he is sending,it is part and parcel.he saying that this is his income,and the version that we heard is that it was for family members,so,of course,we have to show that there was an unexplained wealth.
transcript of trial at,united states romero lopez,ecf.furthermore,during closing arguments,the government argued to the jury,w hen you look at the totals in the tax returns and you look at the totals of the wire transfer,you will see that it is thousands and thousands of dollars in cash that were sent to san diego over and over what was the source of this wealth that was being sent to san diego i submit to you that the evidence has shown that the source was marijuana.transcript of trial at,united states romero lopez,ecf.
thus,the government reliance on the tax returns was not designed to demonstrate romero character,but rather to establish an element of the money laundering offense that the concealed proceeds were derived from illegal activity to be sure,the defendant testimony was that the money transferred was from chino and alexis,and there was no testimony that this money was sandwich shop revenue.but the government was entitled to refute any possible argument that the wired funds were sandwich shop revenue.see united states evans,cir noting that it was not error for the court to admit rule b evidence in its case in chief where the evidence was tendered to rebut an anticipated defense.because the tax returns were admitted for another purpose,they were not subject to automatic exclusion under rule b.furthermore,we find that the potential probative value of the tax returns substantially outweighs the risk of unfair prejudice to the defendant.thus,the district court committed no abuse of discretion in allowing admission of romero tax returns for the years in which the conspiracy was alleged to have taken place 
romero also urges that the district court erred by allowing the government to question him as to his trip and detention by federal authorities in san diego.in particular,romero argues that if the government wished to tie this incident to the conspiracy,it should have brought evidence as to this incident during the government,rather than bring the incident up solely during its of romero.reviewing the record as a whole,it is apparent that one of the principal purposes of the government line of questioning was to refute romero contention that he had no knowledge of why chino had asked him to transfer money to san diego or that the money was the proceeds of illegal activity.
during romero testimony on direct examination,his counsel asked him about his knowledge of the money laundering conspiracy 
q and when,in fact,did you realize what was going on with chino and alexis 
a when i was accused of this in this mess 
q now,sir,when,if at any time,did chino tell you about what business he had in california 
a no,he never gave me an explanation.
q and why did you keep on sending these money orders 
a because he asked me to.and my understanding was when i went to western union that there was nothing illegal involved in that.
transcript of trial at,united states romero lopez,ecf.on,romero also testified that he did not know the people to whom he sent the wire transfers.see id.at.
in order to rebut this testimony,the government inquired about his trip to san diego in,which was within the time period of the conspiracy.the fact that romero traveled to san diego the same city where he had wire transferred funds,during the time period of the alleged conspiracy,with a large sum of cash and money orders,was certainly relevant to refute his lack of knowledge.in response to defense counsel objection under rule b,the government explained,he was detained with money and wire transfers sic.he just said that he did he did know what the money was coming from and did know who these people were i think it within the scope of the conspiracy he took the stand,and he can be about his knowledge.id.at.
furthermore,as the government pointed out in its closing,the jury could draw a reasonable inference that romero failed to claim this money once he was released because if he claimed it,he had to prove that it was legal and he let it go because it was no savings.it was drug money proceeds.transcript of trial at,romero lopez,ecf.although the fact that romero had been detained by fe
