after a jury trial,appellant paul hicks was convicted of being a felon in possession of ammunition in violation of g and of possession with intent to distribute crack and powder cocaine in violation of a.he now appeals his conviction and sentence,requiring us to consider,among other things whether a warrant for the search of his residence was supported by probable cause,whether the district court wrongfully denied appellant a franks hearing to establish the veracity of the affidavit supporting the search warrant,and whether it was error to admit evidence of appellant three prior drug convictions and other bad acts.we reject appellant claims of error and affirm.
on january,agents of the massachusetts state police conducted a search of cabot street in brockton,massachusetts pursuant to a search warrant issued earlier that day by a magistrate judge.massachusetts state trooper james long,who had been investigating appellant for weeks prior to the search,had executed an affidavit in support of the search warrant.
long affidavit stated that in december,a confidential informant ci told him that he or she had been purchasing crack cocaine from a man known as pudgie.the ci identified appellant as pudgie in a photograph.the affidavit stated that the ci then participated in two controlled purchases of crack cocaine from appellant.the first transaction occurred on or about january,and the second on or about january.the affidavit explained that long and other officers working the case were familiar with cabot street from a previous narcotics investigation that had resulted in a search of the residence in january.officer long averred in the affidavit that he believed that cabot street was a location maintained by hicks to prepare and distribute drugs.
the search was executed by a team of law enforcement officers.they found appellant in a bedroom,sitting on the edge of a bed and wearing nothing but a towel.he was the only adult in the house.in the drawer of a night stand and within arm reach of where appellant had been sitting on the bed,the officers discovered a cellular telephone,a box of ammunition,a weapon holster,a men watch,a key,and cash.they also found in cash in the pocket of a leather jacket hanging in the closet.in the basement of the home,the officers found a digital scale,plastic baggies,baking soda,and,inside the hollow legs of a weight bench,grams of crack cocaine and grams of powder cocaine.in the kitchen,the officers found two more digital scales.hicks was arrested and subsequently charged with being a felon in possession of ammunition and possession with intent to distribute crack and powder cocaine.
in march,appellant moved in the district court to suppress the evidence seized during the search of cabot street,claiming that the search warrant had been defective.specifically,he argued that trooper long affidavit did not establish probable cause to believe that evidence of narcotics dealing would be found at cabot street.he claimed that long affidavit did not connect the ci controlled purchases to cabot street or show that appellant was himself connected to the residence.
the district court denied the motion to suppress,finding that the warrant affidavit had established probable cause.the court further found that even if there had not been probable cause to issue the warrant,the search was justified by the rule of united states leon,d,because a reasonable officer could have thought that the affidavit had established probable cause.
shortly before trial,appellant requested a hearing under franks delaware,d,a franks hearing to contest allegedly false statements in the search warrant affidavit.the district court denied the motion,finding that defendant had failed to make the preliminary showing necessary to warrant a franks hearing.
a jury trial commenced on october,and lasted four days.the government presented the testimony of several law enforcement agents,including that of trooper long and others who had participated in the investigation and eventual search of cabot street.the government final witness was massachusetts state police officer dean levangie.officer levangie had participated in well over crack cocaine investigations,an estimated seventy percent of which had occurred in brockton,and testified as an expert in brockton narcotics investigations.
after the district court rejection of appellant motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure,appellant presented the testimony of his mother,rosemarie hicks.the thrust of appellant defense was that he lived with his parents and was only an occasional guest at cabot street,that the drugs and paraphernalia found at the residence did not belong to him,and that he had no intent to exercise control over or distribute the drugs.at the close of evidence,he did not renew his rule motion.the jury found him guilty of all three counts.he was subsequently sentenced to months of imprisonment for each of the three counts,to be served concurrently,followed by an term of supervised release.appellant filed this timely appeal.
appellant argues that the district court erroneously denied his motion to suppress the evidence seized in the search of cabot street because the application in support of the search warrant failed to establish probable cause.we employ a standard of review to analyze such claims.questions of law,including the question of whether a given set of facts gives rise to probable cause,are reviewed de novo,united states woodbury,cir,while factual findings are reviewed for clear error,united states ribeiro,cir.we give significant deference to the magistrate judge initial evaluation,and reverse only if we see no substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed.id.quoting united states feliz,cir.
a search warrant application must demonstrate probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed,and enumerated evidence of the offense will be found at the place to be nexus element.id.in considering whether a warrant affidavit establishes probable cause,a magistrate judge task is to make a practical,decision whether,given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.feliz,at modification in original quoting illinois gates,d.
appellant argues that the warrant affidavit was faulty because it failed to establish probable cause to believe that there was a nexus between the controlled purchases and cabot street,and that the evidence found at the home should therefore have been suppressed.we disagree.trooper long warrant affidavit supplied a host of evidence to establish a fair probability that evidence of the narcotics trade would be found at cabot street.
according to the affidavit,the ci gave officer long the crack cocaine after each controlled purchase and stated that it had been purchased from pudgie.the affidavit also described reliable information provided by the ci in earlier investigations and stated that long knew pudgie to be the nickname of appellant,who had several prior convictions for drug distribution offenses.the affidavit stated that officers followed a black mazda van directly to cabot street after its driver,reported by the ci to be pudgie,had used the van to deliver drugs during a controlled purchase.officers later observed the van parked at the home during the late evening and early morning hours.utilities at cabot street were in appellant name.
trooper long and other officers knowledge and experience with cabot street also linked appellant to the residence.the cell phone number dialed by the ci to reach pudgie was registered to edward robinson,who had previously sold crack cocaine to law enforcement officers and had been arrested after an earlier investigation and search of cabot street.robinson was connected to appellant because during the earlier investigation he had used a vehicle registered to appellant father to deliver drugs.furthermore,cabot street was owned by renee yarrell,who was known by officers to be appellant girlfriend and who had also sold drugs to undercover officers during the earlier investigation of cabot street.finally,the search warrant affidavit detailed trooper long experience and training in narcotics investigations and his belief that cabot street would contain evidence of appellant preparation and distribution of narcotics.
in ribeiro,at,we found that the nexus element was satisfied when police officers conducting surveillance had seen the defendant leaving his home shortly before participating in a controlled narcotics purchase.analyzing whether there was probable cause to establish the nexus requirement,we found it compelling that the defendant had been able to quickly respond to the undercover officer requests for narcotics,which indicated that he kept a readily accessible supply of narcotics.id.at.the nexus requirement was also supported by information obtained through surveillance and by the affiant officer averment that he knew drug traffickers frequently stored drugs,cash,and other evidence of the drug trade in their homes.id.at.
as in ribeiro,the circumstances set forth in the included the surveillance information,appellant prior convictions and his connections to known drug dealers who operated out of cabot street,and observations drawn from trooper long training and a fair probability that appellant lived at cabot street and that evidence of his drug dealing would be found there.because we agree with the magistrate judge determination that probable cause existed to search cabot street,we affirm the district court denial of appellant motion to suppress the fruits of the search 
appellant argues that the district court erroneously denied his motion for a hearing to contest the veracity of statements made by trooper long in the warrant affidavit.under franks,at,a defendant may request an evidentiary hearing to challenge the truthfulness of statements made by law enforcement agents in a search warrant affidavit.to obtain a franks hearing,a defendant must make a substantial preliminary showing that the warrant affidavit contains a false statement made knowingly and intentionally,or with reckless disregard for the truth,id.at,and that the allegedly false statement was necessary to the finding of probable cause.id.at.we review the denial of a franks hearing for clear error,united states materas,cir,which exists only when we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states castillo,cir quoting anderson city of bessemer,d.
in his motion for a franks hearing,appellant challenged the veracity of trooper long statement that the second controlled purchase happened on or about january.the district court denied the motion,finding that appellant had failed to make the necessary preliminary showing that the warrant contained a false statement made knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth,and that,even if the challenged statement were false,it was not necessary to the finding of probable cause.
appellant emphasizes on appeal,as he did in the district court,that the warrant states that the second controlled purchase occurred on or about january,while trooper long work records show that he did not work january,or.appellant finds this possible discrepancy a sufficient showing that trooper long knowingly included a falsehood in the affidavit.
as the government points out,the use of the phrase on or about when describing the time frame of a controlled drug purchase is a common police practice,used to protect the identity of a confidential informant.in united states carty,cir,we found that there was nothing inherently contradictory or incredible in the affiant assertion that a controlled purchase had occurred within the past few days of a warrant execution,when the purchase had actually occurred the day of the execution.id.at.we remarked that the description vagueness was due to the common police practice of not stating precisely the time of the buy in order to protect the confidentiality of the informant.see also united states davis,wl,at cir,while further detail about the controlled buy might have been desirable,the lack of specificity about the date of the buy or the quantity involved is not necessarily probative of falsity.the concern for keeping the buyer identify confidential is a more likely explanation for the lack of those details.as in carty,there is nothing inherently contradictory in trooper long description of the date of the controlled purchase the fact that the buy may not have occurred within one day of the date referenced in trooper long affidavit simply does not mean that it did not occur about that date.
further,even if appellant could show that trooper long made a knowingly false statement,he has not shown that the challenged statement was necessary to the finding of probable cause.t o determine the sufficiency of the affidavit,excluding the contested sentence,we look to whether the totality of the circumstances stated in the affidavit demonstrates probable cause to search either the premises or the person.united states barnes,cir quoting united states khounsavanh,cir.even if the exact dates had not been set forth in the affidavit at all,the totality of the circumstances stated in the warrant affidavit was more than sufficient to establish probable cause to believe that evidence of a crime would be found at cabot street.
accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of defendant motion for a franks hearing.
appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury verdict and the district court denial of his rule motion for judgment of acquittal on all counts we normally review challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence and the denial of rule motions by asking whether,taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdict,a rational jury could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.united states thompson,cir united states morillo,cir challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence and rule motions present a single issue for review.because appellant failed to renew his motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of evidence,however,we will reverse his convictions only if the verdict threatens to work a clear and gross injustice.united states gobbi,cir.
a.the cocaine charges 
we begin with the drug charges.a makes it illegal to distribute or possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance.because appellant did not possess the cocaine on his person at the time of the search,the government relied on a theory of constructive possession,which exists when a person knowingly has the power and intention at a given time to exercise dominion and control over an object either directly or through others.united states,cir quoting united states mclean,cir.such possession can be joint,does not require actual ownership and can be established through circumstantial evidence,though mere presence or association with another who possessed the contraband is insufficient.united states decologero,cir quoting united states wight,cir.
defendant argues,in the main,that he was only at cabot street on the day of the search because he was babysitting yarrell children and that he was not involved with the narcotics trade being run out of the home.he points out that he was not linked to the drugs through physical possession or evidence such as fingerprints.that is true.nevertheless,other circumstantial evidence permitted a reasonable jury to conclude that appellant lived at cabot street,knew of the drugs existence,had the power and intention to exercise control over them,and had the intention to distribute them.
cable,electricity,and telephone bills for service at cabot street were in appellant name.inside the home,officers found a personal letter addressed to appellant at cabot street as well as his student loan statement.moreover,when the officers executing the warrant entered the home,they saw appellant sitting on the edge of the bed in the master bedroom,wrapped in a damp towel as if he had just showered.inside the bedroom was a photograph of appellant and his girlfriend,yarrell,who owned the house.men clothes were on the bedroom floor and inside the bedroom closet.in the drawer of the night stand there was a cell phone regi
