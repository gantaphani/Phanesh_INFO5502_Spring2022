peter mitrano appeals from his conviction on charges of willful failure to pay child support,raising claims concerning the sufficiency of the evidence,the jury instructions,and the calculation of his sentence.finding no merit in his arguments,we affirm.
background 
mitrano married virginia kelly in the district of columbia in.they had three children,born in,and.the family lived together in virginia until mitrano and kelly separated in.they were divorced in virginia in.at the time of the divorce,a virginia court entered a custody order granting mitrano primary custody of the children.the children lived with him during the week and with kelly on weekends.in,mitrano and the children moved to new hampshire.shortly afterwards,kelly followed.the family lived together in the same house,although mitrano and kelly did not reconcile as husband and wife.
in,kelly moved out of the house and filed an action in new hampshire seeking sole custody of the children.around that time,mitrano moved back to virginia.while the custody action was pending in new hampshire,mitrano complied with a temporary order requiring him to pay weekly child support.kelly obtained temporary custody of the children in early.in,the new hampshire court issued a final order awarding kelly sole custody of the children and requiring mitrano to pay per week in child support,plus per week toward past medical expenses.mitrano has paid no child support since issuance of the final order 
mitrano attempted to appeal the child support order to the new hampshire supreme court,but the court declined to hear the appeal.he sought and was denied review by the supreme court.mitrano then filed suits and appeals in four states new hampshire,vermont,virginia,and maryland and in two federal courts the district of new hampshire and the eastern district of virginia.in each case he argued that the child support order was invalid because the new hampshire court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.he lost every case and appeal.
on august,mitrano was indicted for willfully failing to pay child support in violation of a.he was tried before a jury in the district of new hampshire.at trial,kelly testified that mitrano worked as a patent lawyer and was a licensed engineer,that he owned two properties in virginia one of which generated rental income,and that he owned two porsche automobiles and another vehicle.she also testified that before the child support order entered,mitrano supported the family in new hampshire,took the children on multiple vacations,and bought generous gifts including a horse for the children.another witness indicated that mitrano rented a law office in boston from through and regularly paid his rent which ranged from approximately to per month during the period.a tenant who had lived in one of mitrano virginia properties testified that he paid mitrano to monthly rent in cash from to.he said that other tenants rented additional rooms in the house during that time period.
the government also introduced filings from mitrano bankruptcy proceeding in the eastern district of virginia the bankruptcy filings valued one of mitrano unencumbered virginia properties at and a second virginia property at,encumbered only by a secured claim of.records introduced through a representative of the new hampshire department of health and human services office of child support showed that mitrano owed child support in excess of for the years through.
at the close of the evidence,mitrano moved for a judgment of acquittal under.the district court denied his motion.he was convicted,sentenced to serve months in prison,and ordered to pay restitution in the full amount of past due child support including interest.he filed a timely notice of appeal.before this court,mitrano challenges the sufficiency of the evidence,the trial court decision to instruct the jury on willful blindness,and the calculation of his sentence.
sufficiency of the evidence 
we review the denial of a rule motion for judgment of acquittal de novo.united states perez melendez,cir see also united states azubike,f d,cir we review preserved challenges to sufficiency of the evidence de novo.
a trial court must enter a judgment of acquittal when,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,it is insufficient to sustain a conviction.see.a.if a reasonable jury could have found that the government had proven each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt,we will affirm the conviction.perez melendez,at quoting united states angulo hernandez,cir.we have described this standard of review as formidable,and defendants challenging convictions for insufficiency of evidence face an uphill battle on appeal.id.quoting united states lipscomb,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
willfulness 
mitrano first contends there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for willfully failing to pay child support.the willfulness standard used in was borrowed from the statutes criminalizing willful failure to pay taxes.united states smith,cir.accordingly,courts should interpret willfulness in the context of child support obligations in the same way that courts have interpreted it in the context of felony tax provisions.id.at.willfulness is a voluntary and intentional act in the context of a defendant ability to pay.id.emphasis omitted.it is not a crime to fail to comply with the statute based on a good faith misunderstanding of its requirements.see cheek united states.mere disagreement with the law,however,is not a defense.id.at.
mitrano argues that he did not willfully fail to pay child support because he had a good faith belief that the underlying child support order was invalid see united states kerley,cir a defendant found to have acted willfully may negate willfulness by showing that,because of a misunderstanding of the law,he had a good faith belief that he was not violating the legal duty.citing cheek,at.a good faith belief need not be objectively reasonable to negate willfulness.id.mitrano stresses the strength of his belief,which he says shows the absence of the willfulness required under.he also argues that continuing to maintain his position in the face of its rejection by a multitude of courts is not inconsistent with holding a good faith belief,citing united states booker,as an example of a case in which a position which previously had been rejected by many courts ultimately prevailed.
but whether mitrano actually held a good faith belief that the child support order was invalid was a question for the jury.he was trained and had worked as an attorney,and he admits that he knew of the child support order.he even attached it as an exhibit to some of his court pleadings.further,he was aware that numerous state and federal trial and appellate courts had rejected his theory that the new hampshire court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to issue a valid child support order.
given the number of courts that repudiated mitrano claims and appeals,we find that the jury reasonably could have refused to accept that mitrano actually held a good faith belief that the child support order was void.see cheek,at of course,the more unreasonable the asserted beliefs or misunderstandings are,the more likely the jury will consider them to be nothing more than simple disagreement with known legal duties united states cruz arroyo,cir jury acted well within its proper province by rejecting a somewhat fanciful claim advanced by the defendant.the jury also could have reasonably concluded that even if mitrano had a good faith belief that the order was void,it was only because he intentionally avoided his position in light of all the courts which rejected it in other words,as we discuss later,he willfully blinded himself to his legal duty to pay child support.
the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the jury verdict,was more than sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that mitrano willfully failed to pay his child support.
ability to pay 
mitrano claims the government failed to introduce sufficient evidence of his ability to pay child support.he asserts that because the government failed to introduce bank account
