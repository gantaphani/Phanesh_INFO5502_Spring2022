appellant wayne whitney was convicted of violating a by making a false statement to a firearms dealer during an attempt to purchase a firearm.on appeal,whitney argues that the trial judge erred in defining the term knowingly,by refusing to give an explicit willful blindness instruction.whitney also challenges the trial judge decision to admit evidence that he was arrested for violating a protective order entered against him three weeks before denying the existence of such an order on a federal firearms form.we affirm.
factual background 
on or about may,whitney attempted to acquire a small pistol from norm gun ammo shop in biddeford,maine.as with any attempted purchase of a firearm from a licensed dealer,whitney was required to fill out atf form.whitney answered no to question,which asked whether he was under a court order restraining him from harassing a child or an intimate partner at that time,however,he was under an order for protection from abuse protective order entered by the maine district court in springvale with respect to his son,and the boy mother,shawn armstrong.
on october,a one count indictment was returned by a grand jury charging whitney with knowingly making a false statement to a firearms dealer in connection with the purchase of a firearm in violation of a 
pretrial motions 
prior to trial,whitney proposed the following jury instruction 
the phrase reckless disregard means that the defendant deliberately closed his eyes to what would otherwise have been obvious to him.a finding beyond a reasonable doubt of an intent of the defendant to avoid knowledge or enlightenment would permit you to infer knowledge.united states gonsalves,cir.in order to prove that the defendant acted recklessly the government must prove that the defendant deliberately and purposely avoided learning what was contained in form.
whitney also filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence that he was arrested for violating the protective order that produced the charges he argued that records from the state court case regarding the protective order,testimony by the deputy who served the protective order,and his admissions to investigators adequately established his knowledge of the protective order and rendered evidence of the arrest for violation of the protective order cumulative and prejudicial.
in its opposition,the government alleged that it expected whitney defense would be that his false answer on the firearms form was not made intentionally.in the government view,evidence that whitney was arrested for violation of the protective order days before he made the false statement did not tend to prove criminal disposition and was admissible under rule b as proof of whitney knowledge of the protective order and the absence of mistake or accident.the government argued that proof of his arrest demonstrated that the protective order was in the forefront of whitney mind at the time he tried to buy a weapon.the government also argued that rule was satisfied because evidence that whitney was arrested for violating the protective order was stronger proof of his knowledge than was evidence that he was merely served with the order.nevertheless,the government suggested that any conceivable prejudice could be avoided by a stipulation that the government proposed about whitney arrest.
at the pretrial hearing the court held that proof of whitney arrest on the protective order was admissible and found the arrest to be the most probative information in terms of its nearness in time,and in terms of the significance of something like an arrest in terms of bringing it home to a defendant and causing him to remember.the district court further expressed that it would give a curative or limiting instruction to the jury at whitney request and would also consider the effect of any stipulation to which the parties entered.in the court own words 
i wo decide right now what might happen if the defendant stipulated that as of the time he signed the form,he knew that he was under such an order if the defense theory is somewhat narrower in the sense of not understanding the question versus having knowledge.that might be a different issue.i do have that precisely in front of me as we sit here,but on the current status of the case,where the defendant is challenging the knowingly requirement of the statutory violation,i will admit it as described.
when defense counsel tried to anticipate what the ruling would be if whitney stipulated to limited facts about the arrest,the court replied that it had left that aside because it was clear to me what would be the case if that were to develop.the court then encouraged counsel to confer about the issue and indicated that it would hear the argument depending upon what conclusion you reach,but that is something i left open.
the court also deferred the ruling as to defendant proposed jury instruction.
b.the trial 
during the trial,the district court permitted officer mark dyer of the sanford maine police department to testify regarding whitney arrest after he had violated the protective order.officer dyer testified that in may he took a complaint from armstrong regarding a violation of a protective order.dyer researched the protective order,determined that it had been entered against whitney and decided to arrest him for violating it.dyer then called whitney and asked him to come to the police station because he had violated a protective order.a short time later,whitney appeared at the police station and was arrested,booked,and taken to the york county jail.no request for a limiting instruction was made with respect to dyer testimony.
at the close of the government case,defense counsel again asked for a willful blindness instruction counsel read for the record his proposed jury instruction on reckless disregard,which the court declined to give.
the district court then charged the jury on the elements of a a violation.the court stated that it was a violation of federal law knowingly to make a false statement in connection with the purchase of a firearm.the court explained that to convict whitney,the jury must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt first,that whitney knowingly made the false statement second,that the statement was made during an effort to buy a firearm from a licensed dealer and third,that the statement was intended or likely to deceive the firearms dealer about a fact material to the lawfulness of the sale.the court then indicated to the jury that it was not necessary for the government to prove that whitney knew he was violating the law.instead,he explained that a simply requires proof that the false statement was made knowingly.the court later stated that a statement is false if untrue when made.the court explained that a false statement was made knowingly if the person making it knows that it is false,or demonstrates a reckless disregard for the truth,and with conscious purpose to avoid learning the truth,not acting merely by ignorance,accident or mistake.it instructed the jury that a fact is material for purposes of a if it tends to influence the firearms dealer willingness to sell a weapon,whether or not the dealer relies on the statement.
after concluding its instructions,the court stated its reason for refusing to give whitney requested charge and said that the charge it gave had followed united states wright,cir,and united states,cir.the trial judge further explained that his ruling was consistent with authority from the second,fourth and ninth circuits holding that reckless alone is not enough,but that when it coupled with conscious avoidance of the truth,that it can be sufficient,and that is the instruction i gave here.
after deliberating for approximately an hour,the jury found whitney guilty as charged.whitney was later sentenced to an prison term.
ii.analysis 
jury instructions 
whitney argues on appeal that the jury was unable to render a fair verdict because the trial court failed to instruct the jury properly on the issue of reckless disregard.his main contention is that the trial judge incorrectly refused to give the jury charge about willful blindness that whitney had proposed,and that understanding the differ
