a federal jury convicted arthur gianelli,dennis albertelli albertelli,frank iacaboni,and albertelli wife gisele gisele of racketeering,racketeering conspiracy or both,and a host of other federal crimes,incident to their participation in a criminal organization responsible for a large illegal gambling operation.gianelli headed the group,with albertelli serving as the.
the charged criminal conduct involved four operations the first three were different flavors of continuing illegal gambling businesses sports betting,football cards,and video poker that spawned a variety of criminal support activities such as money laundering,usurious lending,and extortionate collection of credit the fourth comprised a single venture by the three male defendants but excluding gisele seeking to burn down a business in north reading,massachusetts.
the indictment used at trial,as narrowed by dropping various counts and other defendants,contained several hundred counts against the remaining four already named but most involved individual transactions designated as money laundering.the remaining or so charged racketeering conspiracy,racketeering,illegal gambling business,transmission of wagering information,money laundering conspiracy,interstate travel in aid of racketeering,extortionate collection of credit,extortionate collection of credit conspiracy,and five variations of arson and extortion crime directed to the planned burning down of the north reading business 
before trial,the defendants jointly moved to suppress evidence obtained through a series of wiretaps,arguing in relevant part that the application for the initial wiretap upon which all subsequent interceptions were based was not properly authorized,did not show the wiretap was necessary,and was not supported by probable cause.the district court,after hearing argument and reviewing the materials submitted,denied the motion in a published opinion.united states gianelli,d.
there followed a trial that stretched over several weeks and included extensive testimony and wiretap evidence directed to the operations of the group,individual transactions,and the roles of the individual defendants.ultimately the jury convicted all four defendants of nearly all of the charges,acquitting each defendant on between one and four counts.each was convicted of racketeering,racketeering conspiracy or both.
the defendants were later sentenced to terms of imprisonment as follows gianelli,months albertelli,months iacaboni,months and gisele,months.each of the defendants now appeals,but with a few exceptions noted below the issues raised on appeal are common to all of the defendants.the standard of review varies by argument and whether or not the argument was preserved in the district court.
wiretaps.organized crime cases depend heavily on wiretaps.for some of the activities gambling,drug sales,money lending there may be no victims to complain.written records are often minimal.and especially where the organization is large or affiliated with a larger criminal enterprise,may be fearful about turning state evidence.so surveillance and wiretaps are principal tools of investigation,and the latter require warrants.
although a warrant issued on probable cause is enough for the police to enter and search a home,title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of title iii codified as amended at et imposes even more stringent requirements for wiretaps and also requires compliance with state law,id,which in massachusetts means.laws ch,f.defendants argue that the initial wiretap application was not properly authorized under section f,as interpreted by massachusetts supreme judicial court in commonwealth vitello.
vitello held that an assistant district attorney may not seek a wiretap on his own authority rather,the district attorney must review and authorize such an application in writing.id.at.however,so long as the matter is subject to his review,the district attorney need not sign the application but may authorize a subordinate attorney to make the application.commonwealth.
in this case,the essex county district attorney by two letters one to three named assistant district attorneys adas and the other to a superior court judge authorized the three subordinates to apply to intercept calls involving albertelli,gianelli and another named associate occurring over three designated telephone lines both letters were attached to the actual wiretap application signed by the named adas and the district attorney letter said that the application and any renewals would be reviewed by the district attorney or a designee.
in addition,a separate affidavit by the district attorney,offered in response to the motion to suppress in this case,attested that he had in fact reviewed draft copies of an affidavit setting forth the probable cause and an application prior to issuing the authorizations,and was satisfied that they complied with the relevant statutes.he also stated that he personally reviewed every renewal application and supporting affidavit.these documents,the district court held,satisfied section f.
defendants argue they do not,emphasizing that in the specific crimes were also identified in the letter,which was dated the same day as the application,whereas in this case the application was dated one day after the authorizing letter.the one day delay makes it possible that the district attorney read only a draft rather than the final application but the district attorney obligation was to superintend and take responsibility for the wiretap application,not to act as the final proofreader.see,at.
citing united states smith,cir en banc,the defendants say that the district court should have held an evidentiary hearing on the extent of his oversight but our remand in smith was because the district court did not make a particularistic inquiry into whether the application was authorized.id.at.here,the district court did make such an inquiry and the only material dispute was not about what happened but whether the district attorney version of what he did was sufficient oversight.
nor do we agree that the wiretap application failed title iii required showing that other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous.c,c.here,the warrant application was accompanied by a detailed page affidavit by massachusetts state police trooper nunzio orlando describing the investigation and explaining in detail the limits on what could be found without wiretaps and why individual alternatives were ineffective.
defendants point out that these alternative techniques had allowed the agents to collect considerable information,as is evident from orlando affidavit,but the partial success of the investigation did not mean that there was nothing more to be done.united states cao,cir emphasis omitted.for example,the affidavit explained that some of the participants in the conspiracy had not yet been identified,and that precautions taken by the known conspirators made the wiretap evidence essential to continued gathering of necessary evidence.
defendants also complain that the affidavit contains a good deal of boilerplate,but so do judicial decisions,and for the same reason that in similar situations here,the conduct of a bookmaking operation much remains unchanged.the affidavit,however,included ample detail unique to this investigation,including,for example,extensive accounts of efforts at and limitations of using confidential informants,physical surveillance,and telephone record analysis.
title iii permits wiretaps to investigate gambling offenses generally,while the state statute whose conditions must also be met authorizes them for only one gambling offense keeping or being in a place for the registering of bets.laws ch.gianelli used an service reached by an number to allow his bettors to place wagers,but the affidavit described conduct in massachusetts of related activities such as communicating with local agents,settling disputes,and collecting payments from local bettors.
commonwealth boyle,held it enough that the defendant possessed memos between the bookmaker or office and the agent or writer of bets registered.here,satisfying boyle,the affidavit reported,based on confidential informants,that albertelli and ramasci retrieved records in massachusetts indicating their customers gambling balances and specific wagers from the previous week.accord commonwealth demogenes,section covers papers containing records of bets.
the defendants claim that the phrase apparatus for registering bets requires that the apparatus be used in the process of recording a bet as opposed to some other facet of the gambling business and that registration of bets in massachusetts must occur to violate the statute.the case law refutes that claim and the link here with massachusetts was sufficient.boyle,at commonwealth carlson.
there was probable cause to believe the three wiretap targets were violating section through their sports betting business,so we can bypass the defendants claims that probable cause was lacking as to their football card and video poker activities probable cause for any one such crime was sufficient.in addition,those arguments were not made in the motion to suppress and have been forfeited.e,b united states walker,cir.
agent kelsch testimony.the defendants say that the court erred in permitting atf special agent kelsch to testify insofar as he sought to interpret for the jury conversations intercepted over the wiretaps.similar objections were made to testimony by other agents but those made to kelsch testimony are representative and,at least as to some,better preserved.review of preserved objections is for abuse of discretion,and the others for plain error.united states weekes,cir.
the focus of the disputed prosecution testimony concerned the charges relating to the effort to burn down a building in north reading,a plot of which investigators learned initially through the wiretaps.in brief,gianelli had partnered with mark colangelo and edward fitzsimons to open a large sports bar in lynnfield the venture ended in litigation between the partners and so the government sought to show gianelli had sought to bring pressure on colangelo and fitzsimons by burning down a building in north reading housing a bar and a pizza joint that provided them revenue.
according to testimony from deeb homsi,a former hells angel gang member and longtime friend of albertelli,albertelli asked homsi to burn down the building,explaining the coercive purpose of the crime and he gave homsi the address and advice on starting the fire.homsi then recruited michael mccormack,who in turn recruited another hells angels member,sean slater,for assistance in setting the fire.gianelli checked in with albertelli regularly for updates and later pressed him to finish the job.
albertelli had separate discussions with iacaboni about the arson project iacaboni secured a diagram of the building from albertelli,and the next day told albertelli that he had recruited his own arsonist and discussed with that man specific plans for setting the building ablaze but,the evidence indicated,the unnamed torch man backed out when iacaboni told him no key was available for the target.completion of the task reverted to homsi recruits.
after one failed attempt,mccormack and slater tried again on november,and got a container ignited at the site,but firemen extinguished the fire,having been alerted by agents who were staked out nearby after intercepting telephone calls about the plan.slater and mccormack were arrested nearby.albertelli then provided to bail out slater.later,gianelli called albertelli to express concern that mccormack might be cooperating with the government.
in advance of kelsch testimony,the defense sought to bar him from testifying as to the meaning of intercepted conversations which,as is not uncommon in conspiracies,were cryptic.the judge refused to bar the testimony outright 
it is my inclination at this time to allow kelsch to testify with respect to specific matters that may be within his expertise as someone who knows about arson and arson investigations.but i am not going to allow more general questions as to what happened in that conversation.if the questions are directed specifically to specific responses or portions of the conversations and they related to matters that i believe are not entirely clear to lay persons,i will allow such testimony.but if they do,i will sustain objections.and,specifically,i would expect to sustain an objection to after we heard a conversation,if the question is,what is happening in that conversation,that is an objectionable question but if they are pinpointed to matters that leaves a layperson with some ambiguity,i would allow such a question.but the more generalized questions i would not allow.
the judge several times sustained objections to questions that appeared to call for unduly speculative or generalized interpretations,but a good many interpretations were allowed and some representative examples follow 
police officers commonly help interpret conversations by translating jargon common among criminals,either as experts,or as lay witnesses offering opinion testimony helpful to the jury in determining a fact in issue.such interpretations give the jury the benefit of an independent body of specialized knowledge.see.advisory committee note kumho tire carmichael,d drug jargon expertise dix et,mccormick on evidence,at ed.weinstein berger,weinstein federal evidence c ed.
but a number of kelsch disputed interpretations were peculiar to these defendants and depended largely on kelsch immersion in the details of this investigation.although linguistically possible,calling such testimony expert opinion would lend undue credibility to it and increase the risk of reliance on information not properly before the jury as data on which experts in the particular field would reasonably rely,even though the field is merely the facts of the case.
while these dangers are lessened by treating kelsch interpretations as lay witness opinions,the interpretations do not reflect a traditional reason for allowing lay opinions that many observations people make every day in ordinary life can not be adequately described in words confined to descriptions of observable phenomena.weinstein berger,supra,see also.advisory committee note.still,kelsch testimony undoubtedly had a potential to help the jury,which is all rule requires for lay opinion.
kelsch had investigated gianelli operations for years,had became familiar with the voices of the major participants,had interviewed witnesses related to the investigation,and had reviewed materials seized from the defendants.that his understanding of the oblique statements in the wiretaps might be helpful to the jury is an understatement some of the defendants wiretapped statements could be entirely unintelligible to the jury absent some interpretation.
for years on end,the defendants deliberately spoke in unintelligible terms,surely to hamper prosecution of their crimes.true,the traditional division of witness examination and counsel argument would call for the government to shower the jury with evidence of those oblique exchanges without any meaningful way of explaining it before the closing arguments of a or trial.and in some trials there might be a very large number of wiretaps introduced.
so,while not the most traditional lay opinion,kelsch testimony formally meets the requirements of rule,being rationally based on his perception of the conversations,united states santiago,cir helpful in the rule sense broadly understood and yet not based on expert knowledge within the meaning of rule.the problems,such as they are,with such testimony turn rather on dangers that have been explored in various contexts in other cases 
that the testimony may effectively smuggle in inadmissible evidence,hearsay not within some exception and perhaps inadmissible under the confrontation clause 
that the witness may be drawing inferences that counsel could do but with advantages as to timing,repetition and the imprimatur of testifying as a law enforcement officer 
that the witness may usurp the jury function by effectively testifying as to guilt rather than merely providing building blocks for the jury to draw its own con
