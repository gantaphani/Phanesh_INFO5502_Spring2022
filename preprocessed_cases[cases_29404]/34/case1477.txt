opinion of the court 
at issue on appeal is whether the work product of a trial consultant in this case is privileged and subject to only limited discovery.ernst young,llp,and cendant corporation are in a federal securities class action involving cendant alleged accounting fraud.the class action claims were settled,leaving claims asserted by cendant and ernst young against each other as the focus of the remaining litigation 
cendant deposed simon wood,a former ernst young senior manager and auditor who prepared the cendant financial statements at issue in the underlying litigation at wood deposition,cendant inquired into communications that took place between wood,ernst young counsel who also represented wood,and phillip mcgraw of courtroom sciences.mcgraw is a consulting expert in trial strategy and deposition preparation who was retained as a trial expert to assist ernst young counsel in anticipation of litigation.
specifically,cendant counsel asked wood have you ever met phil mcgraw on how many occasions did you meet with phil mcgraw did you understand phil mcgraw to be a jury consultant did mcgraw provide you with guidance in your conduct as a witness did you rehearse any of your prospective testimony in the presence of mcgraw in the course of preparing for this deposition did you review any work papers did you select the work papers that you reviewed did you ask anyone for the opportunity to review any particular work papers and did you ask to review work papers on any particular subject ernst young counsel objected,citing the work product doctrine and the privilege and arguing the discovery sought related to private communications relayed in the presence of counsel and for the purpose of assisting counsel in rendering legal advice.in march,the special discovery master held 
wood may be asked whether he has met with mcgraw,the date and duration of any meetings,who was present and the purpose for same.he may not be asked what mcgraw told the witness,whether testimony was practiced,whether any part of the meetings were recorded,whether the witness took any notes,or whether mcgraw provided the witness with any documents.in my view,answers to the latter questions would violate the work product doctrine.
from the information developed thus far,it appears that mcgraw is an expert retained by ernst young counsel to assist in trial preparation.he is not expected to be called as a witness and no exceptional circumstances have been cited to justify the exploration cendant seeks.
in november,the district court reversed the special discovery master determination,holding the work product doctrine and privilege did not apply.the district court said 
w ork product deals with things legal,things with preparation,evaluation,strategies,tactics and it is at first limited to lawyers and then will strictly or rigidly expand it,or restrictively expand it to include people such as paralegals and maybe assistants to lawyers because of their intimacy with the lawyer.
the privilege is really that of the lawyers because he or she has a right to tell his or her client certain things.but,when we go beyond that into a person who is not dealing with the law but telling someone how to prepare it as blumenthal drudge indicates,one of the questions where the lawyer was telling this witness what to do,it a question what this jury consultant is more or less telling that person what to do.
let me read from the blumenthal opinion 
it is true that in some cases the privilege may be extended to non lawyers who are employed to assist the lawyer in the rendition of professional legal services.this extension of the privilege to non lawyers,however,must be strictly confined within the narrowest possible limits consistent with the logic of its principle and should only occur when the communication was made in confidence for the purpose of obtaining legal advice from the lawyer.if what is sought is not legal advice or if the advice itself is the accountant rather than the lawyers,no privilege exists.
here it appears that horowitz was retained for the value of his own advice,not to assist the defendant attorney in providing their legal advice,and the attorney has not carried the burden of demonstrating that the privilege applies.
w e all know what a jury consultant does.he does come down and tell you in the case of expert z you have to blah,blah and you have to be careful of the countervailing opinion in b versus j.he or she says come on now,you got to spruce up.you have to look this way and you never know what the jury may be composed of demographically 
it not designed to augment.it not designed to substitute for legal advice.that not legal advice.that the cosmetic applied 
quoting blumenthal drudge.ernst young now appeals.we will reverse 
the district court had jurisdiction under.we have jurisdiction under although we generally review the decision to grant a motion to compel for abuse of discretion,our review is plenary where the decision was based upon the interpretation of a legal precept.armstrong dwyer,cir.
the work product doctrine is governed by a uniform federal standard set forth in.b and shelters the mental processes of the attorney,providing a privileged area within which he can analyze and prepare his client case.united states nobles,d united coal powell constr,cir.under rule b,the work product doctrine applies to documents and tangible things prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or by or for that other party representative including the other party attorney,consultant,surety,indemnitor,insurer,or agent.b see also charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure,at ed.i t is clear that all documents and tangible things prepared by or for the attorney of the party from whom discovery is sought are within the qualified immunity given to work product,so long as they were prepared in anticipation of litigation or preparation for trial.the supreme court articulated the essential nature of the doctrine in hickman taylor.
in performing his various duties,it is essential that a lawyer work with a certain degree of privacy,free from unnecessary intrusion by opposing parties and their counsel.proper preparation of a client case demands that he assemble information,sift what he considers to be the relevant from the irrelevant facts,prepare his legal theories and plan his strategy without undue and needless interference.that is the historical and the necessary way in which lawyers act within the framework of our system of jurisprudence to promote justice and to protect their clients interests.this work is reflected,of course,in interviews,statements,memoranda,correspondences,briefs,mental impressions,personal belief,and countless other tangible and intangible though roughly termed as the work product of the lawyer.were such materials open to opposing counsel on mere demand,much of what is now put down in writing would remain unwritten.an attorney thoughts,heretofore inviolate,would not be his own.inefficiency,unfairness and sharp practices would inevitably develop in the giving of legal advice and in the preparation of cases for trial.
it is clear from hickman that work product protection extends to both tangible and intangible work product.federal practice and procedure,at rule b itself provides protection only for documents and tangible things and does not bar discovery of facts a party may have learned from documents that are not themselves discoverable.nonetheless,hickman taylor continues to furnish protection for work product within its definition that is not embodied in tangible form indeed,since intangible work product includes thoughts and recollections of counsel,it is often eligible for the special protection accorded opinion work product.furthermore,this protection extends beyond materials prepared by an attorney to include materials prepared by an attorney agents and consultants.as the supreme court explained,a ttorneys often must rely on the assistance of investigators and other agents in the compilation of materials in preparation for trial.it is therefore necessary that the work product doctrine protect materials prepared by agents of the attorney as well as those prepared by the attorney himself.nobles,at.see also federal practice and procedure,at i f statements of witnesses are to be protected from discovery at all,the protection should not depend on who obtained the statement.accordingly the amendment expressly extends protection to documents prepared by or for a representative of a party,including his agent.similarly,in explaining rule b,the advisory committee on civil rules said 
subdivision b reflects the trend of the cases by requiring a special showing,not merely as to materials prepared by an attorney,but also as to materials prepared in anticipation of litigation or preparation for trial by or for a party or any representative acting on his behalf.the rule then goes on to protect against disclosure the mental impressions,conclusions,opinions or legal theories concerning the litigation of an attorney or other representative of a party.
advisory comm.notes,amendment.
but the work product doctrine is not an absolute bar to discovery of materials prepared in anticipation of litigation.work product can be produced 
upon a showing that the party seeking discovery has substantial need of the materials in the preparation of the party case and that the party is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means.in ordering discovery of such materials when the required showing has been made,the court shall protect against disclosure of the mental impressions,conclusions,opinions,or legal theories of an attorney or other representative of a party concerning the litigation.
thus,rule b provides that,even if the party seeking discovery of information otherwise protected by the work product doctrine has made the requisite showing of need and undue hardship,courts must still protect against the disclosure of mental impressions,conclusions,opinions,or legal theories of an attorney and his agents.b.stated differently,rule b establishes two tiers of protection first,work prepared in anticipation of litigation by an attorney or his agent is discoverable only upon a showing of need and hardship second,core or opinion work product that encompasses the mental impressions,conclusions,opinion,or legal theories of an attorney or other representative of a party concerning the litigation is generally afforded near absolute protection from discovery.in re ford motor,cir.thus,core or opinion work product receives greater protection than ordinary work product and is discoverable only upon a showing of rare and exceptional circumstances.
courts have wrestled with the idea of affording opinion work product absolute immunity from discovery.federal practice and procedure,at moore federal practice e,at mathew bender ed.in,the advisory committee on civil rules proposed a rule that would create absolute protection against discovery into information at the core of the work product doctrine,but the supreme court declined to adopt it.federal practice and procedure,at.
in upjohn united states,d,the supreme court declined to establish a rule for discovery of core or opinion work product,noting that some courts have concluded that no showing of necessity can overcome protection of work product which is based on oral statements from witnesses and that other courts in declining to adopt an absolute rule have nonetheless recognized that such material is entitled to special protection.id.at.although the supreme court refused to decide the issue at this time,the court took an expansive approach to the work product doctrine,explaining that such work product can not be disclosed simply on a showing of substantial need and inability to obtain the equivalent without undue hardship.while we are not prepared at this juncture to say that such material is always protected by the rule,we think a far stronger showing of necessity and unavailability would be necessary to compel disclosure.id.
this holding is consistent with the language of rule b which provides that a court,in ordering discovery once a showing of need and hardship has been made,shall protect against disclosure of the mental impressions,conclusions,opinions,or legal theories of an attorney or other representative of a party.b.accordingly,we have held that opinion work product protection is not absolute,but requires a heightened showing of extraordinary circumstances.see sporck peil,cir opinion work product is accorded an almost absolute protection from discovery because any slight factual content that such items may have is generally outweighed by the adversary system interest in maintaining the privacy of an attorney thought processes and in ensuring that each side relies on its own wit in preparing their respective cases.see also rorer home indemnity,cir e fforts to obtain disclosure of opinion work product should be evaluated with particular care.in re grand jury investigation,cir memoranda summarizing oral interviews may indirectly reveal the attorney mental processes,his opinion work product s pecial considerations must shape any ruling on the discoverability of interview memoranda like those at issue in this case.the result,we believe,is exactly that contemplated in hickman such documents will be discoverable only in a rare situation.accord in re san juan dupont plaza hotel fire,cir courts typically afford ordinary work product only a qualified immunity,subject to a showing of substantial need and hardship,while requiring a hardier showing to justify the production of opinion work product.in re sealed case,as the work product sought here is based on oral statements from witnesses,a far stronger showing is required than the substantial need and without undue hardship standard applicable to discovery of protected documents and other tangible things.
nevertheless,cendant argues that rule b work product protection is superseded by rule b b,which governs discovery of facts known or opinions held by an expert who has been retained or specially employed by another party in anticipation of litigation or preparation for trial and who is not expected to be called as a witness at trial.b b but rule b provides work product protection independently of rule b b.in bogosian gulf oil,cir,we held attorney opinion work product shown to experts in an antitrust case was not discoverable.we explained 
t he first sentence of rule b requires protection against disclosure of the mental impressions,conclusions,opinions,or legal theories of an attorney or other representative of a party.the proviso introduces the first sentence of rule b subject to the provisions of subdivision b of this rule,a party may obtain discovery of documents prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial and signifies that trial preparation material prepared by an expert is also subject to discovery,but only under the special requirements pertaining to expert discovery set forth in rule b.the proviso does not limit the second sentence of rule b restricting disclosure of work product containing mental impressions and legal theories.thus,it does not support the district court conclusion that rule b,protecting this category of attorney work product,must give way to rule b,authorizing discovery relating to expert witnesses.
litigation consultants retained to aid in witness preparation may qualify as who are protected by the work product doctrine.see,ford motor,at the work product doctrine protected materials prepared by an technical assistant for meetings to be attended by an outside technical consulting firm and lawyers regarding an issue in a product liability suit martin bally park place hotel casino,cir a technical report prepared by a consulting firm was protected from discovery because the document was prepared in anticipation of litigation by a party representative a consultant for that party representative the company lawyer united coal powell constr,cir the work product doctrine extended beyond materials reflecting an attorney mental impressions to encompass materials prepared in anticipation of litigation by a party insurer sprague director,office of workers compensation programs,cir opinion letter setting
