after obtaining evidence that michael siciliano siciliano had ordered chemicals used in the manufacture of methylenedioxymethamphetamine mdma,a controlled substance,agents from the drug enforcement agency dea began an investigation.while interviewing siciliano in his residence with his consent,a dea agent,along with other law enforcement officers,conducted a protective sweep of the apartment.during the sweep,officers observed materials used in the manufacture of mdma and a plastic bag containing an unidentified powder.on the basis of an affidavit containing this information,agents obtained a search warrant and searched the premises.siciliano moved to suppress the evidence discovered in the search,arguing,inter alia,that the protective sweep was unlawful and that the agents would not have sought a warrant if they had not discovered what they believed to be contraband during the sweep.the district court granted the motion to suppress,and then denied the government motion for reconsideration on the basis of newly discovered evidence.
on appeal,the government argues that the district court clearly erred in finding that the agents would not have sought the search warrant if they had not made the protective sweep,and that the court abused its discretion in refusing to grant the motion for reconsideration.after reviewing the record,we affirm.
we recite the facts as found by the district court,consistent with record support.united states,cir.
a.the investigation 
in,the royal canadian mounted police rcmp informed the dea that,in february,siciliano had purchased chemicals for use in manufacturing mdma.the chemicals were delivered to surrey street,in brighton,massachusetts.sometime thereafter,the dea issued an administrative subpoena to ebay ebay,seeking the transaction history on an account registered to siciliano at the surrey street address.ebay provided the dea with a transaction log on the account for june to august.the log included purchases of chemicals,glassware,and other equipment,all delivered to surrey street.according to testimony from dea special agent anthony roberto agent roberto,the materials ordered are used in the manufacture of mdma.
agent roberto testified at the suppression hearing that the information from rcmp and ebay was the basis for his investigation of siciliano.after receiving the information from rcmp and ebay,he said,he decided to obtain other evidence that there was manufacturing going on.in october,agent roberto established surveillance at surrey street,and followed siciliano from the apartment to nearby northeastern university northeastern.also in october,agent roberto looked through siciliano trash,and discovered financial statements bearing his name and the surrey street address.according to agent roberto testimony,the discovery did ha ve any bearing on the purchase of chemicals,and he did not apply for a warrant as a result of what was found.at that time,he testified,he did not know whether there was an mdma lab on the premises or not,and he had never observed anyone come to the apartment to purchase drugs 
on november,agent roberto,accompanied by dea special agent david ditulio agent ditulio,went to the apartment at surrey street both agents wore plain clothes but were displaying their dea badges.when the agents knocked on the door,siciliano answered.the agents identified themselves and asked if he was michael siciliano.siciliano initially denied his identity,but then admitted it after the agents produced a copy of his driver license photo.agent roberto told siciliano that they wanted to ask him some questions,and siciliano invited them in.
the agents entered the apartment and followed siciliano down a hallway leading to the rear of the residence.halfway down the hallway,agent ditulio turned around and headed back out the door onto the porch,where he motioned to four law enforcement officers who had been waiting in their cars on the street.agent ditulio told the officers that siciliano had agreed to speak with us and that they could come in.the officers entered the apartment and,along with agent ditulio,conducted a protective sweep of the premises.three officers started in the front of the apartment,while two went to the rear.in the front,agent ditulio and boston police detective kevin guy detective guy opened the first doorway on the left,which led to siciliano bedroom.in the bedroom,agent ditulio found a dresser.the bottom drawer of the dresser was open,and in it agent ditulio observed an empty package of gelatin capsules.elsewhere,in the office,dea group supervisor jonathan scheffler observed a plastic bag containing powder.the powder was not.officers in the rear of the apartment discovered one of siciliano roommates in a bedroom adjacent to the kitchen.
meanwhile,agent roberto continued to follow siciliano down the hallway,which led to the kitchen at the rear of the apartment.as they walked,agent roberto asked siciliano if there was anyone else in the apartment.siciliano replied first that there was not,and then said that he was not sure and did not know.in the kitchen,agent roberto told siciliano that he wanted to talk about orders of chemicals.siciliano claimed that he had not ordered any chemicals.agent roberto said that he had,and siciliano disagreed,whereupon agent roberto said that he had a list of siciliano purchases.siciliano said that the orders had taken place six years ago,but when agent roberto disagreed,he said they occurred four years ago.at this point,the other officers in the apartment had completed their protective sweep and joined agent roberto in the kitchen.
agent roberto told siciliano that the chemical orders had occurred that year.siciliano said that the purchases had been for frank,a person he knew from northeastern.agent roberto asked for frank last name,address,and phone number,but siciliano could not or would not provide the information.by this point,siciliano had become hostile he was yelling,and,at one point,he pushed agent roberto.when one of the officers asked siciliano if they could search the apartment,siciliano said no.the officers,along with siciliano,then left the apartment.siciliano told the officers that he wanted to call his mother and an attorney.during siciliano phone call,agent roberto overheard siciliano say that he did something stupid and ordered chemicals.
agent roberto and agent ditulio testified that they then decided to freeze the apartment agent roberto testified that what led him to freeze the apartment was p art of the interview and part what was observed during the protective sweep.agent ditulio testified that a series of factors led to us freezing the apartment t here were conflicting statements,along with what we saw during the protective sweep.while two officers kept the apartment frozen,agent roberto,agent ditulio,and the other officers left to seek a warrant.
detective guy prepared the affidavit supporting the warrant application.the affidavit set forth the information obtained from rcmp and ebay,siciliano evasive responses to questioning from the officers,his agitated demeanor,the gel capsules and powder observed during the protective sweep,and the overheard contents of the phone call.the warrant was issued and the search executed the same day.in siciliano bedroom,officers discovered grams of percent pure mdma,a digital scale,plastic baggies,a plastic spatula,and the gel capsules observed earlier.in the apartment office,the officers discovered documents containing pictures and text describing how to make mdma.next to the documents were two computers and a hard drive,which the officers seized.the officers also located a basement in the apartment,where they discovered glassware and chemicals consistent with the manufacture of mdma.siciliano was arrested on state charges of possession with intent to distribute controlled substances.
in march,several months after the search of the apartment,dea computer forensic examiner jill mossman began a search of the seized computers pursuant to a second warrant issued specifically for that purpose.during the course of this search,she discovered what she believed to be files containing child pornography.after additional investigation not material here,a third warrant was obtained to search the computers for child pornography.
district court proceedings 
in may,siciliano was indicted by a federal grand jury,and the state charges were dismissed.the federal indictment charged siciliano with,among other things,possessing child pornography and attempting to manufacture mdma.on august,siciliano filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained in the november,search of his apartment and the subsequent search of his computers.the government opposed the motion,and hearings were held on february and.
on march,the district court issued an order granting the motion to suppress.the court held that siciliano had not given consent for the four officers waiting on the street to enter his apartment,and that the protective sweep performed by the officers and agent ditulio was unlawful.applying the rule set out in dessesaure,at,the court concluded that,because information obtained during the sweep had been incorporated into the affidavit supporting the november warrant,the evidence obtained pursuant to that warrant should be suppressed unless after excising the unlawfully obtained information from the warrant affidavit,there remained information sufficient to establish probable cause and the warrant would have been sought even if the illegal entry had not occurred.see dessesaure,at.the court concluded that probable cause still existed,but found that the government had failed to establish that the officers would have sought a warrant absent their discovery,during the protective sweep,of gel capsules and powder in the apartment.
on april,the government filed a motion for reconsideration of the district court order.among other things,the government stated that it had discovered the existence of a draft warrant affidavit,prepared by agent roberto in october.the government attached an affidavit from agent roberto discussing the preparation of the draft affidavit and stating that he had intended to apply for a search warrant once the interview was completed.siciliano opposed the motion for reconsideration,arguing that the agents intention to seek a warrant was a factual determination that had been properly made on the basis of testimony at the suppression hearing.on may,the district court denied the government motion in a written order,stating,among other things,that it was not inclined to reconsider its determination that the officers would not have sought a warrant absent the protective sweep.
the government then filed this interlocutory appeal.it does not challenge the district court determination that the protective sweep was unlawful.instead,the government argues that the district court committed clear error in finding that the agents would not have sought a warrant absent the information obtained from the protective sweep,and that the court abused its discretion in denying the motion for reconsideration.siciliano opposes the government on both counts,and offers an alternative ground for affirmance based on the government search of the computers for child pornography.
we apply a mixed standard of review to the district court suppression order.we review the court findings of fact for clear error and the application of the law to those facts de novo,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.to find clear error,an inquiring federal court must form a strong,unyielding belief,based on the whole of the record,that a mistake has been made.in re grand jury investigation,cir.we affirm under the clear error standard if any reasonable view of the evidence supports the district court finding.united states,cir.
a.the decision to seek the warrant 
legal principles 
the exclusionary rule prohibits the introduction into evidence of tangible materials and knowledge acquired during an unlawful search.murray united states,d.in addition,the exclusionary rule prohibits the introduction of tangible and testimonial evidence that is the product of the primary evidence,or that is otherwise acquired as an indirect result of the unlawful search,up to the point at which the connection with the unlawful search becomes so attenuated as to dissipate the taint.id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in this case,siciliano argued that the exclusionary rule should bar introduction of the evidence obtained during the november search and subsequently obtained in the search of the seized computers,since the november search warrant was based on an affidavit containing information obtained during the unlawful protective sweep.
however,under the independent source doctrine,evidence acquired by an untainted search which is identical to evidence unlawfully acquired is admissible.id.at.emphasis omitted.in this context,the question is whether the november search was an independent source of the evidence discovered as a result of the unlawful protective sweep.where,as here,a search warrant is supported by an affidavit containing unlawfully obtained information,the independence of the search depends on two factors whether the agents decision to seek the warrant was prompted by what they had seen during their initial entry,and whether the affidavit contained sufficient facts to support probable cause when the offending facts were excised.dessesaure,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
it is the government burden to establish,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the search was an independent source of the evidence in question.united states forbes,cir the government bears the burden of showing,by a preponderance of the evidence,that there is truly an independent source for the challenged evidence.united states lewis,cir same united states bonczeck,cr.pac,wl,at,dist lexis,at,same united states nguyen,wl,at,applying preponderance standard to dessesaure inquiry nix williams,d if the prosecution can establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the information ultimately or inevitably would have been discovered by lawful means the evidence should be received.
moreover,as the government acknowledges,the court determination of the first dessesaure the agents decision to seek the warrant was prompted by unlawfully acquired a factual finding subject to clear error review.see dessesaure,at describing the factual determination as to the police officers intent to seek a warrant united states stierhoff,d,quoting factual determination language from dessesaure united states gonzalez,cir holding that,for purposes of the identical inquiry under murray,it was not clear error,based on the record before us,for the district court to find that the officers would have sought a warrant had the box not been opened united states restrepo,cir describing the murray determination of whether the officers were prompted to seek the warrant because of unlawfully obtained information as a question of fact united states halliman,clarence thomas,the district court first found that the officers had not decided to obtain the emergency warrant on the basis of what they had seen in room.that finding is not clearly erroneous.citation omitted.
clear error review is appropriate because,as we have said,the first prong of dessesaure is subjective,concerning the police officers intent,in contrast to the objective determination of probable cause under the second prong.dessesaure,at restrepo,at u nlike the objective test of whether the expurgated affidavit constitutes probable cause to issue the warrant,the core judicial inquiry before the district court is a subjective one whether information gained in the illegal search prompted the officers to seek a warrant.to be sure,although the inquiry is subjective,proof should not be by purely subjective means,and the district court must assess the totality of the attendant circumstances in determining the plausibility of the officers assurances.dessesaure,at.in so doing,the court may assume that the officers are reasonable,and would have intended to act as a reasonable officer would act in the circumstances.see united states silva,cir.nevertheless,the ultimate determination of the officers intent is a subjective one,and must remain distinct from the other dessesaure objective determination of whether there existed probable cause to search absent the unlawfully obtained information.as murray itself illustrated,the inquiries may point in different directions.see murray,at.holding that,where probable cause to search had not been challenged,the question of whether the search was in fact a genuinely independent source depended in part on what prompted the agents to seek a warrant 
application to this case 
legal error 
we address first the government argument that the district court committed a legal error in conducting the independent source inquiry.the government writes the focus of the independent source inquiry is not on whether the officers in fact considered tainted information as the court appears to have thought,but whether the warrant would have been sought even if what actually happened had not occurred.we agree that it would have been legal error for the court to conclude that the november search was not an independent source because the agents relied in fact on tainted information in seeking the search warrant.see dessesaure,at.but there is no indication that the district court believed that this was the relevant inquiry.rather,the court cited the agents testimony that they were led to seek the warrant by the combination of siciliano statements and the items observed during the protective sweep.from this testimony,along with other evidence in the record,the court concluded that the government has not established that the officers would have sought the warrant absent the knowledge that gel capsules and powder were in the apartment.the legal standard employed by the court is precisely the one we recommended in dessesaure o ne must ask whether the warrant would have been sought if what actually happened,the unlawful search had not occurred.dessesaure,at quoting murray,at.
factual error 
the core of the government argument on appeal is that the district court clearly erred in concluding that the government did not establish that the agents were not prompted to seek the november search warrant by information acquired during the unlawful protective sweep.the government makes two related arguments to this end.first,it argues that the district court clearly erred in stating that the agents testified that it was the combination of siciliano statements and the items observed during the protective sweep that led them to seek the search warrant.according to the government,the agents testified only that these factors led them to freeze the apartment.second,the government argues that the record does not support the contention that the gel capsules and powder observed during the protective sweep were pivotal to the agents decision to seek the search warrant.in support of this claim,the government points out that siciliano demeanor and evasive answers to questions during the interview would have made it unlikely,in the agents minds,that the chemicals were purchased for a lawful purpose.moreover,there would have been little reason for the agents to wait to seek a warrant,since after the interview siciliano knew he was being investigated,and would have stopped criminal activity and might have destroyed evidence.
i.the agents testimony 
as we have previously explained,officers freeze a property because they intend to seek a warrant and wish to preserve evidence.dessesaure,at.for this reason,testimony as to why officers froze a property may also reveal why they sought a search warrant.here,agent roberto testified that what led to the premises being frozen was p art the interview and part what was observed during the protective sweep.agent ditulio testified that what led to us freezing the apartment was a series of factors,namely,the conflicting statements,along with what we saw during the protective sweep.the factors cited are plainly relevant to a decision to seek a warrant.they would suggest,to a reasonable officer,the presence of criminal activity.
moreover,the agents testimony on this point does not necessarily imply that they would have sought the search warrant if the protective sweep had not occurred.agent roberto testimony that what led to the freezing was p art the interview and part what was observed might have meant that the interview and the protective sweep were each sufficient to prompt him to seek the other words,that he sought the warrant for two independent reasons.however,agent roberto also might have meant that the combination of the interview and the protective sweep prompted him to seek the warrant,such that he would not have sought the warrant if either condition were absent.it was the government burden to rule out the second interpretation.for reasons we explain below,it was not clear error for the district court to choose that interpretation.
ii.the significance of the protective sweep 
contrary to the government suggestion,the district court conclusion that the agents might not have sought the november search warrant if the protective sweep had not occurred is well supported by the record.at the suppression hearing,agent roberto testified that after receiving information from rcmp and ebay,he was not concerned about the chemicals being in siciliano house,and decided to obtain other evidence that there was manufacturing going on.surveillance and the trash pull did not provide the agents with this evidence.according to testimony at the suppression hearing,the agents did not observe siciliano interact with anyone while under surveillance.the results of the trash pull did not have any bearing on the chemical ordering,and agent roberto testified that he did not apply for a warrant as a result of what was found.as of november,the date of the interview,agent roberto testified that he had no knowledge that anyone had visited siciliano apartment to purchase drugs.while agent roberto had concluded that chemicals were delivered to surrey street,he remained uncertain about the manufacturing of mdma on the premises.when asked,there could have been a lab.there might not have been.you did know,did you,he agreed.
this testimony suggests that the agents desired to obtain evidence,besides the record of chemical orders,of mdma manufacturing in the apartment before seeking a warrant.yet nothing that occurred between august and november,provided the agents with that evidence.moreover,the november interview itself,while strongly suggestive of criminal wrongdoing,also did not supply the agents with evidence of manufacturing at siciliano address.during the interview,siciliano told the agents that he had purchased the chemicals for someone named frank,whose identifying information he did not disclose.reasonable agents might have concluded that while siciliano was involved in drugs,manufacturing was not occurring at the surrey street address.after all,they had investigated the address for over a month and discovered nothing.as the district court noted,the only evidence of drugs on the premises was discovered during the protective sweep.it was thus the protective sweep that provided the agents with what they evidence that siciliano was involved in manufacturing mdma on the premises.
moreover,absent evidence of drugs or chemicals in the surrey street apartment,the agents may not have been concerned,as the government suggests they were,with the destruction of evidence at that location.indeed,the district court could fairly infer that the fear of the officers that siciliano would destroy physical evidence was generated by the physical evidence observed during the protective sweep.
the record,as it existed at the time of the suppression hearing,does not leave us with a strong,unyielding belief that the district court erred in concluding that the government did not establish that the agents would have sought the november warrant even if the unlawful protective sweep had not occurred.rather,the district court finding is supported by a reasonable view of the evidence testimony from both agent roberto and agent ditulio about what led them to freeze the premises,as well as testimony about the goal of the investigation and earlier decisions not to seek a warrant.therefore,the district court did not commit clear error.pursuant to dessesaure and the district court findings,the november search was not an independent source of the evidence discovered in the apartment and subsequently on the seized computers.see dessesaure,at.the evidence was therefore rightly suppressed.
b.the government motion for reconsideration 
the district court denial of a motion to reconsider is reviewed for abuse of discretion.united states roberts,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when a relevant factor deserving of significant weight is overlooked,or when an improper factor is accorded significant weight,or when the court considers the appropriate mix of factors,but commits a palpable error of judgment in calibrating the decisional scales.id.at.
when faced with a motion for reconsideration,district courts should apply an test.see greene union mut.life ins.of,cir.the government contends that,under our decision in roberts,district courts should consider seven rules of thumb in making the determination.it insists that the district court ruling is inconsistent with the reasoning of roberts,and that the court abused its discretion by failing to consider all of the issues presented in the government motion.in particular,in that motion,the government argued that it had discovered new evidence of dispositive significance for the defendant prior motion to suppress.attached to the government motion was an affidavit from agent roberto stating that he had prepared a draft affidavit in october to support a search warrant for the surrey street apartment,and that he had intended to apply for a warrant once the november interview was completed.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for reconsideration.first,the roberts factors,on which the government analysis heavily relies,are neither necessary to determining the interests of justice in every evaluation of a motion for reconsideration,nor are they particularly appropriate in this case.see roberts,at.in roberts,a district court summarily granted the defendant motion to suppress after the government failed to timely file an opposition,missing the deadline by several days.id.at.the government moved for reconsideration,explaining that it had misinterpreted the local rule governing filing deadlines.the court accepted the government explanation and agreed to reconsider,but nevertheless refused to determine the suppression issue on the merits,concluding that the circumstances constituted neither good cause nor excusable neglect for the late filing.id.at.
we vacated the court order.id.at.after reaffirming that motions for reconsideration are subject to an test,we stated,i n determining this motion to reconsider the court response to the belated filing before us,it would have helped had the district court examined the following seven factors id.at emphasis added.predictably,several of these factors concerned timeliness,the reason for the late filing,and prejudice to the other party because of the late filing.as we explained,w e do not say that courts must necessarily look at each and all of these factors in every case,or that courts can not,in a proper case,examine other factors.id.at.
indeed,in a recent case examining a district court denial of a motion to reconsider based on new evidence,we did not mention the roberts factors.see douglas york county,cir see also irs,cir applying test without discussing roberts.moreover,the government did not ask the district court to apply the roberts factors to its motion below.there is thus no reason to conclude,as the government suggests we should,that the district court failure to address substantively the roberts factors undercuts the deference that would ordinarily be due a district court order denying reconsideration.
moreover,in contrast to roberts,this case does not concern an initial order summarily entered after one party failed to make a timely filing.instead,we have a fully reasoned decision entered after a suppression hearing.also,the language of the court order denying the motion for reconsideration suggests that the court did test the government arguments against the merits of its earlier suppression decision,but simply decided not to change its position.consequently,several of the roberts factors degree of tardiness,reasons for tardiness,and the utility of the pleading do not apply because the court never asked why the government had not presented the newly discovered evidence at the time of the suppression hearing.instead,the court order denying the motion for reconsideration appears to have reflected an evaluation of the merits of the suppression order in light of the arguments made in the motion for reconsideration.
the government suggestion that the district court simply did not consider the issues presented in the government motion is unfounded.in fact,in its order denying the motion for reconsideration,the district court discussed the substance of some of the government claims.the government had asked the district court to revisit its holding that the protective sweep was unlawful because the agents who performed the sweep lacked an articulable basis for suspecting that the apartment harbored dangerous individuals.the government argued that the district court should consider the collective knowledge of the officers in the apartment,including agent roberto,who was aware of siciliano conduct during the interview and thus did have an articulable basis for suspecting that there could be others in the apartment involved in manufacturing mdma who posed a danger to the officers.in its motion denying reconsideration,the court analyzed the government argument.it concluded that the argument did not require it to revise its previous holding,since even if the collective knowledge doctrine applied,the officers who conducted the sweep were summoned before agent roberto began the interview.
notably,the government does not appeal the district court treatment of the collective knowledge issue.instead,because the court order does not include a similarly detailed analysis of its rejection of the significance of the october draft affidavit,the government argues that the court abused its discretion in denying the motion for reconsideration.the premise of this a court denying a motion for reconsideration must offer a reasoned explanation of its disposition of every argument made in the motion,or otherwise risk abusing its hopeless.see lema moya,cir noting that,in the rule context,a district court deni al of a motion without explanation is permissible citing domegan fair,cir earnhardt puerto rico,cir district court did not abuse discretion by declining to give reasons for denying motion to alter or amend judgment,but we must assume that the motion received careful consideration.
moreover,even in the absence of an explanation of the court reasons for rejecting the significance of agent roberto affidavit,the language of the court order suggests that it did consider all of the arguments but chose to address one specifically the court is not inclined to reconsider its determination that the officers would not have sought a warrant absent the protective sweep.with regard to the government collective knowledge argument 
also,the government has overstated the legal significance of the october draft affidavit.contrary to the government assertion,none of the cases cited stand for the proposition that the mere existence of a partially completed draft affidavit,written sometime before the execution of an unlawful search,proves that the government would have sought the subsequent search warrant regardless of the unlawful search.rather,in the authorities cited by the government,officers were actively preparing a search warrant affidavit when an unlawful search occurred.see united states hobbs,cir officers writing affidavit at the same time unlawful search occurred united states walton,cir officers had been preparing the search warrant affidavit for several days prior to the garage entry,and added the observations from that illegal entry only at the last moment from the fact that the officers were actively preparing a search warrant affidavit,as well as other facts,the courts inferred that the officers
