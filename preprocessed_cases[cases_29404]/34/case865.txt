the government appeals from a judgment issued by the united states district court for the northern district of new york hurd,j.granting defendant appellee jeffrey truman,truman motion for a judgment of acquittal under federal rule of criminal procedure a and conditionally granting truman motion for a new trial under federal rules of criminal procedure d and a after a jury trial in which truman was convicted of various charges in connection with the destruction by fire of a vacant building that he jointly owned.a principal witness against truman at trial,his son,jeffrey truman,truman,had been convicted in new york state court of setting fire to the building and had thereafter cooperated with the federal government.
contrary to the district court analysis,we conclude that truman,refusal to answer certain questions at trial did not render his testimony for the government incredible as a matter of law,and that truman,prior testimony against truman in a separate state court trial was properly admitted as nonhearsay under federal rule of evidence d a.we also conclude that truman was not prejudiced by the government improper and arguments in summation or by the government reference in summation to a breach of truman,cooperation agreement.accordingly,we vacate the district court judgment of acquittal and its order conditionally granting a new trial,and we remand for entry of a judgment consistent with the jury guilty verdict and for sentencing.
background 
according to the evidence introduced at trial,in november truman,along with two partners in jmm properties,llc jmm,purchased a vacant commercial building and the property on which it was located on liberty street in oneida,new york liberty street building or the building for.an insurance policy for the property,set to expire november,covered up to in losses.moreover,as truman later learned from jmm real estate broker,the property without the building was worth as much or more than it was worth with the building on it.
in january a small fire started accidentally at the liberty street property,causing only minor damage.the day after the fire,the real estate broker reminded truman that the building was insured for several million dollars,and truman told an employee responsible for cleaning the building,i f it ever caught on fire again,just get out.it is worth more to me down than it is standing.similarly,when truman said that leasing the building would be profitable,truman responded that it would probably make more money if it burnt.
by the fall of,jmm was financially strapped.unable to find tenants or buyers for the property,it faced mounting unpaid financial obligations totaling several thousand dollars,including a significant interest payment on one mortgage loan,due november,the same day that the insurance policy was set to expire and a payment of in broker fees associated with a second mortgage that truman had personally guaranteed.after truman negotiated three extensions of the deadline for the payment,jmm mortgage broker told truman the week before the fire that the second loan would be canceled if the payment was not made by november.truman himself experienced significant financial difficulties relating to jmm and unrelated businesses,including a restaurant and a skating rink.he lost in other real estate investments in and in september was forced to withdraw from his retirement savings to pay credit card debts and jmm bills.by early november,truman had less than in his personal bank accounts.nevertheless,the premium payments for the insurance policy covering the liberty street building remained up to date through november.
the building burned down the evening of november.investigators soon determined that the fire was the result of arson.the following month,police arrested truman,who confessed that he had burned the building at his father direction.apparently unaware of his son confession,truman and his business partners filed an insurance claim for the building in february.truman was arrested by state law enforcement officials in march,and both he and truman,were indicted by a grand jury in madison county,new york.truman,pleaded guilty to arson pursuant to a cooperation agreement with the district attorney of madison county and served a term of imprisonment.
state proceedings 
truman was first tried in state court on arson,fraud,and related charges,with truman,as the main witness against him.the charges were dismissed,however,when the state prosecutors proved unable to corroborate truman,testimony,as required under new york law when an accomplice testifies for the prosecution.see.
ii.federal proceedings and evidence at trial 
after the state charges against truman were dismissed,the united states began its own investigation.in january truman,entered into a cooperation agreement with the united states attorney office pursuant to which he agreed to give complete,truthful,and accurate information during statements to the government and subsequent testimony before a federal grand jury and during subsequent proceedings,and acknowledged that a failure or a refusal to continue to cooperate or to testify would constitute a breach of the agreement.truman,testified before a federal grand jury,and soon thereafter truman was indicted and charged with aiding and abetting arson,in violation of u.i and count one,mail fraud,in violation of counts two and three,use of fire in the commission of a felony,namely,mail fraud,in violation of h count four,and loan fraud,in violation of,in connection with a second mortgage that truman obtained to develop the liberty street property counts five and six.
truman,testimony and statement to the police 
at truman federal trial,the government called truman,as a witness.he first testified about his criminal history,including the state arson conviction and various convictions for driving while intoxicated dwi he then testified that he burned down the liberty street building.while acknowledging that he had discussed the building with his father the day before the arson,truman,declined to disclose what his father had told him.he testified that he started the fire at a time when truman would be at the skating rink that he owned so that truman would have an alibi.the day of the fire,truman drove truman,to the skating rink.there,truman,met a friend,nick fleming,who drove truman,to the liberty street building.inside the building,truman,located containers of gasoline and kerosene that truman had previously purchased with cash and that had been left inside.he then piled cardboard boxes to ensure that the fire would reach each floor.before setting the fire,he returned to the skating rink to pick up a black hooded sweatshirt that his father had obtained for him,and which he planned to wear while setting the fire.after changing into the sweatshirt,truman,entered the liberty street building,poured gasoline and kerosene from the containers onto wooden pallets,and lit them.after setting the fire,he first went to his father restaurant to change out of his sweatshirt,called fleming to tell him that he had set the fire,and then returned to the burning building,where he spotted his father and fleming watching nearby.truman,then went to his apartment with fleming.his father met him there and helped him retrieve the sweatshirt.the two then drove to syracuse,new york,where truman,discarded the sweatshirt and his shoes in a dumpster.
when the government asked truman,why he set the fire and about the content of his conversations with his father,he refused to answer.the district court confirmed that truman,would not answer and warned him that his refusal would constitute a breach of the cooperation agreement with the government.he still refused,saying,i ca,and,i ca do this.in response,and over truman objection,the government read portions of truman,testimony from truman state court trial,in which truman,confirmed that his father had asked him to start the fire 
question jeffrey,did you have any information about the gasoline and kerosene before going over to the building that morning 
answer yes.
question and from whom did you receive that information 
answer my father.
question and when did you receive that information 
answer the night before.
question and what did your dad tell you about the gasoline and kerosene 
answer told me what room they were in and where in the room.
question what room were they to be in 
answer it was the room that had a previous fire in it.
question and did he tell you anything with regards for the purpose for those being there 
answer for burning the building down.
question and you said a week before the fire you had a discussion with your dad as well.what did he say to you at that time 
answer he asked me if i would do it.
after the testimony was read,truman,confirmed that he had so testified during the state court trial.
on,truman counsel asked truman,about his deposition testimony in a related civil lawsuit that jmm had filed against the insurance company that denied jmm insurance claim.truman,acknowledged that he had refused to answer several questions and had invoked his fifth amendment right not to incriminate himself during the deposition,but he then proceeded to answer defense counsel questions about peripheral matters relating to his state court testimony,and he maintained that his state court testimony had been truthful.he also acknowledged giving to the police the december written statement explicitly implicating his father in the arson,which was admitted into evidence,and he testified that the confession was true.
additional government evidence 
several government witnesses corroborated truman,testimony regarding his father involvement in the arson.three days after the fire,fleming heard truman yell at truman,to keep your mouth shut.in december,in a series of recorded telephone calls that were admitted into evidence,fleming told truman that the police had found tracks from fleming car tires at the scene of the fire,that the police were looking for him and his car,and that he was concerned that they might find traces of gasoline and kerosene in the car upholstery.truman responded by offering to pay fleming for the cost of replacing the tires.shortly thereafter,truman spoke with a police detective about the fire but concealed his conversation with fleming.ashley shaughnessy,a friend of truman,testified that after the arson truman said t hat they were going to take truman,clothes and put them in the dumpster.telephone and toll records further corroborated truman,account of traveling to syracuse with his father to dispose of evidence.in addition,the government presented evidence,set forth above,relating to truman purchase of the building,the insurance policy,his conversations with jmm real estate broker,and his inculpatory statements to a building employee and to his.
after the government,truman moved for a judgment of acquittal under rule a.the district court granted the motion as to the loan fraud charges,counts five and six,but reserved judgment as to the remaining four counts.
c.the defense case 
the defense introduced some evidence that truman,had recanted his state court testimony inculpating his father.in particular,anthony lafache,truman,lawyer in the civil lawsuit between jmm and the insurance company,testified that truman,invoked his fifth amendment right not to answer questions during the civil deposition because he was concerned that his responses might conflict with his prior state court testimony.according to lafache,truman,confided that his previous sworn testimony and previous sworn statements,blaming his father were untrue.
testifying in his defense,truman denied any role in the arson or the related fraud.on,an assistant united states attorney ausa repeatedly asked truman whether statements made by other witnesses that contradicted truman testimony were true,accurate,or mistaken,and whether certain witnesses were lying during their testimony.the ausa also confronted truman about his conversation with fleming and,after noting that truman had failed to mention it to police,asked i s it true that you would not tell the detective about this conversation you had with fleming because he was a police officer and police officers,in your view,are the biggest liars on the planet after truman answered no,the government introduced deposition testimony from the jmm civil suit in which truman stated,police are the biggest liars on the planet.who knows what he is going to write down on a piece of paper they all lie.they lied at my state criminal trial,and they lie all the time.
d.the government rebuttal 
on the government rebuttal case,carrie dailey testified that the summer before the fire,truman arrived at truman,apartment and began talking about the liberty street building.according to dailey,h e said to all the gentlemen in the room,you guys want to get in on burning the building down,you can get a cut of the insurance money.and then he looked directly at truman,and told him,you will be all set.dailey,however,was not asked to identify truman in the courtroom,and she admitted on that she had failed to contact the police after the fire or after truman was indicted.
jury summations 
during summation,an ausa stated that truman,had violated his plea agreement by refusing to testify directly against his father.the ausa then dramatically tore a copy of the agreement in half,describing it as breached,over,and void.the ausa also addressed contradictions between truman testimony and,echoing the government,asserted that truman main argument was that key government witnesses were mistaken or lying.
in its summation,the defense emphasized that the government had not asked dailey to identify truman in the courtroom,noting that t hese two ausas did just graduate from law school,and arguing that i f she could have identified truman,she would have.she could,and she did.in the government rebuttal summation,one of the ausas addressed his failure to ask carrie dailey to identify truman in the courtroom try as we can to be perfect and to remember everything,we ca.and i should have asked some witnesses some questions,and i did.and with carrie dailey,i did i should have,and i did.i apologize to you for that.but nobody is perfect.the government also repeated its argument that,in order to believe truman testimony,the jury would have to believe that several of its witnesses had lied.the government further described it as telling that truman believed most police officers to be liars.truman did not object to any of the government statements during summation.
verdict and post trial proceedings 
the jury deliberated for less than a day before convicting truman on all four of the remaining counts.truman renewed his motion for a judgment of acquittal under rule a or c and moved in the alternative for a grant of a new trial under rule a.the district court granted the rule a motion after concluding that truman,federal and state court trial testimony was incredible as a matter of law.united states truman,d.the court determined that the remaining circumstantial evidence was insufficient to support the arson and other charges.id.at.
the district court also conditionally granted truman motion for a new trial under rules d and a on four grounds truman,patently incredible testimony constituted an exceptional circumstance warranting a new trial,id.at it had erroneously admitted truman,prior state court testimony because it was hearsay,irrelevant,unfairly prejudicial and misleading,id.at the government had engaged in prosecutorial misconduct during its of truman and in its summations,id.at and these errors were not harmless because truman,state court testimony was the only direct evidence of truman guilt,id.at.
the government appealed.
discussion 
rule judgment of acquittala.standard of review 
we have explained that on a motion for a judgment of acquittal,a district court must determine the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the guilty verdict.a,and it must evaluate all of the evidence,including improperly admitted evidence,united states cruz,cir citing lockhart nelson,d.under rule b,when a district court reserves decision on a defendant rule motion at the close of the government evidence,it must decide the motion on the basis of the evidence at the time the ruling was reserved.b.we review de novo a district court grant of a judgment of acquittal,united states coté,cir,and on appeal we view the trial evidence in the light most favorable to the government,united states reyes,cir.when a defendant has been prejudiced by improperly admitted evidence,the proper remedy is not a judgment of acquittal but a new trial.see,united states bruno,cir.
double jeopardy 
as an initial matter,truman argues that the double jeopardy clause deprives us of jurisdiction to review the district court judgment of acquittal because truman moved for the judgment before the jury verdict.but the double jeopardy clause does not bar our review of the district court judgment of acquittal because the district court granted the motion after the jury verdict.united states autuori,cir the double jeopardy clause presents no bar to the review of an acquittal based upon the insufficiency of the evidence and granted following a jury verdict of guilty.see united states hundley,cir 
truman,credibility 
rule does not provide the trial court with an opportunity to substitute its own determination of the weight of the evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn for that of the jury.united states guadagna,cir alteration in original and quotation marks omitted.t he proper place for a challenge to a witness credibility is in and in subsequent argument to the jury,united states roman,cir quotation marks omitted,not in a motion for a judgment of acquittal.we have explained that even the testimony of a single accomplice witness is sufficient to sustain a conviction,provided it is not incredible on its face,united states florez,cir,or does not def y physical realities,coté,at quotation marks omitted.
the district court determined that truman,testimony in both the federal and state court trials was incredible as a matter of law based on a number of factors.it cited his role as an accomplice testifying under a cooperation agreement,his breach of that agreement and the government effective repudiat ion of his testimony,his criminal record and history of alcohol and drug abuse,his attorney assertion that he had perjured himself in the state court trial testimony,his refusal during the federal trial to answer questions about his father involvement in the arson,and truman consequent inability to him concerning his testimony.truman,d at.
although these factors surely impaired truman,credibility,none of them rendered his testimony incredible as a matter of law.assessing his credibility was the province of a jury properly instructed,as was the case here,on those aspects of his testimony that might bear on the question.see united states,cir it is the province of the jury and not of the court to determine whether a witness who may have been inaccurate,contradictory and even untruthful in some respects was nonetheless entirely credible in the essentials of his testimony.quotation marks omitted united states santana,cir.his failure to testify fully,as required under the cooperation agreement,his troubled background,any inconsistencies in his testimony,and the inferences to be drawn from the evidence,are factors relevant to the weight the jury should accord to the evidence,and do not on this record justify the grant of a judgment of acquittal.coté,at.
d.other evidence of guilt 
even aside from truman,testimony,the remaining circumstantial and direct evidence of truman guilt in the government,viewed in the light most favorable to the government,was sufficient to support the jury verdict.first,truman,signed confession to police directly implicated truman second,several witnesses established truman financial motive to destroy the liberty street building.third,the evidence showed that the timing of the fire on november,was in truman financial interest,given the looming payment deadlines and expiration of jmm insurance policy.fourth,truman conversation with fleming and ashley shaughnessy testimony strongly suggested that truman had facilitated the arson and was attempting to conceal his participation.
the evidence adduced in the government of truman participation in the arson,which the district court recognized was an essential element of the other charges against him,was sufficient to support the jury guilty verdict on counts one through four,each of which rested upon a finding that truman had aided and abetted arson.because that evidence,without truman,testimony,was sufficient and,in any event,truman,testimony was not incredible as a matter of law,the district court judgment of acquittal on these counts was error.
ii.new trial 
the government also appeals from the district court conditional grant of a new trial under federal rules of criminal procedure d and.we review a district court grant of a new trial for abuse of discretion.united states polouizzi,cir rule confers broad discretion upon a trial court to set aside a jury verdict and order a new trial to avert a perceived miscarriage of justice.quotation marks omitted.a district court may grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.a,but it abuses its discretion when its decision rests on an error of law or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or when its decision can not be located within the range of permissible decisions,united states gonzalez,cir.
when considering a motion for a new trial under rule,a district court has discretion to weigh the evidence and in so doing evaluate for itself the credibility of the witnesses.united states sanchez,cir quotation marks omitted.even in cases involving a witness perjured testimony,however,a new trial is warranted only if the jury probably would have acquitted in the absence of the false testimony.id.at.
the district court conditionally granted a new trial based on its view that truman,testimony was patently incredible,truman,state court testimony was improperly admitted into evidence,and the government had engaged in prosecutorial misconduct during its of truman and in summation.we address each of these issues in turn.
truman,credibility 
having already concluded that the district court erred when it determined that truman,state court testimony was incredible as a matter of law,we also conclude that the district court exceeded its discretion when it granted a new trial on that basis.see gonzalez,at.even aside from truman,testimony,we can not say that the jury probably would have acquitted truman.in particular,we note carrie dailey rebuttal testimony,which the district court disregarded because dailey failed immediately to notify the police about truman and because she was not asked to identify truman at trial.truman,d at these facts do not,standing alone,demonstrate a lack of credibility,particularly in the absence of any apparent motive to lie or any indication that dailey would have been unable to identify truman if asked to do so.the jury was entitled to credit dailey testimony,and the district court decision to grant a new trial despite that strong evidence of guilt reflected a decision outside the range of permissible decisions.gonzalez,at.
admissibility 
the district court also concluded that a new trial was warranted because truman,state court testimony was inadmissible hearsay.truman,d at.we disagree.a statement is nonhearsay if t he declarant testifies at trial,is subject to about a prior statement,and the statement is inconsistent with the declarant testimony and was given under penalty of perjury at a trial,hearing,or other proceeding or in a deposition.d a section breaks omitted.
truman,answered every question posed to him in about his prior state court testimony,and therefore he was subject to within the meaning of rule d a.his prior testimony was also inconsistent with his refusal to answer questions about that testimony on direct examination at trial.in united states marchand,we held that if a witness has testified to facts before a grand jury and forgets or denies them at trial,his grand jury testimony falls squarely within rule d a,cir.our holding in marchand naturally extends to a trial witness refusal to answer questions posed and answered in prior sworn state court testimony.to the extent marchand did not specifically address this issue,however,we now join all of our sister court
