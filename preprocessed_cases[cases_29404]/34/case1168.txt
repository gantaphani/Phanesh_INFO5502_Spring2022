this appeal primarily concerns a claim that the admission of witness statements,coupled with the prosecution selective use of immunity,resulted in the denial of a fair trial.the government granted immunity to some former of the appellants and presented them as live witnesses as to other former,the government refused to grant use immunity and instead offered their guilty plea allocutions as statements against penal interest.as a result,the appellants could only the deemed so entirely helpful to the prosecution that immunity was provided them,but could not the other,portions of whose statements,helpful to the prosecution,were placed into evidence.
mohammad dolah and marshall weinberg appeal from the march and,judgments of the united states district court for the southern district of new york robert carter,district judge,convicting them,after a jury trial,of nine counts of securities fraud and,and one count of conspiracy.although the introduction into evidence of the plea allocutions of the,following the government selective use of immunity for some of the,arguably presents a substantial claim of error,we conclude that,if error occurred,it was harmless.we also reject the appellants challenge to the return of partial verdicts.we therefore affirm.
the evidence permitted the jury to find the following facts.dolah and weinberg worked at stone asset,a brokerage firm.dolah supervised stock brokers weinberg was the president and a principal of the firm.the charged offenses concerned stone asset private stock offering on behalf of two very small firms one of which tried to make money by placing advertisements on the back of bicycle messengers bicycles.stone asset told customers that underwriting fees and brokerage expenses would consume only percent of the capital raised in fact stone asset got most of the proceeds.dolah weinberg personally altered financial statements,shredded documents,directed cold callers to use fictitious names,took delivery of cash payments from the issuers,and tried to remove their own names from all stone asset documents.
dolah and weinberg primary defense was that they lacked knowledge of the deceit practiced at stone asset they also argued that they believed the companies were good investments.
at trial,the government witnesses included three former employees of stone asset who had been given immunity and two former employees who had pled guilty pursuant to cooperation agreements.the government also introduced the guilty plea allocutions of three other former employees who had been indicted with dolah and weinberg,had pled guilty prior to trial,and were awaiting sentencing.these had indicated an intention to plead their privilege against if called to testify,but they were not given immunity.
the plea allocutions of the three were admitted into evidence,under a limiting instruction,to prove the existence of the conspiracy and the role of these.the names of the appellants were redacted from the plea allocutions.
the appellants were found guilty by the jury on all counts.the details concerning the return of partial verdicts are set forth in part iii,infra.their sentences included terms of imprisonment of months.
discussion 
i.the admission of the plea allocutions 
judge carter admitted into evidence the guilty plea allocutions of the three under the provision of the federal rules of evidence that exempts from the prohibition of hearsay a statement against interest,a statement contrary to the interests of the declarant,such as an admission of criminal liability.b.such statements are admissible only if the declarant is unavailable as a witness,id.b,and u navailability as a witness includes situations in which the declarant is exempted by ruling of the court on the ground of privilege from testifying concerning the subject matter of the declarant statement,id.a.here,the three had indicated they would invoke their privilege.rule also provides that a declarant is not unavailable as a witness if refusal is due to the procurement or wrongdoing of the proponent of a statement for the purpose of preventing the witness from attending or testifying.id.a.
the appellants challenge the admission of the plea allocutions as contrary to both rule and the constitution.
the argument based on rule has two parts.at its fullest,the argument is that the government has not satisfied the unavailability requirement of rule b because the would have testified had the government displaced their privilege by giving them use immunity.see use immunity.more narrowly,the appellants contend that even if the would normally be considered unavailable within the meaning of rule b,their unavailability was attributable to wrongdoing by the government within the meaning of rule a because the government withheld immunity from the three former stone asset employees whose plea allocutions they wanted to introduce after selectively conferring immunity on other former employees.
unavailability.it is settled in this circuit that a witness who invokes the privilege against is unavailable within the meaning of rule b even though the government has the power to displace the witness privilege with a grant of use immunity.we made that clear many years ago in united states lang,cir,and recently adhered to that position in united states gallego,cir upholding admissibility of plea allocution of see also united states petrillo,cir same united states moskowitz,cir same t he law appears to be well settled that the power of the executive branch to grant immunity to a witness is discretionary lang,at see also earl united states.
between lang and gallego some doubt had arisen in our circuit whether a witness invoking the privilege against remained unavailable to the government in view of the government power to displace the privilege by granting immunity.in united states salerno,amended by cir,rev,d,we ruled that the similar motive requirement of rule b did not apply to grand jury testimony offered by defendants against the government,see at,a ruling rejected by the supreme court,see at.we also ruled that the grand jury witnesses,who invoked their privilege at trial,were unavailable to the defendants,see at,at,a ruling not questioned by the supreme court.in making the latter ruling,we added in dictum that the grand jury witnesses were available to the government,see,reasoning that the government could displace their privilege,see at.that reasoning was questioned,see united states salerno,newman,with whom kearse,mahoney,and walker,join,dissenting from denial of rehearing in banc,and subsequently disavowed by the author of the salerno panel opinion as an unwarranted reading of that opinion,see united states bahadar,cir the argument that the government would be unable to invoke any of the rule b hearsay exceptions in criminal cases,since the government always has the ability to immunize a witness who claims the fifth amendment privilege and thereby make that witness available would be an unrealistic reading of the rules of evidence,of the law of immunity,and of the salerno decision itself.
the appellants contend that united states peterson,cir,supports a contrary rule.in peterson,a defendant,who relied on his privilege by refusing to testify at his federal trial,sought to introduce his own prior state grand jury testimony,claiming he was unavailable.we rejected the attempt,ruling that the defendant was not unavailable to testify at trial because he retained the decision whether to testify.id.at alternate holding h e has made himself unavailable to any other party,but he is not unavailable to himself.the appellants argue that just as the defendant in peterson could not offer hearsay where he retained control of his own availability to present his trial testimony,the government should not be able to offer hearsay plea allocutions where it retains the ability to render the declarants available and present their testimony.
the analogy is not persuasive.a defendant decision whether to testify concerns his assessment of the benefits and risks for the outcome of only his own trial.the government decision whether to grant immunity concerns the outcome not only of the trial at which the immunized witnesses would testify,but,if those witnesses are prosecuted,their subsequent trial,at which the government would have to meet the heavy burden of establishing sources of its evidence,independent of the immunized testimony.see united states north.finally,the appellants implicit premise that evidentiary rules for the prosecution and the defense must be mirror images is not always valid.the prosecution faces many evidentiary obstacles not imposed on the defense,notably an obligation to present evidence that is persuasive beyond a reasonable doubt.we conclude that a defendant like peterson remains available to himself for purposes of rule a,but that,as a general matter,witnesses who invoke the privilege against remain unavailable to the government,despite its authority to confer immunity on them.
wrongdoing.the appellants further contend that the three former employees who were not immunized should not be regarded as unavailable to the government because their refusal to testify is attributed to wrongdoing by the government within the meaning of rule a.in the appellants view,the government action in withholding immunity from the three former employees after selectively immunizing other former employees friendly to the prosecution is wrongdoing that undermines the unavailability of the former employees and renders their allocutions inadmissible.we disagree.
the quoted language of the rule applies to circumstances where the government takes positive action to preclude the witness from testifying.the former employees who did not testify made their own decisions to invoke the privilege against.there is no suggestion that the government urged them to do so.although the appellants suggest that a prosecutor has some opportunity to manipulate sentencing dates to make sure that the risk of at sentencing remains at the time of another defendant trial,there is nothing in the record to indicate such tactics in this case.the government decision not to confer immunity on the three was not wrongdoing or an act of procurement of unavailability within the meaning of rule a.these were unavailable for purposes of the rule.
constitutional objections 
the appellants contend that the use of the three plea allocutions violates both the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment and the procedural due process component of the fifth amendment.
confrontation clause.the appellants contend that the supreme court in lilly virginia,d,has interpreted the confrontation clause to forbid the government use of one defendant plea allocution at another defendant criminal trial,even though such an admission might be within the scope of rule.
in lilly,the court considered whether a tape of the defendant accomplice confessing to authorities could be played to the jury.the prosecution claimed that the tape was admissible as a statement against penal interest,but the court disagreed.the court held that the confession did not meet either of the two tests laid down in ohio roberts,d the rule admitting statements against penal interest was not a firmly rooted hearsay exception,and the taped confession did not have particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.id.at.in lilly,the plurality opinion of justice stevens for four members of the court concluded that presumptive unreliability attach ed to accomplices confessions that shift or spread blame.at.that opinion then noted that such unreliability could be rebutted,yet also said that it was highly unlikely that a rebuttal would be successful 
when the statements are given under conditions that implicate the core concerns of the old ex parte affidavit is,when the government is involved in the statements production,and when the statements describe past events and have not been subjected to adversarial testing.
id.emphasis added.
relying on the reference to government involvement,the appellants argue that lilly should be understood to mean that hearsay can not be admitted against a defendant whenever the government has played a role in the production of the statement.here the government has played such a role,the argument continues,because its decision not to confer immunity on the maintained their unavailability,rendering their allocutions admissible.
our circuit has not read lilly so broadly.on the contrary,we have viewed the plurality opinion as rejecting an accomplice confession because it was largely inculpatory,the declarant minimized his own criminal responsibility and shifted blame to the defendant.gallego,at.moreover,the appellants government involvement argument,at its fullest,would render inadmissible virtually all hearsay statements against interest on the theory that the government played a role in the declarant unavailability by declining to confer use immunity.yet,after lilly,we have regularly approved the admission of such statements.see petrillo,at plea allocution moskowitz,at same gallego,at same.the allocutions admitted against the appellants are as reliable as those accepted in petrillo,moskowitz,and gallego.
procedural due process.even if the plea allocutions would normally be admissible under rule as declarations against penal interest made by an unavailable witness,the appellants further contend that,in the circumstances of this case,the selective immunization of only some of the former employees,combined with the evidentiary use of the plea allocutions of the former employees,was so fundamentally unfair as to deny them procedural due process.this argument merits careful consideration,especially in light of the approach our court has already outlined with respect to defense witness immunity in some limited circumstances.
although as a general rule the government may not be required to confer immunity for the benefit of the defense,see united states turkish,cir,we have recognized that in narrowly defined circumstances the government will face a choice between either not immunizing witnesses who invoke the privilege and whom the prosecution might wish to call,or else immunizing both its own recalcitrant witnesses and those the defense might wish to call that choice confronts the government where the following special circumstances are present 
the government has engaged in discriminatory use of immunity to gain a tactical advantage or,through its own overreaching,has forced the witness to invoke the fifth amendment and the witness testimony will be material,exculpatory and not cumulative and is not obtainable from any other source.
united states burns,cir see also united states diaz,cir the defendant bears the burden of showing that each of these elements is present.
in several subsequent decisions,we have characterized our circuit approach to imposing upon the government a choice that includes defense witness immunity as a test discriminatory use by the government to gain tactical advantage,probative and exculpatory value of the expected evidence,and unobtainability from other sources.see diaz,at united states ballistrea,cir test united states bryser,cir bahadar,at united states pinto,cir united states calvente,cir.the discriminatory use component of the test is not entirely clear.it is arguable that this component does not mean a selection of a candidate for immunity based on some objectionable characteristic,but means simply a decision by the government to confer immunity on some witnesses and not on others.this view draws support from the citation in burns to our prior decision in united states praetorius,cir,where we noted decisions of other circuits that we characterized as requiring the government to confer defense witness immunity where the government has used immunity to compel testimony from its own witnesses.id.at citing united states alessio,cir,and earl,at on the other hand,burns referred to a discriminatory use of immunity to gain a tactical advantage,at,and tactical advantage might mean something more than merely selecting from among potential witnesses those who will receive immunity.see ballistrea,at nothing in the record indicates that the government had granted immunity to its witnesses,and refused to grant immunity to defendant witnesses,in order to gain a tactical advantage.burns,at w e find un
