raising an important issue of first impression,customers of woods irrigation company woods,a water distribution corporation,contend the state water resources control board water board lacks jurisdiction to issue a order cdo for an illegal diversion of water if the diverter claims riparian or pre appropriative rights.the customers argue the water board must first file a civil lawsuit to adjudicate the diverter water rights before it can execute its statutory mandate to take vigorous action to prevent the unlawful diversion of water.the trial court granted the customers petition for a writ of mandamus limiting the water board jurisdiction and awarding attorney fees under the private attorney general doctrine.code civ.
the water board granted the customers request for reconsideration,thereby reopening the hearing on woods diversions to allow the customers the opportunity to submit evidence and witnesses.we conclude the reconsideration order moots the due process issue,but the jurisdictional question remains of paramount public interest.we further conclude that pursuant to water code section,the water board can make a preliminary determination for purposes of enforcement whether the diverter has either the riparian or pre appropriative rights it claims without filing a lawsuit.the diverter or interested parties can thereafter seek judicial review if warranted.we therefore reverse the judgment,including the award of attorney fees.
legal and factual context 
the resolution of this appeal turns on the meaning of water code section,which provides in relevant part 
a when the board determines that any person is violating,or threatening to violate,any requirement described in subdivision d,the board may issue an order to that person to cease and desist from that violation.
d the board may issue a cease and desist order in response to a violation or threatened violation of any of the following 
the prohibition set forth in section against the unauthorized diversion or use of water subject to this division.
any term or condition of a permit,license,certification,or registration issued under this division.
any decision or order of the board issued under this part,section,or article commencing with section of chapter of division,in which decision or order the person to whom the cease and desist order will be issued,or a predecessor in interest to that person,was named as a party directly affected by the decision or order.
e this article shall not authorize the board to regulate in any manner,the diversion or use of water not otherwise subject to regulation of the board under this part.
on february,the water board requested woods to complete a statement of diversion and use of water from the middle river in the sacramento san joaquin river delta and to provide evidence to verify the basis of the asserted water right upon which it was diverting water.following an investigation,the water board issued a draft cdo against woods for the alleged unauthorized diversion of water.
on january,woods requested a hearing.four months later,the customers,owners of land on roberts island,sought to intervene in the hearing and requested a continuance.the hearing officer declined to continue the cdo hearing or to allow late intervention.he wrote the woods cdo hearing will not bind to the hearing.whether landowners who receive water through woods would be otherwise impacted by the proceeding will depend upon the terms of an order either issuing or not issuing a cdo against woods.the hearing officers may,if appropriate or necessary,hold open the hearing to allow for submission of additional evidence or to allow for participation of additional parties.
at the hearing,woods provided evidence supporting riparian or pre appropriative water rights to divert no more than cubic feet per second cfs.after several revisions,the board voted in february to approve the draft cdo.woods was ordered to submit monthly diversion records annually,and before diverting any water at a rate in excess of cfs,it was required to submit additional evidence regarding water rights and other information to the deputy director of the water board.the cdo allows woods to seek a diversion rate increase based on additional evidence regarding the water rights of landowners not addressed in this order.the order expressly provides notwithstanding paragraphs and,above,if a water user or water right holder within the woods service area provides information,and such information demonstrates an additional basis of right for deliveries of water acceptable to the deputy director,after issuance of this order,woods may deliver water to the user upon the deputy director approval.
the customers sought both administrative and judicial review.to obtain administrative review,the customers petitioned the water board for reconsideration of the order,and to obtain judicial review,the customers petitioned for a writ of mandate,claiming that the water board does not have jurisdiction to issue a cdo against diverters who claim riparian or pre appropriative rights and that the water board violated their right to due process.before the water board acted on the request for reconsideration,the superior court issued a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the water board to set aside the cdo,water board order no.wr.the customers presented no evidence in the mandamus proceedings regarding the extent of the riparian and pre appropriative rights claimed by woods and the customers,and the court made no findings on this issue.
thereafter the water board partially granted the customers petition for reconsideration and rescinded the due process findings adopted by order no.wr.the order also concludes the water board has jurisdiction under water code section to determi
