section a of the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla,et,imposes liability on certain private parties for the cleanup costs associated with a hazardous waste contamination.in turn,cercla section f,added by the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of sara,stat,allows those responsible for cleanup costs to bring actions for contribution against one another as a means of apportioning fault.metropolitan water reclamation district of chicago metropolitan water has brought this action under both provisions,seeking to recover cleanup costs that it voluntarily incurred in remedying a parcel of property that it has leased for the past fifty years to lake river corporation lake river.lake river parent,north american galvanizing coatings,north american,moved to dismiss metropolitan water complaint for failure to state a claim,see.b.the district court granted the motion in part,dismissing metropolitan water f contribution claim,but allowed the a claim to go forward.we have jurisdiction over north american interlocutory appeal from this order,certified under b,and for the reasons set forth in the following opinion affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.facts 
in this appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss,we accept as true all allegations in metropolitan water complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor.see cler illinois educ.ass n,cir.the facts of the present dispute concern a parcel of contaminated property located on south harlem avenue,about one quarter mile north of the stevenson expressway in forest view,illinois.metropolitan water owns this property,consisting of approximately fifty acres.in the late,it entered into a lease with the lake river corporation,a wholly owned subsidiary of north american.lake river developed the property,constructing a facility to store,mix and package industrial chemicals for its own use and for the use of its customers.lake river operations involved accepting,by truck,barge and rail,large amounts of chemicals that it then held in storage tanks located on the property.
these tanks,according to the complaint,were prone to leaks.over the course of lake river tenancy,the tanks allegedly spilled close to gallons of industrial chemicals into the soil and groundwater.these toxins,the complaint further alleged,were hazardous substances,as that phrase is defined in cercla,see,and posed an imminent danger to the environment.the complaint also stated that metropolitan water has incurred substantial expenses investigating,monitoring and remedying the contaminated portions of its property.at.
district court proceedings 
in february,metropolitan water filed this action against lake river to recoup its costs in remedying the contamination.the original complaint asserted a claim under cercla a,see a,an alternative claim for contribution under cercla f,see id.f,and state law claims for nuisance and breach of contract.lake river failed to answer the complaint,resulting in a default judgment that ordered lake river to pay approximately million in damages to metropolitan water,in addition to future response costs.metropolitan water then amended the complaint to add lake river parent,north american,as a defendant the amended complaint realleged the cercla counts and state law claims.north american then moved to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b.
in ruling on north american motion,the district court began by distinguishing the two cercla claims being asserted.the court first described a liability provisions as providing an implied cause of action for cost recovery in cases where a party is seeking direct recovery of costs incurred in cleaning up a hazardous waste site.at.section f claims for contribution,by contrast,are asserted by potentially responsible parties,or prps,seeking to apportion damages among themselves.the court recognized that metropolitan water,because it owned the property during the period of contamination,must be considered a prp under cercla strict liability framework.normally,the court noted,prps are limited to claims for contribution under f and can not recoup the full cost of remediation under the joint and several recovery of a.the court then observed that the supreme court had held recently in cooper industries aviall services,d,that parties like metropolitan water who have commenced cleanup voluntarily,rather than being compelled to do so by a civil suit,have no right to contribution under the plain wording of f.see f allowing contribution only during or following any civil action.the district court held that,for this subset of prps who voluntarily undertake cleanup,an implied right to contribution under a remains available,notwithstanding their status as strictly liable parties under the statute.a contrary outcome,the court reasoned,would seem to lie contrary to the general purposes of cercla to promote prompt and proper cleanup of contaminated properties.at.
after hearing oral argument from the parties,we invited the environmental protection agency epa to submit its views as amicus curiae.the epa accepted our invitation and,with the permission of the court,lockheed martin corporation also has submitted an amicus curiae brief.both metropolitan water and north american now have filed supplemental briefs in response.
discussiona.cercla 
in the and,a number of environmental disasters,including the love canal dumping at niagara falls,new york,drew the public attention to the environmental risks and health hazards posed by improper hazardous waste disposal in response to rising public concern and the view that existing law was clearly inadequate to deal with this massive problem,pt,at,as reprinted in,congress enacted the cercla.the law purpose was twofold.it was intended,for one,to establish a comprehensive response and financing mechanism to abate and control the vast problems associated with abandoned and inactive hazardous waste disposal sites,at.second,cercla was meant to shift the costs of cleanup to the parties responsible for the contamination.see meghrig kfc western,d.
enforcement of cercla rests primarily with the epa,and the statute gives the agency a broad range of enforcement options.to implement the statute goals at a national level,the epa is directed by cercla to formulate a national contingency plan outlining specific steps that parties must take in choosing a remedial action plan and in cleaning up hazardous waste.see pt.in addition,for specific sites that the epa deems an imminent threat,the agency is authorized to issue an administrative compliance order or obtain a court injunction,directing any responsible party to respond to the contamination.see a.additionally,if it chooses,the epa may commence cleanup on its own using monies from the hazardous substances superfund,see id,a fund established by cerlca and financed through a combination of appropriations,epa fees and industry taxes.united states hercules,cir.
after superfund money has been spent by the epa,cercla allows the agency to recover its costs from the responsible parties,who are divided by cerlca a into the following four statutory categories 
the owner and operator of a vessel or a facility,
any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of,
any person who by contract,agreement,or otherwise arranged for disposal or treatment,or arranged with a transporter for transport for disposal or treatment,of hazardous substances owned or possessed by such person,by any other party or entity,at any facility or incineration vessel owned or operated by another party or entity and containing such hazardous substances,and 
any person who accepts or accepted any hazardous substances for transport to disposal or treatment facilities,incineration vessels or sites selected by such person,from which there is a release,or a threatened release which causes the incurrence of response costs,of a hazardous substance 
for these statutorily defined parties,or prps,liability under a is strict,joint and several.in other words,by invoking a,the epa may recover its costs in full from any responsible party,regardless of that party relative fault 
in the wake of cercla passage,an important question emerged whether a responsible party,who had been sued to commence cleanup or repay response costs,may obtain contribution from other responsible parties.as originally enacted in,cercla did not provide expressly for a right of contribution.see generally cooper,at.courts filled this vacuum by recognizing an implied right of contribution for prps who had been sued under section a and,because of that provision scheme,had been ordered to pay more than their pro rata share of the cleanup costs.see id.citing cases.
in,congress amended cercla by way of sara to authorize expressly a contribution action.see sara,stat.the provision allowing for contribution states in relevant part any person may seek contribution from any other person who is liable or potentially liable under section a of this title,during or following any civil action under section of this title or under section a of this title.f.in actions under this provision,the court allocates costs using equitable principles.liability is several,as opposed to section a joint and several scheme.in addition,sara encourages parties to settle with the government by insulating any party that settles from being sued in a contribution action.see id.f.
sara,in turn,produced its own set of new questions.foremost was whether the new,codified right of contribution was now the only cause of action available to a prp seeking to recover its cleanup costs.prps who had expended costs in remedying a site or settling liability understandably wished to seek joint and several cost recovery under a.litigation ensued.every circuit to decide the issue held that,after sara,prps were precluded generally from seeking joint and several cost recovery under a,and that any claim seeking to shift costs from one responsible party to another must be brought as a f claim for contribution these courts reasoned that a prp,by definition,shares in some of the responsibility for the contamination.therefore,any action by one prp against another to equitably apportion liability is a quintessential claim for contribution and it would be unfair to allow a prp to recover percent of the response costs from others similarly situated.bedford affiliates sills,cir.moreover,these courts reasoned that permitting a prp to elect recovery under a would render f meaningless,as a prp would readily abandon a f suit in favor of the substantially more generous provisions of a.id.we were among the courts to adopt this reasoning and held in akzo coatings,aigner,cir,that a claim by and between jointly and severally liable parties for an appropriate division of the payment one of them has been compelled to make sounds in contribution,and must be brought under f.
the innocent landowner exception 
cercla strict liability regime yields a great number of potentially liable individuals,in large part due to the practical reality that those truly responsible may not have the necessary money for the cleanup.for example,an absentee landowner may be liable under a for the full cost of remedying a hazardous site caused by its tenant,even if the landowner had no reason to know that hazardous waste was being stored on its land to blunt the force of a rule that limits the rights of these innocent parties to contribution under f,our case law has developed what is known as the innocent landowner exception.under the exception,which originated in akzo and was reaffirmed in rumpke of indiana,cummins engine,cir,a joint and several cost recovery action under section a remains available to landowners who allege that they did not pollute the site in any way.
in rumpke,the owner of a dump discovered,some six years after purchasing the site,that a cocktail of hazardous wastes had been deposited there regularly by a nearby recycling company.id.at.recognizing that it now owned a veritable environmental disaster,the dump owner commenced voluntary cleanup and brought an action for both cost recovery under a and for contribution under f against the company that had arranged the delivery of the toxins.reversing an entry of summary judgment for the defendants,we decided that the dump owner,who was strictly liable but who had not actually contributed to the hazardous conditions,could maintain a direct cost recovery claim under a.in doing so,we emphasized that the dump owner had not been the subject of either governmental or private compulsion to initiate cleanup.it undertook cleanup on its own and,maintaining that it shared no actual responsibility for the site,was not trying to divide up its own liability or apportion costs.therefore,we held that the claim was not one for contribution that had to be brought under f a full cost recovery action remained available to the dump owner under a 
cooper industries,aviall services.
recently,the supreme court had occasion to discuss the interplay between sections a and f,and decided a key issue concerning the timing of a f claim for contribution.in cooper industries,d,an owner and one time operator of several airplane maintenance sites had sold the properties to another company in the early.after operating the sites for a number of years,the buyer,aviall services,discovered that both it and the seller,cooper industries,had contaminated the facilities with hazardous substances that had leaked into the ground from storage containers.aviall notified texas authorities of the contamination,who in turn directed aviall to clean up the site.aviall then commenced cleanup and,after it had incurred some million in response costs,brought an action for contribution against cooper industries under cercla f.
the supreme court held that f did not authorize aviall suit for contribution.the court began by noting that the cost recovery remedy of a and the contribution remedy of f are clearly distinct.id.at.the court then examined the text of f,which provides that a claim for contribution may be brought during or following any civil action under section of this title or under section a of this title.f.as the court emphasized,aviall had not been the subject of any civil enforcement action,and its claim based on section f therefore was not during or following any civil action.id.on this basis,the court deemed aviall contribution action premature.
notably,the court did not rule out the availability of a a action,observing in dictum that f is not the exclusive cause of action for contribution available to a prp.cooper,at.the court refused to speculate,however,on the precise nature of the alternative remedy and decided only the question of aviall right to a f cause of action the limited holding of cooper industries is that a party first must have settled its liability with a government entity or been sued,either for costs under a or for compliance under,before it may look to other responsible parties for contribution under f.
we now must decide,in the wake of cooper industries,what rights of action,if any,are available to metropolitan water under cercla.it is clear,at the very least,that metropolitan water can not bring suit under f because it has not been the subject of an action for damages or compliance under cercla this conclusion,as the district court held,follows from a straightforward application of cooper industries 
metropolitan water and lockheed urge us to hold,as the district court did,that a right of action exists under a for private parties that,although potentially strictly liable for the costs of cleanup,have voluntary undertaken remediation and have no right to contribution under f.they invite our attention first to the statutory text of a,which they believe authorizes such a cause of action.the language in focus provides that four statutorily defined categories of parties shall be liable for the government remedial and removal costs,see a a,and for 
b any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person consistent with the national contingency plan 
id.a b.metropolitan water maintains that,under this provision plain wording,the only question is whether it is a person and whether it has incurred necessary costs of response.id.undoubtedly,as it points out,metropolitan water is a person within the meaning of cercla,which defines that term,inter alia,as a firm or corporation.id.moreover,metropolitan water,as its complaint alleges,has incurred costs of response by taking remedial action,to prevent or minimize the release of hazardous substances so that they do not migrate to cause substantial danger to present or future public health or welfare or the environment.id.thus,metropolitan water contends,a makes its cost recovery remedy available,in very straightforward language,to any person that has incurred necessary costs of response,including prps.
north american responds that a b does nothing more than spell out the potential liability of responsible parties and does not create an authorization to sue.although a b includes liability for the response costs of any other person,north american maintains that this language does not create a cause of action for any other person,particularly for prps such as metropolitan water.the epa agrees that metropolitan water has no cause of action under a,but interprets a b in a slightly different manner.unlike north american,the epa acknowledges that the subsection creates a cause of action for some private parties.the agency,however,disagrees with metropolitan water about who specifically is authorized to sue under the subsection.according to the epa,the word other in the phrase any other person distinguishes those who may sue for cleanup costs from the four classes of potentially responsible parties listed earlier in subsections through of section a thus,as the epa reasons,the phrase any other person refers to a class of individuals who by definition are not potentially responsible for cleanup costs.for parties like metropolitan water who are potentially liable for cleanup costs,the epa submits,their only cause of action lies in the contribution provisions of f,when available.
relevant supreme court precedent compels us to reject,at the very least,the view taken by north american that a does not create a cause of action at all.in key tronic united states,d,the supreme court stated that unquestionably provides a cause of action for private parties to seek recovery of cleanup costs.in that case,key tronic corporation,one of several parties responsible for contaminating a landfill,settled a lawsuit with the epa and then brought an action against the air force and several other parties responsible for the contamination.key tronic complaint asserted a contribution claim under f for recovery of part of its dollar commitment to the epa.additionally,key tronic advanced a claim under a b for the costs that it had incurred voluntarily before settling with the epa.
the supreme court accepted certiorari only to decide whether a authorized key tronic to recover its attorneys fees.although the court held ultimately that attorneys fees were unavailable,it also undertook a comprehensive discussion of the rights of action available under cercla.the court began with the premise that unquestionably provides a cause of action for private parties to seek recovery of cleanup costs.id.at.according to the court,this right of action was implied rather than express.as the court explained,by imposing liability on responsible parties for costs incurred by any other person,a b,a does not expressly prps may have a claim for contribution against those treated as joint tortfeasors.key tronic,at.the court noted additional support for this reading in the statute multiple references to an action under section a d.id.at.quoting f and citing id.a d.as for the interplay between sections a and f,the court observed that,after sara,the statute now expressly authorizes a cause of action for contribution in and impliedly authorizes a similar and somewhat overlapping remedy in.key tronic,at.
the court discussion in key tronic therefore dismisses any notion that a does not authorize at least some parties to sue.moreover,in cooper industries,the court reaffirmed key tronic recognition of a cost recovery remedy of a b that is clearly distinct from the contribution remedy in section f.cooper,at.
despite recognizing an implied cause of action under a,however,these cases appear to leave open the question we now face of whether a authorizes a cause of action by potentially liable parties in metropolitan water situation this precise question has been addressed by three federal courts of appeals in the aftermath of cooper industries in consolidated edison of new york,ugi utilities,cir,our colleagues on the second circuit held that parties such as metropolitan water may bring an action under a for response costs incurred voluntarily.shortly thereafter,the court of appeals for the eighth circuit adopted the reasoning set forth in consolidated edison.see atl.research united states,cir.however,most recently,a divided panel of the court of appeals for the third circuit held that the supreme court decision in cooper industries did not require it to revisit its prior holdings that a prp seeking to offset its cleanup costs must invoke contribution under.dupont de nemours united states,cir we review these decisions below.
turning first to the decision of the second circuit,consolidated edison sought reimbursement from the operator of one of its power plants for cleanup costs that consolidated edison had incurred in remedying hazardous waste contamination.consolidated edison complaint asserted claims under both a and f.the court held first that a f claim for contribution was unavailable under these circumstances because consolidated edison had not been sued under cercla or resolved cercla liability through settlement.
instead,the court held,consolidated edison was entitled to pursue its action under a.after reviewing the statutory scheme and the effect of the supreme court decision in cooper industries,the second circuit concluded that sections a and f each embod y a mechanism for cost recovery available to persons in different procedural circumstances.consol.edison,at.for parties that have not been sued or made to participate in an administrative proceeding,but that if sued,would be held liable under section a,the court held that a authorizes a suit to recover voluntary response costs.id.at.in this particular procedural circumstance,the court noted,a f claim for contribution is unavailable because,as cooper industries held,that claim would not arise during or following any civil action,cooper,at.quoting f.to preclude these parties also from recovering necessary response costs under a,the second circuit reasoned,would discourage voluntary cleanup and thereby undermine a key feature of cerlca.
like the second circuit,the eighth circuit in atlantic research was faced with the following question can one liable party recover costs advanced,beyond its equitable share,from another liable party in direct recovery,or by contribution,or as a matter of federal common law at.the court answered in the affirmative and,following the second circuit,held that it no longer makes sense to view as a liable party exclusive remedy.id.the eighth circuit further explained that t he supreme court had emphasized that and are distinct.id.at.accordingly,the court continued,it wa s no longer appropriate to view remedies exclusively through a prism,and it reject ed an approach which categorically deprive d a liable party of a remedy.id.like the second circuit,it found no such limitation in congress words.id 
the court of appeals for the third circuit,however,reached a conclusion different from that of the second and eighth circuits.in dupont,the owned property which was owned or operated by the united states at various times during world war i,world war ii,the korean war,during which time the united states was responsible for some contamination.dupont de nemours,at.the company had undertaken a voluntary cleanup of one of the sites,in the absence of a preexisting or action,and also in the absence of a f settlement,and later instituted a contribution action against the united states.the district court rejected the company claim,and the judgment was affirmed by the third circuit.in doing so,the third circu
