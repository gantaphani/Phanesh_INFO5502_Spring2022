this is the second appeal concerning the rights to groundwater contained in the santa maria valley groundwater basin basin.appellants land owner group parties log are a group of landowners,mostly farmers,who extract groundwater for agricultural use respondents are public water producers that pump groundwater for municipal and industrial use for their citizens and customers in the first appeal,city of santa maria adam th city of santa maria,we reversed and remanded the matter with instructions,directing the trial court to quiet title to appellants overlying rights to native groundwater by declaring that these rights have priority over all appropriators,less the amount that the respondents are entitled to pursuant to their prescriptive rights.we further directed the trial court to reconsider,if necessary,the prevailing party determination and allocation of costs.
the trial court amended its judgment by asserting that appellants overlying rights to the basin groundwater are prior and paramount to any existing or future appropriative rights to the basin groundwater,italics omitted but are subject to the prescriptive rights of respondents,as otherwise provided herein.italics omitted.the judgment held that the city of santa maria had established a total prescriptive right of acre feet per year and golden state water company had established a total prescriptive right of acre feet per year.these prescriptive rights,however,were perfected against the basin aquifer as a whole.therefore,only a proportionate amount of the prescriptive right could be exercised against appellants overlying rights.the trial court determined that it did not need to specifically quantify the proportionate prescriptive rights that could be attributable to appellants.the trial court also determined that it was not necessary to reconsider the prevailing party determination or allocation of costs.
on appeal,appellants insist that the trial court actions on remand were inadequate because quantification of the proportionate volume of the prescriptive loss that can be attributed to appellants is necessary in order to successfully quiet title.further,appellants claim that they were the prevailing parties and should have been entitled to costs we conclude that the trial court properly quieted title and did not err when it declined to reconsider the prevailing party determination.accordingly,we affirm the amended judgment and the order regarding prevailing parties.
background 
quiet title and this court remand 
the underlying litigation before the trial court encompassed multiple issues.one of the issues raised was whether appellants and the wineman parties could quiet title to their rights in the overlying groundwater.city of santa maria,supra,th at.the trial court initially held that it could not quiet title to the overlying rights,because appellants and the wineman parties had not attempted to show how much water they had pumped during the prescriptive period.ibid.
on appeal,we concluded that appellants and the wineman parties have title to the overlying land and respondents have prescriptive rights attached to a specified amount of the basin groundwater city of santa maria,supra,th at.further,we found that although appellants and the wineman parties had not submitted proof of the amount of water they had pumped during the prescriptive period,the trial court could still quiet title to their overlying rights.we held that w here there are no conflicting prescriptive rights,and sufficient safe yield to satisfy all parties,the trial court may simply declare the landowner overlying rights to be superior to those of the appropriators.id.at.appellants and the wineman parties had engaged in,which meant that they retained their overlying rights subject to the respondents prescriptive taking.id.at.we further determined that when the total amount of water covered by all of the rights of the parties exceeds the available supply consisting of the basin safe yield and any temporary surplus,overlying owners should be awarded the full amount of their overlying rights,less any amounts of such rights lost by prescription,from the part of the supply shown to constitute native ground water.ibid.
in our disposition,we remanded the matter to the trial court with instructions to modify the judgment as follows as to those appellants that pleaded quiet title causes of action,the court shall declare their overlying rights to native groundwater prior to the rights of all appropriators less the amount to which the city of santa maria and the golden state water company are entitled pursuant to their prescriptive rights and shall reconsider,if necessary,the prevailing party determination and allocation of costs.city of santa maria,supra,th at.
the proceedings on remand 
on remand,the parties submitted briefing on the issue of whether quieting title required the trial court to quantify the proportion of the prescriptive loss attributable to each parcel owned by appellants and the wineman parties.appellants and the wineman parties contended that quantification was necessary.respondents claimed that quantification was not necessary until there was a shortage.
after considering the parties arguments,the trial court agreed with respondents and found that quantification of the specific prescriptive loss was not required to quiet title.accordingly,the trial court amended its judgment to state subject to and limited by the adjustments for the amounts of native basin groundwater lost to the prior prescriptive rights of the city of santa maria and gswc as described in section a,each of the log and wineman parties that filed quiet title actions has quieted title to the overlying rights to the basin groundwater appurtenant to the properties listed as exhibit,which rights are prior and paramount to any existing or future appropriative rights to the basin groundwater.such overlying rights shall be subject to the prescriptive rights of the city of santa maria and gwc,as otherwise provided herein.judgment to quiet title to such overlying rights is hereby entered with respect to the real property listed as exhibit,with all other log and wineman party causes of action having been dismissed.italics omitted.
the prevailing party determination 
originally,respondents were found to be the prevailing parties.as part of our limited remand from the first appeal,we directed the trial court to reconsider,if necessary,the prevailing party determination and allocation of costs.appellants and the wineman parties filed briefs arguing that due to this court reversal,they were the prevailing parties on the quiet title cause of action and should therefore be entitled to costs.
respondents filed a joint brief arguing that they,not appellants or the wineman parties,were the prevailing parties notwithstanding this court remand.respondents argued that they prevailed by obtaining prescriptive rights to the basin groundwater,having the physical solution affirmed,and having their rights to return flows and salvaged water affirmed.
the trial court determined that it did not need to reevaluate the prevailing party determination,noting that the substantial issues in the underlying case involved the respondents claimed prescriptive rights of the water producers,the effects of the twitchell yield,the northern cities claims and various monitoring and management issues.further,the trial court noted that t he record available to this court did not suggest that there was ever any real contest over whether appellants had overlying rights the only real issue was proof of the quantity of the ground water rights for which there was a failure of proof.
discussion 
appellants argue that the trial court erred when it did not quantify the proportionate amount of the prescriptive loss that can be attributed to their parcels.they also argue that the amended judgment should be modified because as currently read the judgment can be misconstrued to give prescriptive rights a super priority over overlying rights.lastly,appellants claim that they prevailed on their cause of action for quiet title.therefore,appellants insist that they should be determined to be the prevailing party and be entitled to costs.as we explain below,we find no merit in any of appellants arguments.
quantification of prescriptive loss is not necessary to quiet title 
appellants claim that the amended judgment fails to quiet title,because it does not quantify the proportionate prescriptive loss that can be attributed to each of their parcels.we disagree,and find that the trial court judgment properly quieted title.
volume of the prescriptive loss is quantified in the amended judgment 
first,appellants claim quantification is necessary because prescriptive rights,unlike overlying rights,can be readily quantified.we agree with the appellants characterization of prescriptive rights.
overlying rights,which are based on ownership of the land,are determined by evaluating overlying rights holders present and prospective reasonable beneficial use upon the land.city of barstow mojave water agency cal th.overlying rights are also correlative they are mutual and reciprocal among other overlying users.tehachapi cummings county water dist.armstrong d.since overlying rights are correlative and based on reasonable beneficial use,these rights may change over time.prescriptive rights,on the other hand,are quantified by determining the volume of water pumped during the prescriptive period and are limited to that amount.city of los angeles city of san fernando cal d.in other words,prescriptive rights,unlike overlying rights,are fixed.
appellants claim that since prescriptive rights are fixed,the quiet title judgment can not stand because it fails to quantify these rights.appellants,however,misconstrue the amended judgment.the prescriptive rights proved by the respondents are quantified in the amended judgment,which declares that the city of santa maria established a total adverse appropriation of acre feet per year and golden state water company established a total adverse appropriation of acre feet per year.as set forth in the judgment,these specific prescriptive rights will not change over time.
quantifying specific prescriptive loss is not necessary to quiet title 
respondents prescriptive rights were perfected against the aquifer as a whole,not just against appellants overlying rights.therefore,the trial court determined that the prescriptive rights must be proportionately exercised against appellants overlying rights.appellants correctly assert that the amended judgment fails to specifically quantify the proportionate share of the prescriptive loss that can be attributable to each of them.appellants claim that absent a quantification of their proportionate prescriptive loss,title can not be quieted.we disagree.
in the first appeal,we noted that quantification of appellants and the wineman parties overlying rights was not necessary in order to quiet title,because there is no present need to allocate the native supply.city of santa maria,supra,th at.the fact that respondents obtained a prescriptive right has no practical effect until there is an overdraft.id.at.this is because a cquisition of a prescriptive right in groundwater rearranges water rights priorities among water users,elevating the right of the one acquiring it above that of an appropriator to a right equivalent in priority to that of a landowner.ibid.
when there is an overdraft or shortage,appellants,as overlying rights holders,would be awarded the full amount of their present and prospective beneficial use upon the land,less the amounts lost by prescription.city of santa maria,supra,th at.
at the time of trial,it was undisputed that the basin had enough water for all users,including appellants and all appropriators.city of santa maria,supra,th at.accordingly,there was no need to quantify overlying rights to apportion the basin water.we therefore concluded that appellants and the wineman parties were entitled to a quiet title judgment,despite the lack of evidence regarding the amount of water they had pumped during the prescriptive period.we held that title could be quieted by a declaration that appellants overlying rights to the basin groundwater were prior to all rights except for the prescriptive rights proved by respondents.id.at.
in other words,we held in city of santa maria that quieting title in times of surplus did not require quantification of the overlying right.as an extension of that same logic,we find that quantification of the specific prescriptive loss attributable to each overlying user is not necessary to quiet title.when the basin has a surplus of water,the quiet title judgment is not meant to specify the exact amount of water each user is entitled to,which would include the amount of the prescriptive rights that can be enforced against each overlying user.rather,the quiet title judgment is meant to clarify and confirm the priority of appellants overlying rights,specifying that these rights are superior to all appropriators rights less the prescriptive rights established by respondents.there is no need for a quiet title judgment clarifying the priority of water users to specifically quantify the users rights until there is a period of overdraft.
for example,in city of city of glendale cal d,our supreme court entered a judgment declaring that the plaintiff pueblo rights to certain water sources were superior to the rights asserted by the defendants.id.at.the defendants in city of argued that the trial court erred when it rejected the defendants offer of proof that the plaintiff could satisfy all of its water needs from another aqueduct.id.at.our supreme court found no error with the trial court decision to refuse admission of this evidence,noting that the evidence,if received for the purpose intended by defendants,would have required the court to determine the amount of water necessary,and the amount available,for the plaintiff present and future needs.it was not pertinent to the issues of an action to quiet title.in cuyamaca water superior court cal.this court said in the pending quiet title action it will not,of course,be determined that the city is or is not entitled to any particular quantity of water the subject matter of the action is the establishment of the priority of right,and not the quantity of water to be taken.citation.in the present actions the trial court was not called upon to determine the relative rights of the parties to any quantities of water or to peer into the future and detail in amounts the needs of the parties when the conceded present surplus might be exhausted and their demands then be brought into conflict.ibid.
here,the trial court modified the judgment on remand to declare that appellants overlying rights are superior to the rights of all appropriators,except for the prescriptive rights proved below.quantification of prescriptive loss was not required to effectuate the judgment quieting title,which was meant to set forth the priority of appellants rights.the amended judgment achieves this goal.no further quantification is necessary 
c.the quiet title judgment is not illusory 
appellants insist that failure to ascertain the proportionate volume of the prescriptive rights that can be asserted against them will impair their ability to protect and enforce their overlying rights,will harm their enjoyment of the property,and will create a cloud on their title effecting the marketability and value of their properties.further,they insist that the current judgment creates only an illusion of a quiet title judgment and that they should not be required to litigate the prescription issue in the future.
appellants cite to western aggregates,county of yuba th,where the third appellate district explained that a quiet action seeks to declare the rights of the parties in realty.a trial court should ordinarily resolve such dispute.this accords with the rule that a trial court should not dismiss a regular declaratory relief action when the plaintiff loses,but instead should issue a judgment setting forth the declaration of rights and thus ending the controversy.citations.the object of the action is to finally settle and determine,as between parties,all conflicting claims to the property in controversy,and to decree to each such interest or estate there
