this case involves a dispute over a bureau of reclamation project to build a canal to replace an unlined portion of the canal.the district court denied declaratory and injunctive relief.a motions panel of our court granted a temporary injunction halting work on the project pending appeal.after the initial oral argument and based on intervening legislation,the united states filed a motion to vacate the injunction and to remand the action to the district court with instructions that several of the claims be dismissed as moot.we held a second oral argument to consider the motion.
after consideration of the extensive briefing and arguments of the parties,we conclude that the environmental and other statutory claims are moot and that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the remaining claims.we vacate the injunction of the project pending appeal and remand the case to the district court with instructions to dismiss it.
colorado poet laureate thomas ferril described the west by saying here is the land where life is written in water.the legacy of the west is one of continual,and often bitter,controversies about water rights,both above and below the surface.in the west,whiskey is for drinking water is for fighting over,mark twain is said to have observed.our water dispute brings us to the border and the plans of the united states bureau of reclamation to prevent the canal from seeping upon which thousands of mexicans rely.
the canal is one of the world largest irrigation canals,carrying water from the colorado river to the imperial valley in california.the imperial valley lies between the mexican boundary and the salton sea,bounded on the east by sandhills and on the west by the foothills of the san diego mountains.the canal is the valley only source of water.
the canal replaced the alamo canal,which diverted water a short distance north of the mexican border,but transported water mostly through mexico before it the border into the imperial valley.in the,considerable sentiment arose to have a canal that was entirely contained within the boundaries of the united in furtherance of the notion of character noah cross slightly paraphrased,that either you bring the water to california,or you bring california to the water.in any event,the concept of an canal was born.
the canal system was authorized under the boulder canyon project act of december,stat,codified at.construction of the canal by the united states bureau of reclamation commenced in following the construction of the hoover dam,with the project reaching completion in.the design was aimed to have the water transported entirely within the united states.the new canal,as designed,flowed only in the united states.however,water often refuses to be confined by our artificial restraints.thus,although the canal surface water remained in the united states,its seepage did the mexicali aquifer and providing a reservoir of groundwater to the mexicali valley on the other side of the border.the mexicali aquifer underlies both the imperial valley in california and the mexicali valley in mexico.the complaint alleges that the roughly million people who live in the mexicali valley depend on the groundwater from the aquifer,which irrigates thousands of acres of farmland.
prior to,the aquifer was recharged by the colorado and alamo rivers.because it was unlined,the construction of the alamo canal did not impact the recharge of the aquifer.congress considered the idea of lining the canal,but ultimately decided on an earthen and porous design that did allow seven percent of the volume to seep into northern mexico.
seepage from the canal first caused widespread flooding in the mexicali valley until mechanisms were put in place to harness the water.the residents and businesses of the mexicali valley have since expended considerable resources to create an infrastructure of pumping facilities and conveyance equipment that deliver the water for drinking and irrigation.as a result,the complaint alleges that a large metropolitan community has developed in reliance on the water.
in,the united states and mexico entered into a treaty designed to govern the allocation of colorado river water between the two nations.see treaty between the united states of america mexico respecting utilization of waters of the colorado and tijuana rivers and of the rio grande treaty,stat,section iii.
the treaty came in the context of a developing set of domestic authorities designed to regulate the use of colorado river water known collectively as the law of the river.after the first world war,as congress began considering further ways to capture and regulate colorado river water,the states constituting the upper basin of the river colorado,utah,new mexico and wyoming grew concerned that states in the lower basin arizona,nevada and california would begin to claim appropriation rights to the water.see united states,cir.the colorado river compact of apportioned million acre feet of water annually to the lower basin states to forestall any disputes.see act of august,stat,reprinted in.the boulder canyon project act of canyon project act then apportioned that million acre feet among the lower basin states.see,at.to deliver the allocations called for in the act,the canyon project act authorized the construction of the canal.see.the apportionment between the lower basin states has also been the subject of a series of supreme court decisions and decrees,culminating in arizona california,d consolidated decree.
the treaty requires the united states to deliver million acre feet of colorado river water to mexico annually at designated diversion points on the international land boundary as specified in the treaty.the treaty also commits the united states to delivering an additional acre feet in any year in which there is a surplus of colorado river water in excess of the amount required to satisfy other obligations.the treaty then states that mexico shall acquire no right beyond that provided by this subparagraph by the use of the waters of the colorado river system,for any purpose whatsoever,in excess of the acre feet annually.treaty at.the treaty commits the united states to constructing the works necessary to deliver these waters to the diversion points.the treaty considered the canal to be one of the mechanisms for delivery.the treaty committed to the international boundary and water commission boundary commission the authority to resolve disputes arising under the treaty.id.at art,d.
in,the boundary commission issued minute addressing the problem of the salinity of the colorado river.see agreement confirming minute of the international boundary and water commission,and.the minute acknowledged that there was no existing agreement governing groundwater issues in the border area between the two nations.the agreement also stated that w ith the objective of avoiding future problems,the united states and mexico shall consult with each other prior to undertaking any new development of either the surface or the groundwater resources,or undertaking substantial modifications of present developments,in its own territory in the border area that might adversely affect the other country.id.
in,congress passed the san luis rey indian water rights settlement act settlement act which authorized the secretary of the interior secretary to select one of three options for recovering the seepage lost through the canal,stat.the choices included constructing a parallel lined canal,lining the existing canal,or constructing seepage recovery facilities such as a between the canal and the border.the secretary also considered a no action option.the settlement act explained that significant quantities of water currently delivered into the all american canal and its coachella branch are lost by seepage from the canals and that such losses could be reduced or eliminated by lining these canals.id.at.the conserved water was to be used to meet the growing needs of california consumers,as well as to settle water rights claims brought by several native american groups.id.at.the imperial irrigation district iid,with whom the secretary contracts to manage the canal,and the metropolitan water district of southern california mwd would deliver the additional water to consumers.id.at.
the secretary then undertook several environmental studies to consider the impact of the canal lining project lining project and issued a final environmental impact statement feis and record of decision rod in.the feis was noticed in the federal register at that time.after consideration of all the alternatives,the rod selected the parallel lined canal option and the bureau of reclamation approved the rod on july.
thereafter,the united states engaged in a diplomatic interchange with mexico and the mexican section of the boundary commission.there is some dispute as to the nature and extent of that exchange.the united states claims that it engaged in an extensive consultation progress mexico,as amicus,complains of cursory and insufficient consultation.
the lining project lay dormant,however,because the settlement act required that the project be paid for by entities benefitting from the conserved seepage and not by the united states.settlement act at.while the plan was dormant,the bureau of reclamation conducted a reexamination of the feis in,but determined that no new significant information changed the initial analysis and thus a supplemental environmental impact statement seis was not required.
by,the state of california was using over five million acre feet of colorado river water per year,acre feet above its million acre feet allotment under the terms of the canyon project act and consolidated decree.awareness of the size of this usage led to an intensive effort by the region water users to assist california in reducing its historical overuse of colorado river water.this effort led to a series of agreements in between the united states,the mwd,coachella valley water district,iid,san diego county water authority sdcwa,the la jolla,pala,pauma,rincon san pasqual bands of mission indians,the san luis rey river indian authority,and the city of escondido vista irrigation district the allocation agreement.the allocation agreement provided how the conserved seepage water would be allocated.one aspect of the agreement was that the state of california would pay for the lining project.
with the project back on track,the bureau of reclamation asked the united states fish and wildlife service fws to confirm as a biological opinion a conference opinion the fws had issued on february,regarding the lining project impact on the peirson milk vetch,a threatened plant species.fws so confirmed the opinion on september.
on july,this action was filed in the district of nevada seeking to enjoin the lining project.the plaintiffs consisted of consejo de desarrollo economico de mexicali,consejo,a mexican community group,and two american environmental groups environmental plaintiffs citizens united for resources and the environment cure and desert citizens against pollution desert citizen.the city of calexico,california,calexico later intervened as a plaintiff as to one count of the complaint.the parties stipulated to,and the district court approved,the intervention of multiple entities on the side of the defense,including the imperial irrigation district,the san diego county water authority,the central arizona water conservation district,the state of nevada,the southern nevada water authority,and the colorado river commission of nevada.the court also has been aided at various points in the proceedings by other interested parties and amici.
after the district court dismissed a number of counts in the original complaint,the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on february,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.the first four counts were brought by consejo,on behalf of a class of beneficial users of the mexicali aquifer and the canal on the mexican side of the border.count one alleged an unconstitutional deprivation of property without due process of law in violation of the class substantive and procedural rights.count two alleged a constitutional tort pursuant to bivens six unknown named agents of federal bureau of narcotics,d,based on the usurpation of water rights owned by the well owners and water users in the mexicali valley by the secretary and the commissioner of the bureau of reclamation.count three alleged that the application of water rights priorities in the present context is subject to the doctrines of equitable apportionment or equitable use,and that t he secretary and commissioner have an affirmative duty to configure and implement the canal project in a manner that results in the reasonable utilization of the water resources of the mexicali valley.count four alleged that the secretary and commissioner are estopped from operating the canal in any manner that would block the seepage that has recharged the mexicali aquifer for the preceding years.
all of the plaintiffs joined in count five,which alleged a violation of the national environmental policy act nepa and the administrative procedure act apa.in this count,the plaintiffs argued that the secretary and commissioner failed to prepare a seis despite the existence of significant new circumstances bearing on the proposed project.the plaintiffs argue that five new circumstances warrant preparation of a seis the discovery of the andrade mesa wetlands in mexico and its importance as a habitat for the endangered yuma clapper rail after preparation of the feis the anticipated transborder impacts from the water loss,which has been altered and exacerbated since the feis by demographic changes and the passage of nafta new reports suggesting possible unexplored impacts on the salton sea alterations in the project plan with regard to human safety mechanisms designed to prevent drowning and changes in the air quality condition of the effected region.the district court later granted plaintiff in intervention status to calexico as to this count.
the final three counts were brought by the environmental plaintiffs.count six alleged violations of the endangered species act.specifically,the amended complaint alleged that bureau of reclamation failed to reinitiate consultations with the fws as required despite new information about wetlands habitat and the species,the yuma clapper rail and the peirson milk came to light after the feis and biological opinions in existence had been issued.count seven alleged an unlawful taking of a listed migratory bird in violation of the migratory bird treaty act.count eight alleged violations of environmental requirements that were made a part of the settlement act.the amended complaint also alleged that no amount of damages would be sufficient and thus equitable relief was necessary.
subsequent to the filing of the complaint in this case,on november,the bureau of reclamation issued a biological analysis for the lining project regarding the potential species impact in the republic of mexico and transmitted it to the fws.the fws informed the bureau of reclamation by memorandum dated january,that,in its opinion,consultation with fws was not required by the esa when the impacts being considered take place in foreign territory.one day later,on january,the bureau of reclamation issued a supplemental information report sir which determined that no substantial changes,significant new information,or circumstances existed that would require the bureau of reclamation to issue a seis.
the plaintiffs moved for summary judgment as to count five nepa violations and cure moved for summary judgment as to count six endangered species act violations.the defendants opposed those motions and for summary judgment on those claims.the defendants also moved to dismiss counts and of the amended complaint for lack of standing,and contended in addition that claims five,seven and eight were time barred.
on june,the district court granted the motion to dismiss consejo with respect to counts and,but denied the motion to dismiss cure with respect to counts.the order also held that counts seven and eight were and that count five was with respect to any challenge to the feis,but not with respect to any challenge to the bureau of reclamation failure to produce a seis.
on july,the district court denied the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment as to count five and cure motion for summary judgment as to count six and granted the defendants on both those counts.judgment was entered on july.the plaintiffs filed timely appeals from the judgment.
the plaintiffs then filed a motion in the district court for an injunction pending appeal,which was denied.the plaintiffs filed a motion for an injunction pending appeal with this court,which was granted by a motions panel of the court.
after we heard oral argument on the merits of the appeal in december,congress enacted and the president signed into law the tax relief and health care act of,pub.law,stat.act.contained within the omnibus tax bill were sections directly affecting the lining project.in pertinent part,the act provided that 
a notwithstanding any other provision of law,upon the date of enactment of this act,the secretary shall,without delay,carry out the all american canal lining project identified as the preferred alternative in the record of decision for that project,dated july,and in the allocation agreement allocating water from the all american canal lining project,entered into as of october.
b subject to paragraph,if a state conducts a review or study of the implications of the all american canal lining project as carried out under subsection a,upon request from the governor of the state,the commissioner of reclamation shall cooperate with the state,to the extent practicable,in carrying out the review or study.
restriction of review or study conducted by a state under paragraph shall not delay the carrying out by the secretary of the all american canal lining project.
id.at.section of the act provides that 
the treaty between the united states of america and mexico relating to the utilization of waters of the colorado and tijuana rivers and of the rio grande,and supplementary protocol signed november,signed at washington february,stat.is the exclusive authority for identifying,considering,analyzing,or addressing impacts occurring outside the boundary of the united states of works constructed,acquired,or used within the territorial limits of the united states.
following the effective date of the act,the united states filed a motion to remand this case to the district court with instructions that counts five through eight of the amended complaint be dismissed as moot and for an order vacating the injunction pending appeal imposed by the motions panel.the plaintiffs vigorously opposed the motion,and we heard argument on the motion.
if legislation passing constitutional muster is enacted while a case is pending on appeal that makes it impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief,the appeal must be dismissed as moot.paulson city of san diego,cir.here,the government contends that enactment of the act renders the statutory environmental claims contained in counts of the amended complaint moot.in those counts,the environmental plaintiffs allege that the lining project can not proceed until the government complies with nepa,the endangered species act,the migratory bird treaty act,and the settlement act.
in examining the impact of the act on this case,we employ our usual methodology in statutory construction.as always,our starting point is the plain language of the statute.children hosp.health ctr.belshe,cir.w e examine not only the specific provision at issue,but also the structure of the statute as a whole,including its object and policy.id.if the plain meaning of the statute is unambiguous,that meaning is controlling and we need not examine legislative history as an aid to interpretation unless the legislative history clearly indicates that congress meant something other than what it said.carson harbor village,unocal,cir en banc.if the statutory language is ambiguous,we consult legislative history.united states daas,cir.
the government underscores the provisions of the act that direct the bureau of reclamation to proceed with the lining project without delay and notwithstanding any other provision of law.act,a.the government contends that the import of this language is to exempt the lining project from compliance with any other federal law.
assuming it uses constitutional means,congress may exempt specific projects from the requirements of environmental laws.see sierra club usfs,cir graham coalition thomas,cir graham red squirrel madigan,cir stop ass dole,cir noting that congress may moot a pending controversy by enacting new legislation.our first task in examining the statute is to determine whether congress intended that result.
the fact that the act used the phrase notwithstanding any other provision of law is not dispositive.united states novak,cir en banc.indeed,w e have repeatedly held that the phrase notwithstanding any other provision of law is not always construed literally.or.natural res.council thomas,cir.rather,when the phrase is used,we have determined its reach by taking into account the whole of the statutory context in which it appears.novak,at.in viewing the statutory context,we attempt to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute,rather than to emasculate an entire section,estate of reynolds martin,cir,mindful that t he cardinal principle of statutory construction is to save and not to destroy,id.
placing the notwithstanding language of the act in context,we are guided by the further statutory language that the lining project proceed without delay upon the enactment of this act.act a.if congress had intended for the lining project to proceed under the usual course of administrative proceedings,it would have been unnecessary for congress to act at all.the environmental challenges would have been resolved in due course.however,proceeding along the usual course of resolving environmental disputes would be inconsistent with the bureau of reclamation proceeding without delay upon the enactment of this act.the environmental plaintiffs allege in their complaint that the lining project violates various federal environmental statutes and can not proceed until the government complies with those strictures.thus,application of the cited statutes can not be reconciled with the language of the act.under those circumstances,when congress has directed immediate implementation notwithstanding any other provision of law,we have construed the legislation to exempt the affected project from the reach of environmental statutes which would delay implementation.graham red squirrel,at.that is not to say the agency may act lawlessly in completing the project.see or.natural res.council,at rejecting the idea that the phrase notwithstanding any other provision of law require d the agency to disregard all otherwise applicable laws,other than the environmental statutes at issue.rather,we have applied a common sense construction of the phrase to refer to those laws that would delay the commencement of a project in derogation of express congressional directive to proceed immediately or,in this case,without delay.
applying these principles to the case at hand,we must conclude as a matter of statutory construction that the act renders the challenges to commencement of the lining project based on nepa,the endangered species act,the migratory bird treaty act,and the settlement act contained in counts five through eight of the amended complaint moot.each of those claims,if relief were to be granted,would delay commencement of the lining project.congress has instructed otherwise,notwithstanding any other provision of law.therefore,we must construe the act as exempting the lining project from the identified statutory claims.if valid,the act thus exempts the bureau of reclamation from the challenges contained in counts of the amended complaint.
having determined the act statutory reach,we turn to the plaintiffs other objections to the application of the act to the instant case.the plaintiffs contend that the act violates the tenth amendment,invades the judiciary article iii powers,violates the equal protection clause,and deprives them of protected constitutional interests without due process of law none of these arguments is persuasive.
the plaintiffs argue that the act vio
