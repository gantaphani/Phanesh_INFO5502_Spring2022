this appeal follows the declaration by the respondent water replenishment district of southern california wrd of a water emergency in the central basin,a groundwater basin.under the terms of a judgment governing the central basin,a water emergency may be declared when the central basin resources risk degradation.the judgment empowers wrd to declare the water emergency.the judgment governed not only a declared water emergency but also provided a comprehensive framework for water use in the central basin.it imposed a physical solution,best described as an equitable remedy designed to alleviate overdrafts and the consequential depletion of water resources in a particular area,consistent with the constitutional mandate to prevent waste and unreasonable water use and to maximize the beneficial use of water,with recognition that it is a limited resource.citation.hillside memorial park mortuary golden state water th,fn.hillside.
notwithstanding the comprehensive nature of the judgment,this appeal concerns only the declared water emergency.in a petition for writ of mandate,appellant central basin municipal water district cbmwd challenged the declared water emergency on the ground that wrd did not comply with the requirements of the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources,et a broad environmental law applying to most public agencies decisions to approve projects that could adversely affect the environment.kostka et,practice under the california environmental quality act ed.cbmwd appeals from the order sustaining wrd demurrer to cbmwd petition for writ of mandate.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
cbmwd is a municipal water district,and wrd is a water replenishment district.both agencies powers are statutorily defined,et,et the second amended judgment the judgment governs the central basin.it affords wrd the power to declare a water emergency.the judgment also establishes the water rights of numerous entities with the right to extract water from the central basin referred to as pumpers.declaring a water emergency alters the portion of a pumper allocation of water that the pumper may carryover to another year,meaning the entity retains the right to that water longer than it otherwise would it also permits a longer period to replace a pumper of ground water,an extraction of an amount greater than the pumper annual allotment 
pursuant to the judgment,wrd is empowered to declare a water emergency if the following conditions are met without implementation of the water emergency provisions of this judgment,the water resources of the central basin risk degradation.the judgment imposes a limit of one year on a declared water emergency,though the term may be less than one year.the judgment reserves continuing jurisdiction to the court.
on november,wrd declared a water emergency,which by later resolution expired on june.on december,cbmwd challenged the declared water emergency in a petition for writ of mandate,contending that wrd was required to follow ceqa prior to declaring a water emergency.cbmwd argued that the declaration of a water emergency had environmental consequences because it increased the pumpers carryover rights and extended from one year to five years the period in which pumpers could replace water.cbmwd argued that wrd ignored the significant environmental impacts associated with substantially increased holding and pumping of groundwater resources allocated as drought carryover to central basin extractors and did not even bother to contemplate the impacts associated with the delayed replacement of ground water supplies over a year period as a result of the year replenishment.according to cbmwd,the consequences of the declared water emergency may result in significant environmental effects.
wrd demurrered,and the trial court sustained wrd demurrer to the petition,finding that cbmwd could not state a cause of action under ceqa.the court noted that the declaration of a water emergency had been approved in the judgment.the court concluded,wrd declaration was under authority granted by the judgment.the wrd although a public agency in most respects was not acting as such in this situation,but rather as an agent of the court.see california american water city of seaside th.therefore,the activity was approved by the court,not a public agency.the trial court explained the mechanism for challenging the court ruling or activities conducted pursuant to the judgment are provided for in the judgment.those matters are reviewed by the court with retained jurisdiction to oversee the judgment.groundwater usage authorized by and consistent with the governing judgment for the groundwater basin is exempt from ceqa because such area is reserved for resolution by the court or the watermaster.california american water city of seaside,supra,at pp.water rights adjudication,not ceqa,governs the environmental aspects of groundwater usage citations.this appeal followed.
while this case was pending,the parties have been litigating the propriety of the declared water emergency in another court the one with continuing jurisdiction over the case.in that case,the cities of cerritos,downey and signal hill,later joined by cbmwd,argued the declared water emergency was unjustified under the terms of the judgment.that court stayed all consequences of the declared water emergency 
discussion 
we conclude the trial court properly sustained wrd demurrer to cbmwd petition for writ of mandate because ceqa does not apply and even if it did,it would be trumped by the physical solution governing the central basin.we decline to consider cbmwd remaining arguments because they are not properly raised in this appeal.
ceqa is inapplicable 
one purpose of ceqa is to ensure public agencies regulating projects consider preventing environmental damage,subd.g.project means an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment,or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment.ceqa distinguishes between discretionary and ministerial projects,and applies only to the former.friends of westwood,city of los angeles d.for every discretionary project with a significant environmental effect,the public agency must prepare an environmental impact report eir.the eir is the primary means of establishing the legislature considered declaration that it is the policy of this state to take all action necessary to protect,rehabilitate,and enhance the environmental quality of the state.citation.the eir is therefore the heart of ceqa.citations.laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal d.
ceqa does not apply to ministerial actions actions in which the agency is not permitted to shape the process to address environmental concerns,subd.b.leach city of san diego d,explained the distinction between a ministerial and discretionary project to properly draw the line between discretionary and ministerial decisions in this context,we must ask why it makes sense to exempt the ministerial ones from the eir requirement.the answer is that for truly ministerial permits an eir is irrelevant.no matter what the eir might reveal about the terrible environmental consequences of going ahead with a given project the government agency would lack the power that is,the discretion to stop or modify it in any relevant way.the agency could not lawfully deny the permit nor condition it in any way which would mitigate the environmental damage in any significant way thus,to require the preparation of an eir would constitute a useless and indeed wasteful gesture.citation.
ceqa is inapplicable here for two separate reasons.first,the declaration of a water emergency by itself has no environmental impact and therefore is not a project within the meaning of ceqa.instead,it is a mere statement that the resources of the central basin risk degradation.instead of focusing on the actual declaration,cbmwd argues that other provisions of the judgment may trigger significant environmental effects,but that argument is irrelevant because the only role of wrd the public agency whose conduct cbmwd challenged was to declare the water emergency.second,wrd had no discr
