as mark twain is said to have observed whiskey is for drinking water is for fighting over.california and water are inextricably linked in a battle royal waged over distribution of this precious resource among competing interests.no other resource is as vital to california cities,agriculture,industry,and environment as this liquid gold.predictably,no other resource generates such heated controversy as this commodity sometimes referred to as the oil of the century.
here,real parties in interest imperial irrigation district imperial and san diego county water authority san diego sought to enter into an agreement to transfer acre feet of water per year afy from imperial to san diego.ultimately,the parties agreed to transfer afy and conserve afy for possible future acquisition by the metropolitan water district of southern california metropolitan and coachella valley water district coachella.
real party in interest state water resources control board board approved the transfer.petitioner county of imperial county filed two separate mandamus petitions challenging various aspects of the board decision under the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et.the first petition named the board as respondent and imperial and san diego as real parties in interest.the second petition named imperial as respondent and san diego as real party in interest.neither petition named metropolitan or coachella.
imperial demurred,arguing the county failed to name metropolitan or coachella,which were necessary parties in both proceedings.the trial court sustained the demurrers with leave to amend.subsequently,the county amended the petitions,naming metropolitan and coachella as interested parties.metropolitan,coachella,and san diego filed joint demurrers,arguing metropolitan and coachella could not be added after the statute of limitations ran.the trial court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend,finding metropolitan and coachella valley indispensable parties and finding the statute of limitations had run.
the county filed a petition for writ of mandate.we issued an alternative writ the county argues the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing the action after finding metropolitan and coachella indispensable parties.we find no abuse of trial court discretion and shall affirm the trial court judgment sustaining the demurrers without leave to amend.
factual and procedural background 
the county petitions for relief from orders in two separate,but connected,cases.in county of imperial state water resources control board,sacramento county superior court case,the county challenges the board approved permit application for a transfer of water from imperial to san diego.in county of imperial imperial irrigation district,sacramento county superior court case,the county posited various ceqa challenges to the underlying agreement between the transferring parties.
although this litigation concerns numerous entities and has spawned a voluminous record,at its essence the petition rests upon the trial court determination that metropolitan and coachella represented indispensable parties in case and case.with this limited procedural question in mind,we review the factual and procedural background.
imperial and colorado river water 
imperial is the largest single holder of water rights on the colorado river in california.in california initiated the water rights permitting system currently administered by the board.imperial was formed in to bring colorado river water to california imperial valley.each year,imperial provides enough water to irrigate acres in the imperial valley.imperial also delivers water to cities,schools,and businesses.imperial irr.dist.cir.
metropolitan and coachella also possess water rights on the colorado river under an agreement among all california water rights holders known as the seven party agreement of seven party agreement.the seven party agreement placed water rights holders in a priority system.most of imperial water rights under this system take priority over most of coachella and over all of metropolitan.based on its place in the priority system,imperial is entitled to divert its full right to water before metropolitan can divert any water at all.san diego possesses no colorado river water rights.
this priority system led to a conflict among imperial,san diego,metropolitan,and coachella.imperial and san diego contend imperial may reduce its water use and designate another recipient to receive its unused water.in essence,imperial may transfer excess water.coachella and metropolitan disagree and argue that under federal law,any water unused by imperial is available to them under the priority system.
in the,the board found some of imperial water use practices unreasonable and wasteful.the board directed imperial to increase water conservation.one suggested measure by which imperial could increase conservation was to transfer conserved water to a willing purchaser in exchange for funding to support imperial conservation efforts.
imperial and san diego petition to the board 
in imperial and san diego executed an agreement under which san diego would fund water conservation measures within imperial service area in exchange for imperial transfer of up to afy to san diego transfer agreement.imperial and san diego jointly petitioned the board to approve changes in the point of diversion and place of use in imperial water rights permit to allow an annual transfer on a basis of up to afy of colorado river water from imperial to san diego for up to years.the petition noted the agreement was ineffective until completion of environmental review,when the agencies would determine whether to go forward with the project.
the legislature provides for board approval of transfers of water between water districts.water code section states the board may consider a petition for a transfer of water or water rights involving a change of point of diversion,place of use,or purpose of use.a transfer shall be for any period in excess of one year.
a request for approval of a water transfer must be filed by the holder of the water right,permit,or license,tit.a request for a change in point of diversion,place of use,or purpose of use must be filed by the rights holder.
water code section provides that the board may approve a petition for transfer the board,after providing notice and opportunity for a hearing,including,but not limited to,written notice to,and an opportunity for review and recommendation by,the department of fish and game,may approve such a petition for a transfer where the change would not result in a substantial injury to any legal user of water and would not unreasonably affect fish,wildlife,or other instream beneficial uses.
the county protested the petition for approval of the transfer.the county argued the transfer would lead to detrimental effects on the county economy and environment.the county emphasized the impacts caused by the transfer effects on the salton sea and the potentially severe air quality impacts associated with fallowing land and drying out the salton sea.
metropolitan and coachella protest the transfer 
metropolitan and coachella protested the transfer petition,contending the transfer violated their priority rights under the seven party agreement and the board lacked jurisdiction because federal law preempted state regulation of colorado river transfers.metropolitan and coachella indicated their objections could be resolved as part of a broader resolution of colorado river issues.
quantification settlement agreement 
while the transfer petition was pending,negotiations began to reduce and redistribute california use of colorado river water in accordance with guidelines adopted by the secretary of the interior.these guidelines were designed to reduce california colorado river water usage from million afy to million afy,in accordance with rules established by the supreme court in arizona california,d.
the quantification settlement agreement qsa negotiations involved discussions among colorado river water agencies,federal and state officials,and stakeholders to resolve disputes about quantification of colorado river water rights.the disputes included reasonable and beneficial use of river water,transfers and exchanges between water users,federal delivery of surplus water to california,and various environmental and socioeconomic impacts to the county from implementation of the proposed qsas.
the transfer of water from agricultural to urban uses formed a key element of the plan.the transfer between imperial and san diego was the largest such transfer.these negotiations over the reduction of california use of colorado river water led to the negotiation of the qsa and the individual qsas.
the protest dismissal agreement 
to resolve coachella and metropolitan objections to the transfer agreement,imperial,san diego,coachella,and metropolitan entered into the protest dismissal agreement pda.
the pda amended the transfer petition to reduce the water transfer to san diego from afy to afy,and to make the afy difference available for acquisition by metropolitan and coachella.drafts of the agreements for these transfers,along with a draft of the qsa,were submitted as exhibits in the board proceeding.
the board sent out a public notice that it would now consider approving not only the proposed water transfer from imperial to san diego,but also the proposed transfers from imperial to coachella and metropolitan.the board notice stated that despite the parties not using the word transfer for the water going to coachella and metropolitan,the board considered approval of an acquisition to be approval of a transfer.the board served a copy of the notice on the county 
metropolitan and coachella agreed to withdraw their protests and allow the board to hear and approve the transfer project,including the acquisition of water by coachella metropolitan the parties agreed that any decision by the board on the transfer project would be nonprecedential,and san diego would not use the board decision to argue in another proceeding that board approval was required to make water available to coachella or metropolitan.mindful of federal preemption issues,all parties also agreed to urge the board to include a statement that its decision shall not establish the applicability or nonapplicability of california law or federal law to any of the matters raised by the petition or any other colorado river transfer or acquisition.
in comments before the board at the time of the protest dismissal,metropolitan argued the board would not be considering approval of any action by metropolitan or coachella metropolitan reminds the state board that no party is seeking approval of a transfer with respect to the possible conservation and acquisition by metropolitan of up to acre feet of water from imperial.
subsequent proceedings 
after withdrawing their protests before the board,metropolitan and coachella ceased participating in the board proceeding.neither party submitted any briefing or exhibits,nor did either party participate in the board public hearing.
while the board proceeding was pending,imperial,as lead agency,prepared the draft and final environmental impact reports deir and feir,respectively for the water transfer from imperial to san diego.imperial certified and submitted the deir and feir.part of the deir project description includes the transfer of water by imperial to san diego,coachella,and metropolitan.
in an order adopted in october and amended in december,the board approved imperial and san diego transfer petition.as requested by imperial,the orders expressly clarified that the water districts were still to make the final decisions regarding all water transfers or acquisitions.the board filed its notice of determination for approval of imperial and san diego transfer petition.the board relied on imperial transfer project feir.
however,on december,imperial board of directors declined to approve the proposed qsa or adopt the transfer project.subsequently,the board approved the qsa,but with conditions unacceptable to metropolitan and coachella.the agencies failed to meet the department of interior deadline for qsa approval.in january none of the proposed agreements,including the proposed agreements by which metropolitan and coachella would acquire water from imperial,were finalized.
on january,the county filed its mandamus petition in case,naming the board as respondent and imperial and san diego as real parties in interest.the petition challenged the board order approving the transfer.the county did not name metropolitan or coachella.because of the absence of any final approval of the underlying transfer project,and by agreement of the parties,case was stayed.
on october,imperial approved the transfer project.on october,imperial,metropolitan,and coachella signed the qsa and finalized the agreements.
on november,the county filed case,challenging the transfer between imperial and san diego.between january and april,case and case were coordinated.the county filed first amended petitions in both cases.imperial filed demurrers in both cases,arguing the county failed to name as necessary parties metropolitan and coachella.
the trial court sustained imperial demurrers in both cases on indispensable party grounds and granted leave to amend.accordingly,the county amended its petitions,naming metropolitan and coachella as interested parties consistent with the court order but stating it did not consider either entity a real party in interest.
metropolitan,coachella,and san diego filed joint demurrers to the county second amended petitions,arguing metropolitan and coachella could not be added after the statute of limitations had run.the county opposed the demurrers,arguing neither metropolitan nor coachella was indispensable in either case.in reply,metropolitan and coachella argued they were indispensable parties.
at oral argument,the county argued metropolitan and coachella were not indispensable parties metropolitan and coachella responded that they had received an approval from the board and were therefore indispensable.imperial also urged that the two water districts were indispensable parties as recipients of a water transfer approved by the board.
the trial court found metropolitan and coachella indispensable parties in case and case.the court based its ruling on public resources code section and code of civil procedure section the court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend in both cases.
according to the trial court,the county failed to timely name metropolitan and coachella in its petitions.the unnamed parties were recipients of an approval under section,requiring them to be named in the county petition.in determining whether metropolitan and coachella qualified as indispensable parties,the court found metropolitan and coachella had interests divergent from those of the named parties that might be impaired by the underlying litigation.in addition,the court reasoned the county could protect its interests in the coordinated proceedings.the court concluded the county failed to add as indispensable parties metropolitan and coachella within the limitations period and sustained the demurrers without leave to amend.the county filed a timely petition for writ of mandate in this court

standard of review 
the county challenges the trial court order sustaining metropolitan,coachella,and san diego demurrers without leave to amend.we review the indispensable party question under code of civil procedure section for an abuse of discretion.deltakeeper oakdale irrigation dist.th,d deltakeeper.we review de novo the interpretation of a statute.hill city of clovis th,d.
necessary and indispensable parties 
code of civil procedure section governs the joinder of parties and provides,in pertinent part a a person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action shall be joined as a party in the action if in his absence complete relief can not be accorded among those already parties or he claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in his absence may i as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest or ii leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double,multiple,or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of his claimed interest.if he has not been so joined,the court shall order that he be made a party.
b if a person as described in paragraph or of subdivision a can not be made a party,the court shall determine whether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed among the parties before it,or should be dismissed without prejudice,the absent person being thus regarded as indispensable.the factors to be considered by the court include to what extent a judgment rendered in the person absence might be prejudicial to him or those already parties the extent to which,by protective provisions in the judgment,by the shaping of relief,or other measures,the prejudice can be lessened or avoided whether a judgment rendered in the person absence will be adequate whether the plaintiff or will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.
subdivision a of section defines the persons who ought to be joined if possible,often referred to as necessary parties.a determination that a party is a necessary party is the predicate for the determination of whether the party is indispensable.thus,subdivision b sets forth the factors the court should consider in determining whether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed among the parties before it,or should be dismissed without prejudice,the absent person being thus regarded as indispensable.
a court must consider fairness and equity in deciding whether a party is indispensable.a court has the power to proceed with a case even if indispensable parties are not joined.courts must be careful to avoid converting a discretionary power or rule of fairness into an arbitrary and burdensome requirement that may thwart rather than further justice.people ex rel.lungren community redevelopment agency th,d.in the ceqa context,t he public has a right to insist on the adequacy of the environmental document upon which the agency makes its decision,and courts should avoid thwarting this purpose through the harsh application of indispensable party rules.deltakeeper,supra,th at,d.
deltakeeper 
the county asserts the facts before us harken back to our previous decision in deltakeeper.real parties in interest distinguish deltakeeper.the trial court found deltakeeper had been legislatively disapproved and was no longer controlling.given the cacophony over our previous decision,we examine deltakeeper in some detail.
in deltakeeper,named defendants,three irrigation districts oakdale,south san joaquin,and stockton east entered into a joint district water purchase agreement agreement together with the city of stockton city and three water districts lincoln village,colonial heights,and central san joaquin for the sale of water by oakdale and south san joaquin to the other parties to the agreement.as the lead agencies,oakdale and south san joaquin prepared an environmental impact report eir for the project.deltakeeper,supra,th at,d.
plaintiffs,a group of environmental and recreational groups,challenged the eir by a petition for writ of mandate against oakdale,south san joaquin,and stockton east.the trial court dismissed the petition for failure to join city,lincoln village,and colonial heights as indispensable parties.we reversed.deltakeeper,supra,th at,d.
the agreement states that the water districts seek to transfer water to city and three irrigation districts.the purchasers are required to pay for the water whether or not they use it.the obligation of the water districts to deliver water,and the concomitant obligation of the purchasers to pay for water,is conditioned upon the adoption of an eir.deltakeeper,supra,th at,d.
under the agreement,city and two irrigation districts designate stockton east to carry out their obligations,including paying for,receiving,treating,transporting,and distributing the water.however,each party is obligated to defend its own interests in litigation or regulatory action,including ceqa compliance,involving the agreement.deltakeeper,supra,th at,d.
in addition to this litigation clause,city,lincoln village,colonial heights,and stockton east entered into a separate agreement the stockton agreement that provides for the joint control of litigation.under the stockton agreement,stockton east will make litigation decisions after conferring with the other parties.the stockton agreement binds stockton east to a collective litigation decision arrived at by a vote by all parties.deltakeeper,supra,th at,d.
plaintiffs brought a writ of mandate action naming oakdale and south san joaquin as respondents and stockton east as real party in interest and challenging the adequacy of the eir.the trial court granted the defendants motion to dismiss for failure to join city,lincoln village,and colonial heights as necessary and indispensable parties within the limitations period.deltakeeper,supra,th at,d.
on appeal,we considered whether city,lincoln village,and colonial heights were necessary parties under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.we found there was no risk of partial relief to the named parties in the absence of the unnamed parties.resolution of the adequacy of the eir would provide the named parties with complete relief.deltakeeper,supra,th at,d.we noted the central issue was the adequacy of the eir and found plaintiffs timely named as defendants three parties to the agreement,all of whom have a strong interest in upholding the eir so as to obtain the benefits of the agreement.a party ability to protect its interest is not impaired or impeded as a practical matter where a joined party has the same interest in the litigation.id.at,d.
we also noted that under the separate stockton agreement,city,lincoln village,and colonial heights had a vote in control of the litigation,bestowing on them the right to participate in and control the ceqa litigation.in addition,the nonjoined parties did not dispute that their interests in the ceqa litigation could be adequately represented by the defendants.deltakeeper,supra,th at,d.
the unnamed parties claimed they were materially interested in the litigation because of the practical effect the ceqa litigation would have on them as parties to the water transfer agreement.we agreed,finding the unnamed parties had a contractual interest that would be injuriously affected by a judgment declaring the eir to be inadequate.we proceeded on the assumption that the unnamed parties were necessary parties.deltakeeper,supra,th at,d.
we then considered whether the unnamed parties were indispensable parties under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b.as to what extent a judgment rendered in the parties absence might be prejudicial,we found the nonjoined parties had interests in the litigation,but those interests were adequately protected by the named parties to the action.deltakeeper,supra,th at,d.
in assessing whether there were measures by which prejudice could be lessened or avoided,we considered what contribution the nonjoined parties could make to the proceeding before the trial court.we found a proceeding to challenge an eir is unlike a trial of a typical contract action in which a party may present evidence favorable to its position.at an eir hearing,the parties are limited to the issue of whether substantial evidence supports the lead agency determination that the eir is adequate.no new evidence may be presented.this limited any participation by the unnamed parties,since their arguments regarding the sufficiency of the evidence necessarily would be based on the same evidence addressed by the joined parties.deltakeeper,supra,th at,d.
as to whether the judgment rendered would be adequate,we determined that any judgment rendered would adequately adjudicate the rights of the parties before the court.the only question before the trial court was whether the eir was adequate.deltakeeper,supra,th at,d.
finally,we found the plaintiffs would have no adequate remedy if the trial court dismissed the action,since they would have no recourse as the statute of limitations had run for joining more parties.deltakeeper,supra,th at,d.we considered the underlying policy of the ceqa legislation to inform both decision makers and the public of the environmental consequences of a proposed project.we concluded that were we to find city,lincoln village,and colonial heights to be indispensable parties,the adequacy of the eir would escape judicial scrutiny.ultimately,s uch a harsh result is unnecessary where other parties have a unity of interest in the ceqa litigation.deltakeeper,at,d.we determined we could not,in equity and good conscience,find the action should be dismissed.ibid.
shortly after we decided deltakeeper,the legislature enacted section,which requires approval recipients to be named in ceqa litigation and states,in its entirety 
a the petitioner or plaintiff shall name,as a real party in interest,any recipient of an approval that is the subject of an action or proceeding brought pursuant to section,or,and shall serve the petition or complaint on that real party in interest,by personal service,mail facsimile,or any other method permitted by law,not later than business days following service of the petition or complaint on the public agency.
b the public agency shall provide the petitioner or plaintiff,not later than business days following service of the petition or complaint on the public agency,with a list of responsible agencies and any public agency having jurisdiction over a natural resource affected by the project.
c the petitioner or plaintiff shall provide the responsible agencies,and any public agency having jurisdiction over a natural resource affected by the project,with notice of the action or proceeding within days of receipt of the list described in subdivision b.
d failure to name potential parties,other than those real parties in interest described in subdivision a,is not grounds for dismissal pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure.
e nothing in this section is intended to affect an existing right of a party to intervene in the action.italics added.
the trial court decision 
the trial court considered deltakeeper and determined that,although the situation was similar,the case was no longer controlling after the adoption of section in.rather,t he legislative history and intent indicates a reaction against deltakeeper and a desire to strengthen the indispensability rule by requiring that water transfer recipients be involved in proceedings contesting the transfer.
noting that water will flow to metropolitan and coachella only under imperial contracts with the entities,the court found the board decision placed metropolitan and coachella within the class of transferees that the legislature sought to protect as recipients of approval in section,subdivision a.
public resources code section does not indicate the consequences of a failure to name recipients of approval.nonetheless,the court concluded dismissal was possible if the unnamed parties were found to be indispensable under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b.applying section,subdivision b,the court found a judgment against the board would have detrimental consequences for the absent entities because they would potentially lose afy intended for them.this afy would serve at least households.in addition,metropolitan and coachella could face the secondary impact of colorado river diversions if annulment of the board decision led to the unraveling of the qsa approach to bringing california within its colorado river compliance.
according to the court,the named parties did not have the same interests as the unnamed parties.the court explained its position by simply laying out the differing functions of the players imperial is an agricultural water supplier san diego is an urban water retailer.in contrast,metropolitan is an urban water wholesaler and coachella is an agricultural water user.
finally,the court noted that the case management plan in the coordinated proceeding permitted all parties to brief all issues.thus,the county entities would have the ability to assert their interests in the coordinated proceeding.after weighing the code of civil procedure section,subdivision b criteria,the court concluded that dismissal of the county petition was appropriate.
deltakeeper and section 
the parties express passionate and disparate views about the trial court assessment of the continued viability of deltakeeper in light of section.their arguments obscure the holding of deltakeeper,which simply requires recipients of approval to be named,thereby making them necessary parties as a matter of law,but leaves to the trial court the task of determining whether the recipient is an indispensable party.
in deltakeeper,we first found the unnamed parties to be necessary and then performed the analysis under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b to determine whether they were indispensable,requiring dismissal of the action.in both cases the outcome rested on an application of the factors enumerated in section,subdivision b to the facts in each case.
therefore,we begin by considering whether,under public resources code section,coachella and metropolitan were recipients of approval.if we find the unnamed parties received approvals,we then consider whether under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b metropolitan and coachella qualify as indispensable parties,requiring dismissal of the action.
this approach differs from the position taken by coachella,which argues that section mandates dismissal.coachella insists that b ecause the legislative history refers to the persons in section a as indispensable parties,the legislature already has done the equitable balancing that otherwise might be done by a court under code of civil procedure section,and has made a blanket determination that the failure to name recipients of an approval requires dismissal.
in addition,coachella argues that the structure and purpose of public resources code section supports mandatory dismissal.section,subdivision d provides that failure to name potential parties,other than those described in subdivision a,is not grounds for dismissal pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure.therefore,coachella reasons,failure to name parties described in section,subdivision a,that are recipients of approval is grounds for dismissal.
finally,coachella contends one of the purposes of the statute was to streamline the adjudication of ceqa cases.as coachella reasons streamlining suggests replacing equitable balancing on a basis with a simple and general joinder rule,recipients of an approval must be named under subdivision a or the case will be dismissed under subdivision d.
we are not persuaded.coachella fails to provide a citation to the legislative history on which it purports to rely.in any event,the purported legislative history does not lead us to conclude that the legislature has already performed the equitable balancing required under code of civil procedure section and determined that dismissal is always mandated when a recipient of an approval is not named.
nor does the language of public resources code section,subdivision d forestall the application of code of civil procedure section.section,subdivision d states that failure to name potential parties,except recipients of approval,is not grounds for dismissal pursuant to section.it does not state,or imply,that failure to name recipients of approval mandates dismissal.instead,section,subdivision d applies only to parties that do not qualify as recipients of approval under section,subdivision a.subdivision d of section excludes these nonrecipients from dismissal under section.subdivision d of section is silent as to the applicability of section to recipients of approval.
therefore,code of civil procedure section,subdivision b is invoked when a recipient of approval is not named the factors enumerated in the subdivision must then be weighed to determine whether dismissal is warranted.finally,the mere mention of streamlining as a goal does not lead to the conclusion that public resources code section,subdivision d creates a joinder rule,automatically dispensing with section,subdivision b.
recipients of approval 
in finding that metropolitan and coachella were within the class of transferees that the legislature was seeking to protect as recipients of approval in section a,the trial court understood that the two districts had not sought the board approval for the water transfer.indeed,metropolitan and coachella had opposed imperial petition to transfer water to san diego.they retracted their opposition following execution of the pda under which afy was made available for their acquisition.however,the districts insisted that board approval was unnecessary for imperial to reserve afy for a later transfer to them and thereafter withdrew from the proceeding.nonetheless,the court noted that under the board action,imperial permit was modified to expand the place of use to include the metropolitan and coachella service areas,and this water will flow to these areas only under the imperial contracts with these entities.
much of the county disagreement with the trial court interpretation stems from coachella and metropolitan prior assertion that no board approval was required.according to the county,o nly by egregiously reversing position during respondent court proceedings,and abrogating their contractual duty to deny that metropolitan and coachella were approval recipients,did the water district sic induce respondent court conclusion that coachella and metropolitan had received approvals.
however,any analysis of whether a party is a recipient of an approval under the statute rests not with the party or litigation arguments,but with the words of the statute itself.regardless of coachella and metropolitan federal preemption arguments that led them to dispute the necessity of board approval for the transfer,we look to their status in the underlying transaction,focusing on the board order and the statute language regarding approval recipients as applied within the larger statutory scheme regulating water transfers.
the county takes the position that neither metropolitan nor coachella qualify as recipients of approval under the statute language.according to the county,an approval necessarily authorizes its recipient to do something.the board order only authorizes the imperial and san diego transfer it stops short of approving any similar transfer to metropolitan and coachella.instead,it gives imperial permission to engage in water conservation from which the water districts could potentially benefit.the county concludes while the order clearly does approve the proposed diego transfer,and also approves imperial ability to conserve and make available water,the order stops short of approving any similar transfer to metropolitan and coachella.instead,it gives imperial,and imperial alone,a permissive approval to make changes under imperial permit.citation.the purpose of that change obviously was to allow imperial,if it chose,to enter into water acquisition deals citation,but nowhere does the board order purport to actually approve those deals,to give metropolitan and coachella any approval for steps they might take to prepare for entering those deals,or to compel imperial to provide metropolitan or coachella with any water.the content of the order thus was directed at imperial and san diego alone.
the county argument misconstrues the law surrounding water transfers.water code sections through govern board approvals of water transfers.water code section authorizes the board,after notice and an opportunity to be heard,to approve a petition for a transfer of water after certain conditions are met.here,the diego petition for a transfer was specifically amended to transfer afy to coachella metropolitan instead of san diego.this was the petition approved by the board.
as imperial points out,this was the entirety of approval the board could give.there was no further board approval needed under state law to effectuate the transfers to metropolitan and coachella.only through board approval can any of the transferees receive water under imperial state water right permit and priority.under the transfer statutes,water code sections through,imperial could and did petition for a change as to the point of diversion,place of use,and purpose of use to effectuate the transfer to san diego,metropolitan,and coachella.without this board approval,the other water districts would not be authorized users of water under imperial water right permit.
the board order authorizes a new point of diversion,for san diego and metropolitan,and expands authorized places and purposes of use to include the areas and uses of san diego,coachella,and metropolitan.the board order states it is being asked to approve changes that would authorize a transfer of water to coachella and metropolitan under imperial permit.the board also determined that delivery of imperial conserved water to coachella and metropolitan was a transfer.
the board order unambiguously approves the future transfer of afy of water to metropolitan and coachella.therefore,we agree with the trial court assessment that metropolitan and coachella are recipients of approval under section.
the county also labels metropolitan and coachella change in position regarding the board authority to approve the transaction a stunning reversal meriting estoppel.according to the county,metropolitan and coachella stated they would not request board approval or argue that approval was necessary for the transfer.they induced the county to rely on this representation and then promptly reversed course,arguing they had indeed received approvals.this,the county argues,is a case for judicial estoppel.
courts apply judicial estoppel when the same party has taken two positions the positions were taken in judicial or administrative proceedings the party was successful in asserting the first position the two positions are completely inconsistent and the first position was not taken as a result of ignorance,fraud,or mistake.hanna los angeles county sheriff th,d.
although metropolitan and coachella disputed the need for board approval of the transfer,neither party made any representations concerning the applicability of section.neither did either party state that the board order did not constitute an approval of the transfers under imperial permit.we find no prior inconsistent statement inducing reliance giving rise to a judicial estoppel.
indispensable parties 
since we find metropolitan and coachella are recipients of approval,we must next determine whether the trial court correctly concluded they were also indispensable parties under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b in determining whether a party is indispensable,we consider the four factors listed in the statute.the standard of review of a trial court determination pursuant to section,subdivision b is abuse of discretion.the subdivision b factors are not arranged in a hierarchical order,and no factor is determinative or necessarily more important than another.county of san joaquin state water resources control bd.th,d county of san joaquin.
accordingly,we review for an abuse of discretion the trial court determination that coachella and metropolitan are indispensable parties.the county,at least implicitly,acknowledges that the trial court evaluated the code of civil procedure section,subdivision b factors.however,the county,in its petition,asks us to reweigh these discretionary factors to reach a contrary result.
the county analyzes each factor to present a scenario in which the discretionary factors could be balanced to permit its petition to proceed,but the county has failed to demonstrate why these factors must be balanced in this manner.in other words,our review of the county petition reveals it fails to show the trial court abused its discretion in interpreting the factors under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b to find the petition could not proceed absent coachella and metropolitan.we address the relevant factors.
prejudicial judgment 
we first consider to what extent a judgment rendered in the person absence might be prejudicial to him or those already parties.code civ,subd.b,factor.the trial court found a judgment against imperial would prejudice metropolitan and coachella because they would po
