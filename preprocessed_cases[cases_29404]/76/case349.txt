after defendant pajaro valley water management agency enacted ordinance that increased groundwater augmentation charges for the operation of wells within defendant jurisdiction,plaintiff harold griffith challenged the ordinance on the grounds that the increase was procedurally flawed because it was not approved in an election required by proposition cal,art.xiii d,did not conform to certain substantive requirements of proposition,and was to be used for a purpose not authorized by the law under which defendant was formed.thereafter,plaintiffs joseph pendry,james spain,yuet ming chu,william mcgrath,and henry schepeler pendry challenged the ordinance on similar grounds and on the ground that it was void because one of the directors who voted for the ordinance had a disqualifying conflict of interest within the meaning of the political reform act pra,et they also challenged an ordinance passed in,which imposed an augmentation charge,and a ordinance.the trial court rendered judgments for defendant.plaintiffs have appealed and reiterate their challenges.we are considering the two appeals together for purposes of briefing,oral argument,and disposition.after conducting an independent review of the record silicon valley taxpayers,santa clara county open space authority cal th,silicon valley,we affirm the judgments.
general background 
we have previously detailed an historical background to this case in pajaro valley water management agency amrhein th,amrhein.we therefore decline to repeat it and will instead begin with the trial court succinct summary.
the pajaro valley groundwater basin supplies most of the water used in the pajaro valley.the water is being extracted faster than it is being replenished by natural forces,which leads to saltwater intrusion,especially near the coast.once the water table drops below sea level,seawater seeps into the groundwater basin.defendant was created in by the pajaro valley water management agency act stats,ch,et,et,deering wat.uncod.acts act,act to deal with this issue.at present,the strategy is to use recycled wastewater,supplemental wells,captured storm runoff,and a coastal distribution system.the purpose is to reduce the amount of water taken from the groundwater basin for example,the amount taken from wells,by supplying water to some coastal users.the cost of this process is borne by all users,on the theory that even those taking water from inland wells benefit from the delivery of water to coastal users,as that reduces the amount of groundwater those coastal users will extract from their own wells,thereby keeping the water in all wells from becoming too salty.
ordinance describes three supplemental water projects that work together to provide supplemental water to reduce overdraft,retard seawater intrusion,and improve and protect the groundwater basin supply watsonville recycled water project,which provides tertiary treated recycled water for agricultural use and includes inland wells that are used to provide cleaner well water that is blended with the treated water in order to improve the water quality so that it may be used for agricultural purposes harkins slough project,which diverts excess flows from harkins slough to a basin that recharges the groundwater,which then is available to be extracted and delivered for agricultural use and coastal distribution system cds,which consists of pipelines that deliver the blended recycled water and harkins slough project water for agricultural use along the coast.
the act specifically empowers defendant to adopt ordinances levying groundwater augmentation charges on the extraction of groundwater from all extraction facilities within the agency for the purposes of paying the costs of purchasing,capturing,storing,and distributing supplemental water for use within defendant boundaries.amrhein,supra,th at see act.
ordinance describes that the augmentation charge is necessary to cover the costs of supplemental water service described as follows a the,capture,storage and distribution of supplemental water through the supplemental water projects watsonville recycled water project harkins slough project cds and including the planning,design,financing,construction,operation,maintenance,repair,replacement and management of these project facilities,and b basin management monitoring and planning to manage the existing projects and to identify and determine future water projects that would further reduce groundwater overdraft and retard seawater intrusion.the cost of the service also includes ongoing debt payments related to the design and construction of the completed supplemental water projects.
procedural background

in,defendant approved ordinance,which increased the augmentation charge to per.it did not comply with the notice,hearing,and voting requirements of proposition.but it filed amrhein as a validation proceeding seeking a declaration as to the validity of the ordinance.the trial court declared the ordinance valid,and citizens who had objected appealed to this court.
in,defendant approved ordinance,which increased the augmentation charge to per.it did not comply with the notice,hearing,and voting requirements of proposition.griffith challenged the ordinance and a ordinance.san andreas mutual water company and others also challenged the ordinance.the two actions were consolidated with scurich consolidated lawsuits and the consolidated lawsuits were stayed pending our decision in amrhein.
in may,we reversed the judgment in amrhein after holding that the augmentation fee is a fee or charge imposed as an incident of property ownership and thus subject to the proposition preconditions for the imposition of such charges.amrhein,supra,th at.
in october,defendant repealed ordinance and.
in january,the scurich plaintiffs,the san andreas plaintiffs,harold griffith,and the amrhein defendants wanted to resolve all disputes in the amrhein lawsuit and the consolidated lawsuits.they and defendant then entered into a stipulated agreement for entry of judgment stipulated agreement.the stipulated agreement provided all matters raised in the consolidated lawsuits and the amrhein lawsuit collectively the pending litigation as to defendant actions shall be resolved by entry of judgment in the pending litigation defendant would pay million to the scurich plaintiffs,the san andreas plaintiffs,harold griffith,and the amrhein defendants for legal fees,costs,and expenses and the augmentation charges collected pursuant to ordinance and would be refunded.it also stated that the settlement extinguishes any and all claims arising out of the pending litigation all issues,transactions related claims or actions including all claims that the parties have made or could have made with respect to the validity of any augmentation charge or management fee ordinances currently in effect the stipulated agreement did not provide for either the repeal of ordinance or the refund of augmentation charges imposed under that ordinance.
in february,judgment was entered pursuant to the terms of the stipulated agreement.eiskamp,supra,th at.
in may,defendant mailed notice of a public hearing on a proposed augmentation charge increase to all parcel owners at the hearing,defendant tallied written protests from eligible parcel owners.defendant then enacted ordinance,which imposed the increased augmentation charges.
in june,defendant began an election on the ordinance.it mailed ballots to all owners of land parcels served by a well who would be subject to the augmentation charge.each ballot was accorded weighted votes proportional to the parcel financial obligation as measured by average annual water use over the prior five years.and each ballot stated its number of votes.the weighted votes approved the ordinance percent to percent.but,if counted one vote per parcel,votes were in favor of the ordinance and votes were against the ordinance plaintiffs then filed the instant actions to challenge ordinance.
challenges to ordinance 
proposition was passed in by the electorate to plug certain perceived loopholes in proposition.citations.specifically,by increasing assessments,fees,and charges,local governments tried to raise revenues without triggering the voter approval requirements in proposition.silicon valley taxpayers garner th.
relevant here is the component of proposition that undertakes to constrain the imposition by local governments of assessments,fees and charges.
proposition restricts the power of public agencies to impose a f ee or charge,defined as any levy other than an ad valorem tax,a special tax,or an assessment,imposed by an agency upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership,including a user fee or charge for a property related service.citation.the phrase p service is defined to mean a public service having a direct relationship to property ownership.citation.property ownership is defined to include tenancies of real property where tenants are directly liable to pay the assessment,fee,or charge in question.citation.
where a proposed fee or charge comes within this definition,proposition requires the proposing agency to identify parcels upon which it will be imposed,and to conduct a public hearing.citation.the hearing must be preceded by written notice to affected owners setting forth,among other things,a calculat ion of t he amount of the fee or charge proposed to be imposed upon each parcel citation.if a majority of affected owners file written protests at the public hearing,the agency shall not impose the fee or charge.citation.moreover,unless the charge is for sewer,water,or refuse collection services,no property related fee or charge shall be imposed or increased unless and it is submitted and approved by a majority vote of the property owners of the property subject to the fee or charge or,at the option of the agency,by a vote of the electorate residing in the affected area.amrhein,supra,th at.
as mentioned,we have determined that a groundwater augmentation charge such as the one imposed by ordinance is indeed imposed as an incident of property ownership and that it is subject to the restrictions imposed on such charges by proposition.amrhein,supra,th at.we cautioned in amrhein,however,that we should not be understood to imply that the charge is necessarily subject to all of the restrictions imposed by proposition on charges incidental to property ownership.amrhein presents no occasion to determine whether this or a similar charge may fall within any of the express exemptions or partial exemptions set forth in that measure.ibid.fn.
this case,however,presents such an occasion.
boiled to its essence,plaintiffs challenge to the election is that the weighted vote was improper.but the challenge necessarily fails if the augmentation charge falls within the express exemption set forth in proposition for sewer,water,and refuse collection services,subd.c vote required to impose or increase fee except for sewer,water,and refuse collection services.
plaintiffs argue that defendant does not provide water service as that term is commonly understood.see howard jarvis taxpayers city of salinas th,the average voter would envision water service as the supply of water for personal,household,and commercial use salinas.they urge that defendant provides groundwater management,which may be a service but that service is not water service.plaintiffs,however,make a distinction without a difference.
domestic water delivery through a pipeline is a water service within the meaning of proposition.bighorn desert view water agency verjil cal th.and we have held that,for purposes of proposition,the augmentation charge at issue here does not differ materially from a charge on delivered water.amrhein,supra,th at.if the charges for water delivery and water extraction are akin,then the services behind the charges are akin.moreover,the legislature has endorsed the view that water service means more than just supplying water.the proposition omnibus implementation act,enacted specifically to construe proposition,defines water as any system of public improvements intended to provide for the production,storage,supply,treatment,or distribution of water,subd.m.thus,the entity who produces,stores,supplies,treats,or distributes water necessarily provides water service.defendant statutory mandate to purchase,capture,store,and distribute supplemental water therefore describes water service.
plaintiffs reliance on salinas is erroneous.in salinas,the question was whether a storm drainage fee was exempt from the requirement because it was a water or sewer service fee.our point about the average voter envisioning water service as meaning the supplying of water was a preface to distinguishing water service from storm drainage rather than a definition of water service.the entire sentence reads the average voter would envision water service as the supply of water for personal,household,and commercial use,not a system or program that monitors storm water for pollutants,carries it away from property,and discharges it into the nearby creeks,river and ocean.salinas,supra,th at.
we therefore conclude that the augmentation charge at issue here is for water service within the meaning of proposition.as such,it was expressly exempt from the voting requirement.
in a second procedural attack,pendry urges that defendant transgressed proposition by enacting ordinance without giving notice of the protest hearing to tenants and public utility customers who indirectly pay the augmentation charge.there is no merit to the claim.
an agency shall follow the procedures pursuant to this section in imposing or increasing any fee or charge as defined pursuant to this article,including,but not limited to,the following the parcels upon which a fee or charge is proposed for imposition shall be identified.the amount of the fee or charge proposed to be imposed upon each parcel shall be calculated.the agency shall provide written notice by mail of the proposed fee or charge to the record owner of each identified parcel upon which the fee or charge is proposed for imposition,the amount of the fee or charge proposed to be imposed upon each,the basis upon which the amount of the proposed fee or charge was calculated,the reason for the fee or charge,together with the date,time,and location of a public hearing on the proposed fee or charge,subd.a,italics added.
in short,proposition requires that notice of the protest hearing be sent to record owners,not tenants or customers.see,subd.j for purposes of article xiii d of the california constitution j record owner means the owner of a parcel whose name and address appears on the last equalized secured property tax assessment roll,or in the case of any public entity,the state of california,or the united states,means the representative of that public entity at the address of that entity known to the agency.
it is true,as pendry points out,that,in the definitions section of proposition,the term property ownership is defined to include tenancies of real property where tenants are directly liable to pay the assessment,fee,or charge in question,subd.g.and it is true that when a well is shown to be operated by a lessee or other occupant,that person could be billed.amrhein,supra,th at.but the notice provision of section,subdivision a,requires notice to record owners,not to those having property ownership.silicon valley,supra,cal th at the principles of constitutional interpretation are similar to those governing statutory construction.citation.if the language is clear and unambiguous,the plain meaning governs.
proposition also imposes substantive limitations,including restrictions on the use of revenues derived from such charges.amrhein,supra,th at.
a fee or charge shall not be extended,imposed,or increased by any agency unless it meets all of the following requirements 
revenues derived from the fee or charge shall not exceed the funds required to provide the property related service.
revenues derived from the fee or charge shall not be used for any purpose other than that for which the fee or charge was imposed.
the amount of a fee or charge imposed upon any parcel or person as an incident of property ownership shall not exceed the proportional cost of the service attributable to the parcel.
no fee or charge may be imposed for a service unless that service is actually used by,or immediately available to,the owner of the property in question.fees or charges based on potential or future use of a service are not permitted.standby charges,whether characterized as charges or assessments,shall be classified as assessments and shall not be imposed without compliance with section procedures and requirements for proposed assessments.
no fee or charge may be imposed for general governmental services where the service is available to the public at large in substantially the same manner as it is to property owners in any legal action contesting the validity of a fee or charge,the burden shall be on the agency to demonstrate compliance with this article,subd.b.
plaintiffs argue that the augmentation charge transgresses each of the section,subdivision b,substantive limitations.
revenues shall not exceed the funds required to provide the property related service 
according to griffith the revenues derived from the augmentation charge exceed the funds required to provide supplemental water service because some of the revenue is used to pay ongoing debt that was incurred to build a now abandoned pipeline to bring water into the valley.there is no merit to the point.
as noted above,the act allows defendant to levy groundwater augmentation charges for the purposes of paying the costs of purchasing,capturing,storing,and distributing supplemental water.such costs necessarily include debt service incurred to construct facilities to capture,store,and distribute supplemental water.
revenues shall not be used for any purpose other than that for which the fee or charge was imposed 
according to plaintiffs,the revenues derived from the augmentation charge are used for a purpose other than that for which the charge was imposed because some of the revenue is used to pay debt service and defendant general expenses.again,the act allows an augmentation charge to cover debt service.and similar reasoning supports that the costs of purchasing,capturing,storing,and distributing supplemental water necessarily include general expenses to administer the purchasing,capturing,storing,and distributing of supplemental water.
pendry,however,expands on this theme in a separate,detailed argument to the effect that the augmentation charge is unauthorized by the act.he contends that ordinance is invalid because it allows the augmentation charge to be used for supplemental water service,a purpose not authorized by the act.without specifically referring to the watsonville recycled water project that blends treated recycled water with well water for agricultural use,he complains that defendant is using the funds generated by the augmentation charge imposed by ordinance to extract groundwater from within the watershed and deliver that water to the coast 
pendry relies on the act,which authorizes defendant to levy augmentation charges to pay the costs of purchasing,capturing,storing,and distributing supplemental water for use within the boundaries of the agency.from there,pendry notes that the act states that supplemental water means surface water or groundwater imported from outside the watershed or watersheds of the groundwater basin,flood waters that are conserved and saved within the watershed or watersheds which would otherwise have been lost or would not have reached the groundwater basin,and recycled water.act.from this,pendry concludes that the blend is not supplemental water because the well portion of the blend is neither imported water,flood water,nor recycled water.we disagree with pendry analysis.
defendant rate study ante,fn.explains that the watsonville recycled water facility produces recycled water with salinity total dissolved solids or tds concentration between approximately and.the concentration of tds varies seasonally as a result of the source water flowing into the waste water treatment plant.in order to reduce salinity and use the recycled water for irrigation purposes,the recycled water must be blended with higher quality lower tds water.therefore,the recycled water project includes the construction,operation,and maintenance of blend water from supplemental groundwater wells.the supplemental wells are described in the bmp basin management plan as part of the recycled water project.the wells are a necessary component of the recycled water project,which reduces coastal pumping and thus increases the sustainable yield of the overall groundwater basin.these wells also and reduce the adverse water quality wells located closer to the coast.
recycled water means water which,as a result of treatment of waste,is suitable for a direct beneficial use or a controlled use that would not otherwise occur and is therefor considered a valuable resource,subd.n.
given this definition,it is apparent that the watsonville recycled water facility does not produce recycled water because the water it produces is not suitable for the beneficial use of coastal agriculture the water only becomes recycled water when blended with the well water.thus,the blend water delivered to the coast is supplemental water.
we are constrained to add that the act unquestionably allows defendant to extract groundwater for the purpose of capturing recycled water.the act generally provides that defendant should,in an efficient and economically feasible manner,utilize supplemental water and available underground storage and should manage the groundwater supplies to meet the future needs of the basin.act,subd.g.it specifically provides that defendant,in order to improve and protect the quality of water supplies may treat,inject,extract,or otherwise control water,including,but not limited to,control of extractions,and construction of wells and drainage facilities.id.and it also provides that defendant shall have the power to take all affirmative steps necessary to replenish and augment the water supply within its territory.id.
the amount imposed as an incident of property ownership shall not exceed the proportional cost of the service attributable to the parcel 
according to griffith,the amount imposed on his parcel was disproportionate because he uses no services.but this overlooks that the management of the water resources for agricultural,municipal,industrial,and other beneficial uses is in the public interest and defendant was created to manage the resources for the common benefit of all water users.act.it also overlooks that the augmentation charge pays for the activities required to prepare or implement any groundwater management program.id,subd.a.
pendry similarly grounds his argument on the erroneous premise that the only property owners receiving b services from defendant are the coastal landowners receiving delivered water.
pendry specifically complains that defendant established the augmentation charge by calculating the amount needed for its project,and then subtracting its sources of revenue other than the augmentation charge,with the remainder being the amount of the augmentation charge.he urges that defendant improperly worked backwards.according to pendry,the proportional cost of service must be calculated before setting the rate for the augmentation charge.
defendant indeed established its augmentation charge based on a model that budgeted the rates by taking the total costs of chargeable activities,deducting the revenue expected from other sources,and apportioning the revenue requirement among the users.the american water works association manual of water supply practices,in evidence below and relied on by d
