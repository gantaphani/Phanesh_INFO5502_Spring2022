starrett company starrett appeals from two orders by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or commission.the commission concluded that starrett would be required to seek licensing pursuant to section b of the federal power act fpa if it proceeded with certain proposed changes to its crescent street dam project the project,a hydroelectric generating facility.under section b,starrett must seek licensing if its facility is located on a stream over which congress has commerce clause jurisdiction,its proposed changes constitute post construction within the meaning of the fpa,and the proposed modifications will affect the interests of interstate or foreign commerce.see.for the reasons below,we conclude that we have no but to affirm.
background 
the project is located on the millers river in athol,massachusetts,on property that belongs to starrett.it consists of an acre foot reservoir a foot high,foot long concrete gravity dam two powerhouses,one at each end of the dam and various appurtenant facilities.the turbine generator in the powerhouse on the right side of the dam the generator currently has an installed of kw and an actual capacity of kw.the turbine generator in the powerhouse on the dam left side the generator had an installed and actual capacity of kw until,when it failed.prior to the failure of the generator,the combined installed capacity for the project was kw.this installed capacity was memorialized in a ferc order,which concluded that the project did not require ferc licensing because there had been no post construction.see starrett,ferc starrett i.the facility,however,could only actually produce kw of electricity,even prior to the failure of the generator,because of the physical limitations of the site.
after the generator failed,starrett began to investigate its options for replacement or repair.in early,starrett retained gza geoenvironmental,gza,which prepared a feasibility study that examined the financial costs and benefits of repairing the generator.the study concluded that it would be cost effective to use hydropower generated by a new turbine generator the new generator.the new generator installed and actual capacity would be kw.installing the new generator would increase the project combined installed capacity approximately,to kw,and its total actual capacity approximately,to kw.the total actual capacity of the project,however,would remain less than the previous total installed capacity,kw,the capacity documented in starrett i,a point that starrett now emphasizes.
in september,believing that it did not require ferc licensing in order to proceed with its proposed changes starrett ordered a new turbine and began the preparatory work for its installation inside the left powerhouse.according to starrett,replacing the generator required the following lowering the floor inside the powerhouse by approximately feet a improving the plunge within the building footprint by mounting the draft below the turbine generator,and b widening the outlet portal from under the powerhouse to the river from approximately to feet,both in order to improve outlet hydraulics and project efficiency excavating approximately cubic yards of bedrock from the bottom of the millers river,again in order to improve outlet hydraulics and project efficiency and installing a transition piece to connect the existing to the new turbine.
in march,as starrett was working to replace its generator,the fish and wildlife service usf ws wrote to the commission to request that the commission investigate the work occurring at the project.the usf ws had become aware that starrett planned to install higher capacity machinery,and was concerned that the increased capacity at the project would negatively impact migratory fish.
on may,the commission notified starrett that its proposed work would increase the capacity of the project and would be considered post construction,thus triggering the commission licensing jurisdiction.the commission asked starrett to submit various details about its dam and the proposed changes.starrett provided the requested details but maintained that its proposed work would not lead to an increase in capacity above the kw total memorialized in starrett i because only the installed capacity,not the actual capacity,would be over kw.after reviewing these materials,the commission issued an order finding that licensing of the project was required.see starrett,ferc starrett ii.following starrett request for rehearing,the commission issued an order denying rehearing.see starrett,ferc starrett iii.
ii.discussion 
we are now required to review the commission determination that the project fell within its jurisdiction under section b of the fpa.under that section,a hydroelectric project without a valid pre permit is subject to the commission licensing jurisdiction if it 
is located on a navigable water of the united states 
occupies lands of the united states 
utilizes surplus water or water power from a government dam or 
a is located on a stream over which congress has commerce clause jurisdiction,b is constructed or modified on or after august,and c affects the interests of interstate or foreign commerce.

b.a commerce clause stream 
section b requires us to ask whether starrett dam is on a stream over which congress has commerce clause jurisdiction,see,a commerce clause stream.the commission concluded,and starrett does not dispute on appeal,that the millers river is a commerce clause stream.see starrett iii,ferc,at.we agree with the commission assessment because the headwaters and tributaries of navigable waters are c ommerce c lause streams,id.citing fed.power comm union,and the millers river is a tributary of the connecticut river,which is navigable,see starrett ii,ferc,at.
post construction 
in,congress amended the fpa to require that persons intending to construct a dam or other project works on nonnavigable streams obtain a license.thomas hodgson,second emphasis added quoting see also public utility act of,ch,b,stat.thus,if post work constitutes construction within the meaning of the fpa and the other two prongs of section b are met,a facility will be subject to the commission licensing jurisdiction.
the commission argues that,because congress has not spoken on the precise question at issue here which it frames as what constitutes construction we need only determine if its interpretation of section b was unreasonable.see section,supra chevron,at explaining that when congress implicitly delegates a question to an administrative agency,a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.the commission contends that it was reasonable for it to determine that starrett proposed work would constitute post construction because the work would increase the project installed capacity.in addition,it notes that the commission also found that the installation of the new generator would increase actual capacity,another indication that the proposed work constituted post construction.alternatively,the commission argues that it was reasonable for it to conclude that the proposal would result in post construction because it would increase the project head.
starrett,on the other hand,argues that congress has addressed the precise question at issue here by limiting the commission jurisdiction to post construction.starrett contends that because the proposed work was merely a repair,and would not increase actual capacity beyond the installed capacity,it was not post construction.
standard of review 
we must first determine whether congress unambiguously expressed an intent about the precise question at issue here.if we conclude that congress did unambiguously express such an intent,our analysis ends there.if we conclude that congress did not unambiguously express an intent on the precise question here,we must analyze whether the commission conclusion that the work here constituted jurisdictional construction was unreasonable.
in determining congressional intent,we employ the traditional tools of statutory construction,including a consideration of the language,structure,purpose,and history of the statute.in re hill,cir quoting mckenna first horizon home loan,cir internal quotation marks omitted.our research has not uncovered,and the parties do not call to our attention,any legislative history that sheds light on where congress would draw the line between jurisdictional construction and other work.where t here is no legislative history that illuminates the purpose of a particular statutory term,we are left with language,structure,and evident purpose.see also robinson shell oil,the plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.sebelius,at to determine whether a statute exhibits ambiguity courts look at both the most natural reading of the language and the consistency of the interpretive clues congress provided.quoting succar ashcroft,cir quoting dynamics land,cline.
language of the statute 
we begin with the actual language of the statute,and ask whether construction has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in this case.pérez olivo chávez,cir second alteration in original quoting duckworth pratt whitney,cir quoting robinson at.when congress chooses not to define a phrase in the statute itself,we can look to the dictionary for clarification of the plain meaning of the words selected by congress.id.
black law dictionary defines construction as t he act of building by combining or arranging parts or elements.black law dictionary ed.another dictionary defines construction as the act of putting parts together to form a complete integrated object,and the verb construct as to form,make,or create by combining parts or elements.webster third new international dictionary philip babcock gove et eds.these definitions do not suggest that construction has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute here.duckworth,at quoting robinson,at.rather,construction is a chameleon,capable of taking on different meanings,and shades of meaning,depending on the subject matter and the circumstances of each particular usage.strickland comm r,me.dep t of human servs,cir.
statute as a whole 
if we conclude that the plain language of the statute,standing alone,is ambiguous,the next step is to ask whether this ambiguity can be resolved by looking to the specific context in which the language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.pérez olivo,at quoting robinson,at alteration in original.the parties have not called to our attention,and we have not found in our review of the fpa,any clues about the meaning of the word construction as it applies here.therefore,we move on to the second stage of the chevron analysis.
reasonableness 
the commission argues that its conclusion here,that starrett proposed work would constitute jurisdictional construction was reasonable because the proposed changes involved an increase in installed capacity and an increase in head.responding to the commission argument about increased capacity,starrett contends that the project new actual capacity kw,up from kw would remain below the installed capacity kw,and thus the commission should not have exercised its jurisdiction.we conclude that the commission determination was reasonable because there is no doubt that,under starrett plan,there would be an increase in capacity no matter how the capacity was measured both the actual and the installed capacities would be greater than their respective values for this reason,we need not analyze the head issue or resolve any of the factual disputes related to that issue 
given the state of the law,we must conclude that the commission interpretation of construction as including the work here was reasonable.in,the supreme court explained that 
t he central purpose of the federal water power act was to provide for the comprehensive control over those uses of the nation water resources in which the federal government had a legitimate interest these uses included navigation,irrigation,flood control,and,very prominently,hydroelectric which,while unregulated,might well be contradictory rather than harmonious.
union,at.in,congress amended the fpa and made clear that when the commission decides whether to grant a license under section b and various other sections of the fpa,it should give equal consideration to the power and development purposes for which licenses are issued and the purposes of energy conservation,the protection,mitigation of damage to,and enhancement of,fish and wildlife including related spawning grounds and habitat,the protection of recreational opportunities,and the preservation of other aspects of environmental quality.e electric consumers protection act of,stat.we can not say,as a matter of law,that it was unreasonable for the commission to conclude that in order to ensure that the nation waterways be used in a harmonious fashion,and to ensure,among other things,that fish and wildlife were protected,it could interpret construction as including all increases in capacity.
the cases that starrett cites to support its position are distinguishable because they did not involve increases in capacity.in thomas hodgson,the court relied in part upon the fact that there was no increase in capacity when concluding that no post construction had occurred.see thomas hodgson,at no post construction where dam owners restarted operation of inactive dam after twelve years but there was no project enlargement in capacity,diversion,or physical plant quoting puget sound power light fed.power comm n,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the same can be said of puget sound.see at noting that the work there merely restored the project to its original specifications and configuration and that there was no increase in the project electrical generating capacity.similarly,in aquenergy systems,federal energy regulatory commission,cir,although the court ruled on another ground that the dam was subject to the commission licensing jurisdiction,it acknowledged that where a new project was carefully planned to meet the specifications of the original project and where neither designed capacity,head,nor the amount of electricity generated was to increase,such work would not ordinarily constitute jurisdictional construction under section b.id.at.
in short,we conclude that the commission determination that starrett facility met the second required prong was not unreasonable.
d.the effect on interstate commerce 
before allowing the ferc to exert its licensing jurisdiction over projects involving post construction,section b requires the commission to find that the interests of interstate or foreign commerce would be affected by the proposed construction.the commission argues that starrett construction meets the interstate commerce requirement because its dam is a member of a class of small hydroelectric projects that collectively have a substantial impact on interstate commerce because they produce power that would otherwise have to be produced elsewhere on the interstate grid.starrett responds that it is improper for the commission to rely on this cumulative effect theory because it leaves the commission commerce clause jurisdiction without boundary and in any case,the commission has not shown that starrett facility belongs to a class of small hydroelectric projects that collectively affect interstate commerce.
we first address whether it was unreasonable for the commission to consider the cumulative effect on commerce of many small hydroelectric facilities,and then address whether there was substantial evidence that starrett dam,in conjunction with others,actually has a significant impact on interstate commerce.see habersham mills ferc,cir first addressing whether the ferc misappl ied the fpa by considering the cumulative effect of a class of small hydroelectric projects that include d the two projects at issue,and then addressing whether there was substantial evidence of an effect on interstate commerce city of centralia ferc,f d,cir first explaining that if a local activity belongs to a class of activities having a cumulative effect on interstate commerce,it may fall within the commerce power,and then analyzing whether there was substantial evidence that the hydropower facility at issue,either alone or in conjunction with other facilities,had a real and substantial effect on interstate commerce.
the cumulative effect theory 
the supreme court has noted that the language of the fpa strongly implies that congress drew upon its full authority under the commerce clause in enacting the statute.union,at.full authority under the commerce clause includes the power to reach a local activity whose effect on commerce,taken together with that of many others similarly situated,is far from trivial.habersham,at quoting wickard filburn,see also gonzales raich,noting that supreme court case law firmly establishes congress power to regulate purely local activities that are part of an economic class of activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.assuming there was substantial evidence supporting the commission factual findings,it would not be unreasonable for the commission to regulate starrett dam because a small hydroelectric project that affects commerce only slightly can still be subject to congressional regulation if it is part of a class with a significant cumulative effect.habersham,at.we thus turn to the second part of our analysis and ask whether the commission conclusion that starrett dam is part of a class of projects that,in the aggregate,have the required effect on interstate commerce is supported by substantial evidence.city of centralia,at.
substantial evidence 
starrett contends that its situation is comparable to the one in city of centralia,where the ninth circuit concluded that the record failed to support the commission conclusion that a hydroelectric project either itself had a substantial effect on commerce,at or was part of a class of projects that,cumulatively,had a substantial effect on interstate commerce,id.at.we agree with the commission that this case is more comparable to habersham,where the eleventh circuit concluded that two small dams did meet the interstate commerce requirement because the commission presented evidence that by supplying power to a factory,the two hydroelectric projects effectively displace d electricity that the factory otherwise would draw from the interstate grid,at and the commission referred to two ferc reports that indicate d that the small hydroelectric projects around the nation collectively account for a substantial portion of the nation hydroelectric generating capacity,id.at here,the commission explained that starrett dam produces power that starrett would otherwise receive from the interstate grid,a point supported by the record and cited habersham which in turn,as noted above,cited two ferc studies to support the proposition that small hydroelectric projects that displace power from the national grid can have a significant cumulative effect on interstate commerce.starrett iii,ferc,at.we believe that there was substantial evidence to support the factual findings underlying the commission interstate commerce conclusion.
iii.conclusion 
for the reasons stated,we affirm 
i join this opinion with great reluctance.i do so because chevron deference requires the result reached here,not that the result makes economic or realistic sense.
here,we have the last precision tool company producing its product within the united states.although starrett has several manufacturing locations worldwide,the athol location produces most of the precision tools and has remained the company headquarters since its founding in.starrett is the largest employer in the greater athol area,and its payroll typically contributes over million per month to the economy.
in order to remain competitive in the global marketplace,starrett has aggressively sought to lower its cost structures and has instituted many energy conservation measures,which have both saved operating costs and reduced the company carbon footprint.one of these measures included the replacement of the failed left turbine generator with a new,generator,the source of controversy in this case.
innovations like those taken by starrett are a necessary concomitant if we are to reinvigorate the nation manufacturing base.our decision today,however,may well mean that this company loses the economic advantage it would have from its,nonpolluting power structure.measures like those instituted by starrett are particularly key for companies based in high energy cost states,like massachusetts,and may well make the difference in keeping the plant open,providing good paying jobs,and maintaining an essential business such as this in our country.indeed,machine tools are the lifeblood of industry,and when we have lost all of our domestic capacity,we become less secure and less able to compete.it is said by some that american industry has died from a thousand cuts,and many contend that bears a share of the responsibility.
further,it is unfortunate that a small power producer like the starrett facility falls within the ambit of the commission jurisdiction because it is located on a stream that is a tributary to a navigable water and affects interstate commerce through its connection to the interstate grid.although i acknowledge that wickard filburn,and its progeny give the commission power to reach purely local activity,the result strikes me as ironic.in wickard,the government was confronted with a surplus of wheat,and it regulated production to avoid dramatically low wheat prices around the country.the market at issue here,however,proves just the opposite.today,rising energy prices and a diminishing supply of resources pose a real challenge,and our national and state governments are doing all that they can to promote energy efficiency in order to lower energy costs.it would seem that starrett project is a prime example of efficient usage through a nonpolluting power source and is one that we should be encouraging,not stifling.
perhaps a better argument not advanced by starrett would have been that,although chevron applies,the commission definition of post construction was unreasonable in view of the realities presented by this project.defining construction to include any increase in capacity still less than that originall
