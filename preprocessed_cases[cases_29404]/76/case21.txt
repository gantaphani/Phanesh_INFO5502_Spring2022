this case presents a dispute among two indian tribes,the environmental protection agency epa and the state of maine maine.the two tribes are the penobscot nation and the passamaquoddy tribe collectively,the southern tribes.also involved are two different statutory regimes the clean water act,et,which the epa administers in the first instance,and a pair of interlocking federal and state settlement acts that govern maine authority maine tribes.
among other things,the clean water act empowers the epa to issue permits for the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters.a.on certain conditions,the statute entitles states to administer their own permitting programs in place of the epa.id.b.a state desiring to do so must apply to the epa,and if the state has adequate authority to carry out the described program,and other requirements are met,the epa shall approve the program.id.
the present litigation has its origins in such an application.on november,maine submitted its application under section b to take over discharge permitting in maine.the clean water act sets a period for the epa to review the application.id.c.once this period has expired,the epa 
shall suspend the issuance of permits under subsection a of this section as to those discharges subject to such program unless the administrator determines that the state permit program does not meet the requirements of section b.
the application presented questions as to what authority the state had the southern particular,as to discharges connected to tribal members or entities,tribal waters or tribal activities.the epa and maine agreed to extend the review period four times,see d,eventually setting september,as the new deadline.this deadline also expired without an epa decision,and the epa then suspended its own issuance of new permits,as section c commands.
in january,the epa approved the state program in all areas of maine outside disputed indian territory,but took no final action on the issues related to the state jurisdiction and the applicability of state law in indian country for the purposes of implementing the npdes program in those areas.state program requirements,
then,in october,the epa concluded that maine had authority to regulate nineteen discharge facilities owned by located outside,but discharging to boundaries within,the territorial waters of the southern tribes the epa reached the same conclusion as to a facility located outside tribal territory but owned and used jointly by the passamaquoddy tribe and a neighboring municipality.at.
however,the epa refused to approve the state plan as applied to two facilities located on tribal lands and discharging into navigable waters within the southern tribes territories but which thereafter pass other downstream communities.id.at.the epa found that discharges from these facilities were immaterial and had no substantial effect on and it concluded that their regulation was an internal tribal matter over which the state lacked adequate authority.id.as to these two facilities,the epa retained permitting authority.id.
additionally,the epa expressed concern that maine permitting program might not ensure water quality standards adequate to protect the southern tribes right to fish for individual sustenance,id.at right assertedly guaranteed to the tribes by state law.citing its authority to object to specific state permits and to retake permitting authority from the states under certain conditions,d,the epa said that it would require the state to address the tribes uses consistent with the requirements of the cwa.at.
petitions for judicial review,which we have consolidated,followed.the southern tribes say that the epa erred in approving maine program as to the nineteen facilities that discharge into tribal waters.they argue that the settlement acts reserved to the tribes authority the state to regulate pollution by within the tribes territories,and that the epa has a trust obligation to retain permitting authority to facilitate tribal control over the tribes natural resources.
for its part,maine defends the epa as to the nineteen facilities but contends that the epa erred in exempting the two facilities from the state permitting program.several towns and other entities subject to permitting under the clean water act have intervened in favor of maine authority but in addition,they say that state permitting authority as to all the facilities has already come into force by operation of law.
our review is de novo as to issues of law,penobscot air,faa,cir,except that the epa gets a measure of deference in applying ambiguous terms in any statute it administers,including the clean water act.chevron natural resources defense council,d.as to factual matters,the epa is entitled to deference unless its findings are unreasonable.adams epa,cir.
the extent of maine authority as to the southern tribes has a unique history.in the later and early centuries,maine was part of massachusetts and agreements between massachusetts and maine tribes appeared to surrender much or all of the tribes aboriginal sovereignty,at,reprinted in.until the,maine and its courts considered the tribes to be as completely subject to the state as any other inhabitants can be.state newell,me.similarly,the federal government had repeatedly denied that it had jurisdiction over or responsibility for the maine tribes.a.
in the,the passamaquoddy tribe filed a lawsuit laying claim to much of the entire territory of maine,arguing that its agreements with massachusetts were invalid because never approved by congress.when the suit was successful as to the latter issue,bottomly passamaquoddy tribe,cir,federal a compromise with the passamaquoddy tribe and the penobscot nation.this was reflected in a maine statute,ratified by a federal statute also in,collectively,the settlement acts,note,above.
for the southern tribes,the settlement acts confirmed their title to designated reservation lands,memorialized federal recognition of their tribal status,and opened the floodgate for the influx of millions of dollars in federal subsidies.passamaquoddy tribe maine,cir.the settlement acts also protected to a limited extent the southern tribes sovereignty by recognizing their power to control their internal affairs and by withdrawing the power which maine previously claimed to interfere in such matters,at,reprinted in.
in maine favor,the settlement acts extinguished the tribes remaining claims to vast tracts of maine land,and extended state authority well beyond what is customary for indian tribes elsewhere in the united states.of particular importance,the maine statute,ratified by the federal one,provided that with very limited exceptions,akins penobscot nation,cir,the southern tribes would be subject to maine law 
and any lands or natural resources owned by them or held in trust for them shall be subject to the laws of the state and to the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the courts of the state to the same extent as any other person or natural resources therein.
in this,and in a number of other respects described below,maine power over the southern tribes greatly narrows ordinary tribal sovereignty state law.yet,professedly in recognition of the southern tribes remaining inherent sovereignty,at,reprinted in,the settlement acts provide that,for the penobscot nation and the passamaquoddy tribe,internal tribal matters are not subject to regulation by the state.this qualification does not apply to other maine tribes,who are fully subject to maine law.
on its face,section reservation of authority over the tribes lands and natural resources,to the same extent as any other person,might appear explicitly to satisfy the requirements of the clean water act that a state seeking to issue its own permits have adequate authority to carry out the described state permitting program.b.on several grounds,the southern tribes argue otherwise.
the southern tribes broadest claim is that their inherent sovereignty remains intact and therefore state regulatory power over their lands is exceedingly limited.the premise is mistaken the explicit language of the settlement acts establishes state authority that far exceeds what is normal for indian tribes to which no such legislation applies.as akins explained,at,the southern tribes are subject to the laws of maine with very limited exceptions.this markedly contrasts with the status of indian tribes in other states not subject to the settlements acts,santa clara pueblo martinez,d.
in addition to maine explicit authority over tribal lands and natural resources,the settlement acts expressly divested the maine tribes of sovereign immunity,d,and with limited exceptions,made the maine tribes subject to the general criminal and civil law of maine even with respect to activities carried out on tribal lands.a,c.underscoring these limitations,special provisions protect maine law against inadvertent preemption by present and future federal statutes affecting other tribes.h,b passamaquoddy tribe,at 
the southern tribes cite to house and senate reports referring to the sovereignty of the maine tribes as equal to that of other indian tribes,at at,but the reports are referring to the view adopted by the bottomly preceded and indeed precipitated the settlement acts.see.at.and the settlement acts were a compromise by which land claims were limited,federal funds paid over,and the authority of the tribes and the state redefined on a new basis,closer to maine historic treatment rather than the full sovereignty asserted by the tribes.
this temporal distinction is borne out explicitly in a passage in the senate report,adopted as well in the house report.this makes clear that the statutory compromise extended state power over indian territory thereby reviving the state of the caveat that tribal sovereignty would be strengthened to the extent of withdrawing maine prior assertion of authority over internal affairs.at at.
the southern tribes say that state authority over land and water resources can coexist with tribal authority,pointing to certain provisions of the settlement acts that explicitly make state authority exclusive.so,the tribes say,the existence of maine authority does not automatically negate concurrent tribal authority over the same subject matter.but the question here is whether maine has adequate authority to implement permitting as to the tribes lands,and section on its face is about as explicit in conferring such authority as is possible.what the tribes might do if maine did not legislate is beside the point.
the southern tribes concurrency argument would have bite only if their own concurrent regulatory authority,if it existed,took priority over enacted maine law.but this would turn on its head the explicit language of the settlement acts giving maine authority over land and water resources in the tribes territories.if there is concurrent jurisdiction at all,it is subordinate to maine overriding authority to act within the scope of section,which clearly includes maine power to regulate discharge permitting consistent with the clean water act.
at the time the settlement acts were adopted,the interior department,largely responsible for relations with indian tribes,told congress that the southern tribes lands would generally be subject to maine law.at report of the department of the interior.the senate report,adopted by the house report,declared that state law,including but not limited to laws regulating land use or management,conservation and environmental protection,are fully applicable as provided in the proposed bill and section of the maine implementing act.at at.
the settlement act contains an explicit statement that the southern tribes are to be treated as municipal corporations.this status,not conferred on two other maine tribes,is effectively a grant of local police powers.but in maine as elsewhere municipal authority can be overridden by comprehensive law home rule authority gives way in areas preempted by comprehensive schemes.camden rockland water town of hope,me.the state permitting scheme is just such a statute.
there is one pertinent and explicit exception to the settlement act affirmations of state power,and our immediate task is to apply it to the present facts.the maine implementing statute,ratified by congress,says generally that the tribes have within their territories the rights and duties of a municipality such as to enact ordinances and collect taxes and are subject to the laws of maine,
provided,however,that internal tribal matters,including membership in the respective tribe or nation,the right to reside within the respective indian territories,tribal organization,tribal government,tribal elections and the use or disposition of settlement fund income shall not be subject to regulation by the state.
emphasis added.
the tribes read the italicized phrase broadly,as encompassing discharges into navigable waters within tribal boundaries,even by the nineteen facilities located outside those boundaries.maine denies that the phrase applies even to the two tribal facilities that discharge into tribal waters.and the epa adopts a middle ground,treating the discharges by the two tribal facilities as an internal tribal matter the size of the discharge have no substantial effect on.
the phrase internal tribal matters,taken wholly in the abstract,is assuredly vague.but the background rule is that maine law on natural resources governs the tribes and their territories.section says this explicitly and it is underscored by h,providing that no law or regulation of the united states which affects or preempts the civil,criminal,or regulatory jurisdiction of the state of maine,including,without limitation,laws of the state relating to land use or environmental matters,shall apply within the state.
then,in exempting internal affairs,the statute gives four statutory examples of internal membership,residence in tribal territory,elections and use of settlement funds.these are not exclusive,akins,at,but they are indicative of what the statute means by internal tribal matters.penobscot nation stilphen,me.in ordinary statutory construction,the proviso thus reserves to the tribe matters pertaining to tribal membership and governance structure,expenditure of fund income and other matters of the same kind,see united states mckelvey,cir but it does not displace general maine law on most substantive subjects,including environmental regulation.
this court has only two decisions directly construing the phrase internal tribal matters as applied to maine tribes.akins,penobscot nation fellencer,cir,cert.denied,d.in the former,the right of a tribal member residing outside the territory to wood from indian land was held not subject to due process and equal protection rules otherwise applicable to state action,akins,at,in the latter,we said that a dismissed employee of the tribal government could not sue under state law claiming discrimination.fellencer,at.
in both those cases,unlike this case,maine disclaimed any interest in regulation or superintendence.akins,at fellencer,at.by contrast,in the present case,maine affirmatively asserts authority as to both tribal and land to regulate discharges into navigable waters.the settlement act provisions just quoted affirm that power.if the internal affairs exemption negated so specific a ground of state authority,it is hard to see what would be left of the compromise restoration of maine jurisdiction.
thus,we readily uphold the position of the epa and maine that the nineteen discharge sources draining into tribal waters can be regulated by the state.the only real question is the epa of the two source points that are on tribal lands and are owned by tribe entities these do drain into navigable waters within what we assume to be tribal land.the epa said that because the two sources have insignificant consequences for,they are exempt from state regulation.
if the epa were construing the clean water act,we would under chevron,at,owe deference to its coverage determination but the settlement acts,which we treat as a matter of federal law,are not within its purview.so we accept the epa factual premise as to the impact of the discharges but not the epa legal characterization.an interior department opinion letter to the epa,although supporting the southern tribes claims as to all of the facilities,whic
