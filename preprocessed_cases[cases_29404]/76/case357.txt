introduction 
in this appeal,the city of palmdale city asserts the trial court erred in finding the palmdale water district pwd had adopted a new water rate structure in conformity with the constitutional requirements of proposition.
after conducting an independent review of the record silicon valley taxpayers,santa clara county open space authority cal th,we conclude pwd failed to satisfy its burden to establish that its new water rate structure complies with the mandates of proposition as set forth in article xiii d of the california constitution article xiii d,including the proportionality requirement which specifies that no fee or charge imposed upon any person or parcel as an incident of property ownership shall exceed the proportional cost of the service attributable to the parcel.accordingly,we reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural summary 
as of,palmdale water district pwd revenues had decreased by about million primarily due to a decline in water sales,while its expenses had increased by about million in and million in.pwd general manager concluded a percent rate increase was necessary to balance the budget.
at a cost of,palmdale water district pwd retained raftelis financial consultants rfc to prepare a rate study and recommend a new rate structure.according to rfc water rate study report,pwd serves a population of approximately with about service connections.pwd water supply consists of percent surface water from little rock reservoir and state water project swp and percent from pwd area groundwater wells.single family residential customers account for percent of pwd total water usage.remaining water usage is as follows percent,residential percent,irrigation percent,and construction and other customers such as schools and municipalities percent.
according to rfc report,over the preceding five years,pwd had spent more than million to upgrade its water treatment plant and depleted its reserves.pwd wanted to issue million in debt by july for future capital projects and refinancing.rfc presented policy issues for the board to decide,including water budget allocation defaults and methods for calculating desired fixed revenue from proposed new rates.rfc advised the board regarding two options for determining fixed revenues a cost of service option and a percentage of fixed cost option.advantages of the cost of service option were noted as defensible prop and consistent with industry standards but one disadvantage was greater revenue fluctuation with varying demand.an advantage of the alternative fv option was rate stability while disadvantages included significant impact on small customers who conserve water and weaker signal for water conservation.rfc indicated fixed revenue should not exceed percent of revenues.
rfc again met with pwd board regarding the need to adopt a water rate increase structure for a future bond issue it was determined pwd new rate structure would recover percent of its costs from fixed fees and percent from variable fees based on the bond team recommendation and conservation factors the proposed rate structure then included a fixed monthly service charge based on meter size and commodity charges based on a water budget allocation.residential customers were provided indoor and outdoor allocations,commercial customers received a average allocation and irrigation customers received only an outdoor allocation.commodity rates were then imposed under a tiered structure,determining how much the customer went over or stayed within the allocated budget.
again,rfc presented two options for determining the commodity rates and monthly service charge the cost of service cos option and the cost allocation fv.with the fv option,monthly fixed charges would represent percent of total costs while the cos alternative would include only billing and customer service costs plus meter charges in the fixed monthly fees.rfc indicated this option offered more revenue stability but a weaker conservation signal.the reverse was true for the cos option less revenue stability but a stronger conservation signal.
when rfc presented its final water rate study report to the pwd board in march,the board approved the fv option but modified it such that percent of fixed costs would be recovered from fixed monthly charges and percent would be recovered from variable charges.
pwd prepared a notice of public hearing pursuant to proposition,and the city and its redevelopment agency sent letters to pwd protesting the rate increase.pwd held a public hearing in may at which city representatives spoke against the increase and members of the public appeared to object as well.at the same meeting,the board adopted a resolution approving its bonds to replenish its reserves.the success of this bond issue is dependent on the adoption of the pending water rate increases.
as approved,the new rate structure now imposes a fixed monthly service charge based on the size of the customer meter and a per unit commodity charge for the amount of water used,with the amount depending upon the customer adherence to the allocated water budget.the customer pays a higher commodity charge per unit of water above the budgeted allotment,but the incremental rate increase depends on the customer class.more particularly,all customers pay tier rates unit in at to percent of their water budget allocation.thereafter,however,the increased rate depends on the customer category 
commercial irrigation 
tier unit above above above 
the following day,the city filed a complaint seeking to invalidate the water rate increase and the bonds.the case was deemed related to another action filed by the city against pwd seeking injunctive and declaratory relief to stop imposition of the new rates.the cases were not consolidated.
this action was tried in february.the city sought to introduce evidence beyond the scope of the administrative record,after propounding discovery and serving public records act requests for documents.the trial court granted the city motion to amend its complaint but denied its motion to augment the record.the city filed an offer of proof identifying evidence it would have presented at trial had it been allowed to do so and requested a statement of decision.initially,the trial court tentative ruling was to invalidate the rate increase but after hearing oral argument and taking the matter under submission,the trial court issued its ruling validating pwd rates and the bonds.at the court request,both the city and pwd submitted proposed statements of decision and the city also filed objections to pwd statement.the court issued pwd statement without changes.the court mistakenly believed the city had not filed a proposed statement but when the error was brought to the court attention,decided pwd statement should stand.judgment was entered.the city appeals.
discussion 
in november,california voters adopted proposition,the right to vote on taxes act.in adopting this measure,the people found and declared that proposition was intended to provide effective tax relief and to require voter approval of tax increases.however,local governments have subjected taxpayers to excessive tax,assessment,fee and charge increases that not only frustrate the purposes of voter approval for tax increases,but also threaten the economic security of all californians and the california economy itself.this measure protects taxpayers by limiting the methods by which local governments exact revenue from taxpayers without their consent.howard jarvis taxpayers city of roseville th,footnotes omitted.proposition added articles xiii c and xiii d to the california constitution.article xiii c concerns voter approval for local government general taxes and special taxes.article xiii d sets forth procedures,requirements and voter approval mechanisms for local government assessments,fees and charges.we are concerned here with article xiii d,specifically certain provisions concerning fees and charges.ibid.
the relevant california constitution,article xiii d provisions on fees and charges are as follows

b requirements for existing,new or increased fees and charges.a fee or charge shall not be extended,imposed,or increased by any agency unless it meets all of the following requirements 
revenues derived from the fee or charge shall not exceed the funds required to provide the service.

no fee or charge may be imposed for general governmental services including,but not limited to,police,fire,ambulance or library services,where the service is available to the public at large in substantially the same manner as it is to property owners.reliance by an agency on any parcel map,including,but not limited to,an assessor parcel map,may be considered a significant factor in determining whether a fee or charge is imposed as an incident of property ownership for purposes of this article.in any legal action contesting the validity of a fee or charge,the burden shall be on the agency to demonstrate compliance with this article.

d beginning july,all fees or charges shall comply with this section.italics added.
as our supreme court emphasized in silicon valley,supra,cal th,we must enforce the provisions of our constitution and may not lightly disregard or blink at a clear constitutional mandate.citation.in so doing,we are obligated to construe constitutional amendments in a manner that effectuates the voters purpose in adopting the law.citation.id.at.because proposition underlying purpose was to limit government power to exact revenue and to curtail the deference that had been traditionally accorded legislative enactments on fees,assessments,and charges,a more rigorous standard of review is warranted,and we must exercise our independent judgment in determining whether pwd rate increase violates article xiii d proposition.ibid.
among other substantive challenges,the city argues pwd failed to demonstrate that its water rates are proportional to the cost of providing water service to each parcel as required under section b of article xiii d the proposition ballot pamphlet makes clear that the voters intended that no property owner fee may be more than the cost to provide service to that property owner land.nevertheless,the city says,pwd rates violate this proportionality requirement in a number of respects for no permissible purpose according to the city,pwd admittedly targets irrigation users to pay dramatically higher and disproportionate water rates pwd monthly service charge is arbitrary and not tied to the actual costs of providing identified services to each meter pwd commodity charge tiers are not proportional to the costs of providing water service pwd water budget structure is not proportional to the costs of providing water service and fails to achieve its stated purpose.moreover,the city urges,pwd failed to prove its revenues under the new rate structure will not exceed the costs of providing water service in contravention of article xiii d,section b,and instead all but assures that revenues pwd receives from customers in the higher tiers will be more than is required to cover pwd costs of service.further,the city says,pwd new rates require irrigation users to pay for services they can not receive in violation of section b of article xiii 
according to the city,pwd scheme charges a few irrigation users a vastly disproportionate share of pwd total costs.pwd makes no showing whatsoever that pwd cost of delivering service to those irrigation users is proportionately higher than pwd costs of delivering service to residential and commercial users.the record shows that pwd intentionally seeks to recoup most of its costs from a relatively few irrigation users who happen to be institutions such as the city,so as to keep costs to the vast majority of pwd customers proportionately low.this sort of price discrimination is not allowed under proposition 
in response,pwd asserts that the structuring of the various tiers does not even constitute a fee or charge for purposes of proposition but merely defined percentages of a customer water budget that define the breaking points for the applicable tiers,but this is inconsistent with the law as pwd uses these tiers to calculate its customers water rates.because it is imposed for the service of water delivery,pwd water rate,as well as its fixed monthly charges,are fees or charges within the meaning of article xiii d bighorn desert view water agency verjil cal th.a ll charges for water delivery incurred after a water connection is made are charges for a service,whether the charge is calculated on the basis of consumption or is imposed as a fixed monthly fee.ibid.
next,pwd says it is entitled to promote conservation in such a manner pursuant to article x,section,of the california constitution it is hereby declared that because of the conditions prevailing in this state the general welfare requires that the water resources of the state be put to beneficial use to the fullest extent of which they are capable,and that the waste or unreasonable use or unreasonable method of use of water be prevented,and that the conservation of such waters is to be exercised with a view to the reasonable and beneficial use thereof in the interest of the people and for the public welfare.the right to water or to the use or flow of water in or from any natural stream or water course in this state is and shall be limited t
