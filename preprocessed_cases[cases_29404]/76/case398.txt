plaintiffs sierra club and friends of the gualala river appeal from an order of the trial court denying their petition for writ of mandate.plaintiffs petition challenged a decision of defendant california department of forestry and fire protection cdf to issue a timber conversion permit tcp for a site of timberland owned by respondents and real parties in interest phil campbell et real parties,who sought the tcp so they could convert the timberland to a vineyard.cdf issued the tcp after adopting a mitigated negative declaration,that concluded that the timberland conversion project would not have a significant impact on the environment,and thus did not require the preparation of an environmental impact report eir.
plaintiffs contend there is substantial evidence to support a fair argument that the timberland conversion project may have a significant effect on the environment,thus requiring the preparation of an eir.we agree and reverse.
real parties,phil campbell,june campbell,rex campbell,steve campbell,and karen hay,own acres of timberland on a ridge top near the town of annapolis in sonoma county.the timberland is located within the buckeye creek watershed.the proposed vineyard operations could potentially have an impact on buckeye creek,grasshopper creek,soda springs creek,and the gualala river,all of which apparently lie within the gualala river watershed.the gualala river supports coho salmon and steelhead trout,and has been listed as sediment and temperature impaired under section d of the federal clean water act.
in april,real parties applied for a tcp to convert the site from timberland to a vineyard.pursuant to the tcp,the conversion would occur over a period.real parties proposed to log existing timber,remove stumps and debris,plant a cover crop and vines,and install an irrigation system.real parties proposed to use a surface area as a reservoir to provide water to the young vines.apparently,the reservoir will impound winter surface runoff and will not take groundwater or water from any existing watercourses.vineyard operations would involve the use of herbicides and pesticides,which could include potentially hazardous substances.
in late july or early august,cdf released a draft initial study and negative declaration draft nd for real parties timberland conversion project.one of the attachments to the draft nd was an erosion control and mitigation plan,which discussed measures intended to mitigate the impact of the project on soil erosion and water quality.
the draft nd concluded the timberland conversion project will not have an adverse impact on the forest resource,and could not have a significant effect on the environment specifically,the draft nd found that the project had no potential to degrade the quality of the environment,substantially reduce the habitat of a fish or wildlife species,and had only less than significant impacts that were cumulatively considerable.
the draft nd was opened to public and agency comment.received comments included a comment letter from the department of fish and game dfg which opposed the draft nd and believed the project required an eir.
we summarize dfg comments 
the project area was within the geographic range of the northern spotted owl,a federally listed threatened species.the project area contained acres of foraging habitat and acres of nesting and roosting habitat.dfg concluded that the project would restrict the range of the owl species and thus would create a significant impact on the threatened species.
the draft nd and erosion control and mitigation plan failed to consider and adequately analyze the potential impact to steelhead trout from the diversion of water,including surface flow,for irrigation.most important,an evaluation of water quantity and quality available to juvenile steelhead during the summer months in dry years when vineyard operations are occurring,was not included in the impact analysis.dfg believes that the proposed project could adversely affect salmonid habitats in grasshopper creek and buckeye creek,and result in the restriction of the range of steelhead in the watershed.
the withdrawal of groundwater supplies from the onsite well and the construction of the reservoir could negatively affect natural hydrologic processes important to the maintenance of viable,functioning aquatic resources near the plan area.the project documents did not mention whether remaining water supplies would be adequate to meet the needs of downstream populations of steelhead trout.
the erosion control and mitigation plan assumed there would be no increase in sediment as a result of the project,but acknowledged there could be a more definitive assessment of sediment yield.dfg believed that further analysis performed by a qualified hydrologist or watershed geomorphologist would be appropriate to determine changes to water quality that could adversely affect steelhead trout and their habitats in grasshopper and buckeye creeks.
dfg rejected the conclusion of the erosion control and mitigation plan that there would be no significant potential of contamination from the use of fertilizers,pesticides and herbicides if chemicals were used and label instructions were followed.dfg believed there were potential adverse impacts to aquatic resources in grasshopper and buckeye creeks in the event of accidental spills or improper use,handling and storage of chemicals.a contingency plan was not outlined in the project documents that describes avoidance,minimization or compensation measures for potential deleterious effects to downstream salmonids and aquatic habitats in the event of contaminated runoff entering the watercourse.as such,dfg disagrees that the proposed project would not have a substantial adverse impact 
the approximately five miles of deer fencing proposed to protect the vineyard would substantially interfere with wildlife behavioral patterns,and will result in significant impacts to the wildlife community.
the project had cumulative considerable impacts to the spotted owl and steelhead trout habitat and populations.
dfg concluded that the project documents fail to disclose and evaluate potential significant adverse impacts to biological resources on and adjacent to the plan area and that the project,as proposed,will degrade the quality of the environment in the annapolis region of sonoma county.dfg believed that cdf,as lead agency for the project,should find that the proposed timberland conversion may have a significant effect on the environment,and should,therefore,require that an eir be prepared for this project.
the sonoma county permit and resources management department also commented,stating its belief that the draft nd was incomplete and inconclusive regarding several potential environmental impacts and requesting the preparation of an eir.hydrologist dennis jackson submitted a detailed comment letter,stating his belief that the draft nd was incomplete in many areas,including water quality,erosion control,and impact on coho salmon habitat.he also requested that an eir be prepared.
the public comment period closed on september,on november,the coast action group filed a separate mandate action challenging cdf grant to real parties of a less than conversion exemption,to allow real parties to convert acres of the project site into an irrigation pond.plaintiffs and cdf agree that plaintiffs were not parties to,and did not participate in,the coast action group mandate litigation.
the coast action group alleged that the less than conversion exemption amounted to illegal piecemealing of the timberland conversion project.their mandate litigation eventually settled in june of.among other things,real parties agreed to rescind their application for the exemption if and when the a pplication is approved and adopted by cdf.
in may of,cdf issued a mitigated negative declaration mnd.in the executive summary of the mnd,cdf states a negative declaration was prepared for this project in.comments received from the public indicated that the project description did not accurately describe the full range of activities occurring in conjunction with this project.specifically,a conversion exemption had b
