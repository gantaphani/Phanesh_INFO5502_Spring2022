this case presents the question of whether the issuance of a permit by the army corps of engineers violates the clean water act the permit issued in this case authorizes coeur alaska,to discharge process wastewater containing tailings from its gold mine into a lake that is a navigable water of the united states.coeur alaska proposes to discharge daily gallons of process wastewater containing tons of tailings from its mine into lower slate lake.the tailings in the discharge will raise the bottom elevation of the lake by feet.a high,long dam will be built to contain the discharge and the area of the lake will be increased about.the army corps of engineers contends that the permit was properly granted under of the clean water act,which relates to the disposal of fill material,and that it is not subject to the effluent restrictions of or of the clean water act.the plaintiffs contend that this mine disposal discharge must comply with the effluent restrictions of and,and that any permit allowing discharge must be issued by the environmental protection agency.the district court held that the issuance of the permit was proper.we reverse and remand with instructions to vacate the permit 
coeur alaska intends to open the kensington gold mine on the site of a prior mine in southeast alaska that operated from to.although the mining operation will include several facilities,the mine itself will be entirely subterranean.
to process the gold ore retrieved from the mine,coeur alaska will construct a mill facility.in the process,rock from the mine will be transported to a mill and moved through a series of mechanical crushing and grinding procedures.after the rock is finely ground,it will be fed into a tank where water and chemicals referred to as conditioners,frothers,surfactants,and scale inhibitors will be added.air is then pumped into the tank,producing bubbles that attach to the gold deposits.the bubbles rise,bringing the gold with them and forming a froth that is skimmed off the top.
after the gold has bubbled up to the surface and the froth is removed,the ground as a waste product.of the tons of ore that the kensington mine will process each day,only about tons percent contain economically viable gold minerals.about percent of the tailings will be used as backfill in the mine.the remaining volume is,according to coeur alaska,too large to transport off site and presents a waste disposal problem.this dispute arises from coeur alaska current plan for addressing that disposal problem.
coeur alaska earlier plan of operations for the kensington gold mine called for the construction of a dry tailings facility,in which the mine would dispose of waste from its mill on dry uplands.this disposal process involved the construction of berm and drainage structures around the designated disposal area,dewatering the process wastewater,and placement of the tailings within an enclosure.after the closure of the mine in about to years,coeur alaska would have been required to cover the disposal area with native material to support revegetation.the forest service forest service approved the plan of operations for the dry tailings facility,and the army corps of engineers corps and the environmental protection agency epa issued permits to the company authorizing the construction of this facility in.the price of gold subsequently dropped to an ounce,however,prompting coeur alaska to investigate less expensive ways to develop the mine project in,coeur alaska proposed a new plan of operations with significant amendments.the most important change for our purposes was that,instead of the dry tailings facility,coeur alaska proposed to discharge its process wastewater containing the tailings directly into nearby lower slate lake.
lower slate lake,a subalpine lake in the tongass national forest,is one of several small lakes in the vicinity of the mine.the lake is a fish and wildlife habitat and supports about dolly varden char a freshwater fish and other native fish and aquatic life.the lake is also a tributary of slate creek and drains into berners bay.
coeur alaska current disposal plan involves piping approximately gallons of process wastewater,including tons of tailings,each day to the bottom of lower slate lake in the form of a slurry.this slurry would consist of about percent water and percent tailings.a polymer and flocculent would be added to the slurry to enhance settling of the tailings.over the life of the mine,approximately million tons of tailings would be deposited into the lake.the discharge ultimately would raise the bottom of the lake feet,to its current high water mark,and nearly triple its surface area.coeur alaska and the corps admit that the discharge and settling of the tailings into the lake would kill all the fish and nearly all the aquatic life.the effluent would have a ph factor of over,which is considerably higher than the lake current ph factor,and would contain concentrations of several potentially hazardous materials,including aluminum,copper,lead,and mercury.the toxicity of the discharge may have lasting effects on the lake and may negatively affect its ability to sustain aquatic life in the future.the corps intends that aquatic life would be reintroduced into the lake,but the extent to which aquatic life could be restored eventually is unclear.
to prepare the lake for use as a wastewater disposal facility and the consequent expansion of the lake surface,coeur alaska would construct a high,long dam at the lake outfall point.coeur alaska plan to use the lake as a disposal facility also includes the construction of a diversion ditch.constructing the ditch would require cutting trees on acres of forested land,building a wide road,excavating and digging a ditch,and filling in acres of nearby wetlands with cubic yards of fill material.in addition,during the period of the lake use as a disposal facility,slate creek would be diverted around the lake through a pipeline.
the forest service approved coeur alaska current plan of operations at the kensington gold mine,including the revised disposal plan,in a record of decision rod on december.because the proposed discharge would have the effect of raising the bottom elevation of lower slate lake,the corps reasoned that the permit program under of the clean water act,rather than,applies to coeur alaska planned discharges.accordingly,the corps issued a permit for the discharge into lower slate lake on june.
under the permit,when operations at the mine eventually cease,the corps would require coeur alaska to mitigate the environmental impacts at the lake by installing a cap of native material over the tailings at the bottom of the lake.the corps would also require coeur alaska to reintroduce native fish species into the lake and monitor the health of the ecosystem.
southeast alaska conservation council,the sierra club,and lynn canal conservation collectively seacc filed this lawsuit challenging the corps permit and the forest service rod approving the general plan on the grounds that they violate a,e,and e of the clean water act.the crux of seacc argument is that the corps violated the clean water act by issuing a permit for the discharge of process wastewater from a mill into a body of water protected by the clean water act.
after the complaint was filed,the corps decided to suspend the permit and reconsidered its decision to issue the permit.for that purpose,the corps moved for voluntary remand of the case before briefing on the merits began,which the district court granted on november.the corps reinstated the original permit,without changes,on march.at the same time,the corps issued a revised rod in which it explained its rationale.seacc then filed an amended complaint,in which it reiterated its allegations and reasserted its causes of action.coeur alaska,goldbelt,and the state of alaska intervened as defendants.the parties filed for summary judgment.
the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on august.in its opinion,the district court focused on whether the corps misapplied of the clean water act.the district court noted that seacc challenged the granting of the permit on the grounds that it did not comply with e and e.it held that if the permit was issued under for the disposal of fill material,then e and e were inapplicable.
seacc appealed on august,three days after the district court decision,and this court,on seacc motion,granted an injunction pending appeal on august,which prohibited coeur alaska,the corps,and the forest service from proceeding with further construction activities related to preparing the lake for use as a waste disposal site.see seacc army corps of eng rs,cir.since granting the injunction,we have addressed two emergency motions related to stabilizing a temporary coffer dam that was hastily constructed by coeur alaska prior to the injunction.seacc army corps of eng rs,cir.

two different regulations contain plain language interpreting the clean water act that would appear to govern coeur alaska proposed plan of operations at the kensington gold mine,but they result in different interpretations of the act.the discharge of wastewater containing tailings from coeur alaska mill operation facially meets the corps current regulatory definition of fill material because it would have the effect of raising the bottom elevation of the lake.see e.accordingly,under this interpretation,the discharge would be subject to the permit process governed by of the clean water act.however,epa previously promulgated a performance standard,pursuant to and of the clean water act,that prohibits discharges from mills into waters of the united states.see b.
both of the regulations appear to apply in this case,yet they are at odds.as explained below,the plain language of the clean water act resolves this conflict and requires that the performance standard controls.the statute is unambiguous on this point,and the performance standard applies to discharges from the mill at coeur alaska kensington gold mine into lower slate lake.furthermore,the federal agencies clear statements at the time they adopted the current regulatory definition of the term fill material demonstrate that they did not intend for waste products subject to effluent limitations and performance standards to be regulated as fill material.for these reasons the corps should not have issued a permit to coeur alaska under.the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the corps is reversed,and we remand for summary judgment to be entered in favor of the plaintiffs with directions to vacate the permit granted by the corps.
we begin,as we must,with the text of the clean water act itself to determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,natural res.def.council,d.if a court,employing traditional tools of statutory construction,ascertains that congress had an intention on the precise question at issue,that intention is the law and must be given effect.id.at.
congress passed the clean water act in to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the waters of the united states.a.to achieve this objective,the clean water act sought to eliminate completely the discharge of all pollutants into the nation navigable waters by.a.it also sought to make those waters suitable for fish,shellfish,wildlife,and recreation.a.one of congress principal concerns in passing the clean water act was the use of water for waste disposal,which congress deemed unacceptable.see,at,reprinted in,the use of any river,lake,stream or ocean as a waste treatment system is unacceptable,quoted in weyerhaeuser costle,cir.
the cornerstone and fundamental premise of the clean water act is,which prohibits all discharges of any pollutant except in compliance with specified provisions of the statute.ass to protect hammersley,eld,totten inlets taylor,cir natural res.def.council,epa.specifically,a provides that the discharge of any pollutant by any person shall be unlawful except when the discharge complies with the requirements of,inter alia,and a.in furtherance of this mandate,b requires epa to adopt increasingly stringent,effluent limitations for point sources once an effluent limitation is promulgated,e requires that it shall be applied to all point sources of discharge of pollutants in accordance with the provisions of the statute.e emphasis added.
similarly,requires epa to implement even more stringent standards of performance for new sources such as the new coeur alaska mine project b.to carry out directive,epa must promulgate a list of categories of sources and,for new sources within each category,establish a national standard of performance also referred to as a new source performance standard.id.a standard of performance is defined as a standard for the control of the discharge of pollutants which reflects the greatest degree of effluent reduction which epa determines to be achievable through application of the best available demonstrated control technology,processes,operating methods,or other alternatives,including,where practicable,a standard permitting no discharge of pollutants.a emphasis added.as with the effluent reductions promulgated under states that,once a standard of performance takes effect,it shall be unlawful for any owner or operator of any new source to operate such source in violation of any standard of performance applicable to such source.e.congress thus intended these regulations to be absolute prohibitions.du pont de nemours train du pont,d citing,at.the legislative history of indicates that congress made a deliberate choice not to allow variances for new sources.riverkeeper,epa,cir.as such,no exceptions to a standard of performance are allowed.see du pont,at.
to ensure compliance with effluent limitations and performance standards established pursuant to and,congress created the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit program under of the act.through the npdes program,epa may permit a discharge,but only if it complies with and.additionally,npdes permits are supposed to limit the release of pollutants into waterways as much as possible by imposing numerical discharge restrictions.rybachek epa,cir.for this reason,the npdes permit program is considered central to the enforcement of the clean water act.natural res.def.council,costle.
in addition to the npdes permit program,the clean water act established a secondary permit program for the discharge of dredged or fill material under.according to,the corps may issue permits for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters at specified disposal sites.a.we conclude that the permit scheme under is a limited permit program that applies only to dredged or fill material,not to the discharge of pollutants from industrial or municipal sources.
the language of the clean water act is clear on the issue at the center of this dispute.first,a prohibits any discharge that does not comply with several enumerated sections,including both and,as well as and.a.the use of and as a connector,instead of or,indicates that congress intended for effluent limitations and standards of performance to apply to all applicable discharges,even those that facially qualify for permitting under.second,e applies effluent limitations established by epa to all discharges.e.third,e prohibits any discharge that does not comply with performance standards promulgated by epa.e.in clear and precise terms,and require that discharges comply with applicable effluent limitations and standards of performance.neither nor contains an exception for discharges that would otherwise qualify for regulation under.rather,and are absolute prohibitions with no exceptions.du pont,at.
nevertheless,the defendants argue that and do not apply to permits because explicitly requires compliance with those sections whereas does not.the defendants then reason,by way of negative inference,that contains an implied exception to the requirements of and whenever a proposed discharge would meet the agencies regulatory definition of fill material.we disagree.negative inferences and implied exceptions are generally disfavored.as the supreme court stated in united states rutherford,d exceptions to clearly delineated statutes will be implied only where essential to prevent absurd results or consequences obviously at variance with the policy of the enactment as a whole.id.at.citing helvering hammel.that is because courts have generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion of particular language.warren me.bd.of envtl,d quoting bates united states,d.the defendants have produced no compelling reason to believe that congress intended an exception within that it did not explicitly create.if the defendants interpretation were correct,congress would have written and within,not as separate sections.moreover,the implied exception urged by the defendants,if adopted,would turn into an exception that swallows the rule created by,and by allowing the corps to use a negative inference from an exception clause within.thus,silence regarding the explicit and detailed requirements in and can not create an exception to those sections blanket prohibitions.
the defendants interpretation would render e and e effectively meaningless.courts strive to avoid interpreting a statute in a manner that renders other provisions of the same statute inconsistent,meaningless,or superfluous.boise cascade epa,cir,quoted in gonzales,cir see also ratzlaf united states,d watt alaska,d we must read the statutes to give effect to each if we can do so while preserving their sense and purpose.if the defendants were correct,the words all in e and any in e would lose their meaning entirely.
there is a much simpler explanation for the difference in language between and than the defendants proposed negative inference.if epa has adopted an effluent limitation or performance standard applicable to a relevant source of pollution,and preclude the use of a permit scheme for that discharge.see,may,joint response to comments may.accordingly,the npdes program administered by epa under is the only appropriate permitting mechanism for discharges subject to an effluent limitation under or a standard of performance under.consequently,there was simply no need for congress to enumerate or within because congress never intended for to govern discharges subject to effluent limitations or performance standards.rather,when a discharge is subject to an effluent limitation or performance standard,that discharge must comply with the npdes program as required by.see.at.this construction of the statute preserves the full meaning of all of its provisions without rendering any provision superfluous or resorting to negative inferences and implied exceptions.
additionally,although does not contain an explicit exception to effluent limitations or standards of performance,it does contain exceptions to other provisions of the clean water act.specifically,f exempts discharges of dredged or fill material from certain activities from regulation under a,and.f.discharges related to agricultural activities and road construction,among others,are exempted under f.mining is not listed as an exempt activity.where congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition,additional exceptions are not to be implied,in the absence of evidence of a contrary legislative intent.andrus glover constr,d.the defendants have produced no reason to believe that congress intended additional exemptions to be created later.therefore,the lack of any explicit exception to and within,and the lack of an exception for process wastewater from mines,is strong evidence that congress did not intend one.id.even stronger evidence is congress insistence in f that even the discharges from the enumerated activities continue to be subject to effluent standards.f.
thus,the plain language of the clean water act directly resolves the conflict between the regulatory definition of fill material and epa performance standard for mill operations.pursuant to and,epa performance standard for mills governs this situation.the language of does not lead to a contrary conclusion.
although the plain language of the clean water act resolves the apparent regulatory conflict at the heart of this case,the regulatory history further demonstrates that neither the corps nor epa intended for the current regulatory definition of fill material to replace the performance standard for mills.courts consider contemporaneous explanations of regulations,such as those published in the federal register through rulemaking,in order to determine an agency intent.see hillsborough county automated med,d friends of yosemite valley norton,cir league of wilderness mountains biodiversity project forsgren,cir kentuckians for the commonwealth,rivenburgh,cir.and courts will not defer to an agency interpretation of a regulation that contradicts the agency intent at the time it promulgated the regulation.gonzales oregon,d thomas jefferson shalala,d alaska trojan gutierrez,cir see also auer robbins,d an agency interpretation of a regulation is not entitled to deference where it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation quoting bowles seminole rock sand.when the agencies promulgated the current definition in,they foresaw and specifically addressed the potential conflict between the definition of fill material and performance standards already in place.to that end,the agencies explicitly stated that wastes subject to performance standards and effluent limitations would not be considered fill material.the corps application of the fill rule in this case,therefore,contradicts its interpretation at the time the regulation was promulgated.
following its statutory obligation under and,in epa promulgated effluent limitations and standards of performance for sources within the category of ore mining.see.june,proposed,final.within this category,epa established a subcategory that applied to gold mining.see.for gold mines using the mill process,epa promulgated a standard 
except as provided in paragraph b of this section,there shall be no discharge of process to navigable waters from mills that use the process alone,or in conjunction with other processes,for the beneficiation of copper,lead,zinc,gold,silver,or molybdenum ores or any combination of these ores.
b emphasis added see also.at proposing zero discharge.epa found that the standard was practicable because the majority of facilities existing at the time already achieved zero discharge through recycling and evaporation processes.at.epa promulgated this standard knowing that process wastewater discharges from mills contain a large amount of suspended solids that could otherwise qualify for regulation under pursuant to its definition of fill material.see.at mill process wastewater is characterized by very high suspended solids levels often in the percent range rather than milligrams per liter.in determining that a strict limit was appropriate,epa determined that the best available control technology included the complete recycling of process wastewater.see.at.given that the regulation facially applies to any discharge from a mill,and that it provides some limited exceptions that do not include fill material,epa intended for the prohibition to apply to discharges that would otherwise qualify as fill material under.see.at.this conclusion is also supported by the fact that epa promulgated the regulation notwithstanding its definition of fill material,which was identical to the definition used by both agencies today.
the history of the current fill rule also demonstrates that both agencies intended for effluent limitations and performance standards to apply even to discharges that facially meet the definition of the term fill material.the clean water act does not define the term fill material.instead,congress implicitly left that term to the corps and epa to define.see res,army corps of eng rs,cir.as with most regulatory definitions,the agencies definitions of fill material have evolved over time.in fact,prior to the current regulatory definition of fill material,the corps and epa defined fill material differently.the corps initially used an test,which defined fill material as any pollutant used to create fill in the traditional sense of replacing an aquatic area with dry land or of changing the bottom elevation of a water body for any purpose,july.epa later adopted the identical definition.two years later,the corps revised its definition and adopted a test,which excluded from its definition any pollutant discharged into the water primarily to dispose of waste,july.in adopting its definition,the corps explained that there were many waste materials which technically fit within our definition of fill material but which were intended to be regulated under the npdes program.id.at.epa,in,chose to keep its test.see,may.
the agencies differing definitions of fill material created a potential regulatory overlap.see,res,at,acknowledging overlap kentuckians,at the corps acknowledged that the differing approaches in defining fill material employed by epa and the corps in their regulations had created some uncertainty about their interpretation of the clean water act.many industrial wastes contain a high proportion of suspended solids and,therefore,have the effect of changing the bottom elevation of a body of water.as such,those wastes could have been considered fill material under epa definition.however,epa continued to regulate many of those industrial wastes under,and also continued to promulgate new effluent limitations and standards of performance for industrial pollutants with high concentrations of solids,regardless of their potential to raise the bottom elevation of a body of water.see,regulating discharges of suspended solids from processes.indeed,the new source performance standard for mills was adopted in,despite the fact that waste from this process would have the effect of raising bottom elevation and,therefore,could otherwise constitute fill material under epa test.see.at.thus,notwithstanding the potential regulatory overlap created by the agencies differing definitions,epa regulated many industrial pollutants under.the agencies formally adopted this practice in a memorandum of agreement on solid waste moa in.after adoption of the moa in,the corps continually declined to exercise jurisdiction over mine tailings 
in,the agencies promulgated their joint regulation defining the terms fill material and discharge of fill material.at.the current regulatory definition of fill material provides 
except as specified in paragraph e of this section,the term fill material means material placed in waters of the united states where the material has the effect of 
i replacing any portion of a water of the united states with dry land or 
ii changing the bottom elevation of any portion of a water of the united states.
examples of such fill material include,but are not limited to rock,sand,soil,clay,plastics,construction debris,wood chips,overburden from mining or other excavation activities,and materials used to create any structure or infrastructure in the waters of the united states.
the term fill material does not include trash or garbage.
e corps regulation epa regulation emphasis added.the agencies also defined discharge of fill material as follows 
the term discharge of fill material means the addition of fill material into waters of the united states.the term generally includes,without limitation,the following activities placement of overburden,slurry,or tailings or similar materials 
at the same time,however,the agencies made clear that they did not intend to change their practice,according to which epa regulates discharges of pollutants for which it has established effluent limitations or standards of performance under the npdes program 
w e emphasize that today rule generally is intended to maintain our existing approach to regulating pollutants under either section or of the cwa.effluent limitation guidelines and new source performance standards effluent guidelines promulgated under section and of the cwa establish limitations and standards for specified wastestreams from industrial categories,and those limitations and standards are incorporated into permits issued under section of the act.epa has never sought to regulate fill material under effluent guidelines.rather,effluent guidelines restrict discharges of pollutants from identified wastestreams based upon the pollutant reduction capabilities of available treatment technologies.recognizing that some discharges such as suspended or settleable solids can have the associated effect,over time,of raising the bottom elevation of a water due to settling of waterborne pollutants,we do not consider such pollutants to be fill material,and nothing in today rule changes that view.nor does today rule change any determination we have made regarding discharges that are subject to an effluent limitation guideline and standards,which will continue to be regulated under section of the cwa.similarly,this rule does not alter the manner in which water quality standards currently apply under the section or the section programs.
at emphasis added.additionally,in their joint response to comments to the proposed rule,the agencies restated this position 
under today rule,we will continue,consistent with our practice,to rely on the existence of effluent limitation guidelines or standards or a npdes permit to inform the determination of how a particular discharge is regulated under the act.if a specific discharge is regulated under section,it would not also be regulated under section,and vice versa.
joint response to comments.in the same document,the agencies clarified that the new rule would not expand the jurisdiction of the corps or permit previously prohibited discharges the suggestion that this rulemaking now provides a legal basis for previously illegal activities is not the discharges that were previously prohibited are now authorized as a result of this rulemaking.id.thus,the agencies clearly intended to exclude discharges subject to effluent limitations or performance standards from the new definition of fill material.
in fact,when the corps and epa first proposed the revised,coordinated definition in,they included an explicit exemption from the definition of fill material for discharges subject to effluent limitations or standards of performance.see.the stated purpose of the exemption was to maintain the agencies current practice,which was consistent with paragraph of the solid waste moa.id.at.although the agencies removed the explicit exemption from the final rule,they did so only because commenters expressed concern that the exception was vague and would create uncertainty regarding whether the reference to effluent guidelines applied prospectively or only to those guidelines already in existence at the time.see.at.as such,the agencies still intended to regulate discharges subject to effluent limitations and standards of performance under.
the defendants attempt to undermine the clear intent of the agencies by focusing on a single sentence of the preamble in which the agencies stated material that has the effect of fill when discharged will be regulated as fill material.id.the district court also relied on that one sentence.however,the defendants and the district court give far more weight to that singular statement than it deserves.it is difficult to understand why the agencies would painstakingly explain in the preamble that the new definition would not change their treatment of discharges
