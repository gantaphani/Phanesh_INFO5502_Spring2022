the united states army corps of engineers corps manages the missouri river mainstem reservoir system the system under the flood control act of,stat.the system consists primarily of a series of dams and reservoirs on the upper river.the corps governing operational document is the missouri river mainstem reservoir master water control manual the master manual,which has been revised five times since its initial adoption in.the corps also publishes specific operational details in an annual operating plan.
in recent years,persistent drought conditions have challenged the corps ability to perform its dominant flood control act functions of flood control and maintaining downstream navigation while also continuing to benefit secondary uses such as irrigation,recreation,fish,and wildlife.forced to make difficult choices,the corps has faced repeated lawsuits by competing beneficial users of the river as controlled by the system.in south dakota ubbelohde,cir,cert.denied,d,we reversed the grant of preliminary injunctions preventing the corps from releasing waters from reservoir lakes in south dakota and north dakota in order to maintain downstream navigation.meanwhile,environmental groups sued,and the judicial panel on litigation consolidated all actions in the district of minnesota.in march,the corps issued a revised master manual the master manual containing provisions prompted by a biological opinion issued by the fish and wildlife service fws under the endangered species act.see.competing users challenged the actions of both agencies on numerous grounds.in in re operation of the missouri river system litigation,cir,cert.denied,hereinafter.river,we affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of both agencies.
in this action,a sequel to.river,the state of missouri claims that the corps violated the national environmental policy act nepa by implementing march revisions to the master manual without preparing a supplemental environmental impact statement seis.the district court granted the corps motion for summary judgment.missouri appeals.we conclude that the corps actions were not arbitrary and capricious and therefore affirm.
acting under the endangered species act,fws listed the least tern as endangered and the piping plover as threatened in and the pallid sturgeon as endangered in.in developing the master manual,the corps consulted fws after both agencies determined that operation of the system jeopardizes these protected species.in,fws issued a biological opinion biop that included a reasonable and prudent alternative rpa recommending various actions by the corps to mimic the natural hydrograph of the river to benefit the listed species.see.river,at.a key recommendation was a spring rise a controlled release of additional water from the gavins point dam for thirty days every three years.the biop explained that the spring rise would act as a spawning cue for pallid sturgeon,provide an influx of nutrients from the floodplain for all three species,and scour sandbars to allow terns and plovers to nest more safely.
in the final environmental impact statement feis for the master manual,the corps analyzed the projected economic and environmental effects of five alternatives to the water control spring low flow release options from the gavins point dam based upon the fws rpa,and a modified conservation plan that did not include a spring rise but instead focused on drought conservation measures,reservoir balancing,minimum water flows,and implementation of an adaptive management process to give the corps flexibility to adjust the system.the feis chose the modified conservation plan as its preferred alternative but noted that the absence of a spring rise may result in jeopardy of the three listed species and with the endangered species act.
after reviewing the feis and consulting with the corps,fws issued an amended biop in november the amended biop that gave the corps two more years to develop an acceptable alternative to the spring rise.if no alternative was developed,the fws amended rpa imposed a default plan including a spring rise beginning in for the benefit of the endangered pallid sturgeon.the default plan prescribed an annual bimodal spring rise,with releases from the gavins point dam in both march and may.in march,the corps adopted the master manual including the modified conservation plan.the agency record of decision rod acknowledged a continuing obligation to evaluate a spring rise as mandated by the amended biop.the rod declared 
decisions concerning implementation of additional measures including potential release changes out of gavins point dam,will be made through the adaptive management process.the reevaluation will include input from missouri river stakeholders to foster conservation of endangered species species and the broader ecosystem values of the missouri river while providing other congressionally authorized system project purposes.
in.river,rejecting multiple attacks on the master manual based on the flood control act,the endangered species act,and nepa,we described the modified conservation plan as a plan consistent with the amended biop.at.
following adoption of the master manual,the corps formed a plenary group of numerous missouri basin stakeholders,including the missouri department of natural resources,to develop a recommendation on the spring rise issue.the plenary group met four times in the summer of.though unable to reach a consensus,the group provided input and technical assistance.in october,the corps released for review and comment a draft annual operating plan and draft technical criteria for a spring pulse water control plan.like the fws amended rpa,the plan includes a bimodal spring releases from the gavins point dam in march and in may.both the march pulse and the may pulse are precluded if the reservoir system is not storing at least million acre feet of water in the first year and million acre feet in any subsequent year.if not precluded,the march pulse begins the day after the flow out of gavins point dam reaches the minimum level necessary for downstream navigation.the pulse consists of a peak release of up to cubic feet per second in addition to the existing flow,followed by gradually reduced releases for five days until the flow is reduced to the downstream flow level.the may pulse begins between may and may,depending upon water temperatures,and increases by approximately cubic feet per second per day until the peak is achieved.the peak varies depending upon factors such as system storage,downstream flow limits,and the risk a release will take threatened or endangered species.the pulse is then reduced over ten days to the downstream flow level.
following public meetings and a public comment period,the corps prepared an ea comparing the impacts of the proposed bimodal spring rise plan,the default bimodal spring rise plan in the fws amended biop,the spring rise alternatives analyzed in the feis,the water control plan,and the modified conservation plan adopted in the master manual.the ea calculated the benefits provided by each plan measured by fifteen different criteria it reported that the impacts of the proposed bimodal spring rise plan are within the range of impacts of the alternatives considered in the feis that contained spring pulse releases.the ea also compared the proposed bimodal spring rise plan with water release data from the operation of the system since its inception in,concluding that the proposed peak releases are well within the normal operating range of gavins point dam and significantly lower than the historical maximum daily release rates set in.analyzing historical flood damage data,the ea also reported that,because of downstream flow limits and other flood control measures,the proposed spring rise plan would rarely,if ever,result in increased flooding and crop damages beyond what would occur without a spring rise.
based upon this analysis,the ea concluded that there are no new significant environmental impacts of the proposed action that have not been evaluated in the feis and that warrant the preparation of a supplement to the final environmental impact statement pr
