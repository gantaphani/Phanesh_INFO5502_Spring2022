public water supply district of laclede county,missouri the district brought this suit against nearby city of lebanon,missouri the city,alleging that the city is illegally providing water and sewer services to customers within the district boundaries.the district argues that the city,in providing services to these customers,violated the requirement of b that t he service provided or made available through the district shall not be curtailed or limited.because we conclude that the district is not entitled to b protection for any of the disputed customers,with the possible exception of customers at one property development,we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part the district court grant of summary judgment to the city.
background 
the district was created in to provide water service to customers within boundaries established in the district decree of incorporation.in,the decree of incorporation was amended to authorize the district also to provide sewer service.on august,the district closed on a million loan from the united states department of agriculture the usda loan.the usda loan was made pursuant to a and was for the purpose of extending and improving the district sewer system.the usda loan was secured by the district net revenue from its sewer operations.as a federally indebted rural water association,the district became insulated from competition under b,which protects a rural water association service area from certain incursions by nearby cities.specifically,b states that 
t he service provided or made available through any such association shall not be curtailed or limited by inclusion of the area served by such association within the boundaries of any municipal corporation or other public body,or by the granting of any private franchise for similar service within such area during the term of such loan nor shall the happening of any such event be the basis of requiring such association to secure any franchise,license,or permit as a condition to continuing to serve the area served by the association at the time of the occurrence of such event.
at the time the district closed on the usda loan,the city was already providing sewer and water services to some customers within the district boundaries.after the district closed on the usda loan,the city extended service to additional customers within the district boundaries,though not to any customers whom the district was already serving.
on october,the district filed this suit against the city,alleging that the city violated b by providing sewer and water services to certain customers within the district boundaries.the district sought injunctive relief to prevent the city from continuing to serve these customers,as well as damages from the date the district closed on the usda loan,august.this dispute centers on the district claim that,as a result of its usda loan for sewer development,b entitles the district to be the exclusive sewer and water service provider for customers to whom the district has made service available but to whom the city currently provides service.these disputed customers can be divided into three sets sewer customers the city began serving before august,water customers,regardless of when the city began providing service to them and sewer customers living in seven tracts of properties that the city began serving after august,the district court granted the city motion for summary judgment,holding that b does not entitle the district to be the exclusive service provider for any of these sets of disputed customers.the district appeals.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.irving dormire,cir.the consolidated farm and rural development act of authorizes the usda to issue loans to associations,including corporations not operated for profit,indian tribes on federal and state reservations and other federally recognized indian tribes,and public and agencies.a.we will refer to these associations as rural districts.the qualifying federal loans made to rural districts are to provide for the application or establishment of soil conservation practices,shifts in land use,the conservation,development,use,and control of water,and the installation or improvement of drainage or waste disposal facilities,recreational developments,and essential community facilities.id.when such a loan is made,b protects the federally indebted rural district service area from certain incursions by nearby cities.
we have only once before addressed the merits of a claim based on b.see rural water.city of sioux center,cir.in sioux center,we noted that any d oubts about whether a water association is entitled to protection from competition under b should be resolved in favor of the usda indebted party seeking protection for its territory.id.at quoting sequoyah county rural water dist.town of muldrow,cir.nonetheless,o ur role is to interpret and apply statutes as written,for the power to redraft laws to implement policy changes is reserved to the legislative branch.doe dep t of veterans affairs,cir.with these principles in mind,we proceed to address the district claims with respect to each of the three sets of disputed customers.
the district closed on the usda loan on august.the district argues that as of august the city lost its right to serve sewer customers within the district boundaries,even though the city began serving many of those customers before the district obtained the usda loan.the city urges us to reject the district continued service theory by holding that the city continuing to provide service to these customers does not violate b because the statute merely prevents cities from commencing service to new customers.consequently,we must decide whether the timing of the city initial provision of service to these customers is relevant to whether the city violated b.the scope of b protection,which depends in part on the relevance of the timing of the city initial provision of service,is a question of statutory interpretation,which we review de novo,see indep.drivers ass united van lines,llc,cir.
as with any question of statutory interpretation,our analysis begins with the plain language of the statute.jimenez quarterman.the key operative provision of b provides that a rural district service shall not be curtailed or limited.in this context,the verbs curtail and limit connote something being taken from the current holder,rather than something being retained by the holder to the exclusion of another.see the new shorter oxford english dictionary,ed defining curtail as s horten in extent or amount abridge defining limit as set bounds to restrict see also csl,jennings water,cir the cases and fragments of legislative history available to us all seem to have in mind curtailment resulting from substitution of some third party as a for the rural district.emphasis added moreover,b enumerated methods of curtailing or limiting a rural district service area inclusion of the area within the boundaries of any municipal corporation or granting of any private franchise for similar service reinforce the notion that the statute prevents a city from taking customers served by a rural district,not a city passive continuation of service to its customers thus,both the terms ordinary meanings and their particular usages within the statute are inconsistent with the district argument that it is entitled to take sewer customers whom the city started serving before the district obtained the usda loan.these key terms suggest that a city curtails or limits service within the meaning of b when it initially provides service to a customer,not when it continues to do so.
furthermore,the plain language of the statute specifically restricts its application to such associations.emphasis added.giving effect to the term such requires that we read the statute to protect a subset of all rural districts,namely,only those rural districts that have a qualifying federal loan.because the district claims that the timing of the city initial provision of service is irrelevant,the district would essentially remove this limitation from the statute,forcing cities to operate in the shadow of b,even when a nearby rural district had no qualifying federal loan.under this scenario,cities would face the constant threat that a rural district will someday obtain a qualifying federal loan and bring suit under b,thereby stranding the city investment in infrastructure it had already built to serve those customers.a rural district would be insulated from competition even without a qualifying federal loan because no rational city would make such an investment under those circumstances.thus,the principle of statutory interpretation that require s statutes to be construed in a manner that gives effect to all of their provisions,united states ex rel.eisenstein city of new york,counsels against adopting the district continued service theory as the proper interpretation of b.the statute plain language suggests that the scope of protection against competition is more limited than the district continued service theory would allow.
additionally,b includes a specific timing element.in particular,it provides that service shall not be curtailed or limited during the term of such loan.this phrase limits the scope of a rural district exclusive provider status to the period during which the qualifying federal loan is outstanding.the district argument that the city continuing to provide service to its existing customers violates b effectively eliminates this phrase from the statute.under the district view,at any point in time a rural district can obtain a qualifying federal loan and then challenge a city continuing to provide service,regardless of whether a city incursion occurred during the term of such loan.here again,we reject the district interpretation as inconsistent with the rule that statutes are to be construed in a manner that gives effect to all of their provisions,eisenstein.at 
finally,i nterpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text,considering the purpose and context of the statute.dolan postal,congress enacted section b to encourage rural water development and to provide greater security for usda loans.sioux center,at.rejecting the district continued service theory is not inconsistent with these purposes.again,if b permitted rural districts to capture customers that a city began serving before a rural district obtained a qualifying federal loan,cities would not be willing to invest in the necessary infrastructure to serve customers within a rural district boundaries because such investments would be rendered worthless by a rural district that obtains a qualifying federal loan.creating such a disincentive would undermine the purpose of encouraging rural utility development.additionally,rural districts can continue to use b to protect their exclusive right to serve their existing customer base during the time of the qualifying federal loan,thereby ensuring the continued security of the loan.in sum,the plain language of the statute,the rule in favor of giving effect to all terms in the statute,and our analysis of the statute purposes all confirm that the city did not violate b merely by continuing to provide service to those customers it began serving before the district obtained the usda loan.
other circuits have also addressed this question,though in cases presenting somewhat different facts.analyzing b curtailed and limited language in a similar manner,the sixth circuit distinguishes between offensive and defensive uses of b.see water dist.city of athens,cir the statute use of phrases like curtailed and limited to describe the municipality interference with the rural water association suggests that a rural water association must already be providing service to an area before the protections of b apply.in,the sixth circuit rejected a rural water district attempt to use b to become the exclusive service provider for a new development that it had not previously served.id.the sixth circuit adopted a categorical rule prohibiting rural districts from making offensive use of b by seeking to use the statute to foist an incursion of its own on users that it has never served or made agreements to serve.id.at.in contrast,the court read b to authorize defensive uses,allowing rural districts to use the statute to protect their users or territory from municipal incursion.id.
we recognize that the tenth circuit has addressed this question twice before and taken a contrary approach,albeit without much discussion of the issue.see pittsburg county rural water dist.city of mcalester,cir sequoyah county rural water dist.town of muldrow,cir.both pittsburg county and sequoyah county involved rural water districts that were previously federally indebted,but both districts later paid off their qualifying federal loans.without active loans,b protection did not apply,and nearby cities began providing water service to customers within the rural water districts.after the cities started providing service to these customers,the rural water districts acquired new qualifying federal loans under a,restoring their b protection.in both cases,the tenth circuit held that the districts could sue to reclaim the customers that the cities began serving during the time between the districts periods of federal indebtedness.on this view,all claims based on service by a city to customers within the limitations period were not otherwise barred by the fact that the city was serving those customers prior to the subsequent loan.pittsburg county,at see also id.the fact that a municipality had provided service to those properties prior to the qualifying federal loan was no bar in sequoyah to claims arising out of a city service during the period of indebtedness.
none of these cases is precisely analogous to this case.in,the rural district brought suit over customers outside the association boundaries,while here the customers are within the district boundaries and unlike the rural districts in pittsburgh county and sequoyah county,the district never had a qualifying federal loan before august,and thus never had b protection with respect to customers the city served before that date.nonetheless,neither of those distinctions affects our analysis of this issue.to the extent there is a conflict between these cases,we find the sixth circuit distinction between offensive and defensive uses of b in to be more persuasive and consistent with our reading of the statute.section b provides a shield,not a sword.because we conclude that the city continuing to provide service to customers it began serving before the district obtained the usda loan does not violate b,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment with respect to this set of customers.
the district next challenges the city right to provide water service to customers within the district boundaries.although the usda loan was secured to expand the district sewer system and was secured only by its sewer revenues,the district argues that the usda loan also triggers b protection with respect to its water service.we must determine whether t he service provided or made available under b refers solely to the service for which a qualifying federal loan was obtained and which provides the collateral for the loan,as the city argues,or to all services that a rural district provides,as the district would have us hold.this appears to be a question of first impression as another question of statutory interpretation,we review the issue de novo.see indep.drivers ass n,at.
we again begin with the plain language of the statute,jimenez.at,which refers to t he service provided or made available.both parties argue that the plain language supports their position,and each accuses the other of reading additional terms into the statute.the district claims that adopting the city interpretation would change the phrase the service into the financed service,adding a restrictive term to the statute.the city argues that adopting the district interpretation would add an expansive term to the statute,changing the service into all services.these arguments underscore the ambiguity in the phrase the service provided or made available.the term service,standing alone,reasonably may be read to refer to a single type of service or to multiple types of service.thus,b isolated use of the term service,without explanation,provides little insight into the interpretive question before us.
however,w e do not construe statutory phrases in isolation we read statutes as a whole.united states morton.notably,a repeatedly employs both the terms service and services.in doing so,congress distinguished between a single service and multiple types of services.compare a b the term project shall include facilities providing central service,and a e t he secretary may make grants to state agencies for use by regulatory commissions in states with rural communities without local broadband service,with a b i directing the secretary of agriculture to consider the extent to which the applicant provides development services,which include training,establishing business centers,and analyzing business opportunities,and a e describing grants to cable operators that establish common carrier facilities and services,and a describing grants to local governments to improve the infrastructure,services,and business development capabilities of local governments emphasis added throughout.in b,congress used only the singular term service.read in pari materia with a,congress pattern of using the singular to refer to a single type of service while using the plural to refer to a collection of multiple types of services is decisive.because b employs the singular term,we conclude that the service provided or made available is best interpreted to include only the type of service financed by the qualifying federal loan 
as before,we also look to the whole statutory text,considering the purpose and context of the statute,dolan,at,which in this case is to encourage rural water development and to provide greater security for usda loans,sioux center,at.while adopting the district broad view of the scope of protection would undoubtedly benefit the district and other rural districts,it would not promote rural water development because other services a rural district might happen to provide are irrelevant to maintaining the necessary economies of scale to allow rural utility associations to remain viable and to keeping the cost low for the service financed by the loan.see alamo water supply city of san juan,cir describing how congress crafted b to address these issues.the district position also is incompatible with the purpose of encouraging rural water development because expanding b to protect services unrelated to the qualifying federal loan would prohibit cities from providing other services to customers within a district boundaries even when the city is perhaps better situated to do so,thereby forcing customers to remain with less desirable service providers.turning to the second purpose,limiting the district protection under the statute solely to the type of service being service in this not appreciably impact the security of the federal loan.the revenues from the district sewer system secure the usda loan the district water revenues are not collateral for the loan.the district existing sewer customers and revenues remain protected under b.in short,divorcing the type of service underlying a rural district qualifying federal loan from the type of service that b protects would stretch the statute too far.because we interpret the service provided or made available to be limited to the financed service,sewer service here,we affirm the grant of summary judgment to the city with respect to water customers within the district boundaries.
the district also challenges the city provision of sewer service to customers at seven tracts of properties that the city did not begin serving until after the district closed on the usda loan.this challenge represents a more typical b claim in that it involves both customers who were not served until after the district obtained the usda loan and the same type of service financed by the loan.we thus apply the test for determining whether a rural district is entitled to protection under b.to qualify for protection,an entity must be an association under the statute,have a qualifying federal loan,and have provided or made service available to the disputed area.see,sequoyah county,at.with respect to the customers at these seven tracts,the first two requirements are not in dispute.making service available has two components the physical ability to serve an area and the legal right to serve an area.sioux center,at.because the district court granted the city motion for summary judgment,we view the evidence concerning the district physical abilities and legal rights in the light most favorable to the district.see irving dormire,cir 
in,the district amended its decree of incorporation to authorize providing sewer service in addition to the water service it was already providing.the district claims that,at that time,it began designing and constructing a wastewater treatment facility.however,the district did not secure an operating permit that would allow for discharge of wastewater from that facility until may.by then,the city had already begun serving all of the disputed customers,with the exception of those in one tract known as castle rock.
castle rock 
the city does not dispute that the district had the legal right to serve castle rock rather,it challenges whether the district had the physical ability to serve these customers.although the district had completed its wastewater treatment facility and obtained an operating permit for the facility at the time the city began serving castle rock,the district did not propose using this facility to provide service to customers at castle rock.instead,the district proposed having castle rock developer,becky burk,construct a new treatment facility to serve those customers.this separate facility would treat wastewater using recirculating sand filters or biomedia filters.the district does not provide much detail about this proposal,though it appears that individual septic systems would also need to be installed at each house.indeed,the parties dispute even basic objective facts,such as the visual impact the facility would have on the surrounding development.nonetheless,the district expert averred that the facility,in whatever form it would take,would cost burk approximately and take approximately one year to construct.
burk averred that the district proposal of forcing her to build a treatment facility was unacceptable.burk intended castle rock to be an development,and she insisted that her customers would not tolerate the individual septic systems involved in the district proposal.in fact,burk claimed that she would not have developed castle rock had she known that the district proposed method of providing sewer service would be forced on her.the district court accepted burk testimony and held that because the district proposal would not reasonably conform to the ideals and standards a developer or customer in a similar situation would expect,the district had not made service available within the meaning of b.as a result,the district court granted the city motion for summary judgment with respect to castle rock.
the district court misapplied the made service available test by improperly focusing on the preferences of the potential recipient of the service.the statute protects a rural district service wherever it has been made available,without restricting the methods of providing that service.the district court cited no authority for the proposition that courts should give dispositive effect to the ideals and standards a developer or customer in a similar situation would expect.and we can find no support for that proposition either in the text of b or in the cases interpreting the statute.although courts have recognized that a rural district proposed method of providing service,if unreasonably costly or unreasonably delayed,can constitute a constructive denial of service,see rural water district city of wilson,cir,allowing recipients preferences to restrict the acceptable methods through which a rural district can provide service would significantly dilute b protections we recognize that b can im
