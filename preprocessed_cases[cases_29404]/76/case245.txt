background 
factual summarya.central valley project 
the central valley project cvp is the largest federal water management project in the united states.central delta water agency united states,cir.l ocated in the central valley basin of california,which is roughly miles long by miles wide,it includes the major watersheds of the sacramento and san joaquin river systems.id.these two river valleys merge at the sacramento san joaquin delta,where the waters mix and then flow through the carquinez strait into the san francisco bay,continuing to the pacific ocean.united states gerlach live stock.the sacramento river has almost twice as much water as the san joaquin river but the sacramento valley has very little tillable soil,while about of the san joaquin valley lies in the domain of the less affluent san joaquin.gerlach live stock,at.see also dugan rank,d.to alter this imbalance and to make water available to the san joaquin valley,the state of california embarked on its natural water distribution through the authorization of the central valley project cvp united states took over administration of this project in gerlach live stock,at.
the cvp purpose is to improv e navigation,regulat e the flow of the san joaquin river and the sacramento river,control floods,provid e for storage and for the delivery of the stored waters thereof,for the reclamation of arid and semiarid lands and lands of indian reservations,and other beneficial uses,and for the generation and sale of electric energy.act of august,stat.to accomplish the project purposes,cvp construction includes a series of many dams,reservoirs,hydropower generating stations,canals,electrical transmission lines,and other infrastructure.gerlach live stock,at.
the united states bureau of reclamation bureau,a division of the department of the interior,operates the cvp.the california state water resources control board grants permits for water appropriation from the cvp.the bureau appropriates water from various sources and delivers it to permit holders for beneficial uses.central delta water,at.
san luis unit of the cvp 
the san luis unit,one of the many water management units of the cvp,was authorized by the san luis act of,stat.june.the san luis unit,an integral part of the cvp,consists of the san luis dam and the san luis reservoir.the san luis reservoir was constructed to provide water to merced,fresno and king counties,and is used to store surplus water from the joaquin delta,for delivery to contractors such as westlands and san benito.the tracy pumping plant pumps water from the joaquin delta into the canal.the canal,located south of the joaquin delta,channels water along the west side of the san joaquin valley for use in the san luis unit and reservoir.westlands water dist.patterson,westlands iii.
friant unit of the cvp 
around,the bureau took over construction of a dam on the san joaquin river that eventually created lake millerton and the friant unit of the central valley project see gerlach live stock,at.westlands iii.at.the friant unit impounds the waters of the san joaquin river at a dam constructed at friant,california,approximately sixty miles upstream from mendota,diverting a major portion of the flow of the san joaquin river both to storage in millerton lake and into the and madera canals for delivery to local water users.dugan,at.the cvp also diverts water from the sacramento river into the san joaquin valley to make additional water available for use in the san joaquin valley.
exchange contractors 
to fulfill the purposes of the rivers and harbors act of,the secretary of the interior was given the right to acquire water rights for the development of the cvp.act of august,stat.the exchange contractors hold both riparian and appropriative rights to the san joaquin river.cal.state water rights bd.the district court noted that the cooperation of the exchange contractors made possible the expansion of the cvp and the san luis unit.westlands water dist.united states,d,westlands vi to provide a reliable source of water for its proposed canals,the bureau had to assure that the exchange contractors rights would be satisfied.westlands iii.at.
in,the exchange contractors entered into two contracts with the united states a purchase contract and an exchange contract.under the purchase contract,the exchange contractors sold all of their san joaquin river water rights to the united states,except for reserved water,water to which the exchange contractors hold vested rights.simultaneously,under the exchange contract,the exchange contractors agreed not to exercise their reserved water rights to the san joaquin river,so long as they receive certain volumes of substitute water id.
pursuant to the exchange contract,the exchange of water is a conditional permanent substitution of water supply.the united states has a right to use the exchange contractors water rights so long as,and only so long as,the united states does deliver to the contracting entities by means of the project or otherwise substitute water in conformity with this contract.the exchange contract defines substitute water as all water delivered regardless of source.the contract further provides that i t is anticipated that most if not all of the substitute water provided the exchange contractors hereunder will be delivered to them via the canal.
water allocation in any year is designated as a full year supply of percent.in critical years,the water supply can be reduced by approximately percent.if there exists a temporary interruption of waters from the canal,the contract provides that the united states will deliver water stored in millerton lake behind the friant dam.
westlands and san benito water districts 
san benito and westlands purchase cvp water from the bureau pursuant to water service contracts.
westlands is a california water district located within fresno and king counties.in,westlands entered into a contract with the bureau for water from the san luis unit of the cvp,which diverts water from the joaquin river delta via the canal.westlands is the largest contractor for water from the san luis unit,firebaugh canal united states,cir,with a contractual entitlement to purchase acre feet of water annually,united states,cir.pursuant to article a of the westlands contract,this entitlement is limited during times of water shortage 
there may occur at times during any year a shortage in the quantity of water available for furnishing to the district through and by means of the project,but in no event shall any liability accrue against the united states for any damage arising from a shortage on account of errors in operation,drought,or any other causes.in any year in which there may occur a shortage from any cause,the united states reserves the right to apportion the available water supply among the district and others entitled under the then existing contracts to receive water from the san luis unit in accordance with conclusive determinations of the contracting officer as follows 
i a determination shall be made of the total quantity of water agreed to be accepted during the respective year under all contracts then in force for the delivery of central valley project water by the united states from the san luis unit,the quantity so determined being hereinafter referred to as the contractual commitments 
ii a determination shall be made of the total quantity of water from the central valley project which is available for meeting the contractual commitments,the quantity so determined being hereinafter referred to as the available supply 
iii the total quantity of water agreed to be accepted by the district during the respective year,under article hereof,shall be divided by the contractual commitments,the quotient thus obtained being hereinafter referred to as the district contractual entitlements and 
iv the available supply shall be multiplied by the district contractual entitlement and the result shall be the quantity of water required to be delivered by the united states to the district for the respective year 
westlands contract,a.

water year allocations 
in february,the regional director for the bureau announced annual cvp water allocations for the water year march,to february.appellants westlands and san benito were granted of their contractual percentage of the available supply and the exchange contractors were granted of their contractual critical supply see westlands iii.at.due to the water year shortage,the exchange contractors were provided with additional water from the san luis reservoir.
ii.procedural history 
appellants previously challenged the bureau allocation of water for water years and.see westlands water dist.firebaugh canal,cir westlands i affirming the district court decision that the bureau did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in its water allocation decisions westlands water dist.united states.in westlands i,we rejected the appellants interpretation of their contracts with the bureau.at.we stated,however,that the appellants should not be foreclosed from arguing in a future suit that the bureau has violated its contractual obligations to apportion water as required by the westlands and san benito contracts.id.at.
westlands and san benito filed a complaint with the district court in march against the united states of america,department of interior,bureau of reclamation,regional director of the region of the bureau of reclamation,and the secretary of the interior collectively federal defendants,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the enforcement of the bureau water allocations 
appellants allege violations of their water service contracts with the united states and request the court to reapportion water allocations,subject to prohibitions in existing contracts,the exchange contractors,the friant power authority,certain members of the friant water users association,the chowchilla water district,and the madera irrigation district join the federal defendants in opposing the relief sought by appellants.
appellants motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the water allocation decisions and to compel equal apportionment was denied by the district court.westlands iii.during the course of this litigation,appellants filed a motion to dismiss its suit without prejudice appellee united states filed a motion for summary judgment.the district court denied appellants motion to dismiss,but granted appellee motion for summary judgment.westlands water district patterson.westlands iv.on appeal,we reversed the district court grant of summary judgment to appellee united states and reversed the denial of appellant water district motion to dismiss its suit against appellee because the suit should have been dismissed without prejudice.westlands water dist.united states,cir westlands v.
in july,the district court issued an order conditioning voluntary dismissal on appellants payment of attorneys fees and costs to intervenors.appellants elected not to pay the attorneys fees and costs and instead,elected to proceed on the merits.westlands vi,d at.the parties filed for summary judgment,and the district court granted defendants and motions with respect to all of plaintiffs claims.the district court held that the plaintiffs water service contracts did not prevent the bureau from satisfying its obligations to senior water rights holders before allocating water under its water service contracts.westlands and san benito appeal alleging that the bureau allocation of water in violated the terms of their water service contracts.
standard of review 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.see oliver keller,cir.if genuine issues of material fact exist,summary judgment is not proper.meade cedarapids,cir.the court reviews de novo principles of contract interpretation as applied to the facts.in particular,the determination of whether contract language is ambiguous is a question of law,at citations omitted.
discussion 
one of the most contentious issues in the western united states is the management of water resources.central delta water,at.this case involves contract interpretations involving a precious resource,cvp water.three contracts are involved the exchange contract,the westlands water service contract,and the san benito water service contract.appellants allege that the district court erred in granting summary judgment,raising seven issues concerning the district court interpretation of their water service contracts.in sum,the issues address whether the water service contracts,under which westlands and san benito purchase irrigation water from the bureau,prevent the bureau from excluding water owed to senior water rights holders from supplies subject to apportionment under the contracts during periods of water shortage.since we affirm the district court determination that the exchange contractors prior rights are not subject to the distributions included in the westlands and san benito water service contracts,we do not reach the other issues raised on appeal.
equitable estoppel 
we stated in westlands i that appellants should not be foreclosed from arguing in a future suit that the bureau has violated its contractual obligations to apportion water as required by the westlands and san benito contracts.at.the district court concluded that appellants are equitably estopped by their knowledge and conduct to claim otherwise in derogation of a course of dealing by which interior has recognized the contractual priority of the exchange contractors vested water rights to substitute water,which it has supplied from sacramento river and delta water.westlands vi,d at.this conclusion was erroneous because the record fails to establish that the requirements of equitable estoppel were met.see lehman united states,cir listing elements of estoppel.as discussed below,however,this issue does not affect the outcome in this case.
contract interpretation 
the westlands and san benito contracts were authorized by federal reclamation laws.see d,e.therefore,these contracts should be interpreted against the backdrop of the legislative scheme that authorized them,and the interpretation of ambiguous terms or implied covenants can only be made in light of the policies underlying the controlling legislation.peterson united states of the interior,cir citing federal hous.admin.darlington,d,cert.denied,d.
