smith,circuit judge 
natural resources defense council and santa monica baykeeper collectively,the plaintiffs file this interlocutory appeal from the district court dismissal of their claims for injunctive relief as moot.we hold that we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to a,and that the plaintiffs claims for injunctive relief are not moot.
factual and procedural background 
in,the plaintiffs filed suit against the county of los angeles and the los angeles county flood control district collectively,the county defendants alleging that the county defendants were discharging polluted stormwater in violation of the terms of their national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit,issued pursuant to the federal water pollution control act the clean water act,stat,codified as amended at,et.in,we held that as a matter of law,the county defendants had violated their permit because their monitoring stations recorded levels of pollution that exceeded the receiving water limitations in the permit.nat.res.def.council,cnty.of los angeles,cir.we remanded the case to the district court for a remedies determination.id.at.
in,during the pendency of appellate proceedings,the county defendants sought and received a new npdes permit from the los angeles regional water quality control board the regional board,which now governs the county defendants stormwater discharges.id.at.both permits have substantially the same baseline receiving water limitations,which are the crux of the plaintiffs claims.
however,the permit made significant changes concerning how the receiving water limitations requirement could be met.in the permit,the prohibition against pollution exceedances was specific and straightforward d ischarges from the that cause or contribute to the violation of water quality standards or water quality objectives are prohibited.if the pollution levels exceeded the limitations as detected by a relevant monitoring station,the permittees were in violation of the permit.id.at.
the permit is more complicated.first,the permit establishes total maximum daily loads tmdls for impaired water bodies.this is a measure of the maximum quantity of a pollutant that can be sustained by a water body that is already impaired,and it is used to calculate effluent limitations specific to the area.the permit contains interim requirements to ensure that permittees are making progress toward achieving water quality standards in those areas,as well as final deadlines for permittees to actually meet tmdl targets.failing to meet an interim or final tmdl requirement is a violation of the permit.conversely,if a permittee meets the tmdl standards,it is deemed to be in compliance with baseline receiving water limitations.the permit has tmdls for different bodies of water and pollutants.where no tmdl is assigned to a certain body of water,the baseline receiving water limitations apply.
second,the permit creates a safe harbor program for permittees that initiate,develop,revise,and implement a voluntary watershed management program wmp or enhanced watershed management program ewmp.if a permittee initiates a wmp and timely meets the requirements of the program,the permittee is deemed to be in compliance with both baseline receiving water limitations where there is no overriding tmdl requirement and interim tmdl requirements,but must still meet final tmdl requirements.if a permittee successfully completes an ewmp,it is exempt from all receiving water limitations and tmdl requirements,including the final deadlines.the deemed compliance begins as soon as a permittee p rovides timely notice of its intent to develop a wmp or ewmp.this declaration of intent triggers a schedule requiring the permittee to keep up with implementation requirements and deadlines.but this safe harbor is not guaranteed to last.if a p ermittee fails to meet any requirement or date for its achievement in an approved wmp or ewmp,the permittee shall be immediately subject to the receiving water limitations for the waterbody at issue.
the county defendants have initiated a total of seven wmps and ewmps,covering all the watershed areas for which they have responsibility.after declaring their intent to develop their wmps and ewmps,the county defendants submitted their initial plans to the regional board in june.the regional board returned comments and necessary revisions to the wmp drafts in october.the county defendants submitted revised drafts in january,and the board returned conditional approvals of the drafts in april,requiring the permittees to make additional revisions.the county defendants ultimately obtained final approval for at least three wmps.
as for the ewmps,work plans were submitted in june,and initial drafts were due in june.the county defendants obtained final approval from the regional board for at least one ewmp.
but even with the approved wmps and ewmps,the permittees must actually comply with the requirements in those plans,and the regional board will review the implementation efforts every two years thereafter.implementing wmps will require new programs and new construction that address water quality on a watershed basis,and implementing ewmps will require construction of regional projects.at this point in time,the record does not reflect whether the county defendants have taken any actual steps to implement the requirements of the wmps or ewmps.the county defendants concede that compliance is voluntary,and that the wmps and emps will require substantial new resources and time for implementation.
in january,the county defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs entire lawsuit on mootness grounds,arguing that the permit supplanted the permit and therefore relief was not available to the plaintiffs.the district court denied the motion with regard to the claims for civil penalties for past violations.however,the district court granted the motion with regard to injunctive relief,on the basis that the county defendants were currently in compliance with the permit,combined with the fact that the court has been provided with no evidence that defendants will not comply to the fullest extent.the district court noted that the county defendants revised plans in response to the regional board comments on the initial draft suggest even if they do not establish a commitment to compliance more than a likelihood of falling out of compliance.on this basis,the district court concluded that it is absolutely clear that defendants can not reasonably be expected to fall out of compliance,and a s a result,the court finds plaintiffs remaining claims for injunctive relief to be moot.on april,the plaintiffs filed a timely interlocutory appeal of the district court dismissal of injunctive relief.
jurisdiction 
as a threshold matter,we must determine whether jurisdiction exists over this appeal.as a general rule,appellate jurisdiction is limited to final decisions of the district courts of the united states.in re lorillard tobacco,cir.quoting.but pursuant to a,we have appellate jurisdiction over i nterlocutory orders of the district courts of the united states granting,continuing,modifying,refusing or dissolving injunctions.the plaintiffs filed this interlocutory appeal of the district court order as one refusing an injunction under a.the county defendants argue that the district court order was not a denial of an injunction on its face,but only had the practical effect of denying an injunction.the county defendants maintain that under the test in carson american brands,the plaintiffs can not show the irreparable harm necessary to make the district court order immediately appealable.
in shee atika sealaska corp,cir,we held that when a district court specifically denie s a request for an injunction,the appeal falls squarely within the language of section a.id.at.in contrast,we noted that when an order only has the practical effect of denying an injunction,carson requires that the appellant show that the order might have a serious,perhaps irreparable consequence in order to invoke jurisdiction pursuant to a.id.at quoting carson,at.however,we clarified that carson requirement of irreparable injury does no
