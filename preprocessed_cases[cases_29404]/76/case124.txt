gary bailey constructed a road on a parcel of wetlands in lake of the woods county county,minnesota,without obtaining a permit under section of the clean water act act.the united states army corps of engineers corps ordered bailey to restore the land to its previolation condition.bailey refused,and the united states brought an action under section b of the act to enforce the restoration order and to enjoin bailey from discharging further pollutants into the wetland.bailey counterclaimed against the united states,alleging that the corps did not have jurisdiction over his parcel of land and that its restoration order was arbitrary and capricious.bailey sued the county in a complaint,alleging that the county should pay to restore the land.all parties moved for summary judgment.
in a most comprehensive,thorough opinion from which we have borrowed extensively,the district court granted in part the united states motion for summary judgment,finding that the corps properly asserted jurisdiction under the act and that its restoration order met the requirements of united states sexton cove estates,cir.united states bailey,d.the district court dismissed bailey counterclaim against the united states and his complaint against the county.id.the district court subsequently issued a final injunction,ordering bailey to restore the wetland at his own expense to its previolation condition.united states bailey,d.
bailey appeals,contending that the district court erred in concluding that the corps has jurisdiction over his property,in granting summary judgment in favor of the united states,and in entering an injunction to enforce the restoration order.he also argues that the restoration order is arbitrary and capricious.we affirm.
factual background 
bailey owns a parcel of land along the western shore of the lake of the woods lake,which is located in northern minnesota.at issue in this lawsuit is a site that consists of approximately twelve acres of wetland,as defined by the corps.
in the early,bailey considered developing the site and received a general permit from the corps to excavate a harbor.the permit,however,excluded fills for commercial development or residential housing.in,the corps advised bailey that the intended harbor was located on wetland and informed him that he would need additional permits to place dredged or fill material on the site.in,after bailey and a corps official visited the site,the corps suggested that bailey hire a consultant to help you delineate this highly diverse site and prepare the required application that was previously provided to you.the harbor project was eventually abandoned.
bailey decided to plat the site for residential development and sell the lakeside property.the development was named sunny beach and consisted of fourteen lots,each having approximately feet of lakefront.in,bailey hired mark lavalla to build a road through the site to provide access to the lots.bailey did not seek any permits from the corps before lavalla began constructing the road.
lavalla cleared a roadway feet wide and about a quarter of a mile long,running parallel to the lake shoreline.lavalla dug ditches on either side of the road and used the excavated material to build up the road.before the road was complete,on june,employees of the local soil and water conservation district visited the site and told lavalla that the road construction was not properly permitted and that he should stop construction,which he did.on june,a corps employee visited the site with bailey and several employees from the county and the soil and water conservation district and instructed bailey to do no more work on the road.about a week later,a representative from the environmental protection agency epa told bailey that the epa would not pursue an enforcement action if bailey stopped all work on the road until he obtained a proper permit.
on june,bailey filed a project notification form with the county wherein he proposed building an access road for logging on the site.bailey believed that his application would be accepted,and he alleges that an official from the soil and water conservation district told him that the corps would approve the permit and that he should finish the road.without waiting for a decision on his application,bailey instructed lavalla to finish work on the access road.lavalla completed the road,topping the roadbed with square yards of gravel.
the corps received a copy of bailey notification form on august,and treated it as an application for a permit under section of the act.on september,after the road was complete,the corps notified bailey in writing that the work was done in violation of the act,that his permit was incomplete,that no additional work should be done on the road without a permit,and that if his permit was ultimately denied,he would be required to restore the land to its previous condition.
bailey intended to dedicate the road to the county so that the road would become public and be maintained by the county.accordingly,the road had to be built to meet the county road specifications.bailey requested that the road be inspected,and by letter dated september,the county highway engineer informed bailey of his inspection and of certain improvements that were required to bring the road into compliance with county road standards.the highway engineer sent a second letter in november,detailing specific recommendations and requiring that a bond be posted to ensure that the road met county standards.in the spring of,bailey hired lavalla to complete the improvements,which included adding approximately square yards of gravel to the road and replacing the culverts with new pipe.lavalla completed the work on the road that summer.
while the road was being completed,bailey was also preparing to plat the site.in october,shortly after he received the notice of violation from the corps,bailey filed an application with the county to plat fourteen residential lots on the site.the county environmental services director recommended the approval of the sunny beach plat,and the county board of commissioners approved the plat on december.upon approval of the plat,the road became a public road,although the county disputes the nature and extent of its property rights.
on june,the corps denied bailey section permit application on october,after a period of public notice and comment,the corps ordered bailey to restore the property at his own expense.the restoration order required bailey to remove the dredged and fill material used in construction of the road fill in the ditches with native,loamy soils seed the restored area with a specified seed mixture and control certain weed species for three years following restoration.bailey refused to comply with the restoration order,and the united states brought this enforcement action.
summary judgment was granted in favor of the united states,and bailey was ordered to submit a proposed restoration plan.bailey,d at.after an unsuccessful appeal to this court,bailey submitted a proposed plan.the united states objected and submitted its own proposed plan.the district court ordered bailey to restore the site at his own expense to its previolation condition in compliance with the restoration order the corps issued on october.bailey,d at.
ii.issues on appeal 
bailey raises the following arguments on appeal that the district court erred in applying justice kennedy opinion in rapanos united states,d,to determine whether the corps had jurisdiction over the site and that even if justice kennedy opinion controls,the corps has failed to show that the wetland has a significant nexus to or is adjacent to the lake of the woods that the corps denial of the permit and its restoration order are arbitrary and capricious and that the district court abused its discretion when it approved the restoration plan.
summary judgment and the corps jurisdiction under the act 
congress enacted the clean water act in to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.the act prohibits the discharge of any pollutant from any point source into navigable waters of the united states without a proper permit from the secretary of the army through the corps or from the epa.the corps and the epa share responsibility for implementing and enforcing the act permit scheme for the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters,and the extent of the corps jurisdiction has been hotly contested in cases around the country.bailey concedes that the gravel and fill he placed on the site to build the road constitute pollutants and that those pollutants were discharged from a point source.bailey also concedes that he did not obtain a permit from the corps.bailey challenges the corps assertion of jurisdiction over the site,arguing that the land onto which he discharged the pollutants did not constitute navigable waters under the act.
the act defines navigable waters as the waters of the united states,including the territorial seas.the regulations promulgated by the corps define navigable waters as or traditionally navigable waters and the wetlands adjacent to such waters.a.
the supreme court opinions in rapanos united states 
in rapanos united states,the supreme court addressed how the term navigable waters should be construed under the act and the extent to which the term includes wetlands.all members of the court agreed that navigable waters encompassed something more than traditional waters.at.plurality opinion.kennedy,concurring.stevens,dissenting.there was no majority opinion,with five justices concluding that remand was necessary for consideration of whether the wetlands at issue in rapanos were navigable waters covered by the act and whether the epa and the corps had impermissibly extended their regulatory jurisdiction under the act.justice scalia wrote the plurality opinion,joined by three other justices justice kennedy wrote a concurring opinion and justice stevens wrote the dissenting opinion,joined by three other justices.
the plurality opinion limits federal authority over navigable waters to those wetlands with a continuous surface connection to bodies that are waters of the united states in their own right,so that there is no clear demarcation between waters and wetlands,are adjacent to such waters and covered by the act.id.at.the plurality test requires two findings 
first,that the adjacent channel contains a wate r of the united states,a relatively permanent body of water connected to traditional interstate navigable waters and second,that the wetland has a continuous surface connection with that water,making it difficult to determine where the water ends and the wetland begins.
in his concurring opinion,justice kennedy rejected these two requirements as unduly dismissive of the interests asserted by the united states in these cases and recognized that the rationale for the act regulation of wetlands is the functions that wetlands perform in relation to the integrity of other waters functions such as pollutant trapping,flood control,and runoff storage.id.at.accordingly,justice kennedy determined that the government jurisdiction under the act extends to wetlands that possess a significant nexus to waters that are or were navigable in fact or that could reasonably be so made.id.at.internal quotations omitted.w etlands possess the requisite nexus,and thus come within the statutory phrase navigable waters,if the wetlands,either alone or in combination with similarly situated lands in the region,significantly affect the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the covered waters more readily understood as navigable.id.at.a wetland would not satisfy justice kennedy test if its effect on water quality were speculative or insubstantial.id.justice kennedy also concluded that if the wetland is adjacent to waters,then the corps may rely on adjacency to establish its jurisdiction.id.at.
the dissenters determined that to the extent the act requires a significant nexus,the requirement is categorically satisfied as to wetlands adjacent to navigable waters or their tributaries.id.at.the dissent specifically noted that all four dissenters would uphold the corps jurisdiction in cases that satisfy either the plurality test or justice kennedy.id.at.i n these and future cases,the united states may elect to prove jurisdiction under either test.id.
the circuit courts application of rapanos united states 
when a majority of the supreme court agrees only on the outcome of a case and not on the grounds for that outcome,the holding of the court may be viewed as that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.marks united states,d internal quotations omitted.the supreme court has recognized that applying a rule of law from its fragmented decisions is often more easily said than done.grutter bollinger,d nichols united states,d.the marks rule the becomes problematic when one opinion supporting the judgment does not fit entirely within a broader circle drawn by the others.king palmer,en banc.because there is little overlap between the plurality and justice kennedy opinions,it is difficult to determine which holding is the narrowest.
of those circuit courts that have considered rapanos,most have concluded that justice kennedy opinion constitutes the narrowest holding.united states robison,cir cal.river watch city of healdsburg,cir united states gerke excavating,cir per curiam.thus if a wetland meets the substantial nexus test,the federal authority has jurisdiction to regulate the wetland under the act.rapanos,at.kennedy,concurring.the seventh and the ninth have not foreclosed the possibility that the plurality test might apply in some cases and have limited their holdings to the facts of the cases before them.cal.river watch,at stating that justice kennedy concurrence provided the controlling rule of law for our case and that it is the narrowest ground to which a majority of the justices would assent if forced to choose in almost all cases gerke excavating,at stating that justice kennedy test must govern the further stages of this litigation.the seventh circuit concluded that the narrowest opinion is the one least restrictive of federal authority to regulate and that as a practical matter the kennedy concurrence is the least common denominator.gerke excavating,at.similarly,the eleventh circuit determined that the narrowest grounds is the less,of cwa jurisdiction and that justice kennedy test,at least in wetlands cases such as rapanos,will classify a water as navigable more frequently than justice scalia test.robison,at.
the first circuit has concluded that the marks rule is unworkable as applied to rapanos and has instead followed the dissent instruction to find jurisdiction if either the plurality test or justice kennedy test is met.united states johnson,cir.the sixth circuit did not decide which test controls,concluding that jurisdiction in the case before it was proper under both the plurality and justice kennedy opinion.united states cundiff,cir see also united states lucas,cir concluding that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support all three rapanos standards and upholding guilty verdicts of defendants convicted under the act.
bailey and amicus pacific legal foundation argue that the controlling jurisdictional test is stated in the plurality opinion,and thus the wetland must have a continuous surface connection with water for the corps to assert jurisdiction over the wetland.the united states urges us to adopt the district court holding that the corps has jurisdiction over the wetland if either the plurality test or justice kennedy test is satisfied.we find judge lipez reasoning in johnson to be persuasive,and thus we join the first circuit in holding that the corps has jurisdiction over wetlands that satisfy either the plurality or justice kennedy test.
justice kennedy jurisdictional test is met in this case because the wetland is adjacent to lake of the woods 
justice kennedy opinion holds that when a wetland is adjacent to the waters,then a significant nexus exists as a matter of law rapanos,at.as applied to wetlands adjacent to waters,the corps conclusive standard for jurisdiction rests upon a reasonable inference of ecological interconnection,and the assertion of jurisdiction for those wetlands is sustainable under the act by showing adjacency alone.see also cal.river watch,at noting that justice kennedy reaffirmed that wetlands adjacent to navigable waterways are covered by the act.if the wetland is adjacent to tributaries of waters,then the corps must show that the wetland significantly affect s the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the waters.rapanos,at.
justice kennedy found the corps definition of adjacent to be reasonable when applied to wetland adjacent to waters,at,and the corps defines adjacent to mean bordering,contiguous,or neighboring.c.the district court determined that the road was built on wetland adjacent to the lake,which is undisputably a water,holding that the corps has presented evidence that the wetland on the site extends to the edge of the lake and is thus bordering on or contiguous to the lake.bailey,d at.
bailey argues that the corps has failed to meet its burden on summary judgment to show that the wetland at issue is adjacent to the lake.specifically,bailey argues that the corps has not shown that the corridor closest to the lake has wetland hydrology because it did not sample the soil saturation.without wetland hydrology,the corridor can not be deemed a wetland.bailey also contends that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the corridor closest to the lake is wetland because gary lockner,the county environmental services director,testified in a related proceeding that it is not.we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,affirming if there exist no genuine disputes of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.in re operation of.river,cir.c.to determine whether these corridors constitute wetlands,we review the definition of wetlands and explain the corps evaluation of the site.
the corps defines wetlands as those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support,and that under normal circumstances do support,a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.b.the corps conducts wetland delineations to determine the presence and extent of wetland,using the criteria set forth in the corps of engineers wetlands delineation manual manual and corps guidance interpreting the manual.
in general,the manual defines land as wetland when,under normal conditions the land is dominated by hydrophytic vegetation plants that have the ability to grow,effectively compete,reproduce persist in anaerobic soil conditions caused by inundated or saturated soil conditions the land has wetland hydrology inundated or saturated to the surface for at least five percent of the growing season in most years and the land consists of hydric soils soils formed under conditions of saturation,flooding,or ponding long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part of the soil.the corps uses defined field indicators to determine whether the land is wetland by investigating the plants,water,and soil.
to determine whether an area is dominated by hydrophytic vegetation,the corps establishes at least one sample point within each plant community and surveys the herbaceous vegetation within a radius and the woody vegetation within a radius.the corps consults a list of plant species published by the united states fish and wildlife services,which assigns an indicator status to individual plant species reflecting their probability of occurrence in wetlands.hydrophytic vegetation is present if greater than fifty percent of the dominant plant species are obligate wetland plants,facultative wetland plants,or facultative plants excluding facultative negative 
to determine whether the land has wetland hydrology,the corps requires either one primary indicator,such as direct observation of soil saturation within twelve inches of the surface,or two secondary indicators,such as the test and local soil survey data.the test uses vegetation as a secondary indicator of hydrology.if obligate wetland plants and facultative wetland plants outnumber facultative upland plants and obligate upland plants,then the sample meets the test and tests positive as a secondary indicator of hydrology.the rationale is that obligate wetland plants and facultative wetland plants occur in wetlands to percent of the time.facultative plants,which occur in both wetlands and nonwetlands,are considered neutral.
an interdisciplinary team consisting of steve eggers,a senior ecologist with the corps rod heschke,a soil scientist with the united states department of agriculture and kelly urbanek,a senior project manager and biologist with the corps,conducted field investigations to delineate the wetland at the site.consistent with the manual,they established at least one sample point where a change in soils,hydrology,vegetation,or topography occurred,which resulted in a survey of sample points along established transects.they sampled vegetation,saturation levels,and soil types,concluding that the wetland encompassed the entire site except for approximately acres.
according to the expert report prepared by eggers and heschke,there is no upland border along the site shoreline.thirteen of the sample points were within to feet of the cut bank of the shoreline.all thirteen of these sample points were dominated by hydrophytes and had hydric soils.eleven of the thirteen had saturated soils within twelve inches of the surface,a primary indicator of wetland hydrology.the twelfth met two secondary indicators of wetland hydrology,the test and the local soil survey data.the thirteenth sample point lacked sufficient indicators of wetland hydrology.eggers and heschke concluded that the area surrounding the thirteenth point is drained by a preexisting ditch and does not constitute a wetland.
although the corps did not sample the soil saturation,a primary indicator of wetland hydrology,within the corridor of land closest to the lake,two secondary test and local soil survey met.eggers found that the test was met in the corridor based on his observation of the vegetation closest to the lakeshore.eggers established three sample points at the mark,and he surveyed the herbaceous vegetation within the radius of the sample points and the saplings and shrubs within the radius.eggers observed no changes in vegetation between the lake and the sample points at the mark that would have necessitated further sampling and determined that the land closest to the lake tests positive under the test.the other secondary indicator was local soil survey data,which heschke reviewed.heschke concluded that the soils within fifteen feet of the lake are hydric based on his observations of the site,the national cooperative soil survey,and the prevalence of the hydric soils in the surrounding area.the corps thus presented sufficient evidence to allow a factfinder to conclude that the corridor closest to the lake shoreline consisted of wetland hydrology.
bailey failed to rebut the corps evidence he offered no expert evidence of the hydrological characteristics of the site,let alone the corridor closest to the lake.in his briefs and at oral argument,bailey explained that the wetland at the site is a bowl shape,with the highest point being along the lake.bailey also argues that the drop between the lake and the shore causes the water table to be drawn down,creating upland.accordingly,his argument goes,the strip of land is not wetland.without competent evidence to contradict the government expert evidence that the corridor constitutes wetland,however,we can not make that leap.
bailey also contends that the corridor closest to the lake is not wetland,but he has again failed to submit evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact.as he did before the district court,bailey relies heavily on the testimony from gary lockner,the county environmental services director,who opined in a state proceeding that the corridor was upland and lacked wetland hydrology.bailey brushed aside the district court ruling that the testimony was inadmissible hearsay,arguing that in a motion for summary judgment all evidence can arguably be
