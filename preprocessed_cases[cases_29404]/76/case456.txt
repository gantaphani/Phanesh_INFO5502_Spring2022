water lies beneath the surface of today case,yet our holding is based on a rule of grammar,not capture.the water authority must seek voter approval,in any bond election it conducts,to sell bonds so that fronted the cost of the city water and sewer be reimbursed.does any bond election mean every bond election or has the authority satisfied its obligation by approving the reimbursement proposal in at least one election,even if voters reject the measure we hold that,in the context of these agreements,any means every.our answer to that question,however,matters little unless the authority is amenable to suit.we hold that it is.when a water authority enters into a contract like the one here,it may be sued for failing to fulfill the contract terms.see.loc.gov t codee.the authority refusal to include a reimbursement measure in every bond election constituted a breach of its contracts with the developers.because the legislature has waived the authority immunity from suit for that breach,we reverse in part the court of appeals judgment and remand the case to that court to consider the authority remaining issues.because we agree with the court of appeals that the authority actions did not rise to the level of a taking,we affirm that part of the court of appeals judgment.
background 
petitioners are residential developers in the clear lake area of greater houston each entered into contracts entitled sales agreement and lease of facilities with the clear lake city water authority the agreements stipulated that the developers would build water and sewer facilities according to the authority specifications,and that the developers would lease the facilities to the authority free of charge until the authority purchased them.the authority agreed to reimburse the developers for of their construction costs once it received bond funds.the authority was not obligated to reimburse the developers until a bond sale was approved in an election.
the agreements contain the following pertinent clauses 
subject to other terms and provisions hereof,the developer agrees to sell and the authority agrees to purchase all completed portions of the facilities as soon as possible,but not more than days after receipt of bond proceeds legally available and allocated by the authority for payment therefore 
it is expressly acknowledged and agreed by the parties hereto,that the authority has no existing voter authorization to issue any bonds to pay for the cost of the facilities,and does not anticipate that funds will be available for such costs without a voter approved bond sale for such purchase.the authority intends to call a bond election in the near future but is not obligated to do so,and the authority can not predict when,if ever,such an election and bond sale will occur,or when,if ever,the authority will have other funds available and allocated for the purchase of the facilities.the authority shall have the right to purchase the facilities with funds available from a source other than a bond sale for such purpose,but shall have no obligation to do so.the authority does agree,however,that it shall include in any bond election it does hold subsequent to the effective date of this agreement bond authorization in an amount sufficient to pay the purchase price of the facilities 
the authority shall have no obligation to obtain approval from the voters of bonds to finance purchase of the facilities,but if such voter approval is obtained,the authority shall sell authority bonds for the purpose of purchasing the facilities the authority agrees to proceed with due diligence to consummate the issuance of such bonds and the acquisition of the facilities under such circumstances.
in may,as stipulated by the agreements,the authority placed a bond authorization measure on the next election ballot.voters rejected the measure.in october,the authority again placed a bond measure on the ballot,this time separating it into two parts a proposal to reimburse the developers,and another to fund the maintenance of a separate water treatment plant the authority owned.the voters passed the second proposal but rejected the first.three of the four developers kirby lake,miter,and taylor lake then sued the authority,alleging that it was obligated to reimburse them anyway.a jury found for the developers,and the trial court rendered judgment in accordance with that verdict.clear lake city water auth.kirby lake,dist,pet.denied kirby lake i.the court of appeals reversed,holding that voter approval was a condition precedent to the authority purchase obligation.id.at.
the authority held another bond election in september.this time it omitted the developers reimbursement proposition altogether,citing the 
language of the opinion rendered by the fourteenth court of appeals,which expressly stated that certain of the developers contracts merely required that the developers be included in any subsequent election,and they were confirming that any obligation to seek voter approval to issue bonds to reimburse the developers has already been satisfied.
the developers sued again,alleging that the authority breached its agreement to include a reimbursement provision in each bond election on motion for summary judgment,the trial court concluded that the authority breached the agreement and awarded damages.at kirby lake ii.the court of appeals rejected the authority argument that it was immune from suit,holding that local government code section waived the authority immunity.id.at citing friendswood i,at.nonetheless,the court of appeals reversed the trial court judgment,holding that the authority complied with the contract because the balance of the paragraph in the agreements clearly indicates that only one election was contemplated we therefore find the agreement to be unambiguous in obligating the water authority to place the measure only on the next ballot after the effective date of the agreement.id.at.
kirby,miter,and taylor also alleged that the authority continued possession of the facilities constituted a taking.lexis,at kirby lake iii the authority then filed a plea to the jurisdiction,arguing,among other things,that kirby,miter,and taylor consented to the alleged taking.id.at.the trial court granted the plea and dismissed the takings claim for lack of jurisdiction.id.the court of appeals agreed,finding that the developers had consented to the authority possession of the an inverse condemnation claim.id.at.each of these cases was decided by a different panel of the same court of appeals.
in november,while the above cases were pending in the trial court,the authority held another bond election that called for reimbursing the developers.the election proved more contentious than its predecessors.the authority board members who had signed the original discouraged passage of the measures.a article in the local paper quoted board members as opposing the bonds.an authority newsletter denied any obligation to conduct future bond elections,but said n evertheless,the board finds it appropriate at this time to submit the issue to the voters for a third time,so that the will of the people,which is an express condition of the contracts,can be heard.the bond measures outcome that the developers claim would not have occurred absent the authority intermeddling.
we consolidated friendswood ii,kirby lake ii,and kirby lake iii,kirby lake,clear lake city water,may,and granted the petition for review,kirby lake,clear lake city water.the developers maintain that the court of appeals erred in holding that any bond election meant only one election.they also allege that the authority perpetual use of the property without compensation constitutes inverse condemnation.the authority argues,among other things,that neither section of the water code nor section of the local government code waives its immunity,and that it has fully satisfied its obligations under the agreements.
ii.an overview of water management in texas 
texas first venture into water regulation stemmed from the state need to irrigate its driest regions.see generally joyce cox,the texas board of water engineers,in texas,as elsewhere,administrative control of water resources came in answer to a need.in,the legislature enacted a bill for the arid districts of texas.see act of march,ch.laws.the goal was to charter corporations that would build an infrastructure to furnish water to all persons for irrigation and domestic uses.see also ward county irrigation dist.red bluff water power control,paso,no pet.fifteen years later,texans approved a constitutional amendment permitting local governments to issue bonds for water development.const.art.iii,b.
texas voters ratified another amendment in.see.const.art.xvi.the amendment created conservation and reclamation districts as units of local government,and made the preservation of natural resources a public right and duty.id.a,b see also dallas county levee dist.looney.as with prior amendments,financing was instrumental to management.in that respect,the amendment permitted all such indebtedness as may be necessary to provide all improvements and the maintenance thereof requisite to the achievement of the purposes of this amendment,as long as such proposition shall first be submitted to the qualified voters of such district and the proposition adopted.const.art.xvi,c.
along with the development of conservation districts came the legislature codification of state water law.see.water code declaring the public policy of the state to provide for the conservation and development of the state natural resources.chapters and of the water code govern water control and improvement districts wcids,like clear lake city water authority.chapter provides a blueprint for creating and operating general law water districts,and for financing the significant work required to conserve water resources.see id.b.chapter deals with wcids.see id.wcids have broad authority to supply and store water for domestic,commercial,and industrial use to operate sanitary wastewater systems and to provide irrigation,drainage,and water quality services.texas commission on environmental quality,texas water districts a general guide,available at http all internet materials as visited august,and available in clerk of court file.
wcids are one of thirteen different types of general law water districts acting as state political subdivisions.see.water code bonnie stepleton,note,texas groundwater legislation conservation of groundwater or drought by process,nat.resources.wcids may consist of a single county or multiple counties.see dick smith,water control and improvement districts,the new handbook of texas.because wcids have extensive power to regulate domestic and commercial water supply,they have become the main financing mechanism for development in urban areas.stepleton,nat.resources at.
clear lake city water authority 
the clear lake city water authority was created in.see act of may,ch.laws.the authority occupies the clear lake area in harris county,approximately miles southeast of downtown houston.clear lake city water authority,general information.it is currently texas largest water district,encompassing over acres,with around residents.id.
water districts frequently contract with private developers to build and maintain water facilities.prefunding agreements,like the ones at issue here,are governed by the texas commission on environmental quality tceq rules.see malcomson.util.dist.newsom,dist,pet.denied.admin.code.these agreements allow developers to finance facilities contemplated for purchase by the district before tceq has approved the bond issue,provided certain conditions are met.admin.code.the tceq rules require developers to pay at least of the costs under such contracts,to insure the feasibility of the construction projects of such districts.admin.code.the rules further provide that a person proceeding with construction of a project prior to its formal approval by the commission shall do so with no assurance that public funds will be authorized for acquiring the facilities.id.thus,the developer who builds the infrastructure assumes the risk that funding will never materialize,and voters determine whether to commit funds for the project.
we turn now to the issues before us.
iii.government immunity 
water control and improvement districts are valid and existing governmental agencies and bodies politic.willacy cnty.water control improv.dist.abendroth,quotations omitted.as such,they enjoy governmental immunity from suit,unless immunity is expressly waived.reata constr.city of dallas.the developers argue that both texas water code section and texas local government code section waive the authority immunity.the court of appeals in the developers two cases held that,while section does not waive immunity,section does.lexis,at citing friendswood i,at at.we agree for the following reasons.
water code section 
section a provides that a district may sue and be sued in the courts of this state in the name of the district by and through its board.a suit for contract damages may be brought against a district only on a written contract of the district approved by the district board.water code a.as we explained in tooke city of mexia,
the effect of a sue and be sued clause in an organic statute depends on the context in which it is used.the words can mean that immunity is waived,but they can also mean only that a governmental entity,like others,has the capacity to sue and be sued in its own name.
tooke city of mexia.standing alone,then,sue and be sued does not plainly waive the authority immunity.
the developers argue that section plainly waives a district immunity because it specifies how a district may be served with a lawsuit for contract damages,and delineates the mechanisms for enforcing a judgment against it.see.water code a c.in harris county hospital district tomball regional hospital,we held that a sue and be sued statute that specified who would represent the district in civil proceedings was not an indication of legislative intent to waive immunity instead,the phrase merely anticipates the district involvement in civil proceedings of some nature at some point,but it does not address immunity from suit.harris cnty.hosp.dist.tomball reg l.
as the court of appeals in friendswood ii reasoned,the legislature states that a suit for contract damages may be brought against a district only on a written contract of the district approved by the district board however,it does not state that all parties to such contracts may sue the district for breach of these contracts or that immunity from suit as to all such claims is waived.at.this interpretation conforms with our holding in tooke,in which we scrutinized similar statutory language providing that the city may contract and be contracted with,implead and be impleaded in all courts and places and in all matters whatsoever tooke,at.we explained that the provision appears to address the capacity of the city to act as a corporate body,not its immunity from suit.all it clearly says is that the city can be sued and impleaded in court when suit is permitted,not that immunity is waived for all suits.id.hence,a statute that contemplates a government entity involvement in litigation does not clearly and unambiguously waive the entity immunity from suit.see wichita falls state hosp.taylor,a statute that waives the state immunity must do so beyond doubt.
the developers also point to the provision in section a setting forth the only conditions under which a contract against a district will be enforceable.see.water code a a suit for contract damages may be brought against a district only on a written contract of the district approved by the district board.but such language does not go as far as waiving immunity from suit,but merely establishes a condition precedent to suit.travis county pelzel,see also farmers state bank of new boston bowie county,the language of said article indicates that the rejection by the commissioners court of a claim against the county,or the failure of such court to act on the same,is merely a condition precedent to the filing of a suit to recover thereon.bexar metro.water dist.educ.and econ.dev.joint venture,antonio,pet.dism the language the legislature actually used in amending section a does not authorize a suit against a water district nor does it expressly waive immunity.rather,the amendment creates a condition precedent if a suit for contract damages is otherwise authorized,it may be maintained only if the stated condition is met.we therefore reject this argument as well.
since tooke,we have consistently refused to find waivers of immunity implicit in statutory language there can be no abrogation of governmental immunity without clear and unambiguous language indicating the legislature intent do so.see,tomball,at lamesa indep.sch.dist.booe,city of elsa.the present statute is no different.in fact,every court of appeals to interpret section after tooke has concluded that the statute does not waive immunity.see clear lake city water auth.mcr.lexis,at dist,pet.denied jonah water special util.lexis,at,no pet.boyer,trinity river auth.of tex,worth,pet.denied bexar metro.water,at valley mun.util.dist.rancho viejo.lexis,at christi,no pet.because section does not contain a clear and unambiguous waiver,the sue and be sued language in a does not on its own abrogate governmental immunity.
local government code section 
the legislature enacted section to loosen the immunity bar so that all local governmental entities that have been given or are given the statutory authority to enter into contracts shall not be immune from suits arising from those contracts.ben blanco consol.indep.sch.dist.political subdivisions joint.fund,quotations omitted the statute waives immunity from suit for certain contract claims a local governmental entity that is authorized by statute or the constitution to enter into a contract and that enters into a contract subject to this subchapter waives sovereign immunity to suit for the purpose of adjudicating a claim for breach of the contract.loc.gov t codee.the statute defines contract subject to this subchapter as a written contract stating the essential terms of the agreement for providing goods or services to the local governmental entity.id.
the agreements here are written contracts stating their essential terms.the names of the parties,property at issue,and basic obligations are clearly outlined.see liberto stauffer biscuit,cir noting that texas courts generally construe essential terms of a contract to include the time of performance,the price to be paid,the work to be done,the service to be rendered,or the property to be transferred fort worth indep.sch.dist.city of fort worth,noting that a contract is legally binding if its terms are sufficiently definite to enable a court to understand the parties obligations.the relevant inquiry is whether the agreements entail the provision of goods or services to the authority.
chapter provides no definition for services,despite the legislature definition of the term in other contexts it appears,generally,that the term is broad enough to encompass a wide array of activities.see van zandt fort worth press,in ordinary usage the term services has a rather broad and general meaning.it includes generally any act performed for the benefit of another under some arrangement or agreement whereby such act was to have been performed.quoting creameries of am.indus.comm n,utah but see berkman city of keene,pet.denied t he statute does not apply to contracts in which the benefit that the local governmental entity would receive is an indirect,attenuated one.quotations omitted.
the friendswood i court relied on our analysis in ben bolt to conclude that the agreement to hire third parties to construct the facilities and to build the streets,roads,and bridges is sufficient to constitute the provision of services to the authority.friendswood i,at see ben bolt,at.in ben bolt,we liberally construed a insurance policy the fund as encompassing services rendered by its members,based on the fact that the fund members elect a governing board,and a board subcommittee resolves claims disputes.to that extent,at least,the fund members provide services to the fund.id.the services provided thus need not be the primary purpose of the agreement.see friendswood i,at i n ben bolt,the texas supreme court concluded that the legislature had waived immunity under this statute even though the court concluded that the part of the contract on which the plaintiff based its claim did not involve the provisions of good sic or services to the local governmental entity.
we agree with the court of appeals that the agreements entail services provided directly to the authority.the developers contracted to construct,develop,lease,and bear all risk of loss or damage to the facilities,obligations far more concrete than those at issue in ben bolt.ben bolt,at.we therefore hold that the agreements contemplate the provision of services under the statute.
the authority also argues that the agreements fall outside chapter because there is no balance due and owed.see.loc.gov t codee a limiting t he total amount of money awarded in an adjudication brought against a local governmental entity for breach of a contract to the balance due and owed by the local governmental entity under the contract.according to the authority,because the voters have not approved bonds to buy the facilities,the developers can not prove that the amount they seek is due and owed.at least within the context of these agreements,we disagree.the purpose of section is to limit the amount due by a governmental agency on a contract once liability has been established,not to foreclose the determination of whether liability exists.furthermore,the agreements do stipulate the amount of reimbursement owed upon approval of bond funds.the existence of a balance due and owed is thus incorporated within the balance that would come due when voters approve payment in a bond election.
for the above reasons,we agree that section waives the authority immunity from suit.
iv.interpretation of the agreements 
defining any 
we disagree,however,with the court of appeals conclusion regarding interpretation of the word any in the following contract provision 
the authority intends to call a bond election in the near future but is not obligated to do so the authority does agree,however,that it shall include in any bond election it does hold subsequent to the effective date of this agreement bond authorization in an amount sufficient to pay the purchase price of the facilities.
the authority says this provision requires the reimbursement measure be placed on one ballot only,upon which it will have fulfilled its contractual obligation.the developers,on the other hand,contend the provision requires that the authority place the measure on every bond authorization ballot until the end of time,or until the measure is approved.the court of appeals agreed with the authority,holding that,although the pertinent sentence could reasonably be interpreted either way,the balance of the paragraph clearly indicates that only one election was contemplated.kirby lake ii,at.
texas courts defining any have generally interpreted it to mean every.those decisions,however,have been so rooted in context that they provide little guidance in this case.see texas schriewer,the word any is a flexible word that may have any one of several meanings according to its use its meaning is often restrained,limited,or influenced by the or manner in which it is used,aff in part,rev in part sub nom.smith.comm app.accordingly,we will examine the agreements grammatical structure,in context.
the authority and the kirby lake ii court point to the use of singular nouns in the succeeding sentence as indicative that any means one time the paragraph first sentence states that the water authority intends to call a bond election but it can not predict when or if such an election will occur.unlike any,the words a and an are always singular.kirby lake ii,at.however,the fact that a and an are singular does not foreclose interpreting any to mean each or one of all both of which would require singular antecedents.see,schriewer,at in its broad,distributive sense,the sense in which the word is very frequently used,it may have the meaning of all,every,each,or each one of all.the more conventional grammatical meaning of the term,then,suggests that the proposition must be included in every bond el
