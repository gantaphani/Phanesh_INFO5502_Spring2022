background 
the facts related to this appeal are largely undisputed and are taken from the district court memorandum and order.templeton bd.of sewer comm rs am.tissue mills,nmg.in march,the town of templeton entered into a waste management contract with baldwinville products,baldwinville and its owner,erving industries,erving by which templeton agreed to build a wastewater treatment plant the plant and make the plant available to erving and baldwinville for treatment of their wastewater.the contract provided,inter alia,that templeton shall retain legal title to all wastewater facilities,waste management contract,section xv templeton shall pay one dollar per year consideration for defendants to operate the plant,section xvi templeton would apply for federal state construction grants for its wastewater treatment facility,section vi.finally,it provided that erving and baldwinville would pay the net operating costs of the plant as well as of the net capital costs of the plant,section xvi a and c.
templeton applied to the environmental protection agency epa for a construction grant.the agency approved the grant,and the plant was built and became operational.
in,defendant american tissue mills of massachusetts,atm,purchased baldwinville operating assets.an assignment and assumption agreement was executed,assigning baldwinville rights and liabilities under the waste management contract to northeast waste treatment services,northeast,an atm subsidiary.from until april,atm and northeast operated the plant.
in march,the epa informed templeton that the clean water act cwa,b,required templeton to implement a user charge system whereby each user of the plant must pay a proportionate share of the cost of operating and maintaining the entire wastewater treatment system based upon that user contribution to the total waste flow.the epa also advised templeton that the user charge system specified by the waste management contract was inconsistent with the user charge system required by the cwa.a subsequent epa memorandum received by templeton in september concluded that the contract user charge system must be revised in order to comply with the epa regulatory scheme.
procedural history 
templeton filed its initial complaint in the district court in june.count i sought a declaration of the parties rights,specifically whether atm was required to pay a user charge which included payment for other treatment works pursuant to of the cwa,and the epa regulations thereunder.jurisdiction was premised upon,as the plaintiff was allegedly seeking relief under the cwa,and the remaining state law claims were entertained pursuant to.although the complaint was amended three times,count i did not materially change.it stated,in relevant part 
under the agreement,the town is obligated,among other things,to 
construct a wastewater treatment plant the plant with an average daily flow capacity of approximately three million gallons and agree to make the plant available to the company for treatment of its wastewater.sections ii and iii 
maintain and operate the plant and retain a third party to operate the plant with prior approval of the company.section iv and 
apply for federal state construction grants for the plant.section v.
states as a condition of any grant for any project for any treatment works that the applicant for the grant must adopt a system of charges such that each recipient of waste treatment services within the applicant jurisdiction pays its proportionate share of the cost of operation and maintenance including replacement of any waste treatment services provided by the applicant.
the epa has informed the commissioners,and the commissioners agree,that the town is required under the clean water act and the regulations promulgated thereunder to implement a user charge system based on actual use of wastewater treatment services such that each user,including america sic tissue,pays its proportionate share of operation and maintenance based on each user proportionate contribution to the total waste contributed by all users.see cfr 
it is the commissioners and the epa position that the requirements of the clean water act and regulation promulgated thereunder supersede the agreement.relying on cfr g.
third amended compl.at.
in,templeton moved for partial summary judgment on count i seeking,inter alia,a declaration that atm was subject,under the contract and federal law,to a user charge system for the use of the treatment works in compliance with the cwa and epa regulations.the district court concluded that templeton interpretation of the federal requirements was correct,but denied the summary judgment motion because material facts were still in dispute.templeton bd.of sewer comm rs american tissue mills,nmg.the district court denied the motion for summary judgment because the record failed to establish a conflict between the contract and the epa regulations 
on october,elghanayan,an alleged officer,director and shareholder of atm and northeast,filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction under.b,c and h,arguing primarily that the district court did not have jurisdiction over count i because it did not arise under federal law.the district court granted the motion.
ii.analysis 
appellee elghanayan argues that the district court had no jurisdiction under because the cwa,the statute upon which appellant purported to base jurisdiction,does not provide a private right of action.appellant argues that,notwithstanding this lack of a private right of action,count i involves a substantial question of federal law,and thus jurisdiction under is proper.

determining whether arising under jurisdiction exists is a particularly difficult task.we must first determine whether count i of the third amended complaint alleges a federal cause of action.if not,then we must inquire into whether some element of the claim depends on the resolution of a substantial,disputed question of federal law.if a question of this nature exists,federal jurisdiction will lie.see west street commercial west owners,cir to determine whether the court has federal question jurisdiction to decide the case,the complaint must contain either a federal cause of action or a state cause of action embodying a substantial federal question.
private rights of action 
the supreme court of the united states has established that a district court properly exercises jurisdiction under section when a plaintiff complaint is based on a right conferred under federal law.oneida indian nation county of oneida,d.whether a claim arises under federal law is determined under the complaint rule.franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust,d see also louisville nashville mottley.under that rule,the jurisdictional question must be determined from what necessarily appears in the plaintiff statement of his own claim in the bill or declaration,without reference to any other pleadings.franchise tax,at.internal quotations omitted.in other words,a right or immunity created by the constitution or laws of the united states must be an element,and an essential one,of the plaintiff cause of action.id.at.quoting gully first bank.
