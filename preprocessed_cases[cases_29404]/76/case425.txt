in this mandamus case,plaintiff protect the historic amador waterways challenged the environmental impact report eir defendant amador water agency agency certified for a project that would replace the amador canal with a pipeline.the agency acknowledges that leakage from the amador canal contributes to the surface flow of water in local streams and that putting the water from the canal into a pipe will reduce the summer flows in those streams,including a significant reduction in the south fork of jackson creek.nonetheless,the agency concluded in its eir that this reduction in stream flow would not constitute a significant effect on the environment within the meaning of the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code et the superior court denied plaintiff petition,finding the agency had complied with ceqa and its conclusion was supported by substantial evidence.
on appeal,plaintiff contends the agency abused its discretion when it concluded that modifying the hydrology of local creeks from perennial to intermittent surface flows,drying local streams during the late summer and early fall due to the dewatering of amador canal was not a significant adverse physical change to the existing environmental conditions according to plaintiff,the agency inappropriately used irrelevant thresholds of significance to avoid a meaningful,fair,and reasonable evaluation of the substantial evidence demonstrating significant adverse environmental changes in local stream hydrology.
we conclude the agency abused its discretion because the eir does not contain a required statement indicating the reasons why the agency determined that the reduction in the surface flow of local streams would not be significant.accordingly,we will reverse the superior court judgment denying plaintiff petition for a writ of mandate and remand the matter for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
originally constructed in,the amador canal is a mostly unlined earthen ditch that transports water along the natural contours of the land approximately miles from lake tabeaud to the tanner reservoir.the agency,which owns the canal,wants to replace it with a pipeline that would run approximately eight miles in a more direct line between the lake and the reservoir.the objectives of the pipeline project include improving water quality,reducing water loss,and improving reliability of the water supply.
having determined in an initial study that the project would have potentially significant impacts on several environmental factors,the agency prepared a draft eir for the project in september.
the environmental analysis section of the draft eir addressed the areas in which the project would have potentially significant environmental effects,including water resources and biological resources.the hydrology portion of the water resources section of the eir discussed the results of a detailed hydrological analysis that was performed at the agency request to determine if leakage from the mostly unlined canal was contributing to the surface flow of local streams.based on data from field studies in,the agency determined that the surface flow in parts of six local streams was increased in varying degrees by leakage from the canal,particularly in the summer and early fall june through october.the agency further determined that canal leakage was probably keeping the affected parts of some of these streams from becoming intermittent during drier years.
the agency acknowledged in the eir that the pipeline project would eliminate all leakage from the amador canal and that,as a result,no contribution to local surface discharges would occur and the flows in local streams now influenced by canal leakage and runoff capture would return to their historical hydrological conditions,the conditions that existed before the canal was built.the agency predicted that the south fork of jackson creek and some of its tributaries would become intermittent during august and september,and possibly october,in all but the wettest if the pipeline were constructed.the agency similarly predicted intermittent flow in the middle fork of jackson creek,new york ranch gulch,cooper gulch already intermittent or nearly so by the fall of most years,and oneida creek barely perennial under current conditions as a result of the pipeline.
having identified the pipeline likely impact on the surface flow of these streams,the eir addressed the significance of that impact as follows the change in local hydrology associated with dewatering the amador canal and eliminating all leakage is not considered to be a significant hydrological impact per se.the hydrological changes may have effects on other resources dependent on hydrology,for example,water quality or wildlife,and these effects are discussed elsewhere in the eir.consequently,changes in hydrology are not significant.the impact of the pipeline alternative on hydrology is determined to be less than significant.
the eir went on to address the potential effects of the pipeline on various biological resources,including wetland and riparian habitats in the project area.the eir explained that the montane riparian habitat occurs along seasonal and perennial streams in the project area,including the south fork of jackson creek and new york ranch gulch.the eir discussed in several paragraphs the potential impact of the pipeline on various areas of wetland habitat created or supplemented by leakage from the canal.after noting the pipeline impact on this wetland habitat would be less than significant,the eir addressed the impact of the pipeline on riparian habitat in a single sentence,as follows similarly,the montane riparian vegetation would continue to thrive along local streamcourses,even if canal leakage is eliminated.the eir then drew the following conclusion regarding the effect of the pipeline on the wildlife habitats and the associated wildlife communities of the project area while the dewatering of the amador canal,attributed to the pipeline alternative,would change local hydrological conditions along the amador canal and in associated watersheds by eliminating leakage and restoring natural runoff,the interaction of these changes are not expected to significantly affect local wildlife communities or their distribution in the project area.it is determined that the effect of eliminating leakage on wildlife resources is less than significant.
after circulating the draft eir for public review and comment,the agency prepared a final eir and in may adopted a resolution certifying the eir and approving the project.the final eir did not contain any relevant revisions to the sections of the draft eir discussed above 
in june,plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of mandate in the superior court asserting,among other things,that the eir failed to comply with the mandatory requirements of ceqa in various particulars.one of the particular shortcomings of the eir plaintiff alleged was that it f ailed to analyze and mitigate the significant adverse environmental impacts of the proposed project on the surrounding stream hydrology,especially various forks of jackson creek that are dependent upon leaks from the amador canal for surface flow and maintenance of riparian vegetation.plaintiff went on to allege that c hanging perennially flowing streams into intermittent streams is per se a significant change to the physical environment.
in september,the superior court found the agency had substantially complied with the ceqa statutes and regulations and its decision to certify the eir was supported by substantial evidence.accordingly,the court denied plaintiff petition.plaintiff appeals from the resulting judgment.

the eir and thresholds of significance 
an environmental impact report is an informational document,the purpose of which is to provide public agencies and the public in general with detailed information about the effect which a proposed project is likely to have on the environment ceqa.the purpose of an environmental impact report is to identify the significant effects on the environment of a project,to identify alternatives to the project,and to indicate the manner in which those significant effects can be mitigated or avoided.ceqa,subd.a.the eir has been repeatedly recognized as the heart of ceqa.communities for a better environment california resources agency th,d.
a project will have a significant effect on the environment if it will cause a substantial,or potentially substantial,adverse change in the physical conditions which exist within the area which will be affected by the project,including land,air,water,minerals,flora,fauna,noise,objects of historic or aesthetic significance.ceqa,defining environment,defining significant effect on the environment.
one of the first steps in the ceqa process is to determine whether the project may have a significant effect on the environment.if there is substantial evidence,in light of the whole record before the lead agency,that a project may have a significant effect on the environment,an environmental impact report shall be prepared.ceqa,subd.d.thus,d etermining whether a project may have a significant effect plays a critical role in the ceqa process.tit,subd.a.s ince the preparation of an eir is the key to environmental protection under ceqa,accomplishment of the high objectives of that act requires the preparation of an eir whenever it can be fairly argued on the basis of substantial evidence that the project may have significant environmental impact.no oil,city of los angeles cal d.
there is no gold standard for determining whether a given impact may be significant.an ironclad definition of significant effect is not always possible because the significance of an activity may vary with the setting.for example,an activity which may not be significant in an urban area may be significant in a rural area.guidelines,subd.b.
under the guidelines,however,e ach public agency is encouraged to develop and publish thresholds of significance that the agency uses in the determination of the significance of environmental effects.a threshold of significance is an identifiable quantitative,qualitative or performance level of a particular environmental effect,with which means the effect will normally be determined to be significant by the agency and compliance with which means the effect normally will be determined to be less than significant.guidelines,subd.a.such thresholds can be drawn from existing environmental standards,such as other statutes or regulations.a lead agency use of existing environmental standards in determining the significance of a project environmental impacts is an effective means of promoting consistency in significance determinations and integrating ceqa environmental review activities with other environmental program planning and regulation.communities for a better environment california resources agency,supra,th at,d.
former guidelines section,subdivision h,specifically provided for the use of existing environmental standards as thresholds for determining the significance of environmental impacts,provided those standards met certain requirements.in relevant part,former guidelines section,subdivision h,provided 
a except as otherwise required by s ection mandatory findings of significance,a change in the environment is not a significant effect if the change complies with a standard that meets the definition in subdivision h.
for the purposes of this subdivision a standard means a standard of general application that is all of the following 
a a quantitative,qualitative or performance requirement found in a statute,ordinance,resolution,rule,regulation,order,or other standard of general application 
b adopted for the purpose of environmental protection 
c adopted by a public agency through a public review process to implement,interpret,or make specific the law enforced or administered by the public agency 
d one that governs the same environmental effect which the change in the environment is impacting and,
e one that governs within the jurisdiction where the project is located.
in communities for a better environment california resources agency,supra,however,this court upheld the invalidation of former guidelines section,subdivision h,because it was inconsistent with controlling ceqa law governing the fair argument approach.th at,d.we explained if a proposed project has an environmental effect that complies with a subdivision h regulatory standard,the lead agency is directed under subdivision h a to determine that the effect is not significant,regardless of whether other substantial evidence would support a fair argument that the effect may be environmentally significant.this direction relieves the agency of a duty it would have under the fair argument approach to look at evidence beyond the regulatory standard,or in contravention of the standard,in deciding whether an eir must be prepared.id.at,d.we concluded that an established regulatory standard could not be applied in a way that would foreclose the consideration of other substantial evidence showing that there might be a significant environmental effect from a project.id.at,d.accordingly,we agreed that former guidelines section,subdivision h,was invalid.
the invalidation of former guidelines section,subdivision h,was not a repudiation of the use of thresholds of significance altogether.public agencies are still encouraged to develop thresholds of significance for use in determining whether a project may have significant environmental effects.see guidelines,subd.a.in the wake of our decision in communities for a better environment,however,such thresholds can not be used to determine automatically whether a given effect will or will not be significant.instead,thresholds of significance can be used only as a measure of whether a certain environmental effect will normally be determined to be significant or normally will be determined to be less than significant by the agency.guidelines,subd.a,italics added.in each instance,notwithstanding compliance with a pertinent threshold of significance,the agency must still consider any fair argument that a certain environmental effect may be significant.
the use of thresholds of significance is not limited to the determination of whether an eir must be prepared.once a public agency has determined that a project may have one or more significant effects on the environment and therefore an eir is required,the purpose of the eir is to identify the significant effects on the environment of the project.ceqa,subd.a.thus,in preparing the eir,the agency must determine whether any of the possible significant environmental impacts of the project will,in fact,be significant.in this determination,thresholds of significance can once again play a role.as noted above,however,the fact that a particular e
