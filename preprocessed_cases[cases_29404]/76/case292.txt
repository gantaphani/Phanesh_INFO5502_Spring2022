the chippewa and flambeau improvement company petitions for review of a series of orders in which the federal energy regulatory commission concluded that the company must obtain a license under the federal power act for its reservoir on the flambeau river in northern wisconsin.we reject the company arguments that the reservoir is not subject to the commission jurisdiction and hence we deny the petition.
background 
in the predecessor of the company filed with the predecessor of the commission a declaration of its intention to create a reservoir for the purpose of developing power by damming the headwaters of the flambeau river.the agency,finding both that the north fork of the flambeau river was not navigable as defined in the federal power act and that the reservoir would not otherwise affect interstate commerce,declined to assert jurisdiction over the project.the company predecessor completed construction of the storage reservoir in.
although the reservoir remained free from federal oversight until the issuance of the orders under review,the company has long been required to operate it in accordance with the rules of the public service commission of wisconsin and,more recently,pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with the wisconsin department of natural resources.those authorities have required the company to make seasonal releases of water in order to control the risk of flooding and to preserve natural resources.there is no equipment at the reservoir,but the required seasonal releases increase the generation of power at downstream hydroelectric plants,eight of which are owned by the principal shareholders in the company.
the current dispute has its genesis in the relicensing proceedings of six downstream plants.in the course of those proceedings the commission staff determined that operation of the reservoir increased total generation at plants on the flambeau river by per year,or between five and six percent of the total average annual generation at those plants.
in light of this information,the commission opened a separate docket to consider whether the reservoir should be licensed on the ground that the reservoir is necessary or appropriate in the maintenance and operation of the licensed power plants downstream.see.in the orders under review,the commission concluded that the reservoir,because of the benefit it provides to plants downstream,is indeed part of the complete unit of development that includes those projects,chippewa flambeau improvement,at,wl,ferc lexis june,order denying rehearing,and therefore is subject to licensing under the federal power act.the company petitioned for review.
ii.analysis 
the company contends first that the commission assertion of jurisdiction over the reservoir is precluded by the commission determination that it would lack jurisdiction over the same reservoir.second,the company argues that the commission failed adequately to explain why the reservoir is necessary or appropriate to the maintenance and operation of downstream plants.finally,the company argues that the commission arbitrarily limited its analysis to the four projects closest to the reservoir,and thereby inflated the effect that operation of the reservoir has upon downstream power generation,measured as a percentage increase in power output.
issue preclusion 
in response to the company suggestion that the commission is bound by its previous determination that the reservoir is not subject to federal licensing requirements,the commission maintains it is free to reexamine its findings in order to take account of changes in the relevant facts and the governing law.see nantahala power light fpc,cir.the commission points out that its initial determination rested upon a more restrictive definition of navigable waters than that subsequently adopted by the supreme court in united states appalachian power.under the commission earlier approach a river that could be made navigable by improvements was not considered a navigable waterway.as a consequence,neither the reservoir nor the downstream power plants were subject to licensing,and the commission therefore had no occasion to determine whether the reservoir might be necessary or appropriate to the operation of a licensed plant.
now,by contrast,it is undisputed that the flambeau river is navigable,and the commission has licensed all the downstream plants with the exception of one that is exempt.therefore,the commission argues,the precise question at issue namely,whether the reservoir should be licensed because it is necessary or appropriate to the operation of a licensed plant arose for the first time in this proceeding,and the commission is not bound by the answer it gave to the jurisdictional question at an earlier time.see,joint operating agency ferc,en banc a fundamental requisite of issue preclusion is an identity of the issue decided in the earlier action and that sought to be precluded in a later action.
in reply the company relies upon an unrelated decision in which the commission predecessor disclaimed jurisdiction over hydroelectric projects notwithstanding the presence upstream of a storage reservoir on the ground that the chippewa river was not navigable.see federal power comm n,second annual report.according to the company,the commission action 
clearly demonstrate s that,even if the commission had jurisdiction over one component,over the upstream storage reservoir or over the downstream hydro projects benefitted by the storage reservoir it was not in the asserting jurisdiction over the other component under a complete unit or any other theory.thus,even if appalachian power had been the law in and the commission had at that time asserted jurisdiction over the downstream hydroelectric projects on the flambeau river based on their location on navigable waters,the commission would not have asserted jurisdiction over.
the company argument asks too much of preclusion doctrine.issue preclusion,upon which the company purports to rely,applies only to issues that were actually litigated in a prior proceeding it is undisputed that the commission has never,prior to the present proceeding,considered whether the reservoir should be licensed because of its possible effects upon projects in the vicinity.with claim preclusion,the bar extends to claims that could have been brought,but even that extension avails the company naught.in its order declining to exercise jurisdiction,the commission could not have addressed whether jurisdiction could be based upon the reservoir likely effects upon licensed plants because there were no such plants in the vicinity.in sum,the company speculation as to what might have happened in the proceeding if the law or the facts had been different is irrelevant.
at bottom,it seems the company plaint the state has satisfactorily overseen the safety of the reservoir for years is merely that the reservoir should not be subjected to regulation by the commission after so many years of uneventful freedom from its clutches.in the federal power act,however,the congress did not intend to create an indefeasible private right springing from an initial exercise of the commission regulatory authority,that would survive and remain immune from future regulation under any circumstances.nantahala,at.we agree with the commission that the supreme court decision in appalachian electric power and its own subsequent licensing of downstream power plants are changes in the circumstances sufficient to justify the commission taking a second look at its jurisdiction over the reservoir.
necessary or appropriate 
the company contends that the commission assertion of jurisdiction was arbitrary and capricious because the commission did not adequately explain why is necessary or appropriate to the maintenance and operation of any licensed project.first,the company argues that necessary means indispensable,and there is no evidence in the record suggesting that the downstream plants would not be financially viable in the absence of the reservoir.second,the company maintains that the commission failed to give weight to the countervailing consideration that no agency has identified an environmental o
