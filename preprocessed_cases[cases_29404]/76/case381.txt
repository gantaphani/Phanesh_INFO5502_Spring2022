facts and procedural history 
prior to the bench trial,the parties submitted to the trial court a stipulation of undisputed facts together with certain records agreed to be genuine and authentic,including copies of the relevant deed of trust on the nicoll field parcel,the trustee deed,a indenture,and the judgment and report of arbitrators relating to the water rights deemed to be appurtenant to the original real property.the following is a brief synopsis of the undisputed facts and records.
nicoll owns the real property situated in kern county,california,designated as assessor parcel number,comprising acres.rudnick owns the real property situated in kern county,california,designated as assessor parcel number,comprising acres.as noted,for purposes of this appeal we refer to nicoll property as nicoll ranch and rudnick property as nicoll field.nicoll ranch and nicoll field are contiguous parcels that were originally owned by nicoll as a part of the land known as the nicoll ranch.in,nicoll constructed a ditch to convey water from the kern river to his ranch land,the nicoll ditch.
in,while nicoll still owned all acres of the nicoll ranch,including the parcels referred to herein as nicoll ranch and nicoll field,a judgment was entered confirming his right to appropriate water from the kern river through the nicoll ditch.the judgment of the kern county superior court,entered on the report of arbitrators,established as follows nicoll has the third right or claim to take water from said south fork of kern river,which said claim dates from the year,said claim being to the extent of inches of water measured under a four inch pressure,and measured at the head gate of the ditch known as the nicoll ditch.the basis of this third right to take water from the south fork of the kern river was a ditch attained by the diversion and conveyance of water from the south fork of the kern river through the nicoll ditch by nicoll,beginning in and continuing to the present day,which created a valid appropriative right.
the judgment indicated that the individual water rights adjudicated therein were appurtenant to each party real estate on which the appropriated water was used for beneficial purposes.specifically,the judgment declared that the rights of the parties in and to the waters of the south fork of kern river,and the right to take and appropriate said water,for the purpose of irrigation,and other beneficial purposes,were being determined as to the land owned by said parties,which land has acquired a water right from or in connection with said south fork of kern river 
along with the judgment and report of arbitrators,the documents presented in the trial court below included the written agreement to submit the original controversy to arbitration.in that submittal,the parties to the dispute basically agreed that approximately inches of water,measured under a four inch pressure,should be allowed as to each tract that had acquired a water right,or as to fractional increments of acres.
in,nicoll executed a deed of trust on the nicoll field parcel as security for a loan from united security bank and trust company.in,the nicoll field parcel was foreclosed on and a trustee deed was issued to bank of america.in,an indenture transferred said parcel to rudnick predecessors,and rudnick is now the present owner of nicoll field.
in addition to the stipulated facts summarized above,the trial court heard the testimony of nicoll.nicoll,who was years old at time of trial and has lived at nicoll ranch his entire life,testified that in the and early nicoll ditch water was used to irrigate approximately acres of the nicoll ranch parcel,but only acres of the nicoll field parcel.based on these estimates of preforeclosure water usage,nicoll claimed that his property,nicoll ranch,should be allocated approximately percent of the water rights,and that rudnick property,nicoll field,should receive percent thereof.in contrast,rudnick argued that the judgment established that the water rights were appurtenant to the entirety of the land,and when he acquired percent of the original acreage,a proportionate share of the water rights passed to him,percent.
on march,the trial court issued its proposed statement of decision in which it adopted the analysis of rudnick.on march,judgment was entered in favor of rudnick,declaring rudnick to be the owner of of the water rights appurtenant to the nicoll ranch that were recognized in the judgment and report of arbitrators.
nicoll appeals from the judgment.

ii.overview of water rights law 
the parties dispute centers on an appropriative water right acquired by the original landowner of their two parcels.as background,we briefly consider the nature of such a water right under california law.
california operates under the dual system of water rights which recognizes both the appropriation and the riparian doctrines.citation.the riparian doctrine confers upon the owner of land contiguous to a watercourse the right to the reasonable and beneficial use of water on his land.the appropriation doctrine contemplates the diversion of water and applies to any taking of water for other than riparian or overlying uses.citation.both riparian and appropriative rights are usufructuary only and confer no right of private ownership in the watercourse.citation.people shirokow cal d,fn.omitted.appropriative rights are subordinate to the rights of riparian owners and prior appropriators,and may be lost by nonuse.pleasant valley canal borror th,d.
historically,appropriative water rights developed during the gold rush days and were acquired by diverting water for beneficial use,but beginning in under a statutory scheme were only acquired through a statutory process 
upon discovery of gold and the development of the california mining industry,water was often diverted from streams passing through government lands to be used on nonriparian lands.to accommodate this usage,the doctrine of appropriation originated and was incorporated in california water law.citation.the appropriation doctrine confers upon one who actually diverts and uses water the right to do so provided that the water is used for reasonable and beneficial uses and is surplus to that used by riparians or earlier appropriators.appropriators need not own land contiguous to the watercourse,but appropriation rights are subordinate to riparian rights so that in times of
