in this case,a flood control district proposed a storm drainage fee to fund improvements intended to prevent flooding and flood damage.pursuant to article xiii d,section of the california constitution enacted as part of proposition in,the fee was voted on by the property owners in the district,and obtained the needed majority.one property owner challenged the legality of the election,a challenge that,after various iterations,came down to this the ballots were not secret,because the ballot contained on its face the name and address of the voter,and required the voter to sign the ballot,so that inspection of the ballot would reveal how the person voted.although the procedures enacted by the flood control district provided that the ballots would remain secret before tabulation and would be revealed for inspection after tabulation only pursuant to a court order,it was argued,and the court of appeal held,that these measures were insufficient.although article xiii d is silent on the matter of ballot secrecy,article ii,section guarantees a secret ballot in elections,and the court of appeal concluded that the latter article was fully applicable to fee elections conducted pursuant to article xiii d,section.the court of appeal further concluded that secrecy provisions adopted by the district were inadequate,and that,when a voter is asked to vote on a ballot that reveals his or her identity,article ii requires that he or she receive explicit assurances that the ballot will remain secret.the court of appeal therefore overturned the election result.
we disagree with the court of appeal.as explained below,article xiii d,section,while incorporating various measures to preserve secrecy,does not incorporate wholesale the ballot secrecy requirements of article ii,section,and does not require the kind of assurances the court of appeal opinion contemplated.we therefore reverse the court of appeal and reinstate the election result.
factual and procedural background 
in,the marin county flood control and water conservation district district proposed a new storm drainage fee to be imposed on the owners of property within zone of the district ross valley,which includes all or part of larkspur,ross,san anselmo,fairfax,and surrounding communities.the area had a history of chronic flooding,which included a flood on or about december,that allegedly caused over million in damage.according to the storm drainage fee report report authorized by the district,this was a storm,meaning there was a percent chance that a storm of that severity would happen in a given year.the area had also experienced storms in and.much of ross valley,according to the report,provides only for flood protection,meaning that it could be overwhelmed by a storm that has a percent chance of occurring in a given year.
in response to the threat of future storm damage,various government officials and citizen groups developed a proposal for a fee to fund flood control improvements.the proposal,articulated in the report,prescribed measures such as removing various constrictions that block the creeks and adding upstream detention basins to hold and release water gradually.the report arrived at a cost estimate for these improvements and devised a fee methodology,with the amount of the fee a property owner would be required to pay varying according to the size and type of the parcel.intervenors flood mitigation league of ross valley and friends of the corte madera creek watershed participated in this process.
the district board,the marin county board of supervisors board,accepted the report,adopted written protest procedures pursuant to article xiii d,section,scheduled a public hearing on the fee for may,at which protests to the fee election could be registered pursuant to article xiii d,section,subdivision a,and directed the mailing of notices to affected property owners.on may,the board declared by resolution that there was no majority protest at the public hearing and called a special election on the fee to be held on monday,june,solely by mailed ballot,pursuant to and in accordance with section and the procedures attached hereto.
the ballot mailed by the district to property owners consisted of card stock that stated the instructions for filling out the ballot on one side and the actual ballot on the other.the instructions specified that the ballots were to be signed.the actual ballot contained the name and address of the property owner,the exact amount of the annual fee to be imposed on the property owner,the statement of the question to be voted on,yes and no check boxes,and designated spaces for the voter printed name,signature,and the date.
an exhibit a to the district board resolution adopted local rules for the election.those rules provided that the election was to be conducted by mail,that the clerk of the board of supervisors of marin county was to date stamp the return envelopes of the unopened ballots as they were received and place them in a secure container or lock box.the ballots were to be opened only after all the ballots were due on june,at.it was further specified that only the clerk and deputy clerks were to have access to the ballots,and that they were not to disclose how a particular voter voted,unless required to do so by a court order.
the official canvass of the votes showed total ballots cast yes votes no votes invalidated votes.on july,the board by resolution declared that the measure had passed.on july,the board adopted an ordinance implementing the fee.
on july,ford greene,a property owner in the district who voted in the election,demanded a recount of the election results pursuant to elections code section.the record does not include any written response to the recount demand or any official declaration of the results of a recount.on august,greene filed a verified complaint for an election contest pursuant to elections code section et.the district answered and,pursuant to the trial court authorization,flood mitigation league of ross valley and friends of the corte madera creek watershed filed their complaint in intervention,joining the district in opposing appellant election contest complaint.
the crux of greene complaint was that the notice given to the voters did not adequately inform them that they were required to sign the ballot,because the warning was inconspicuously placed in small type and was not in boldface.he alleged that as a result of this defect,ballots were invalidated for lack of signature,approximately percent of the votes cast,in contrast to the usual percent invalidation rate in marin county elections.this inadequate notice required that the election contest be set aside,or that there be a recount that would include the unsigned ballots.the district denied the allegations in its answer to the complaint.at a september,case management hearing,the parties stipulated that the court could determine greene election challenge solely on the pleadings and on the face of the ballot and waived an evidentiary hearing.
meanwhile,the flood mitigation league of ross valley and the friends of corte madera creek watershed filed a complaint in intervention on august,requesting declaratory relief declaring the election to be lawful.in his answer to the complaint in intervention,greene raised as one of his affirmative defenses that the requirement that voters sign their ballots violated the ballot secrecy requirement of article ii,section.
the trial court rejected the argument,concluding that the requirement to sign ballots was expressly authorized by article xiii d and by government code section.the court further ruled that the notice to voters of the signature requirement was sufficient.the trial court denied the election contest in its entirety.
on appeal,the court of appeal redefined the issue to be decided.although initially challenging the signature requirement per se,greene clarified at oral argument,and in his appellate briefs,and the record of the trial court proceedings confirm,that his central legal argument in this litigation has always been that article ii,section secret voting requirement applies to an article xiii d,section c fee election.
the court of appeal reversed the trial court.first the court concluded,for reasons elaborated below,that the secret voting requirement did in fact apply to the election at issue.it then concluded that the district procedures did not adequately protect voter secrecy although the district election procedures may have actually provided sufficient secrecy,the court of appeal concluded,as explained at greater length below,that the voters were not given adequate assurances that their ballots would be kept secret,and therefore were for all intents and purposes deprived of a secret ballot.
we granted review to clarify the election secrecy requirements,if any,imposed by article xiii d,section.before proceeding to the merits,we discuss the underlying constitutional and statutory scheme.
ii.proposition and government code section 
the court of appeal in howard jarvis taxpayers city of riverside th,usefully summarized the purpose of proposition proposition can best be understood against its historical background,which begins in with the adoption of proposition.the purpose of proposition was to cut local property taxes.citation.citation.its principal provisions limited ad valorem property taxes to percent of a property assessed valuation and limited increases in the assessed valuation to percent per year unless and until the property changed hands.cal,art.xiii a.
to prevent local governments from subverting its limitations,proposition also prohibited counties,cities,and special districts from enacting any special tax without a vote of the electorate.cal,art.xiii a,rider county of san diego cal th.it has been held,however,that a special assessment is not a special tax within the meaning of proposition.knox city of orland cal th,and cases cited.accordingly,a special assessment could be imposed without a vote.
in november,in part to change this rule,the electorate adopted proposition,which added articles xiii c and xiii d to the california constitution.proposition allows only four types of local property taxes an ad valorem property tax a special tax an assessment and a fee or charge.cal,art.xiii d,subd.a see also cal,art.xiii d,subd.a.it buttresses proposition limitations on ad valorem property taxes and special taxes by placing analogous restrictions on assessments,fees,and charges.
proposition findings and declarations state the people of the state of california hereby find and declare that proposition was intended to provide effective tax relief and to require voter approval of tax increases.however,local governments have subjected taxpayers to excessive tax,assessment,fee and charge increases that not only frustrate the purposes of voter approval for tax increases,but also threaten the economic security of all californians and the california economy itself.this measure protects taxpayers by limiting the methods by which local governments exact revenue from taxpayers without their consent,stats,also reprinted at historical notes,west ann.cal.const.supp.foll.it also states the provisions of this act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes of limiting local government revenue and enhancing taxpayer consent.
article xiii d,enacted as part of proposition,specifically addresses the means by which local government agencies may impose assessments and property related fees.assessment means any levy or charge upon real property by an agency for a special benefit conferred upon the real property.assessment includes,but is not limited to,special assessment,benefit assessment,maintenance assessment and special assessment tax.art.xiii d,subd.b.fee or charge means any levy other than an ad valorem tax,a special tax,or an assessment,imposed by an agency upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership,including a user fee or charge for a property related service,subd.e.
article xiii d,section sets forth in considerable detail the procedures for adopting assessments.assessments are levied in proportion to the special benefit conferred on a parcel,subd.a,as calculated in an engineer report,subd.b,and each affected property owner must receive detailed notice about the assessment,subd.c.subdivision d provides each notice mailed to owners of identified parcels within the district pursuant to subdivision c shall contain a ballot which includes the agency address for receipt of the ballot once completed by any owner receiving the notice whereby the owner may indicate his or her name,reasonable identification of the parcel,and his or her support or opposition to the proposed assessment.italics added.
subdivision e provides the agency shall conduct a public hearing upon the proposed assessment not less than days after mailing the notice of the proposed assessment to record owners of each identified parcel.at the public hearing,the agency shall consider all protests against the proposed assessment and tabulate the ballots.the agency shall not impose an assessment if there is a majority protest.a majority protest exists if,upon the conclusion of the hearing,ballots submitted in opposition to the assessment exceed the ballots submitted in favor of the assessment.in tabulating the ballots,the ballots shall be weighted according to the proportional financial obligation of the affected property.italics added.
article xiii d,section,concerning property related fees,provides a somewhat different procedure.once the amount of the fee per parcel is calculated,the agency must provide written notice to each affected property owner and the opportunity to protest the fee.at the public hearing,the government agency is to tabulate all the written protests to the proposed fee,and if a majority of owners of the identified parcels protest,the fee will not be imposed.art.xiii d,subd.a.
if,however,there is no majority protest,the proposed fee is put before the voters for approval.subdivision c sets forth the manner of conducting such an election and states in full except for fees or charges for sewer,water,and refuse collection services,no property related fee or charge shall be imposed or increased unless and until that fee or charge is submitted and approved by a majority vote of the property owners of the property subject to the fee or charge or,at the option of the agency,by a vote of the electorate residing in the affected area.the election shall be conducted not less than days after the public hearing.an agency may adopt procedures similar to those for increases in assessments in the conduct of elections under this subdivision.italics added.
after passage of proposition,the legislature passed in government code section et designed to clarify the implementation of proposition.stats,ch.section addressed the procedures for protesting assessments.as originally enacted,section contained no provisions for assessment ballot secrecy.the statute provided that e ach assessment ballot shall be signed and either mailed or otherwise delivered to the address indicated on the assessment ballot.former,subd.c,as enacted by stats,ch.it further provided that t he majority protest proceedings described in this subdivision shall not constitute an election or voting for purposes of article ii of the california constitution or of the california elections code,subd.e,as enacted by stats,ch.
section was amended in to provide for a certain measure of assessment ballot secrecy.according to the legislative history,the amendment was initiated by the howard jarvis taxpayers association,the original sponsors of proposition.the impetus for the amendment was the practice in some cities of putting pressure on property owners to change their votes after they had submitted their ballots but before the deadline for submitting ballots.assem.com.on local,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may.on the other hand,the legislative history reveals that earlier,unsuccessful legislative attempts to protect the secrecy of assessment ballots were viewed as too extreme.ibid.
instead,the amendment made clear that ballot secrecy was to be preserved before the assessment ballots were tabulated,but that the ballots were to be made a public record thereafter.section,subdivision c,as amended in,therefore now provides in pertinent part assessment ballots shall remain sealed until the tabulation of ballots pursuant to subdivision e commences,provided that an assessment ballot may be submitted,or changed,or withdrawn by the person who submitted the ballot prior to the conclusion of the public testimony on the proposed assessment at the hearing required pursuant to subdivision d.section,subdivision e provides in pertinent part at the conclusion of the public hearing conducted pursuant to subdivision d,an impartial person designated by the agency who does not have a vested interest in the outcome of the proposed assessment shall tabulate the assessment ballots submitted,and not withdrawn,in support of or opposition to the proposed assessment during and after the tabulation,the assessment ballots shall be treated as disclosable public records,as defined in section,and equally available for inspection by the proponents and the opponents of the proposed assessment.italics added.
most of the other original provisions of section,including the requirement that ballots be signed and the proviso that these procedures are not elections within the meaning of article ii,were not modified by the amendment and remain in force today.
iii.discussion 
we review questions of law about the meaning of proposition,as other questions of law,de novo.apartment of los angeles county city of los angeles cal th.
here,article ii,section,provides that v oting shall be secret.the right to a secret ballot is the very foundation of our election system.scott kenyon cal d.the right is an important and valuable safeguard for the protection of the voter,and particularly the humble citizen,against the influence which wealth and situation may be supposed to exercise.robinson mcabee.
yet although these secrecy requirements have been applied scrupulously to candidate elections and to initiatives and referenda,elections outside these traditional electoral areas have not invariably been governed by the constitutional right of secrecy.thus in alden superior court d,alden,the court concluded that an election to form a water district was not bound by the constitutional secrecy requirements of the predecessor to article ii,section the creation of such a district is a legislative act,and the legislature may enact conditions,upon the performance of which the district shall be regarded as organized.the court cited tarpey mcclure cal.tarpey,in which the court upheld the constitutionality of the water storage district act of,which provided for a formation election in which only property owners were entitled to vote,and each voter was given one vote for each worth of his land.the tarpey court concluded that this act did not violate the right to vote then provided in former ii,section,by denying to any but land owners the right to vote at district elections i t is now clear,in the light of the later decisions,that those provisions of the constitution refer to the qualification of electors entitling them to vote at the ordinary elections,local and general,held in the course of the usual functions of civil government.citations.the formation of this and similar districts is a function pertaining purely to the legislative branch of the government.wherefore it may do so by giving such persons as it may think best an opportunity to be heard.tarpey,supra,at.for the same reason,it denied a challenge to the act based on the constitutional right to a secret ballot.ibid.
the question is whether and to what extent the right to vote in secret set forth in article ii,section applies to the voting procedures set forth in a different and more recently enacted constitutional provision,article xiii d,section.to answer this question we first examine the relevant constitutional language.
whereas section of article xiii d and section provide in considerable detail the procedures for obtaining and tabulating assessment ballots,the description of the procedures for fee elections under article xiii d,section is quite brief that section merely provides that a fee or charge must be submitted and approved either by a majority vote of the property owners of the property subject to the fee or charge or,at the option of the agency,by a vote of the electorate residing in the affected area.it further states an agency may adopt procedures similar to those for increases in assessments in the conduct of elections under this subdivision.
to determine whether secrecy requirements apply to fee elections,we therefore first turn to the procedures for assessment balloting to determine whether and to what extent assessment balloting requires secrecy.as the court of appeal recognized,although proposition is silent on the secrecy issue,s everal of the requirements suggest a nonsecret vote.the ballot must be one whereby the owner may indicate his or her name,reasonable identification of the parcel,and his or her support or opposition to the proposed assessment,which suggests that these three pieces of information will appear on a single piece of paper in contrast to the typical election ballot that does not identify the voter.art.xiii d,subd.d.the ballots must be tabulated a t the public hearing,which suggests the information on the ballot might become public at the hearing.art.xiii d,subd.e.finally,ballots must be weighted according to the proportional financial obligation of the affected property,which requires the person actually tabulating the ballots to take the identity of the parcel and thus of the property owner into account,again suggesting a nonsecret procedure.
the court of appeal nonetheless concluded that the question of whether or not section requires secret voting is unclear.it reasoned that an agency could comply with article xiii d,section while maintaining secrecy in voting.the information on the ballot need not be publicly disclosed at the public hearing.the persons tabulating the ballots could use the information on the ballot even if all gathered on a single piece of paper to validate,weight,and count the ballots but keep the information confidential in the absence of a challenge to the balloting resulting in a court disclosure order.indeed,this was the procedure prescribed for the district fee election under the election procedures.
alternatively,the voter and parcel identifying information could be placed on the outside of an envelope that contains the ballot,in the manner of absentee voting.see.the voter qualification could then be confirmed and the weight to be accorded the ballot calculated before the ballot was opened.there would need to be a mechanism to associate the actual vote with the weight of the ballot,but this could be done using computer coding to avoid public disclosure of any individual property owner vote,the association of a particular voter to a particular vote would be hidden within the computer databank unless ordered disclosed on a challenge to the balloting or by some other mechanism strictly limiting the disclosure of information that would link the identity of a voter to a yes or no vote.
but the question is not whether assessment balloting under article xiii d,section could be done in a manner that protects secrecy.the question rather is whether section requires secrecy.to address that question,we first review certain basic tenets of constitutional construction.the principles of constitutional interpretation are similar to those governing statutory construction.in interpreting a constitution provisions,our paramount task is to ascertain the intent of those who enacted it.citation.to determine that intent,we look first to the language of the constitutional text,giving the words their ordinary meaning.citation.if the language is clear,there is no need for construction.citation.if the language is ambiguous,however,we consider extrinsic evidence of the enacting body intent.professional engineers in california government kempton cal th.
moreover,r udimentary principles of construction dictate that when constitutional provisions can reasonably be construed so as to avoid conflict,such a construction should be adopted.serrano.priest cal d,see also lungren deukmejian cal d.as a means of avoiding conflict,a recent,specific provision is deemed to carve out an exception to and thereby limit an older,general provision.citations.izazaga superior court cal d.
as noted,section,subdivision d provides that the ballot must be one whereby the owner may indicate his or her name,reasonable identification of the parcel,and his or her support or opposition to the proposed assessment,which,as the court of appeal correctly observed,suggests that these three pieces of information will appear on a single piece of paper,in contrast to the typical election ballot that does not identify the voter the provision in section,subdivision e that the votes be tabulated at a public hearing also weighs in favor of interpreting section to authorize nonsecret voting.
moreover i n cases of ambiguity we also may consult any contemporaneous constructions of the constitutional provision made by the legislature or by administrative agencies.city and county of san francisco county of san mateo cal th.o ur past cases establish that the presumption of constitutionality accorded to legislative acts is particularly appropriate when the legislature has enacted a statute with the relevant constitutional prescriptions clearly in mind.citation.in such a case,the statute represents a considered legislative judgment as to the appropriate reach of the constitutional provision.although the ultimate constitutional interpretation must rest,of course,with the judiciary see marbury madison cranch,a focused legislative judgment on the question enjoys significant weight and deference by the courts.pacific legal foundation brown cal d.
here,as discussed,section,enacted specifically to address the article xiii d,section,provides that the provisions of article ii,which includes in section the ballot secrecy provision at issue here,do not apply to the assessment ballot procedures prescribed in section,subd.e.the statute also provides that the ballots must be signed,further indicating that the ballot is not secret,subd.c.moreover,as discussed,section was later amended to specifically address voter secrecy requirements,and now provides that the ballots shall be secret before tabulation and public thereafter,but did not alter the voter identification provisions of assessment ballots.
we therefore conclude,based on all the above,that section of article xiii d,sets forth a balloting scheme that authorizes a ballot on which a property owner not only indicates his or her vote,but also his or her name and parcel public disclosure of the ballots,at least during and after tabulation.
this conclusion does not fully answer the question before us.as discussed,article xiii d,section provides for voter approval of fees in elections in which the sponsoring government agency may adopt procedures similar to those for increases in assessments,obviously referring to section.what does procedures similar to those for increases in assessments in the conduct of elections under this subdivision mean in this context to answer the question we identify precisely the kinds of election or balloting procedures set forth in section,governing approval of assessment increases,and which of these may have been incorporated into section elections.
the procedures in article xiii d,section pertaining to the conduct of voting on assessments may be separated into three categories.subdivision c specifies the manner in which the affected property owners will be notified of the assessment.subdivision d prescribes the basic content of the ballot,and requires,as discussed above,voter.subdivision e prescribes the manner in which a public hearing is conducted,during which the ballots are tabulated.
one would expect the procedures similar to those for increases in assessments language in section,subdivision c to refer to procedures found in section but not in section,otherwise there would be no need to refer to the former section.section,subdivision c notice provisions are similar to those provided in section,subdivision a.section,subdivision a has rules for conducting a public hearing at which protests will be considered before an election that are similar to those set forth in section,subdivision e.what section does not have is any provision regarding the composition of the ballot to be sent to property owners in the event of an election.it therefore can be reasonably inferred from the plain language of the statute that procedures similar to those for increases in assessments in the conduct of elections under this subdivision includes the use of a ballot for property owner fee elections that is similar to one used to register assessment protests as set forth in section,subdivision d.as explained above,that ballot includes voter identification of both the name and the property of the voter on the ballot.
greene argues that the phrase procedures similar to those for increases in assessments in the conduct of elections under this subdivision refers only to the procedures to conduct the election exclusively by mail and not to the contents or features of the ballot.he cites no authority for this narrow reading,either in the language,the ballot arguments,or any other available legislative history.if what section could borrow from section were confined to ballots,one would expect appropriately narrow language,rather than the open ended,plural procedures similar to.
greene argues that the adoption of the requirement that a property identify himself and his property on the ballot only makes sense in the context of weighted voting,and further argues that section does not permit weighted voting.the resolution of the question whether section authorizes weighted voting is not immediately clear.on the one hand,section,subdivision c refers to a fee increase approved by a majority of property owners of the property subject to the fee,which greene argues would preclude weighted voting.but see american federation of musicians wittstein,fair import of phrase by a majority vote of the delegates voting at a regular convention includes weighted voting.on the other hand,the reference in that subdivision to procedures similar to those for increases in assessments in the conduct of elections art.xiii d,subd.c may arguably include weighted voting procedures.
we need not decide this question,however,because the answer does not affect the resolution of the issue presented.the district did not employ weighted voting in this case.rather,we disagree with greene premise that the nonsecret voting procedures of section must apply only to weighted voting elections.greene argues in effect that whereas weighted voting may require voter,property owner elections in which each parcel has one vote must be conducted with a secret ballot in the manner prescribed in the elections code for and absentee ballots,in which the identifying information is not placed on the ballot itself but on the envelope enclosing the ballot.see,see also peterson city of san diego cal d,peterson.whether,property owner elections are less amenable to the elections code procedures is unclear.it may be that this type of nonsecret voting is efficacious in verifying the qualification of property and dealing with situations in which more than one vote is cast for a given property,which can occur,for example,if there is more than one record owner of a given property or the record owner is not the actual current owner.moreover,as discussed above,it is not clear that weighted voting requires nonsecret elections.what is clear is that article xiii d,section,does authorize ballots on which voters are required to identify themselves and section authorizes election procedures similar to section.therefore,in the absence of explicit language or legislative history to the contrary,we conclude section also authorizes a ballot with voter,irrespective of whether weighted voting is used 
we therefore conclude that article xiii d,section,subdivision c authorizes government agencies to require property owners to identify themselves and their parcels on the ballot on which they indicate how they are casting their votes.the fact that such identification is authorized under article xiii d,however,does not mean that fee elections are devoid of secrecy requirements.although procedures for increases in assessments in section,subdivision c refers to section of that article,it may also be reasonably read to include procedures subsequently devised by the legislature to implement section that are consistent with that section.thus,it may be read to include the requirement of section that ballots remain secret at least until the time they are tabulated.furthermore,it may be the case that some secrecy requirements apply in section elections even during and after ballot tabulation.after all,the provision in section,subdivision e that the assessment protest ballots become public records after they are tabulated at a public hearing,may not apply to section ballots,wherein such a method of tabulation is not required.
we need not decide these questions,because it is undisputed that the district protected ballot secrecy before the ballots were tabulated and that their procedures provided for allowing the inspection of the ballots by the public only pursuant to court order.the court of appeal acknowledged the secrecy of the district procedures,and stated that t hese procedures,if followed,might have been sufficient to preserve the secrecy of the voting.
the court of appeal nonetheless invalidated the election,reasoning as follows i nsofar as the record indicates,voters were not provided any assurances that their votes would remain confidential both before and after tabulation of the ballots.although the election procedures were public documents,they were not mailed to voters and the materials provided to voters to describe the election procedures and included in the record did not assure them of voting secrecy.voters who are required to cast their votes on ballots that disclose their names and identify the property they own and that must be signed to be counted,and who are not provided assurances that their votes will be kept permanently confidential,may reasonably be said to have been denied their right to vote,subd.e as that right is protected by article ii,section.that is,they have been denied their right to vote freely with the confidence that their votes will remain secret before and after tabulation of the ballots.
we disagree.proposition together with its subsequent implementing legislation provides specific,sui generis procedures for conducting assessment protest balloting,and permits local government agencies to use similar procedures in conducting fee elections.nowhere in either section or section of article xiii d,nor in section,are such assurances required.nor does article ii,section,on its face,require such assurances.
this is not to say that such notice may not be provided,nor that it is not desirable.but the fact that a court may devise in retrospect a procedure that would have increased the perception of ballot secrecy does not mean that the failure to adopt such a procedure requires invalidation of the election.section,subdivision c by its plain terms was intended to provide a safe harbor for localities that conduct fee elections using procedures similar to the procedures prescribed for assessment balloting.we conclude that because the district adopted such procedures,the election was therefore lawful 
in arriving at the contrary conclusion,the court of appeal focused,and greene now focuses,on the use of the words vote and election in the proposition ballot pamphlet.the court of appeal noted that the legislative analyst analysis of the initiative used the words election and vote for both the assessment balloting procedure and for fee elections.see ballot,legis.analyst,analysis of.the court further stated the overwhelming focus of the arguments in support of and in opposition to the initiative was also on the issue of voting rights.proponents of the measure argued that the initiative would guarantee your right to vote on local tax when they are called something else,like assessments or fees ballot,supra,argument in favor of.after describing how local politicians had used assessments to create loopholes in proposition requirement of voter approval for taxes,the proponents argued,taxpayers have no right to vote on these tax increases and others like them unless proposition passes ballot,at.the proponents repeatedly argued that the initiative gives taxpayers the right to vote on taxes.id.at.opponents of the measure also focused on voting rights,but alleged that those rights would be infringed because of the property qualification for voting on assessments and the weighting of assessment ballots.the opponents did not suggest that voting rights would be further infringed by the absence of a secret ballot.neither did the proponents.voters reading these ballot arguments would reasonably conclude that voting rights were at issue and that those rights arguably were infringed by limiting one voting rights according to property qualifications and weighted ballots.in other respects,however,voting rights were preserved or enhanced.
the argument proves too much.the proponents in the passage quoted above referred to the right to vote on assessments,and indeed proposition was designed to do just that.but as discussed above,proposition did not contemplate a secret ballot in the traditional sense for those casting assessment protests,as is evident from the plain language of article xiii d,section.therefore,the use of the term vote in the ballot arguments did not by itself indicate that there would be a secret ballot.
greene cites dictum in view water agency verjil cal th,bighorn w hen a word has been used in different parts of a single enactment,courts normally infer that the word was intended to have the same meaning throughout.greene then argues that the term election is used in article xiii c,also enacted as part of proposition,to apply to voter approval of special and general taxes,conventional elections that clearly contemplate secret ballots.see art.xiii c.it must therefore be the case,he argues,that elections referred to in article xiii d must also contemplate secret ballots.
the problem with this argument is suggested by bighorn itself.in that case,we addressed whether water delivery charges to existing customers were fees or charges within the meaning of article xiii c,section,which authorizes use of the initiative power to reduce or repeal such fees or charges.we stated because article xiii c and article xiii d were enacted together by proposition,it seems unlikely that the terms fee and charge were meant to carry entirely different meanings in those two articles,although some variation in meaning is possible.bighorn,supra,cal th at,latter italics added.in that case,we further noted that it was possible that the terms fee and charge did have different meanings in articles xiii c and xiii d,because those terms in the former article did not seem to be limited to fees,as they were in the latter article.bighorn,at.
in the present case,the term election is a general one in which many variations are possible,and there is no reason to assume procedural uniformity in every statute in which the term is used.thus,for example,the fee elections in section,subdivision c authorize limiting the election to only property owners,while most other elections,including elections pertaining to special and general taxes in article xiii c,section,do not permit property qualifications.the elections authorized by proposition may be conducted by mail alone,while most other elections may not be,subd.c.there is no reason to suppose that the term election has a core meaning of ballot secrecy when the specific constitutional provisions authorizing the election indicate otherwise.
nor do we find convincing the argument by greene and the amici curiae in support of his position that the presumption against implied partial repeal see stop youth addiction,lucky stores,cal th,means that we should presume section intended to incorporate article ii secrecy provision.as noted above,our case law has held that property owner elections are generally not subject to constitutional voter secrecy requirements.see tarpey,supra,cal.at alden,supra,d at.this case law largely undercuts the implied repeal argument,because section,subdiv
