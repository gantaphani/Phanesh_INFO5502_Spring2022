the san carlos apache tribe tribe appeals from a decision of the united states court of federal claims,which dismissed the tribe monetary damages claim against the united states for an alleged breach of fiduciary duty relating to water rights in the gila river.because the court of federal claims correctly granted the government motion to dismiss the tribe claim for lack of jurisdiction,we affirm.

the matter was appealed to the arizona supreme court,which in declined on the basis of comity to consider the tribe argument that the decree is not binding on the tribe.adjudication,at.in essence,the court held that the proper forum for challenging the interpretation and enforcement of the decree was the united states district court for the district of arizona,not arizona state court id.at.the arizona supreme court further held that the decree resolved all of the tribe water rights,under all theories,and thus precludes any further claim by the tribe to the waters of the gila river.id.at.the arizona supreme court noted that it express ed no opinion as to what other remedies,if any,might be available to the tribe for the government allegedly inadequate representation.id.at.
on january,the tribe filed a complaint in the united states court of federal claims for monetary damages.the tribe alleged that t he united states inadequate representation and failure to secure and protect the tribe aboriginal and federal reserved water rights under the decree for a permanent tribal homeland constitutes a serious breach of fiduciary duty which it owed to the tribe.compl.at.the tribe asserted that its claim against the united states for monetary damages did not become ripe until the decision of the arizona supreme court.id.at.

on appeal,the tribe argues that the court of federal claims erred by dismissing its claim.the tribe asserts that its claim against the government accrued in following the decision of the arizona supreme court,and is therefore within the statute of limitations under.the tribe contends that,due to the government legally inadequate representation of the tribe in the globe equity litigation,it was not clear until that the tribe was in fact bound by the decree.
the tribe also argues that the scope of the decree remained unclear until the arizona supreme court held that the decree precluded any claims by the tribe for additional water rights from the gila river.the tribe points out that the united states,as trustee for the tribe,continued to support the tribe claims for additional water rights until,and the tribe contends that it had no notice that the decree precluded additional water rights.the tribe thus argues that,as a beneficiary,it was entitled to rely on the government good faith and expertise without having to sue for money damages prior to the decision.further,the tribe argues that because the government did not repudiate its role as the tribe trustee until,the tribe claim for breach of fiduciary duty did not begin to accrue until then.
the government argues that the tribe claim is untimely and barred by the statute of limitations.the government contends that a claim against a trustee for breach of trust accrues when the beneficiary objectively knew or should have known of the breach.the government points out that the basis of the tribe present claim is the plain language of the decree itself,demonstrating that the tribe claim was inherently knowable to the tribe in.appellee br.at.the government further argues that the decision of the arizona supreme court in did not fix the basis of the tribe claim at most,the decision clarified the possible damages associated with the claim.therefore,the government argues,the arizona supreme court decision did not affect whether the tribe knew or should have known that its claim existed.
we agree with the government that the court of federal claims lacked jurisdiction over this case because the tribe claim is barred by the statute of limitations.the tribe complaint asserts jurisdiction pursuant to the tucker act,a.as noted above,an action brought under the tucker act is unless it is filed within six years of the date that the cause of action accrued.the central question in this case is when the tribe claim for breach of fiduciary duty accrued.we conclude that the tribe claim accrued in upon entry of the decree.as we shall explain,our conclusion is compelled by the plain terms of the decree and is consistent with the tribe own concessions in its complaint and appellate brief.
it is objectively evident that all of the events that fixed the government alleged liability and entitled the tribe to institute an action against the government occurred upon entry of the decree in.the tribe claim is based on the unsatisfactory water rights to which the government stipulated in the decree.specifically,the tribe asserts that it was inadequately represented because the united states failed to obtain aboriginal or federal reserved water rights.compl.at.however,the terms of the decree plainly and objectively indicate which water rights the tribe did and,importantly,did not receive following the settlement of the globe equity litigation.the decree does not expressly grant any aboriginal or federal reserved water rights to the tribe,and,as the tribe acknowledges,the decree plainly identifies the tribe as represented by the united states in the globe equity litigation,grants the tribe a total of acre feet of water rights,and includes a provision in article xiii stating that each and all of the parties to whom rights to water are decreed in this cause are hereby forever enjoined and restrained from asserting or claiming any right,title or interest in or to the waters of the gila river,or any thereof,except the rights specified,determined and allowed by this decree.appellee br.at.accordingly,viewed under an objective standard,fallini,at,the tribe knew or should have known that the terms of the decree precluded the tribe from seeking additional gila river water rights.
the tribe further contends that the government inadequate representation and its resulting breach of fiduciary duty arose from a severe conflict of interest due to the government representation of multiple parties in the globe equity litigation.compl.at.the facts supporting the alleged conflict of interest,however,were similarly apparent from the text of the decree,which,viewed objectively,plainly indicated that the united states represented multiple parties in the globe equity litigation.as of,therefore,the tribe was objectively on notice of the accrual of its claims against the government 
it is also evident from the tribe complaint and appellate brief that the basis for its claim in this case is the language of the decree itself.for example,the tribe complaint acknowledges that the government alleged breach of fiduciary duty was apparent from the fact that the decree provides for only for the tribe 
the united states denial of any benefits to the apaches from the san carlos project was part of a consistent pattern of discrimination against the tribe,and breach of fiduciary duty,that would be demonstrated again in the globe equity proceeding when the united states stipulated to only acre feet of gila river water for the tribe.
compl.at this is further apparent from the tribe appellate brief,which concedes,for example,that the government breach of trust is also manifested in many of the terms of the decree that provided the tribe virtually worthless limited irrigation rights while providing substantially greater more valuable rights to others.opening br.san carlos apache tribe at,wl appellant br.
the tribe also asserts that its claim arises from the government failure to stipulate to substituted water rights for the tribe,despite having done so for other parties to the decree.the complaint states the following 
the also stipulated to substantial water rights to benefit the upper valley farmers under the decree.these farmers upstream from san carlos who had entered the upper valley lands starting in the early,were provided a special substituted storage right under article viii of the decree based on the amount of water stored each year in the san carlos reservoir 
the united states utterly failed to secure comparable water rights for the tribe.it limited the tribe to a mere acre feet from the gila,and made no similar effort to established sic substituted storage rights for the tribe based upon water stored in the reservoir,even though the reservoir is located within the heart of the tribe reservation,and even though the united states was legally obligated under its fiduciary duties to act as the tribe trustee in securing its federal reserved water rights under the decree.
compl.at.thus,with regard to substituted water rights,the tribe again concedes that the government alleged breach of fiduciary duty is apparent from the terms of the decree.regarding the alleged conflict of interest,the tribe complaint acknowledges that the decree itself indicates that the united states agreed to a negotiation that provided water rights for multiple parties including the tribe.id.at.
finally,in connection with the tribe allegation that the government breached its duty to adequately represent the tribe in actions to obtain sufficient water rights to fulfill the tribe aboriginal and federal reserved water rights,id.at,the complaint references a provision of the decree granting the upper valley farmers another party to the decree a limited right to purchase the tribe for a specified sum.according to the tribe,t his agreement under the decree clearly provides evidence beyond any reasonable doubt that the government officials representing the tribe in globe equity never had any intention to secure aboriginal or federal reserved water rights for the tribe under the decree,as required under federal law.id.at.again,consistent with our conclusion that the tribe claim accrued in,the facts supporting the tribe claim arise from the terms of the decree itself.
we are not persuaded by the tribe arguments to the contrary.in support of its contention that its claim against the united states accrued in,the tribe relies on samish indian nation.united states,in which we stated that,i f a necessary element to a claim must be established in a different forum,the claim will not accrue for until that element is finally established in the other proceeding.the tribe contends that,in,the arizona supreme court decided a necessary element to its claim,that the tribe was precluded from asserting its winters and aboriginal water rights to the main stem of the gila river.appellant br.at.
samish is not controlling in this case,however.in samish,the interior department dropped the samish in from its list of federally recognized tribes.in,following a series of administrative and judicial proceedings,a federal district court ruled that the government refusal to federally recognize the tribe violated the samish due process rights and the administrative procedure act apa.id.at.in,the samish filed suit in the court of federal claims seeking,inter alia,monetary damages for lost benefits resulting from the government wrongful refusal to accord federal recognition to the samish during the period of to.id.at.
in relevant part,the opinion of the court of federal claims dismissed the samish claims as under,reasoning that the samish claims accrued in.id.we reversed that part of the court decision and held that the tribe claim for retroactive benefits did not accrue until,because the district court determination in provides a predicate wrongful element in this action.id.at.we pointed out that o nly a district court,acting on a challenge under the apa,has authority to review the secretary acts concerning the executive recognition determination.id.at.because the district court decision provided the missing element,to the samish claim for damages against the government,the samish claim accrued in its complaint filed in,less than six years later,was timely.
accordingly,in samish,a money damages claim for improperly withheld federal recognition between and required,as a necessary element,a district court determination in that federal recognition was in fact improperly withheld during that period.in contrast,in the present case,the tribe claim required no further legal determination beyond the decree itself.as discussed above,the government alleged liability was objectively fixed in with the plain language of the decree.here,unlike in samish,there was no necessary element to be established in a different forum,before the tribe claim accrued under.the decision of the arizona supreme court,rather than providing a necessary element to the tribe claim,simply stated what was readily apparent from the face of the decree.
more germane to the present case is catawba indian tribe united states.that case involved a dispute stemming from the enactment of the termination act in.catawba,at.as the supreme court of the united states ruled in,the act rendered the ancestral lands of the catawba subject to south carolina adverse possession laws.id.at citing south carolina catawba indian tribe.the catawba sued the united states in,claiming,among other things,that the government,as trustee for the catawba,breached its fiduciary duty to the catawba.id.specifically,the catawba alleged that the government failed to protect its land claim by breaching a duty to notify it of the legal effect of the act.id.the catawba also asserted that its claim did not accrue upon enactment of the act because,allegedly,the government incorrectly assured the tribe that nothing in the act would affect the tribe claim to its ancestral lands.id.at.
the court of federal claims dismissed the catawba claim as,and we affirmed.we held that the catawba claim accrued in when the act was adopted.id.at.we rejected the catawba argument that its claim did not accrue until the supreme court ruling in 
while the supreme court pronouncement in might be relevant to fixing the time when the tribe subjectively first knew what the act meant,it is fundamental jurisprudence that the act objective meaning and effect were fixed when the act was adopted.any later judicial pronouncements simply explain,but do not create,the operative effect.
id.at.we further explained that the supreme court holding in that the act was unambiguous on its face merely reinforced the conclusion that the catawba claim accrued in upon enactment of the act.id.
here,as the tribe correctly asserts,the arizona supreme court held in that the tribe was bound by the terms of the decree.however,like the supreme court in catawba,the arizona supreme court based its decision on the unambiguous language of the legal instrument fixing the alleged liability the decree.for example,in reviewing the language of the decree and determining that the tribe was bound by its terms,the arizona supreme court,foreshadowing our present decision,stated that i t is difficult to imagine more explicit language indicating that the decree was intended to resolve all of the parties claims to the gila river mainstem.adjudication,at.as in catawba,where we held that the damage was done when the act became effective in,at,we hold here that the government liability was fixed upon entry of the decree in.also,like the alleged incorrect assurances by the government in catawba,the government continued support of the tribe water rights claims following entry of the decree does not alter the fact that the terms of the decree objectively fixed the tribe claim in.
the tribe further argues that its claim did not accrue until because,u ntil the full extent and permanency of harm is objectively known,a claim does not accrue.appellant br.at.the tribe thus contends that the decision in of the arizona supreme court clarified for the first time the extent of the damages associated with the tribe claim against the government for inadequate representation in the globe equity litigation.
we disagree.we have soundly rejected the notion that the filing of a lawsuit can be postponed until the full extent of the damage is known.boling united states,discussing united states dickinson.we recently confirmed this legal principle in navajo nation united states,where we stated that,for purposes of determining when the statute of limitations begins to run,the proper focus must be upon the time of the defendant acts,not upon the time at which the consequences of the acts become most painful,quoting delaware state coll.ricks.even if,as the tribe contends,the full extent of the damages associated with the government alleged breach of trust was not certain until,all of the facts relevant to the tribe claim were known as of.see catawba,at.we therefore disagree with the tribe assertion that its claim accrued in.
as a final matter,the tribe argues that its claim is timely because it was not until that the united states definitively repudiated its role of trustee for the tribe.appellant br.at.because the tribe did not raise this argument before the court of federal claims,it is waived on appeal.see corus staal bv united states,treating as waived an argument made for the first time on appeal sage,devon,t his court does not review that which was not presented to the district court.
however,even if this argument were timely presented,we do not find it persuasive.the tribe refers us only to shoshone indian tribe united states,a case concerning the alleged mismanagement of trust funds by the united states as trustee for the shoshone.in that case,we explained 
the beneficiary,of course,may bring his action as soon as he learns that the trustee has failed to fulfill his responsibilities.it is often the case,however,that the trustee can breach his fiduciary responsibilities of managing trust property without placing the beneficiary on notice that a breach has occurred.it is therefore common for the statute of limitations to not commence to run against the beneficiaries until a final accounting has occurred that establishes the deficit of the trust.
shoshone,at citation omitted.
relying on shoshone,the tribe argues that not until a trustee repudiates the trust and the beneficiary is aware of that repudiation does a claim for breach of fiduciary duty accrue.however,shoshone involved a situation where the trustee allegedly breached its duty by mismanaging trust funds without placing the beneficiary on notice that a breach has occurred.id.in such cases,a final accounting is necessary to put the tribe on notice of the breach.id.in the present case,in contrast,a final accounting was unnecessary to put the tribe on notice of the accrual of its claim the plain terms of the decree were objectively sufficient to notify the tribe of the alleged breach,as we have explained above.
we conclude that the government alleged liability for breaching its fiduciary duty to the tribe was objectively fixed upon entry of the decree in,and that the tribe knew or should have known,jones,at,upon entry of the decree that the government breach occurred.as we explained supra,our conclusion is compelled by the plain language of the decree,which states in part 
t hat each and all of the parties to whom rights to water are decreed in this cause and the persons,estates,interests and ownerships represented by such thereof as are sued in a representative capacity herein are hereby forever enjoined and restrained from asserting or claiming any right,title or interest in or to the waters of the gila river,or any thereof,except the rights specified,determined and allowed by this decree.
appellee br.at.therefore,the tribe claim is barred by the statute of limitations set forth in.because the tribe claim is,the court of federal claims did not legally err by granting the government motion to dismiss the tribe claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the decision of the united states court of federal claims granting the government motion to dismiss the tribe complaint.
for decades the united states stood together with the san carlos apache tribe,in federal and state court,pressing the position that the globe equity decree did not finally determine the tribe water rights in the gila river.when the issue was resolved in in the arizona supreme court,and the tribe water rights were finally lost,the tribe filed a claim for monetary damages in the court of federal claims.in that court,for the first time,the united states took the position that the claim became six years after the globe equity decree of.the government now argues,and my colleagues now agree,that the tribe was required to file this suit for the value of the lost water rights,before the water rights had been finally lost and before any claim for damages arose.the court holds that this tucker act claim became in,although its premises did not arise until the arizona supreme court finally resolved the water rights issue in.thus this court provides yet another instance of the manifest injustice which has assailed the tribe at virtually every turn since their dealings with the united states and its citizens began.united states gila valley irrigation.i respectfully dissent.
discussion 
the history of the gila river water allocation supports the position that the decree did not represent the interests of the tribe.
the san carlos apache indian reservation,established in in east central arizona,is the remnant homeland of approximately tribal members.the gila river provides tribal members with water to grow crops and sustain themselves.in,and,the united states stripped out of the reservation major parcels of land including valuable bottomlands along the gila river,transferring these lands to settlers who began diverting water from the river.in construction began of the coolidge dam on the gila river,flooding nearly acres of the most valuable remaining reservation bottomlands.no storage water rights in the impoundment were provided to the san carlos tribe all such rights were dedicated to other water users.
in the united states initiated the globe equity proceeding in the united states district court for the district of arizona,to allocate gila river water rights for the san carlos apache tribe,the pima indian tribe,and others including settlers and farmers.the san carlos tribe was not a party to the proceeding and did not participate in the negotiations,while the united states ostensibly represented the san carlos tribe as trustee.the superintendent of the san carlos agency expressed strong opposition to the terms of the decree and its adverse impact on the san carlos tribe,but his protests were ignored.san carlos apache tribe united states,complaint.other united states officials,such as the special assistant to the attorney general,pressed the position that the united states should not support the san carlos tribe superior priority to gila river water.id.the resultant globe equity decree allocated acre feet of annual irrigation water to the san carlos tribe,amounting to less than two percent of the water allocated in the decree.in contrast,the pima indians gila river community was allocated acre feet of gila river annual irrigation water.the record states that this differential treatment was rationalized because the pimas are an industrious farming race while the apache are and always have been warlike and in no sense agrarian.id.non indian interests were allocated over acre feet of annual irrigation water.as a result,the gila river in the san carlos reservation is frequently reduced to a trickle and consists mostly of saltladen irrigation return flows unsuitable for use.id.
in the san carlos apache tribe filed suit in the united states district court in arizona,asserting federal reserved water rights called winters rights in the gila river and tributaries,based on the ruling in winters united states,that when the federal government creates an indian reservation,it impliedly reserve s a right to the amount of river water necessary to effectuate the purpose of the reservation.nevada united states,see also arizona california,the court in winters concluded that the government,when it created that indian reservation,intended to deal fairly with the indians by reserving for them the waters without which their lands would have been useless.
the tribe suit reached the supreme court,which held that the tribe should pursue its winters claims in arizona state court,stating that 
the mccarran amendment,as interpreted in colorado river,allows and encourages state courts to undertake the task of quantifying indian water rights in the course of comprehensive water adjudications.although adjudication of those rights in federal court instead might in the abstract be practical,and even wise,it will be neither practical nor wise as long as it creates the possibility of duplicative litigation,tension and controversy between the federal and state forums,hurried and pressured decisionmaking,and confusion over the disposition of property rights.
arizona san carlos apache tribe of.thus in the tribe filed federal reserved water rights claims in arizona state court,asserting that the tribe was entitled to annual acre feet of water from the gila river system,based on winters rights.the united states filed a separate claim in the arizona state court on behalf of the san carlos apache indian tribe,asserting federal reserved water rights as the basis of the claim.statement of claimant form,in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the gila river and source,file.the united states further stated that until the federal court with jurisdiction over the gila decree of finally determines the scope of that decree and the res judicata effect of that decree,the united states considers this claim to be an appropriate part of the tribe reserved water rights claim.id.
in various parties,apparently served by gila river water,moved the arizona state court for dismissal on the ground that the tribe claims,and the federal government claims on behalf of the tribe,were res judicata based on the globe equity decree.in response the united states stood with the tribe,and argued that the tribe is entitled to a trial on the adequacy of united states representation in the globe equity decree,based on due process considerations.see br,in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the gila river and source,no.wc ir w e agree with the apaches that a remand for further proceedings would be appropriate.among other things,to determine whether the united states exercised due diligence and reasonable prudence in prosecuting the globe equity decree on behalf of the apaches.the united states and the tribe argued that the globe equity decree did not extinguish the tribe winters rights.id.at.
the arizona supreme court held that the globe equity decree of precluded the continuing existence of preserved aboriginal or winters rights for the tribe.the arizona court explained that the claim was precluded although the issue was not litigated and the globe equity decree did not mention federal reserved or aboriginal water rights.in re the general adjudication of all rights to use water in the gila river source,holding the san carlos claim precluded as to the mai
