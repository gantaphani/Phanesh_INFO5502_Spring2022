this is an action for inverse condemnation in a flood control context.we uphold the judgment that found,with one exception,no inverse condemnation liability.we do so because the trial court,in this bench trial,decided all material issues,and properly found that defendant public entity activities met the applicable legal rule of reasonable conduct also known as the reasonableness rule.
background 
in,william hauselt plaintiff,an experienced property developer,purchased a almond orchard about a mile north of chico,eventually intending to develop the property as a residential subdivision.to date,plaintiff has been unsuccessful in obtaining development approval.a natural watercourse called keefer slough,which is on plaintiff property,forms its northern boundary the western boundary is adjacent to highway.north of keefer slough are two parcels that were developed into the subdivisions of carriage estates carriage and wildflower estates wildflower.
keefer slough is situated between rock creek to the north and mud creek to the south.for many years,keefer slough received floodwater overflow from rock creek via a natural stream bifurcation.the natural drainage in the area from rock creek is southwest toward plaintiff property and keefer slough.keefer slough and rock creek are privately owned.
plaintiff property has had a history of periodic shallow flooding two to three times a decade.this history was confirmed by department of transportation records and photographs dating from the,and a flood map from the federal emergency management agency fema showing the property in a floodplain.
when plaintiff purchased his property in,drainage improvements consisting of a pipe and ditch from the wildflower property to keefer slough were present.two months after plaintiff bought his property,he consented to carriage drainage work on his property at keefer slough in return for the cooperation of defendant county of butte the county with his development.
plaintiff contends that county,through a series of activities over several years,implemented a master storm drainage plan sometimes,the master drainage plan that made keefer slough a major part of the county public drainage system.these activities increased the flow on the plaintiff property to resulted in a taking of plaintiff property for public use.the county principal activities were as follows 
carriage and wildflower were drained using detention ponds,at each subdivision and a drainage ditch and pipes into keefer slough.county accepted the drainage improvements for carriage and wildflower,including the pipes into keefer slough.county requires developers to build detention ponds so that storm water drainage from developed sites does not exceed predevelopment levels,and to dedicate to county these works and accompanying easements necessary to own and operate the drainage system.county and plaintiff stipulated that no evidence would be offered at trial that the subdivision detention ponds were unreasonably designed or constructed.
plaintiff contended that county,in,allowed developers on the north side of keefer slough carriage and wildflower to raise the north bank of the slough above the south bank.county claimed that the trial judge inspection of the property disputed this,as did other evidence.
in the early,county built a new bridge over keefer slough at garner lane,which is upstream of plaintiff property.plaintiff contended the new bridge increased the flow in the slough,as the former bridge had been acting as a plug.county replied that plaintiff property often flooded when the former bridge was in place,and that plaintiff expert did not identify the new bridge as a substantial cause of plaintiff flooding.
in,county adopted the north chico specific plan sometimes,ncsp to implement the county general plan in the area.according to plaintiff,the ncsp identified keefer slough as the area primary drainage channel notwithstanding its inadequate flood capacity.county noted that the ncsp contemplated drainage detention basins for developed property along keefer slough that would not increase the expected peak runoff,and also contemplated,in line with general plan policy,to carry out storm drainage by means of natural watercourses like keefer slough.
before a large storm hit the area at the end of of the storm,rock creek sediment bed was three to five feet lower than keefer slough and functioned as a natural weir bifurcation that limited flow into keefer and isolated keefer topographically.the storm evened out the elevations of these sediment beds,increasing the flow into keefer slough.the county in sponsored a federally funded project through the national resources conservation service to restore the bed levels,but this restorative work was undone by a storm.plaintiff contends that county deliberately made permanent the radically changed rock slough flow regime that has taken plaintiff property.
finally,plaintiff contends that county has prevented him from developing his land for residential use,but county maintains that plaintiff has had only one development proposal denied.
on march,plaintiff sued county for inverse condemnation and related torts.
following a bench trial,the trial court concluded county permitting the carriage and wildflower development north of keefer slough,in constructing the new garner lane bridge,and in sponsoring the bed restoration project at the bifurcation of rock creek and keefer not individually,or in combination,unreasonable conduct that would impose inverse condemnation liability on county within the meaning of locklin city of lafayette cal th,d,locklin.in a related vein,the trial court also found that keefer slough is a private watercourse,and that county activities did not transform the slough into a public work or increase the flow of water in the slough or on plaintiff land plaintiff cause of action for encroachment,founded on the carriage and wildflower drainage pipes and ditch into keefer slough,was plaintiff tort claims were barred for failure to comply with the tort claims act plaintiff does not appeal this ruling and plaintiff is entitled to as just compensation for a temporary taking regarding red fox court in wildflower prior to a storm in,county placed material on plaintiff property at keefer slough to prevent flooding into red fox court.the trial court found that,although county properly undertook this work pursuant to its emergency police power and that plaintiff did not prove that this work caused his land to flood,the emergency work was still in place at the time of trial,and the court ordered the work removed the parties stipulated to a damages award for this activity of.
discussion 
inverse condemnation in the flood control context 
before delving into the issues plaintiff raises on appeal,we briefly examine the law concerning inverse condemnation in the flood control context.
article i,section of the california constitution provides the basis for an inverse condemnation action by stating that private property may not be taken or damaged for public use unless just compensation has been paid.odello brothers county of monterey th,d odello.
formerly,an exception to the rule of inverse condemnation liability was recognized in the flood control context.this liability exemption originally evolved from the common enemy doctrine in the common law.under that doctrine,a landowner threatened by flooding could erect defensive barriers without regard to flow damage done to lower landowners.because such activity was privileged when performed by a private party,it was generally considered privileged when performed by a public entity.odello,supra,th at fn,d see also locklin,supra,cal th at,d.
this exception to inverse condemnation liability,however,incurred a flood of criticism.see odello,supra,th at,d.and this led to changes in the law.
today neither a private owner nor a public entity has the right to act unreasonably with respect to other property owners.neither may disregard the interests of downstream property owners,and a public entity may no longer claim immunity in tort or inverse condemnation actions.locklin,supra,cal th at,d.with respect to flood control projects,the public agency is liable if its conduct poses an unreasonable risk of harm to the plaintiff,the unreasonable conduct is a substantial cause of the damage to the plaintiff property,and the plaintiff has taken reasonable measures to protect his property.the rule of strict liability generally followed in inverse condemnation does not apply in this context.locklin,supra,cal th at,d,see id.at,d,conc.opn.of mosk.
this reasonableness rule was deemed to best serve two competing concerns in the flood control context on the one hand,a public agency that undertakes a flood control project must not be deemed an absolute insurer on the other hand,the damage potential of a defective public flood control project is clearly enormous.bunch coachella valley water dist.cal th,d,bunch,citing belair riverside county flood control dist.cal d,belair.reasonableness,in this context,involves a balancing of public need against the gravity of private harm,and aligns with the basis for inverse condemnation liability when a public agency has acted unreasonably,the damaged property owner should be compensated because the owner has contributed more than his or her proper share to the public undertaking.bunch,supra,cal th at,d,locklin,supra,cal th at,d,see also paterno state of california th,d.
this reasonableness rule of inverse condemnation liability has been applied in the following flood control contexts where a public flood control levee on the bank of a natural watercourse failed in an area historically subject to flooding belair,supra,cal d at,where a public flood control system of dikes and levees that diverted and rechanneled water of a natural watercourse failed in an area historically subject to flooding bunch,supra,cal th at,d,and where downstream damage was caused by an increased volume or velocity of surface waters discharged into a natural watercourse from public activities or public infrastructure,or from the watercourse being converted into a public drainage system or public work locklin,supra,cal th at,d,see id.at,d,conc.opn.of mosk.
of these three flood control contexts that apply the reasonableness rule,it is the locklin context that most resembles the situation before us.
this does not mean,however,that the flood control context always invokes the application of the reasonableness rule.for example,in akins state of california th,d,a public agency intentionally diverted water and flooded private property not historically subject to flooding in order to protect other property from flooding.id.at,d.akins distinguished this situation from that in belair and bunch on the one hand is the type of situation,belair,bunch where a public entity tries to protect private property owners from a risk created by nature and in doing so may alter the risks created by nature,but the public entity efforts fail.on the other hand is a situation,akins where government appropriates private property in order to protect other property,creating a risk which would not otherwise exist.we see no unfairness in applying a reasonableness standard to the first situation but not to the second.akins,supra,at,d.as noted,and as we shall further explain later,the situation here resembles locklin,which falls within the camp,and therefore the reasonableness rule applies.
the trial court did not fail to decide the central material issue of whether county implemented the master drainage plan 
plaintiff contends that,because the trial court failed to decide the central issue in this,whether county implemented a master storm drainage plan that made keefer slough,and therefore his property,the public drainage because he presented substantial evidence to support a finding in his favor on this issue,reversal is compelled here this evidence was primarily in the form of the carriage and wildflower drainage systems,the raising of keefer slough north bank,the new garner lane bridge,the north chico specific plan,the rock creek bed restoration project,and the blocking of plaintiff development.see guardianship of brown cal d.we disagree at the threshold of this contention.we find the trial court did decide this central issue and did so against plaintiff.
the parties submitted to the trial court a joint statement of issues for trial,which included the following issues 
plaintiff asserts that the public project public benefit is for public storm drainage.the parties agree that the court s resolution of this issue of determining and defining the project activity for public benefit may include the following 
whether county exercised control over keefer slough making it a public work.
whether county commissioned and implemented a master storm drainage plan that established a network of drainage consisting of both open and closed channels,utilization of keefer slough as the conduit for drainage and by diverting surface waters into keefer slough.
plaintiff concedes the trial court decided issue against him although he claims this was done without evidentiary support more on this later,but asserts the court completely failed to decide issue.we disagree with this assertion.
a bit of background is in order.county commissioned the master storm drainage plan,which included keefer slough.the master drainage plan purpose was to set forth development drainage guidelines under one comprehensive plan.the master drainage plan primary author was civil engineer jon anderson.
anderson deposition testimony was read at trial.according to this testimony,keefer slough was the ultimate drainage way under the master drainage plan,and the plan principal objective was to maximize everything into keefer slough and use that as an outfall.the key to the whole plan,as described by this testimony,was an adequate outfall channel and,to a lesser extent,a collection manifold,a drainage hub,at the junction of keefer slough and highway.anderson cautioned that the master drainage plan would be ineffective and should not be implemented without the outfall and manifold.
the outfall and manifold envisioned by the master drainage plan were never built.instead,as plaintiff notes,the evidence showed that county required the carriage and wildflower developers to build detention ponds that eventually drained,via a ditch and pipes,into the north bank of keefer slough which is on plaintiff property.as noted previously,county requires developers to build detention ponds so that storm water drainage from developed sites does not exceed predevelopment levels.the parties stipulated at trial that no evidence would be offered that the subdivision detention ponds were unreasonably designed or constructed.
on the issue of the master drainage plan implementation,the trial court ruled as follows over the years,the county hired consultants to study drainage and flooding problems in the area.to mitigate flooding and drainage problems,developers were required to build detention ponds so that storm water drainage from developed sites did not exceed levels.developers are required to dedicate to the county these works and easements necessary to own and operate the drainage system.a study proposed a diversion channel from rock creek north of keefer slough to upper mud creek south of keefer slough and a master storm drain plan,the master drainage plan which included a detention manifold on keefer slough at highway.d epo anderson.the county did not adopt the plan or construct the diversion channel or the manifold.instead,the studies were used as a guide,for information on the effects of the natural bifurcation and the direction of natural drainage in the area.citations.italics added.
accordingly,the trial court did decide the allegedly overlooked central issue.the court concluded that county did not implement the master drainage plan that envisioned keefer slough as the public drainage hub using an outfall channel and a collection manifold.instead,county implemented a distinct drainage system based on,detention ponds designed to not exceed predevelopment drainage levels into keefer slough,and county used the master drainage plan as an informational guide.because we have concluded that the trial court did decide this issue,we need not consider whether plaintiff has prese
