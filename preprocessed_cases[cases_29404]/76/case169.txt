the national forests of the sierra nevada mountains the sierras are home to a rich array of fauna,including at least species of fish and species of amphibians.the sierra nevada ecosystem project,a study commissioned by congress,concluded in that their environment has been severely degraded the systems are the most altered and impaired habitats in the sierra.
the national forests in the sierras are managed under eleven forest plans the forest plans.in january,the united states forest service forest service issued a final environmental impact statement eis recommending amendments to the forest plans in the sierras.the amendments were intended,among other things,to conserve and repair the aquatic and riparian ecosystems.in january,under the administration of president clinton,the forest service adopted a modified version of the preferred alternative recommended in the eis.the parties refer to this as the framework.
in november,under the administration of newly elected president bush,the chief of the forest service asked for a review of the framework.in january,the forest service issued a final supplemental environmental impact statement eis recommending significant changes to the framework.the forest service adopted the preferred alternative in the eis.the parties refer to this as the framework.
plaintiff appellant pacific rivers council pacific rivers brought suit in federal district court challenging the framework as inconsistent with the national environmental protection act nepa and the administrative procedure act apa.the gravamen of pacific rivers complaint is that the eis does not sufficiently analyze the environmental consequences of the framework for fish and amphibians.on for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment to the forest service.
pacific rivers timely appealed the grant of summary judgment.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the forest service analysis of fish in the eis does not comply with nepa.however,we conclude that the forest service analysis of amphibians does comply with nepa.we therefore reverse in part,affirm in part,and remand to the district court.
background 
stretching along a axis for more than miles,the sierra nevada mountains form one of the longest continuous mountain ranges in the lower states.the forest service manages nearly million acres of land under the forest plans.each forest plan is a land and resource management plan lrmp formulated and promulgated pursuant to the national forest management act nfma.see.nfma requires the forest service to provide for and to coordinate multiple uses of the national forests,including outdoor recreation,range,timber,watershed,wildlife and fish,and wilderness.e.an lrmp adopted pursuant to nfma guides all management decisions within the forests subject to that lrmp.individual projects are developed according to the guiding principles and management goals expressed in the lrmp.see ohio forestry ass n,sierra club,d.
the forest plans govern the eleven national forests that run the length of the sierras from southern california to the california oregon border the sequoia,inyo,sierra,stanislaus,humboldt toiyabe,eldorado,tahoe,plumas,lassen,and modoc national forests,and the lake tahoe basin management unit.the area encompassed by the plan amounts to more than of the total forest land managed by the forest service.see national forests encompass million acres.the forests support substantial economic activity,including logging and grazing,as well as recreation.the forests comprise dozens of complex ecosystems.they include iconic natural landmarks such as whitney,mono lake,lake tahoe,and giant sequoia trees.
as part of its mandate to manage the national forests,the forest service took major steps in the to improve the ecological health of the sierras.in november,the forest service published a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement eis analyzing a number of proposed changes to the forest plans for the sierras.the forest service cited the need to improve national forest management direction for five broad problems conservation of ecosystems,conservation of aquatic,riparian,and meadow ecosystems,increased risk of fire and fuels buildup,introduction of noxious weeds,and sustaining hardwood forests.
in,after nearly a decade of study,the forest service proposed a number of changes to the forest plans to ensure the ecological sustainability of the entire sierra nevada ecosystem and the communities that depend on it.the forest service issued a draft eis evaluating eight alternatives for implementing the objectives outlined in the notice of intent.following public comment,scientific review and consultation with other agencies,the forest service released a final eis in january.
the eis designated the modified alternative as the preferred alternative.in a record of decision issued january,the forest service adopted this alternative.this is the framework.
the forest service received over timely administrative appeals.the chief of the forest service,newly appointed by the incoming administration,did not respond directly to the appeals.rather,he directed the regional forester to reevaluate the framework with respect to three issues.first,the chief directed him to the decision for possibilities of more flexibility in aggressive fuels treatment.second,he directed him to the decision based on possible new information associated with the national fire plan,a strategy developed by congress,federal agencies,indian tribes and western states to restore ecosystem health.third,he directed him to limitations placed by the framework on the herger feinstein quincy library group forest pilot project dealing with fire prevention.
in december,the regional forester appointed an amendment review team.the regional forester added issues to the issues identified by the chief.in addition to the issues,he asked the review team to identify opportunities in three areas first,to reduce the unintended and adverse impacts of the framework on grazing permit holders second,to reduce the unintended and adverse impacts of the framework on recreation users and permit holders and,third,to reduce the unintended and adverse impacts of the framework on local communities.
in june,the forest service issued a draft supplemental eis,based on the work of the review team.the draft focused on a comparison of two alternatives.alternative was the framework.alternative was the preferred alternative.alternative proposed substantially more logging and associated activities than the framework.it also proposed to reduce restrictions on grazing by commercial and recreational livestock.
the draft was criticized by the staff of the forest service washington office for watershed,fish,wildlife,air and rare plants.the staff wrote a letter complaining that there was no discussion of the effects of the logging and activities on fish 
aquatic and riparian there needs to be a discussion of the effects of the new alternatives on riparian ecosystems,streams and fisheries.it is not sufficient to dismiss these effects as within the range of impacts discussed in the framework without further analysis,given the activities proposed in alternative.if the treatments proposed in alternative will be sufficient to have their intended effect,there is a high likelihood that there will be significant and measurable direct,indirect and cumulative effects on the environment,which need to be analyzed and disclosed in this document.
emphasis added.the letter also raised concerns that the draft did not adequately analyze the impact of changed grazing standards on riparian environments,streams and fisheries.
the forest service issued the eis in january without adding the discussion of riparian ecosystems,streams and fisheries that the staff letter had said was needed.the regional forester adopted alternative shortly afterwards in a record of decision.over administrative appeals were filed objecting to the record of decision.the forest service chief approved the record of decision without change in november.this is the framework.
both the and frameworks are written in general terms,rather than addressing specific sites at which the logging and activities will take place.but there are substantial differences between the and frameworks.relevant to this appeal are changes in authorized logging and activities,and changes in grazing standards for commercial and recreational livestock.
the most substantial changes are in logging and activities.the framework allows the harvesting of substantially more timber than the framework.the framework allowed the harvesting of million board feet of salvage timber per year during the framework first and second decades.by contrast,the framework allows the harvesting of three times that amount of salvage timber million board feet per year during its first and second decades.the framework allowed the harvesting of million board feet of green timber per year during its first decade and million board feet per year during its second decade.by contrast,the framework allows the harvesting of and times that amount of green timber million board feet per year during its first decade and million board feet per year during its second decade.the totals for salvage timber for the two decades are million board feet under the framework,and billion board feet under the framework.the totals for green timber for the two decades are million board feet under the framework,and billion board feet under the framework.stated differently,compared to the framework,the framework allows the harvesting of an additional billion board feet of timber billion board feet of salvage timber and billion board feet of green timber during its first two decades.
the framework also allows the harvesting of larger trees than the framework.for example,under the framework,trees up to inches in could be harvested in the wetter west side of the sierras,but only up to inches in the drier east side.under the framework,trees up to inches in can be harvested on both the west and east sides.
the framework substantially increases the total to be logged.under the framework,about fewer acres will be subject to prescribed burns than under the framework,but about more acres will be logged mechanically.further,under the framework,more logging will be conducted close to streams than under the framework.the eis states,with more than the usual amount of obfuscating bureaucratese 
the spatial location of strategically placed area treatments under alternatives the framework and the framework are the same,but they are different than previously considered.for example,analysis in the eis was based on the assumption that the area treatments would be placed primarily on the upper of slopes,thus minimizing overlap with rcas associated with perennial,intermittent,and ephemeral streams.however,this assumption is no longer valid.consequently,under alternatives and,treatments are not limited to any geographic position as a result,more treatments within rcas are expected.alternative requires that portions of treatment areas be left in an untreated condition it is likely that riparian areas would be priorities for retention to meet this requirement alternative does not require retention of untreated areas within treatment units so that fire behavior and fire effects are effectively reduced within the entire unit.
the framework limited soil compaction in project areas close to streams to of the area,but the framework places no limit on disturbances in such areas.
the framework allows substantially more construction of new,and reconstruction of existing,logging roads than the framework.under the framework,miles of new roads were to be constructed,and miles of existing roads were to be reconstructed,during the first decade.under the framework,miles of new roads are to be constructed,and miles of existing roads reconstructed,during the first decade.however,under the framework,miles of roads were to be decommissioned,compared with miles of old roads that are to be decommissioned under the framework.the framework also allows an additional miles of temporary roads miles of temporary roads per year for years and slates an additional miles of roads for maintenance miles per year for five years.
finally,grazing restrictions under the framework are reduced in the framework.under the framework,commercial livestock cattle and sheep,as well as recreational livestock pack and saddle stock used by commercial outfitters were to be excluded from meadows known to be occupied by yosemite toads during the toads breeding and rearing seasons,as well as from meadows where surveys to determine the presence or absence of yosemite toads had not yet been performed.the framework allows commercial livestock to graze in meadows where surveys to determine the presence of yosemite toads have not yet been performed.further,the framework eliminates the categorical exclusion of recreational pack stock and saddle stock from meadows during the breeding and rearing season,and allows managers to develop plans to mitigate effects on the toad.
other restrictions on grazing have also been reduced.the framework divides restrictions on grazing into several categories based on the adverse impacts on the grazing permittee the greater the adverse impact,the more effort is required on the part of the permittee.the eis describes the effect of the framework on grazing permittees amounting to of the active allotments.under the framework,the regulations had no adverse impact on any permittee.the regulations had a low adverse impact on permittees,a medium adverse impact on,a high adverse impact on,and a very high adverse impact on.under the framework,those numbers are,respectively,no adverse impact,low,medium,high,and very high.that is,a total of grazing permittees who had been adversely impacted by regulations under the framework are not adversely impacted at all under the framework.for of those permittees,the change effected by the framework is to move from a high adverse impact to no impact at all that is,to move from regulations requiring substantial effort by the permittee to regulations requiring no effort whatsoever.
the eis predicts that the framework will reduce the annual acreage burned by wildfires.under the framework,the estimated annual acreage of wildfires was acres during the first decade,and acres during the fifth decade.under the framework,the estimated annual acreage of wildfires is acres during the first decade,and acres during the fifth decade,resulting in a total reduction of acres over two decades.
pacific rivers filed suit in may,alleging that the framework was adopted in violation of nepa and the apa.on appeal,pacific rivers contends that the eis fails to take a hard look at the environmental impact of the framework on fish and amphibians.we conclude that the eis does not comply with nepa with respect to fish,but does comply with respect to amphibians.

iii.discussion 
the forest service argues for the first time on appeal that pacific rivers lacks standing under article iii of the constitution.questions of article iii jurisdiction can be raised at any time.see ctr.for biological diversity kempthorne,cir.
to have standing under article iii,a plaintiff must establish that 
it has suffered an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d.to have standing to seek injunctive relief under article iii 
a plaintiff must show that he is under threat of suffering injury in fact that is concrete and particularized the threat must be actual and imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical it must be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and it must be likely that a favorable judicial decision will prevent or redress the injury.
summers earth island,d.an organization may sue on behalf of its members 
when its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right,the interests at stake are germane to the organization purpose,and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.
laidlaw,at.
the forest service contends that because pacific rivers challenges amendments to land and resource management plans rather than a specific project under an lrmp,it has failed to allege a threat of a concrete and particularized injury that is actual or imminent.the forest service also contends that pacific rivers members have not specified which parts of the national forests in the sierras they use.
the forest service relies heavily on the supreme court decision in summers.the plaintiffs in summers challenged nationwide regulations promulgated by the forest service that exempted sales of salvage timber of acres or less from nepa requirements to prepare an eis or an environmental assessment ea.id.at.the plaintiffs initially challenged a specific sale of salvage timber.after the district court issued a preliminary injunction,the parties settled the dispute over that sale.id.at.on appeal,both before the ninth circuit and before the supreme court,the plaintiffs continued to challenge the validity of the exemption for acres or less,though now there was no specific sale at issue.they could make only a general statement that they would visit national forests in the future and might come in contact with a parcel of acres or less on which a sale had been conducted without an eis or an ea.id.at.
the supreme court concluded that there was only a remote chance,hardly a likelihood,that such visits would bring plaintiffs into contact with land affected by the challenged regulations.id.at.the court noted that the regulation at issue applied to all national forest land million acres and that the size of the affected parcels was small acres or less.id.accepting an intention to visit the national forests as adequate to confer standing to challenge any government action affecting any portion of those forests would be tantamount to eliminating the requirement of concrete,particularized injury in fact.id.
one year after summers,we held in wilderness society,rey,cir,that a plaintiff organization lacked standing to challenge the same nationwide forest service regulations at issue in summers.a member of the plaintiff organization expressed a general intention to return to the umpqua national forest for recreational use.id.at.we held that summers demands more than a showing of a general intention of returning to a national forest.the member must show that he is likely to encounter an affected area of the umpqua national forest in his future visits.id.emphasis in original.in addition,the member feared that the ash creek project in the umpqua national forest might threaten the interests in protecting wilderness lands.id.but the court found this fear insufficient to obtain standing the member did not allege that his future enjoyment is in any way threatened by the ash creek project.id.emphasis added.
summers and wilderness society are substantially different from this case.pacific rivers introduced into evidence in the district court a declaration of its chairman,bob anderson.anderson declares that he lives in south lake tahoe,that he and his wife own property at mono lake,and that they frequently hike and climb in the sierra nevada range.anderson declares further that pacific rivers has over members,some of whom live in california.he states 
my first sierra nevada backpacking trip was to the mineral king area in,during which time i also fished.i plan to continue these activities as long as the management of sierra nevada national forests does not prevent me from doing so.i have garnered great personal solace in the knowledge that sierra nevada native species and the watersheds that support them persist despite over a century worth of impacts from grazing,mining,logging,road building,dam construction,and related activities.the same is true for the membership of pacific rivers,many of whom recreate in,fish throughout,and derive much satisfaction from the sierra nevada.
he writes specifically with respect to members 
pacific rivers members participate in recreational activities,such as fishing,hiking,backpacking,skiing,nature photography,and river and lake boating throughout the sierra nevada.
the forest service challenged pacific rivers article iii standing for the first time in this court.if the forest service had objected to standing in the district court,pacific rivers could easily have supplemented anderson declaration with declarations of individual members who use and enjoy the sierras,specifying particular national forests and particular patterns of use.given the timing of the forest service objection to standing,if we were to hold on the current record that pacific rivers has not sufficiently established threats of harm to its members who use the sierras for recreation,we would remand to the district court to allow further development of the record.but we think such additional development is unnecessary.anderson has clearly stated that he and a number of pacific rivers members have used,and will continue to use,the national forests in the sierras in a variety of places and in a variety of ways.
during the first two decades,the framework allows the harvesting of approximately billion board feet of green timber and approximately billion board feet of salvage timber.this harvesting will take place in every one of the national forests in the sierras.the smallest amount of green timber harvesting during the two decades million board feet will take place in the lake tahoe management basin.the lake tahoe basin is relatively small and is subject to the most intensive recreational use of the national forests covered by the framework.anderson lives in the lake tahoe basin.the greatest amount of harvesting billion board feet will take place in plumas national forest.harvesting in quantities between these two amounts will take place in each of the other nine national forests covered by the framework.
under the framework,much of the timber harvesting will be in the upper two thirds of slopes.the result of that harvesting will therefore likely be visible from great distances.significant timber harvesting will also take place near streams,where recreational users of forests spend much of their time.the framework authorizes the construction of miles of new roads and the reconstruction of miles of existing roads during the first decade.grazing restrictions on commercial and recreational livestock will be reduced throughout the sierras.
there is a concrete connection between the interests of pacific rivers members in enjoying the forests of the sierras and the effect of the framework.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d.there is little doubt that members of pacific rivers will come into contact with affected areas,and that the implementation of the framework will affect their continued use and enjoyment of the forests.by contrast,the regulation at issue in summers affected only small and widely scattered parcels of land throughout the entire united states,and the plaintiffs had not shown any realistic likelihood that they would come into contact with those parcels.
there are two relevant cases in this circuit,both controlling.in salmon river concerned citizens robertson,cir,we held that an environmental organization had standing to bring a challenge under nepa to an lrmp that applied to million acres of national forest land in the sierras.id.at.the challenged lrmp allowed the use of all methods to treat competing vegetation in order to meet the timber yield objectives,and delegated the decision to use herbicides to the district foresters.id.at.
the forest service standing argument in salmon river was essentially the same as its standing argument here that plaintiff lacked standing because it failed to demonstrate that the members would be harmed by a specific project using herbicides.id.at.members of the organization lived next to or within the boundaries of the area where herbicides had previously been banned but would now be permitted,and they frequently used the area for recreation.id.at.these members contended that their health and recreational interests were adversely affected by the forest service decision to permit herbicide use.id.we characterized the members injury as the risk that environmental consequences of herbicide use might be overlooked as a result of deficiencies in the government analysis under environmental statutes.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.that risk constituted a concrete,specific and imminent injury sufficient to challenge an eis because unfettered use of herbicides in the absence of nepa compliance will cause harm to visitors recreational use and enjoyment,if not to their health.id.
we specifically held that the plaintiffs did not have to wait to challenge a specific project when their grievance is with an overall plan.id.we explained why 
i f the agency action only could be challenged at the development stage,the underlying programmatic authorization would forever escape review.to the extent that the plan the future,it represents a concrete injury that plaintiffs must,at some point,have standing to challenge.that point is now,or it is never.
id.quoting idaho conservation league mumma,cir.see also res,robertson,cir rejecting,in a challenge to a forest plan,the argument that plaintiffs must point to the precise area of the park where their injury will occur.
another ninth circuit panel has recently addressed a separate nepa challenge to the same framework at issue in our case.in sierra forest legacy sherman,cir,we held that an environmental organization had standing to challenge the framework.id.at.we noted ohio forestry ass sierra club,d,in which the supreme court held that the sierra club challenge to an lrmp under the national forest management act was unripe as a prudential matter,but did not hold that the sierra club lacked article iii standing.ohio forestry.the court in ohio forestry specifically noted that despite the considerable legal distance between the adoption of the plan and the moment when a tree is cut,the plan promulgation nonetheless makes logging more likely in that it is a logging precondition in its absence logging could not take place.id.at.we held in sierra forest legacy that the harm flowing from a failure to comply with nepa in formulating the framework was sufficient to confer standing on plaintiff to bring a facial nepa challenge to the framework,independent from specific implementing projects.at.
we therefore conclude that pacific rivers has article iii standing to challenge the framework under nepa.
the national environmental policy act has twin aims.first,it places upon a federal agency the obligation to consider every significant aspect of the environmental impact of a proposed action.second,it ensures that the agency will inform the public that it has indeed considered environmental concerns in its decisionmaking process.kern,at quoting baltimore gas natural res.def.council,d internal quotations and citations omitted,alteration in original.nepa is not substantive.it does not require that agencies adopt the most environmentally friendly course of action.kern,at.rather,t he sweeping policy goals of nepa are realized through a set of procedures that require that agencies take a hard look at environmental consequences.robertson methow valley citizens council,d quoting kleppe sierra club,d.
taking a hard look at environmental consequences of major federal actions includes considering all foreseeable direct and indirect impacts.furthermore,a hard look should involve a discussion of adverse impacts that does not improperly minimize negative side effects.alaska envtl.ctr.kempthorne,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also or.natural res.council fund brong,cir g eneral statements about possible effects and some risk do not constitute a hard look absent a justification regarding why more definitive information could not be provided.internal quotation marks omitted.
pacific rivers alleges that the eis does not take a hard look at environmental consequences of the framework on fish and amphibians.for the reasons that follow,we agree with pacific rivers with respect to fish,but disagree with respect to amphibians.
the eis contained a page detailed analysis of environmental consequences of the framework for individual species of fish.in stark contrast to the eis,the eis contains no analysis whatsoever of environmental consequences of the framework for individual species of fish.the eis incorporates by reference the analysis contained in the eis,but contains no analysis of additional or different environmental consequences of the framework even though the new framework authorizes substantially more activities than the old framework.of particular importance,the framework allows an additional billion board feet of green and salvage timber harvesting during the first two decades,much of it conducted nearer streams,compared to the framework.the eis also incorporates by reference two biological assessments bas of the consequences of the and frameworks on listed fish under the endangered species act.but it neither summarizes the findings of the bas nor includes them in an appendix.
the forest service contends that the eis takes a sufficiently hard look at environmental consequences of the framework on fish.it makes two arguments.first,it points out that the framework is an amendment to each of the forest plans in the sierras.the forest service argues that because the forest plans are lrmps,it is not reasonably possible for the eis to provide an analysis of environmental consequences of the framework on individual species.second,it argues that the eis incorporation by reference of the bas concerning environmental consequences of the and frameworks on listed fish satisfies the hard look requirement.we consider these arguments in turn.
level of required analysis in the eis 
during the time frame at issue here,federal law required preparation of an eis in conjunction with the preparation of a plan such as an lrmp.see b a draft and final environmental impact statement shall be prepared for the proposed plan according to the nepa procedures.see also a i a new plan or plan revision requires preparation of an environmental impact statement.the framework is not,in itself,an lrmp rather,it is an amendment to the lrmps for the sierras.some amendments to lrmps may be so insignificant that they do not require preparation of an eis.but the framework is a fundamental revision of the forest plans in the sierras.see f requiring forest service,when making a significant change in the plan,to follow the same procedure as that required for development and approval of a forest plan see also a ii the appropriate nepa documentation for an amendment may be an eis,an ea,or a categorical exclusion,depending on the scope and scale of the amendment and its likely effects.the forest service does not argue that an eis was not required.but the forest service does argue that,because of the programmatic nature of the framework,it was not required in its eis to perform an analysis of environmental consequences for the individual species of fish.
the required level of analysis in an eis is different for programmatic and plans.we wrote in friends of yosemite valley norton,cir 
an agency planning and management decisions may occur at two distinct administrative levels 
the programmatic level at which the agency develops alternative management scenarios responsive to public concerns,analyzes the costs,benefits and consequences of each alternative in an eis,and adopts an amendable management plan to guide management of multiple use resources and the implementation stage during which individual site specific projects,consistent with the management plan,are proposed and assessed.
ecology,united states forest,cir.an eis for a programmatic plan must provide sufficient detail to foster informed,but impacts need not be fully evaluated until a critical decision has been made to act on site development.alaska envtl.ctr.lujan,cir 
although nepa requires that the agency evaluate the consequences of its action at an early stage in the project planning process,that requirement is tempered by the statutory command that a reviewing court focus upon a proposal parameters as the agency defines them,and the preference to defer detailed analysis until a concrete development proposal crystallized the dimensions of a project probable environmental consequences.california block,cir.
regardless of whether a programmatic or plan is at issue,nepa requires that an eis analyze environmental consequences of a proposed plan as soon as it is reasonably possible to do so.kern,at.at issue in kern were two things an eis for a resource management plan rmp for the coos bay district in oregon,and an environmental assessment ea for a project in that district.the rmp in kern was a programmatic plan,like the lrmp in the case before us.we wrote 
an agency may not avoid an obligation to analyze in an eis environmental consequences that foreseeably arise from an rmp merely by saying that the consequences are unclear or will be analyzed later when an ea is prepared for a program proposed pursuant to an rmp.t he purpose of an eis is to evaluate the possibilities in light of current and contemplated plans and to produce an informed estimate of the environmental consequences drafting an eis necessarily involves some degree of forecasting.city of davis coleman,cir emphasis added.if an agency were to defer analysis of environmental consequences in an rmp,based on a promise to perform a comparable analysis in connection with later projects,no environmental consequences would ever need to be addressed in an eis at the rmp level if comparable consequences might arise,but on a smaller scale,from a later action proposed pursuant to the rmp.
once an agency has an obligation to prepare an eis,the scope of its analysis of environmental consequences in that eis must be appropriate to the action in question.nepa is not designed to postpone analysis of an environmental consequence to the last possible moment.rather,it is designed to require such analysis as soon as it can reasonably be done.see save our ecosystems clark,cir reasonable forecasting and speculation is implicit in nepa,and we must reject any attempt by agencies to shirk their responsibilities under nepa by labeling any and all discussion of future environmental effects as crystal ball inquiry,quoting scientists inst.for pub,atomic energy comm n.if it is reasonably possible to analyze the environmental consequences in an eis for an rmp,the agency is required to perform that analysis.the eis analysis may be more general than a subsequent ea analysis,and it may turn out that a particular environmental consequence must be analyzed in both the eis and the ea.but an earlier eis analysis will not have been wasted effort,for it will guide the ea analysis and,to the extent appropriate,permit tiering by the ea to the eis in order to avoid wasteful duplication.
id.at emphasis added.see also agencies shall integrate the nepa process with other planning at the earliest possible time to insure that planning and decisions reflect environmental values,to avoid delays later in the process,and to head off potential conflicts.new mexico ex rel.richardson bur.of land,cir relying on kern to find nepa violation with respect to programmatic eis.
our dissenting colleague contends that we overruled kern with respect to plans in our en banc decision in lands council ii.we do not believe that lands council ii overruled the reasonably possible requirement of kern.at issue in lands council ii was an eis for a project.in our en banc opinion,we specifically overruled ecology center,austin,cir,cert.denied sub nom.mineral county ecology,d.our holding in lands council ii was that the analysis in the eis at issue was sufficiently supported by studies and analysis.our opinion nowhere mentioned kern,nowhere mentioned a programmatic eis,and nowhere suggested that environmental consequences need not be analyzed in a programmatic eis if it is reasonably possible to perform that analysis.
nor does the forest service believe that lands council ii overruled the reasonably possible requirement of kern.the forest service nowhere contends that we wrongly decided kern,or that lands council ii overruled kern reasonably possible requirement.the forest service recognizes in its brief that kern requires it to perform reasonably possible analyses of environmental consequences in a programmatic eis.see appellee br.at pacific rivers correctly notes that this court has held in kern that a programmatic eis should analyze environmental consequences where reasonably possible.the forest service argues under lands council ii that a court owes deference to its determination of what is reasonably possible because,in its view,w hat scientific analysis is reasonably possible at the programmatic stage is a methodological question within the expertise of the agency.id.but the forest service nowhere argues that it need not comply with kern.
the eis at issue in this case recommends extensive changes to the framework and even more extensive changes to the underlying forest plans in the sierras.we have described the principal changes above.briefly,they include harvesting billion more board feet of timber than under the framework billion more than under the unamended forest plans.they include logging and burning near streams that would not have been permitted under the framework.they include the construction of more miles of new roads than under the framework more miles than under the unamended forest plans,and reconstruction of more miles of existing roads than under the framework more miles than under the unamended forest plans.and they include reduction of restrictions on grazing by commercial and recreational stock.
the eis contains no analysis whatsoever of environmental consequences of these changes on individual fish species in the sierra.the eis promises,in section aquatic,riparian,and meadow ecosystems,that it will provide such an analysis.the eis states,effects of the alternatives on species dependent on aquatic,riparian,and meadow habitats are explained elsewhere in this eis section.emphasis added.but that promise is not fulfilled.section contains pages of analysis of the environmental consequences of the framework for a number of individual species of mammals,birds and amphibians who are dependent on riparian and meadow habitats in the sierras.but nowhere in that section or anywhere else in the eis is there any analysis of individual species of fish.the explicit promise to analyze effects on species dependent on aquatic habitats in section,and the absence of any such analysis in that section or anywhere else,is puzzling.it is possible that the absence of the promised analysis is nothing more than a simple mistake.but if a mistake,it was a mistake that was specifically brought to the attention of the forest service in the letter written by its washington staff.as described above,that letter stated,there needs to be a discussion of the effects of the new alternatives on riparian ecosystems,streams and fisheries.
in striking contrast to the eis,the eis contained pages of detailed analysis of environmental consequences of the framework on individual fish species.the eis devoted pages to individualized analyses of nine federally threatened and endangered fish species the little kern golden trout,the paiute cutthroat trout,the lahontan cutthroat trout,the modoc sucker,the warner sucker,the shortnose and lost river suckers,the central valley chinook salmon,and the central valley steelhead trout.it then devoted pages to individualized analyses of sensitive fish species the goose lake lamprey,the fall run chinook salmon,the eagle lake rainbow trout,the volcano creek golden trout,the goose lake redband trout,the warner valley redband trout,the goose lake sucker,the lahontan lake tui chub,the goose lake tui chub,and the hardhead.finally,it devoted pages to individualized analyses of moderate and high vulnerability fish species the kern brook lamprey,the pacific lamprey,the kern river rainbow trout,the owens sucker,the mountain sucker,the eagle lake tui chub,the pit river tui chub,the sacramento hitch,the owens speckled dace,the pit river roach,the san joaquin roach,and the rough sculpin.
the eis analyzed the environmental consequences to fish of each of the eight alternatives identified in the eis.see,eis,vol,ch,at timber harvesting may be conducted in riparian areas,following different guidelines,under alternatives,and modified.alternatives and prohibit road building in riparian zones alternative further addresses negative effects of roads on streams by requiring that failed road crossings and culverts be identified and have priority for rehabilitation.see also id.at,same.the eis also described the environmental consequences of grazing.see,id.one of the greatest risk factors,within the control of the forest service,to forest service sensitive fish species in the western united states has been the degradation of the aquatic environment,especially those resulting from long term livestock grazing.see also id.at,same.
the eis also analyzed particular environmental risks for individual species of fish.for example,for both paiute and lahontan cutthroat trout,risk factors included the immediate loss of individual fish specific habitat features such as undercut banks use d for cover,increases in sedimentation leading to changes in spawning bed capacity,and the loss of riparian vegetation necessary to maintain adequate temperature regime s.for shortnose and lost river suckers,risk factors included d ecreases in water quality resulting from timber harvest,dredging activities,removal of riparian vegetation,and livestock grazing.for central valley steelhead,habitat destruction was listed as a risk factor.the eis noted that timber harvest,road building,agriculture,livestock grazing,and urban development all affect steelhead habitat.for volcano creek golden trout,risk factors included increases in sedimentation leading to changes in spawning bed capacity,and the loss of riparian vegetation necessary to maintain adequate temperature regime.the risk factors identified are primarily a result of historic and current grazing practices.for goose lake suckers,risk factors included the fact that many of the streams have experienced some habitat loss due to the effects of logging,grazing and other factors that can degrade watersheds.
the adequacy of the eis with respect to fish is not at issue.what is at issue is the adequacy of the eis.whether or not the analysis in the eis was adequate a question that is not before us,the eis shows that an analysis of environmental consequences of the framework for individual species of fish was reasonably possible.there is no explanation in the eis of why it was not reasonably possible to provide any analysis whatsoever of environmental consequence for individual species of fish,when an extensive analysis had been provided in the eis.there is also no explanation in the eis of why it was reasonably possible to provide an extensive analysis of environmental consequences to individual species of mammals,birds,and amphibians in,but not reasonably possible to provide any analysis whatsoever of environmental consequences to individual species of fish in.
an agency has flexibility in deciding when to perform environmental analyses.but an environmental analysis must provide sufficient detail to foster informed,friends of yosemite valley,at citation omitted,and so can not be unreasonably postponed.in,the council on environmental quality ceq established a task force to review agency practices under nepa.the task force wrote in its september report to ceq,reliance on programmatic nepa documents has resulted in public and regulatory agency concern that programmatic nepa documents often play a shell game of when and where deferred issues will be addressed,undermining agency credibility and trust.the nepa task force,modernizing nepa implementation,available at http.an agency compliance with the reasonably possible requirement in a programmatic eis,resulting in an appropriate level of environmental analysis,ensures that a shell game or the appearance of such a game is avoided.judicial review under the arbitrary and capricious standard of the administrative procedure act,a,in turn ensures that an agency does not improperly evade its responsibility to perform an environmental analysis when such an analysis is reasonably possible.
in some cases,the appropriate level of environmental analysis in a programmatic eis is fairly debatable.in such cases,our obligation is to defer to the expertise of the agency.but in this case the forest service has largely resolved the debate for us.in its eis,the forest service performed an extensive analysis of the likely environmental impact of the framework,including pages of detailed analysis of the likely impact on individual fish species.in stark contrast,the forest service performed no analysis whatsoever in its eis of the likely impact of the framework on fish.the forest service provided no analysis despite the fact that the framework allows much more logging,burning,road construction,and grazing than the framework,and despite the fact that it had provided a detailed analysis in a programmatic eis only three years earlier.
we do not require the forest service to provide in the eis precisely the same level of analysis as in its eis.we recognize that it may be appropriate to have fewer than pages of detailed analysis of environmental consequences for individual species of fish in the eis.indeed,if the forest service had explained its reasons for entirely omitting any analysis of the impact of the framework on individual species of fish,it might have been able to show that it is reasonable to postpone such analysis until it makes a proposal.but the forest service has provided no explanation.compare requiring that an agency always make clear if it lacks information to conduct environmental analysis.the forest service has provided almost the opposite of an explanation,for it promised such an analysis and then failed to provide it.as we noted above,section.of the eis promises an analysis of the e ffects of the alternatives on species dependent on aquatic,riparian,and meadow habitats in section.section contains a detailed analysis of the environmental effects on individual species of mammals,birds and amphibians.but section.contains no analysis whatsoever of individual species of fish,even though fish are the quintessential species dependant on aquatic habitat.
in light of the extensive analysis of the environmental consequences on individual fish species in the eis,and of the extensive analysis of the environmental consequences on individual species of mammals,birds,and amphibians in the eis,we conclude,contrary to the forest service contention,that it was reasonably possible to provide some analysis of the environmental consequences on individual fish species in the eis.the failure of the eis to provide any such analysis is a failure to comply with the hard look requirement of nepa.
incorporation by reference of the biological assessment 
the forest service argument is that even if an analysis of environmental consequences of the framework for individual fish species was reasonably possible,the requirement is satisfied by two biological assessments bas,incorporated by reference in the eis.we disagree.
section of the endangered species act requires a federal agency to consult with the fish and wildlife service usfws if a proposed action by that agency may affect a listed species or its critical habitat.a a.pursuant to section,the forest service sent two bas to the usfws to initiate the consultation process.the first ba,sent in december,indicated that the alternatives considered in the eis may affect the little kern golden trout,california golden trout,lahontan cutthroat trout,paiute cutthroat trout,owen tai chub,modoc sucker,lost river sucker,shortnose sucker,and warner sucker.the second ba,sent in july,indicated that the alternatives considered in the eis may affect all of the species listed in the ba except the california golden trout.
the eis does not include the texts of the bas,but it refers to them twice,once in the text and once in an appendix.first,section discusses threatened,endangered,and proposed species.with respect to the bas,it states,in its entirety 
t he biological assessment s for the eis and for the eis contain a more thorough analysis of effects and was sic used in evaluating effects on each species.they are hereby incorporated by reference.
the text does not identify the individual species of fish included in the bas.
second,appendix c of the eis is a consistency review that compares the and frameworks to determine whether a supplemental environmental analysis is needed in the eis.with respect to endangered,threatened,and proposed species of fish,the consistency review concluded 
implementing the proposed changes considered in the eis would not be expected to produce appreciably different results.effects on these species are documented in the biological assessment for the eis,july.
the appendix identifies the species of fish covered by the ba.
the forest service argument fails for three independently sufficient reasons.
first,depending on its nature,material should be in the text of an eis,should be in an appendix to the eis,or should be incorporated by reference in the eis.in descending order of importance discussion of significant environmental impacts must appear in the text of an eis.material that substantiates any analysis fundamental to the eis may appear in an appendix.id.material may be incorporated by reference so long as its omission from the eis does not imped e agency and public review.id.see also forty most asked questions concerning ceq national environmental policy act regulations,march,faqs.if the bas were intended to serve as the analysis of the environmental consequences of the framework for fish,the eis needed to do more than incorporate them by reference.they should have been described and analyzed in the text of the eis,and the bas themselves should have been included in an appendix.
this is not a mere formality.the purpose of an eis is to inform decisionmakers and the general public of the environmental consequences of a proposed federal action.that purpose would be defeated if a critical part of the analysis could be omitted from an eis and its appendices.the eis is circulated to the general public.if at all possible,the appendices are also circulated to the public.id.at faq.the material that is incorporated by reference is not circulated to the public it need only be made available.id.material that is incorporated by reference must be briefly described in the body of the eis,but a brief description can not fulfill the purpose of the eis if the substance of what is incorporated is an important part of the environmental analysis.
second,even if they had been fully described and analyzed in the eis,the bas could not have satisfied the hard look requirement.the bas functioned as a trigger to the consultation process required under section of the endangered species act.they merely enumerated the several species of listed fish that may have been affected by the alternatives considered in the and eiss.there was no analysis in either of the bas of the manner or degree to which the alternatives may have affected these fish.to the degree that any analysis was performed,it was performed by the fish and wildlife service when it prepared biological opinions in response to the bas.the eis makes no reference,in any form,to either of the biological opinions.
third,even if the bas could have satisfied the hard look requirement,they applied to only one group of fish species.as described above,the eis analyzed the environmental consequences for three groups federally threatened and endangered fish species species sensitive fish species species and moderate and high vulnerability fish species species.the bas analyzed only the individual species in the first group.they said nothing about the individual species in the second and third groups.
amphibians 
the eis contains an extensive analysis of individual amphibians.it specifically analyzes six species of amphibian the california frog,the foothill frog,the mountain frog,the northern leopard frog,the cascades frog and the yosemite toad.for each species,the eis identifies changes between the and the frameworks that are likely to affect that species.the eis discusses the impact of livestock grazing,prescribed fire,mechanical fuels treatments and road maintenance.
one of the major differences between the and frameworks is the latter emphasis on logging,rather than prescribed burning,as a means of reducing the risk of wildfires.the eis describes the impact of the changed emphasis on the foothill frog.it states that the framework posed some risk to the frog because prescribed burning often results in the destruction or dispersal of coarse woody debris that the frog uses for shelter.by decreasing the amount of prescribed burning,the framework will provide some benefit to the frog.however,the eis also identifies the use of mechanical logging as a risk.for example,the frogs sometimes seek shelter beneath parked vehicles.when logging operations begin on any particular day,the vehicles may crush frogs sheltered beneath the tires.
similarly,the eis considers the impact of changed grazing standards on the yosemite toad.it states that risk factors to the yosemite toad from grazing include 
decreased growth rate of tadpoles as a result of increased bacteria from livestock fecal matter mortality from being buried by livestock feces reduced vegetative hiding cover for metamorphs,juveniles,and adults,which increases their vulnerability to predation by snakes and birds and the collapse of rodent burrows from livestock hoof punching,thereby entrapping or burying individuals that use burrows for hiding cover.
the eis notes that allowing grazing in meadows that have not yet been surveyed for yosemite toads may contribute to localized extirpations.
the eis also discusses a number of mitigation strategies to minimize the environmental consequences of the framework.for example,the forest service will use best management practices for road construction and maintenance.these practices include designing stream crossings and replacement stream crossings for a year flood designing stream crossings to minimize the diversion of natural stream flow and avoiding road construction in wetlands and meadows.the forest service will also continuously monitor grazing allotments if changes around yosemite toad breeding sites are authorized.the eis states that such monitoring will allow the forest service to identify and mitigate threats to the yosemite toad.
pacific rivers contends that the forest service is required to provide further analysis of the changes that are authorized under the framework.pacific rivers contention stems in part from the forest service decision under the framework to delegate significant decisionmaking authority to local managers of amphibian habitats.for example,in a portion of section discussing livestock grazing on meadows,the eis notes that the new framework makes changes designed to allow flexibility to design management practices to address local conditions.however,we are satisfied that the forest service analysis was sufficient,at this stage of the process,given that the eis provides significant analysis of the environmental effects on amphibians,and that projects are not yet at issue.
the forest service has repeatedly committed itself to complying with nepa for projects that will be proposed under the framework.for example,in its brief in this court,it states that additional nepa analysis will occur at the.see appellee br.at.it states,further,that because activities such as timber harvest and road,skid trail,and log landing construction would not occur prior to a future decision,the forest service will analyze the effects of those activities before allowing them.id.at.the brief states,still further,that w hen the forest service makes a decision to authorize or reauthorize grazing on an allotment,it conducts a detailed nepa analysis,where it can examine the effects of the particular proposed grazing,considering the allotment location,and the timing,scope,and intensity of proposed grazing.id.at emphasis deleted.the forest service makes similar commitments in the eis.for example,the eis states,decisions will be made on projects in compliance with nepa following applicable public involvement and administrative appeal procedures.the eis states further,any actions taken to implement direction in the forest plan amendment would require compliance with nepa.we are confident that when the forest service proposes to build,reconstruct or decommission roads to conduct a logging or a prescribed burning operation for fuels management to allow pack stock saddle stock into yosemite meadows to permit commercial livestock to graze near yosemite toad breeding and rearing sites or to use pesticides in a riparian conservation area,that it will fully comply with the nepa requirements applicable to such projects.
conclusion 
in lands council ii,we wrote that we will hold that an agency has acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in preparing an eis when it has entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem.at.in this case,the forest service entirely failed to consider environmental consequences of the framework on individual species of fish.given the detailed page analysis of the likely impact on individual species of fish in the eis,the complete lack of such analysis of the likely impact on individual species of fish in the eis,and the lack of any explanation in the eis why it is not reasonably possible to perform some level of analysis of such impact,we have no choice but to conclude that the forest service failed to take the requisite hard look at environmental consequences of the framework for fish.
we hold that the forest service failed to take a hard look at environmental consequences on fish in the eis,in violation of nepa.we hold that the forest service did take a hard look at environmental consequences on amphibians in the eis,in compliance with nepa.we therefore reverse in part and affirm in part,and remand to the district court.
reversed in part,affirmed in part,and remanded.costs to plaintiff appellant.
the majority conclude s,contrary to the forest service contention,that it was reasonably possible to provide some analysis of the environmental consequences on individual fish species in the eis,and thus that the agency decision not to provide this analysis as soon as it was reasonably possible to do so was arbitrary and capricious.op.in doing so,the majority makes two fundamental errors first,it reinvents the arbitrary and capricious standard of review,transforming it from an appropriately deferential standard to one freely allowing courts to substitute their judgments for that of the agency.in doing so,the majority disregards our circuit precedent holding that an agency timing of analysis required by the national environmental policy act nepa is not arbitrary and capricious if it is performed before a critical commitment of resources occurs.the majority instead creates an unclear rule based on reasonable possibility that imposes additional procedures not required by nepa on the forest service.such a rule leave s the agencies uncertain as to their procedural duties under nepa,invite s judicial involvement in the decisionmaking process of the agencies,and invite s litigation.kleppe sierra club,d.
second,the majority ignores the tiering framework created by nepa.because the majority ignores such framework,it fails to differentiate between a environmental impact statement eis and a programmatic eis that focuses on policy decisions.under nepa regulations on tiering and ninth circuit precedent,a programmatic eis requires less detailed analysis than a eis.therefore,agencies are allowed to defer analysis until projects have been identified.furthermore,agencies are given wide latitude in the tiering methodology they choose to implement,so long as the programmatic eis allows for informed.as a result,courts owe a high level of deference to the methodological choices of the agency.
because the majority opinion amounts to an inappropriate and substantial shift in our nepa jurisprudence,i must dissent.
standard of review 
congress enacted nepa to require agencies to produce an eis whenever they engage in a major action that could significantly affect the environment.c.however,congress also enacted the administrative procedure act apa,which governs our review of an agency actions.under the apa,we must employ a highly deferential standard of review when reviewing the forest service actions in this case.a.unless the forest service action is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,we may not set it aside.id.
in lands council ii,a unanimous en banc decision,we explained that r eview under the arbitrary and capricious standard is narrow,and we do not substitute our judgment for that of the agency.lands council mcnair lands council ii,cir en banc alteration in original omitted quoting earth island inst.forest,cir,abrogated on other grounds by winter natural res.def.council,d.we also noted that our circuit environmental jurisprudence ha d,at times,shifted away from the appropriate standard of review,prior to.id.at.
although lands council ii only explicitly overruled ecology center,austin,cir,explaining that ecology center was a case illustrative of this error,our correction extended beyond that solitary case.we referred to the shift in our jurisprudence occurring in recent years,which clearly alludes to multiple incorrect decisions.lands council ii,at.our correction also dealt with the deference owed to agencies under our appropriate standard of review in general,rather than just regarding studies and analysis,as the majority argues,op.we observed that previous decisions committed key errors by imposing on agencies additional requirement s not found in any relevant statute or regulation and by showing insufficient deference to agencies and their methodological choices.lands council ii,at.
therefore,we renounced this incorrect jurisprudence where we engaged in assessments of agency action.id.at.we instead observed that this was not the proper role for courts.id.rather,our proper role is simply to ensure that the forest service made no clear error of judgment that would render its action arbitrary and capricious.id.quoting marsh or.natural res.council,d.the majority relies on cases decided prior to that suggest a less deferential role for courts.however,lands council ii has irrevocably changed the legal landscape by setting forth the high level of deference owed by courts to agency action.
accordingly,an agency decision can be set aside only if the agency relied on factors congress did not intend it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,or offered an explanation that runs counter to the evidence before the agency or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.id.at internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added see also sierra club envtl.prot.agency,cir.
the majority argues that the forest service entirely failed to consider environmental consequences of the framework on individual species of fish.op.but w hether an agency has overlooked an important aspect of the problem,turns on what a relevant substantive statute makes important.or.natural res.council thomas,cir quoting motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm,d.as discussed below in part ii,nepa is the relevant statute.nepa does not require site specific analysis be considered at the programmatic eis stage.rather,nepa encourages the deferral of such analysis until the issues are ripe and analyzing them will be most meaningful.thus,the forest service can not have failed to consider an aspect of the problem required by nepa by following nepa tiered analysis structure and deferring specific analysis.
in addition,though the majority pays lip service to lands council ii deferential standard of review,the majority relies on kern bureau of land management,cir to engage in the same type of analysis that was rebuked in lands council ii specifically,the majority demands that the agency provide whatever analysis the majority determines is reasonably possible as soon as it can reasonably be done.id.at.however,the majority is unable to provide any support for this rule for at least two reasons.
first,relying on kern to require a programmatic eis to include reasonably possible analysis as soon as reasonably possible stretches the language from kern far beyond the facts of the case kern did deal with a programmatic eis.however,the agency actions at issue there were timber sales,constituting a critical commitment of resources.id.at a concrete plan,a specific undertaking,and a program incorporating the guidelines,such as we anticipated in a previous case,are now before us.the programmatic eis in kern had specifically deferred analysis of specific actions to future nepa analysis.id.at.rather than strike down this deferral as necessarily arbitrary and capricious,the kern court merely looked to the subsequent ea to see whether the ea had sufficiently analyzed the action.id.the second sentence in the programmatic eis is not an analysis,but rather a promise of a later analysis to be performed in connection with specific projects within the range of the port orford cedar.the revised ea for the sandy remote analysis area is such a analysis.the adequacy of that ea has also been challenged by onrc.we now turn to that question.
thus,kern does not support the proposition that a programmatic eis must include any analysis as soon as reasonably possible if no critical commitments of resources have occurred.kern is rather inapposite to such a rule.thus,applying the reasonably possible rule to a programmatic eis that does not contemplate critical commitments of resources is not only unsupported by kern holding,it also eviscerates the nepa tiering framework discussed in part ii.
second,such a rule,particularly when applied to a programmatic eis,constitutes a dramatic departure from this circuit precedent regarding arbitrary and capricious review.our rule has always been that nepa requires a full evaluation of impacts only when a critical decision has been made to act on site development,when the agency proposes to make an irreversible and irretrievable commitment of the availability of resources to a project at a particular site.friends of yosemite valley norton,cir quoting california block,cir.until that threshold point,we are required to defer to the methodological choices of the agency regarding the timing of when analysis can reasonably be done.block,at.
the majority is correct that nepa regulations encourage agencies to integrate the nepa process with other planning at the earliest possible time op.quoting.but this court has interpreted these regulations as requiring agencies to prepare nepa documents,such as an eis,before any irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources.metcalf daley,cir.this rule is derived from the text of nepa itself.see conner burford,cir the irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources criterion is derived from nepa,which requires an eis to include a statement of any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented.this rule has also proved useful,as explained by environmental law scholars,because without inside knowledge,courts really can not know the status of various initiatives under consideration james salzman and barton thompson,environmental law and policy ed.thus,to provide a bright line standard for challenging the timing of eis preparation courts have required that preparation of an eis commence before an irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources.id.at quoting environmental defense fund,andrus,cir.
consequently,in multiple cases,we have explained that an agency timing of its analysis becomes arbitrary and capricious only if the nepa documents are prepared after an irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources has occurred.see,native ecosystems council dombeck,cir t he issue we must decide here is whether the federal defendants prepared the ea too late in the process,after making an irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources.quoting metcalf,at.on the other hand,we have held that an agency is free to decide not to provide nepa analysis up until the time it issued its decision notice for the specific commitment of resources.id.at emphasis in original.in other words,an agency can not have entirely failed to consider an aspect of a problem before a critical commitment of resources has taken place,because the agency still has an opportunity up to that point to provide the necessary analysis.accordingly,whether analysis is reasonably possible and was provided as soon as it is reasonably possible is wholly irrelevant to the inquiry of whether the timing of the agency analysis was arbitrary and capricious.
the majority cites,but ignores,precedent upholding this critical commitment of resources threshold.see,op.citing friends of yosemite valley,at.the majority instead requires its own preferred timing for nepa analysis.essentially,the majority misunderstands that there is a wide range of permissible agency action between what courts hope for as ideal agency actions,and actions that fall below a much lower threshold,becoming arbitrary and capricious.see fox television stations,d under arbitrary and capricious review,courts should uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency path may reasonably be discerned.quoting bowman,arkansas best freight system,d texas clinical labs,sebelius,cir an agency decision need not be ideal or even,perhaps,correct so long as not arbitrary or capricious and so long as the agency gave at least minimal consideration to the relevant facts as contained in the record.internal quotation marks omitted.the majority proposed rule would turn arbitrary and capricious review on its head and allow courts to keep agencies on a tight leash,directing agencies based on what courts view as best,as illustrated by the majority decision in this case.while there are certainly times when i would disagree with quality or timing of an agency analysis and would enjoy dictating my own agenda,arbitrary and capricious review simply provides courts with no warrant to do so.
in the present case,it is undisputed that the forest service has not made a critical commitment of resources regarding any projects.the framework do es not provide final authorization for any activity,and subsequent and full environmental review of these projects is contemplated,friends of yosemite valley,at it only establishes the standards and guidelines under which future projects permitting such actions must occur.thus,the forest service timing of analysis has not reached the threshold upheld by our precedent,and the forest service decision to defer more specific analysis regarding fish can not be arbitrary and capricious.
ii.the forest service appropriately utilized a tiered analysis structure 
because it is irrelevant whether the forest service provided a reasonably possible amount of analysis as soon as reasonably possible,the appropriate issues to review are actually whether the agency use of a tiered analysis structure was arbitrary and capricious,and whether the amount of analysis in the current programmatic eis was sufficient to engage in informed regarding broad policies affecting all species,including fish.
a.the agency use of a tiered analysis structure to defer analysis until concrete,projects were planned was not arbitrary and capricious.
the agency methodological decision to utilize a tiered eis approach and defer analysis of projects was not only reasonable,but it is also encouraged by the council on environmental quality ceq regulations for implementing nepa.these regulations explain that a gencies are encouraged to tier their environmental impact statements to eliminate repetitive discussions of the same issues and to focus on the actual issues ripe for decision at each level of environmental review.citations omitted emphasis added.the term tiering refers to the coverage of general matters in broader environmental impact statements such as national program or policy statements subsequently followed by narrower statements or environmental analyses such as regional or basinwide program statements or ultimately statements incorporating by reference the general discussions and concentrating solely on the issues specific to the statement subsequently prepared.these regulations explain that tiering is appropriate when the sequence of analysis moves from a program,plan,or policy environmental impact statement to a statement or analysis.a.
agencies have a wide range of discretion in determining how to implement their tiering strategy.in a memorandum,frederick skaer,director of the office of nepa facilitation,explained that we have deliberately stayed away from prescriptive guidelines on how to apply tiering so that each tiered process can be custom designed to the specific situation.you therefore have considerable latitude in the specific tiering approach you utilize to implement the nepa policy mandate of informed.office of nepa facilitation,memorandum on tiering of the i project,kansas city,missouri to louis,june,citation omitted see also ecology,austin,cir mckeown,dissenting the limited nature of this inquiry underscores the latitude in implementation and interpretation that congress intended for its agents,overruled on other grounds by lands council ii,at.
because the framework is a programmatic eis,that focuses on broad policies and general goals and does not make critical commitments of resources as discussed in part i,the forest service decision to utilize a tiered approach and defer more analysis was clearly a reasonable choice within the agency discretion.thus,so long as the programmatic eis provides sufficient guidelines to foster informed as discussed in part,nothing more can be required of the agency at this stage.
the majority acknowledges this nepa tiering framework.op.then the majority promptly disregards our precedent and argues that r egardless of whether a programmatic or plan is at issue,nepa requires that an eis analyze environmental consequences of a proposed plan as soon as it is reasonably possible to do so.id.at.the majority also argues that the agency was required to perform an appropriate level of environmental analysis based on what the majority determines was reasonably possible.id.at.the majority observes that the framework provided more analysis of specific aquatic species.id.at.the majority also claims that the agency failed to explain why it provided less analysis of fish in the framework.id.at.as a result,the majority asserts that this proves the agency was able to provide more analysis than it did.id.consequently,the majority holds that the agency lesser amount of analysis of fish in the framework was arbitrary and capricious.id.at.the majority arguments suffer from at least four flaws.
first,this is a classic example of courts imposing additional procedures on agencies that have no basis in statutory or regulatory law.nowhere in the text of nepa,or its regulations,is an agency required to provide a similar amount of analysis in the current eis as was performed in a previous eis.both the and the frameworks were programmatic environmental impact statements.the forest service voluntarily chose to provide more analysis in the framework than was necessary,but nothing in nepa requires an agency to provide an equivalent level of analysis for a subsequent eis.as long as the agency analysis falls within the wide zone of reasonability,the agency need not provide the most ideal analysis in order to avoid having its decision struck down as arbitrary and capricious.see dombeck,at we will uphold the forest service decision not to provide nepa analysis until a later date unless that decision was unreasonable.while it may irritate the majority that the forest service did not provide as much detailed analysis in the eis as in the eis,there is no precedent for the majority decision to strike down the forest service decision to defer more analysis until more concrete projects have been identified.
nepa also does not impose a blanket requirement on agencies to provide as much analysis as the majority determines is reasonably possible as soon as it can reasonably be done.op.quoting kern,at.to the contrary,the nepa regulations about tiering clearly indicate that delayed analysis is not only allowed,but even preferable in some instances.see also block,at noting that the analysis is more meaningful when a concrete development proposal crystallizes the dimensions of a project probable environmental consequences ctr.for biological diversity forest,cir nepa purpose is to ensure informed to the end that the agency will not act on incomplete information,only to regret its decision after it is too late to correct.
the majority is correct that nepa is designed to encourage agencies to integrate the nepa process with other planning at the earliest possible time.op.quoting.but,in friends of yosemite valley and other cases,we have recognized that nepa encouragement of early analysis is tempered by the statutory command that a reviewing court focus upon a proposal parameters as the agency defines them,and the preference to defer detailed analysis until a concrete development proposal crystallizes the dimensions of a project probable environmental consequences.at quoting block,at.the majority ignores this tempering effect.instead,it essentially demands as much analysis for fish as the majority determines is reasonably possible as soon as the agency can provide it,irrespective of the forest service methodological choices and decision to utilize a tiered analysis structure.
second,the majority argument comparing the volume of analysis between the and frameworks suffers from the proverbial comparison of apples to oranges.the framework contained many more rules and policies that made for easier identification of issues.the framework by design calls for a flexible approach based on specific conditions and it leaves critical decisions to be made when site specific projects are identified.for example,under the previous eis,the spacial location of area treatments was specifically limited in geographic location to the upper of slopes,whereas the eis contains no such geographic limitations.seis at.similarly,the eis limited compaction in riparian conservation areas to less than of project activity areas,whereas the framework provides n o firm numeric standard s,thus allowing for evaluations.id.as a result,it is not surprising that the framework more easily lent itself to more extensive analysis up front.
third,the majority insistence on requiring the agency to provide the amount of analysis the majority thinks is appropriate as soon as reasonably possible illustrates a misunderstanding of the tiering framework set forth in the ceq regulations.these regulations balance the public need to receive analysis quickly with the public competing need to receive analysis regarding actual issues ripe for decision.to achieve this balance,agencies are given wide latitude in choosing the scope of analysis that will occur at different stages of the tiered analysis structure.office of nepa facilitation,memorandum on tiering of the i project,kansas city,missouri to louis,june.
the majority correctly observes that the level of analysis may differ depending on the scope of the agency action.op.but then the majority incorrectly takes it upon itself to determine the scope of the project,based on the quantity and timing of analysis that the majority determines is reasonably possible.id.at.this approach not only ignores the wide latitude the nepa regulations accord agencies in determining how to structure their tiered analysis methodology,it directly contradicts supreme court and ninth circuit precedent.see kleppe,at.agencies have discretion to intelligently determine the scope of environmental analysis and review specific actions they may take friends of yosemite valley,at a reviewing court must focus upon a proposal parameters as the agency defines them alteration in original omitted quoting block,at.
as the majority observes,it is true that the ceq task force has expressed concern that the use of a tiering structure can result in a shell game regarding when and where deferred issues will be addressed.op.citing the nepa task force,modernizing nepa implementation,available at.but the majority ignores that,in the same paragraph discussing this potential shell game,the task force recommends that the ceq address the problem by creating requirements whereby programmatic documents would provide a roadmap,explaining where and when deferred issues raised by the public regulatory agencies will be addressed.this potential regulatory solution of requiring a simple roadmap for programmatic analysis is markedly different than the majority approach of imposing a novel and unclear judicial requirement,destroying an agency methodological flexibility and requiring whatever analysis the majority thinks is reasonably possible to be performed as soon as it can reasonably be done.
the majority seems to suggest that the forest service inappropriately participated in such a shell game in this case by providing a puzzling and unfulfilled promise to perform specific analysis of individual fish species.op.but,even assuming that the forest service was required to follow through on any promises made in the eis,the forest service did not break any promises.as the majority acknowledges,the forest service never explicitly promised to analyze individual fish species it merely explained that the e ffects of the alternatives on species dependent on aquatic,riparian,and meadow habitats would be explained elsewhere in th e seis.seis at see also op.the forest service clearly delivered on this promise.specifically,as to aquatic habitats,part highlights the forest service extensive analysis regarding how various alternatives would affect aquatic habitats and the corresponding dependent species in general.moreover,as the majority also notes,the framework incorporates by reference two different biological assessments analyzing the consequences of the eis on individual fish species.op.while the analysis from the biological assessments is likely insufficient for nepa analysis regarding a potential critical commitment of resources affecting fish,it further illustrates that the forest service did not break its promise to provide at least some analysis of aquatic species in the programmatic eis.
fourth,the majority incorrectly asserts that there is no explanation for the forest service decision to defer more analysis of individual fish species.see,op.however,the forest service clearly did explain its reasons for deferring in depth analysis until more projects were identified.specifically,in its record of decision,the forest service stated,
our ability to strategically place fuel treatments for optimum effectiveness has been compromised by the set of complicated rules in the framework.the standards and guidelines in that framework are applied at the stand level,rather than by land allocations some of the rules are so detailed that they prescribe down to one acre what is allowed,and require measuring change in canopy to ten percent increments,which is not consistently practical with existing measurement tools.this approach limits our ability to make significant progress o ur ability to strategically place fuels treatments on the landscape has been compromised by the complexity of rules which allows more habitat to be lost to wildfire this decision is intended to reverse that trend.

if the forest service commits to a project in the future,without engaging in the required level of nepa analysis,then pacific rivers might have a viable nepa claim.indeed,it is likely that t he deficiencies noted by the majority opinion regarding analysis of fish are precisely the omissions the forest service will need to correct in order to comply fully with nepa at a later time.block,at see also alaska envtl.ctr.lujan,cir approving a programmatic eis that deferred detailed analysis until an application for a mining permit was submitted,but noting that judicial estoppel precludes the park service from later arguing that it has no further duty to consider mitigation measures.
not only has the forest service affirmed many times that they plan to engage in further detailed analysis when specific projects are identified but we have a legal duty to assume that the agency will perform that analysis.in salmon river concerned citizens robertson,we observed that courts should assume that government agencies will comply with their nepa obligations in later stages of development,cir quoting conner,at.
b.the amount of programmatic,analysis was sufficient to engage in informed decisionmaking regarding broad policies affecting all species,including fish.
the majority claims that the forest service entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem by not providing analysis regarding how the programmatic framework would affect specific species of fish.op.citing lands council ii,at.but here,because the forest service chose to utilize a tiered nepa analysis structure and implement a programmatic eis,the relevant scope of the problem is whether the forest service provide d sufficient detail to foster informed decisionmaking.friends of yosemite valley,at quoting lujan,at.as discussed above,the majority is only able to claim otherwise by ignoring the proper standard of review and refusing to defer to the forest service discretion in determining the scope of its analysis.see kleppe,at.agencies have discretion to intelligently determine the scope of environmental analysis and review specific actions they may take friends of yosemite valley,at a reviewing court must focus upon a proposal parameters as the agency defines them alteration in original omitted quoting
