order and opinion 
the petition for panel rehearing is granted.the petition for rehearing en banc is denied as moot.
the opinion filed october,slip,and appearing at,is withdrawn.it may not be cited as precedent by or to this court or any district court of the ninth circuit.it is replaced by the concurrently filed opinion.
in congress passed the clean water act cwa or the act to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.see federal water pollution control act amendments of clean water act of,stat.codified at a.central to that legislation and later amendments is the notion that pollution discharges would be controlled through effluent limitations.
environmental advocates,our children earth foundation and ecological rights foundation collectively oce,filed this citizen suit under the clean water act,et,alleging that the environmental protection agency epa or the agency has failed to fulfill its mandate to review effluent guidelines and limitations in a timely manner and in accord with standards.specifically,oce claims that epa violated its duties by abandoning review in favor of review neglecting to identify new polluting sources and failing to publish timely plans for future reviews.see cwa b,b cwa d,d cwa b,b cwa m,m 
a approach to water quality focuses on the achievable level of pollutant reduction given current technology,whereas a approach seeks to identify known hazards or contaminants in the water and to reduce the prevalence of those hazards.see,at.although these approaches are not mutually exclusive,oce claims that epa jettisoned a approach altogether,thus abdicating its statutory duties.
the district court granted judgment in favor of epa,holding that the challenged acts or omissions were discretionary.we agree that the decisions whether to revise the effluent guidelines and whether to incorporate criteria in its periodic review of the guidelines fall within epa discretion.consequently,we affirm.
background 
oce amended complaint contains four claims alleging with what oce characterizes as epa mandatory duties under the act 
epa failed to review effluent guidelines based on the best conventional pollutant technology bct and best available technology bat,as mandated by b,m 
epa failed to review existing effluent limitations as required by b,d 
epa failed to issue timely final effluent guidelines plans as required by m and 
epa failed to identify new polluting sources as required by m b.
in sum,oce argues that the cwa requires,as a matter,that the agency take a particular approach to water safety regulation review,published in a sufficiently timely fashion to afford a meaningful opportunity for notice and comment.epa and intervenors effluent guidelines industry coalition and association of metropolitan sewerage agencies now known as the national association of clean water agencies together,intervenors counter that epa duties do not extend to a particular manner of performing reviews and revisions.
we first address the argument by epa and the intervenors that this suit was not properly brought under the citizen suit provision of the act,a,a,but rather should have been brought under b,b.then,we consider whether the district court has jurisdiction over each of oce four claims under a.because a jurisdiction is predicated on citizen enforcement of a duty,our analysis focuses on whether the claims relate to discretionary or duties under the act.
jurisdiction to review agency action 
the cwa contains two separate jurisdictional sections a,known as the citizen suit provision,and b,which relates primarily to challenges to promulgation of certain standards and determinations.oce brought suit under a,which permits any citizen to commence a civil action on his own behalf against the administrator where there is alleged a failure of the administrator to perform any act or duty under this chapter which is not discretionary with the administrator.cwa a.
alternatively,b permits suits against the epa administrator for review of action 
a in promulgating any standard of performance under section of this title,b in making any determination pursuant to section b c of this title,c in promulgating any effluent standard,prohibition,or pretreatment standard under section of this title,d in making any determination as to a state permit program submitted under section b of this title,e in approving or promulgating any effluent limitation or other limitation under section,or of this title,f in issuing or denying any permit under section of this title,and g in promulgating any individual control strategy under section l 
suits brought pursuant to b must be filed directly 
in the circuit court of appeals of the united states for the federal judicial district in which petitioner resides or transacts business any such application shall be made within days from the date of such determination,approval,promulgation,issuance or denial,or after such date only if such application is based solely on grounds which arose after such day.
cwa b.section b actions,as opposed to suits brought under a,challenge the exercise of the administrator discretion in promulgating standards and issuing determinations.
so long as epa challenged acts and omissions relate to duties under the act,oce action was properly brought in the district court under a.to the extent oce challenges actions within the discretion of the administrator,the district court properly refused to exercise jurisdiction under a.nonetheless,a jurisdictional defect under a does not mean that jurisdiction is proper under b.
t his court has counseled against expansive application of section b.league of wilderness defenders forsgren,cir.section b covers only challenges to promulgation or approval or determinations on permits,not failure to comply with allegedly mandated procedures,which is the thrust of oce suit.
additionally,b lists a number of sections for which review obtains in the court of appeals,l,and.neither b or m is referenced in b.because the challenge here does not stem from the promulgation or approval of an effluent limitation or permit,we need not decide whether b encompasses a challenge under.compare du pont de nemours train,d suggesting that the epa could collapse the limitations to be promulgated under and into a single review,with longview fibre rasmussen,cir holding that the sections listed in are sufficiently specific that unlisted sections should not be interpreted to be covered by.
we thus agree with the district court that the circuit court exclusive jurisdiction extends only to a substantive review of the appropriateness of the guidelines actually promulgated,and not to the threshold question of whether the statutory requirements of the cwa have been met.no such promulgated guidelines or limitations are at issue here.the district court had jurisdiction under a to determine whether epa discharged its duties under the cwa.
ii.review and revision 
in determining whether oce four claims challenge obligations under the act,our point of reference is the statute itself.although the line between a congressional mandate and an area of agency discretion is not difficult to state,ascertaining that line is not always as easy.when congress specifies an obligation and uses the word shall,this denomination usually connotes a mandatory command.see alabama bozeman,d.on the other hand,a bsent some provision requiring epa to adopt one course of action over the other,we can only conclude that epa choice represented an exercise of discretion.farmers union cent.exch.thomas,cir.
however,not every decision is so easily categorized.as the supreme court teaches,the process does not necessarily collapse into a single final decision.it is rudimentary administrative law that discretion as to the substance of the ultimate decision does not confer discretion to ignore the required procedures of decisionmaking.bennett spear,d.in bennett,considering a citizen suit provision parallel to that in the cwa,the supreme court held,s ince it is the omission of these required procedures that petitioners complain of,their claim is reviewable.id.at.emphasis added.
