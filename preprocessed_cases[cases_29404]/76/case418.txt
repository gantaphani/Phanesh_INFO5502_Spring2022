in november,the voters of the city of watsonville city passed a ballot initiative known as measure measure s prohibits introduction of any substance into city water supply unless the substance conforms to listed requirements.we hold that to the extent measure s applies to fluoridation it is preempted by state law.
factual and procedural 
in the fall of,city was poised to begin a water fluoridation project when city voters passed measure s and halted city fluoridation efforts.measure s prohibits introducing any substance into city drinking water other than substances used to make the water safe to drink unless,among other things,the united states food and drug administration fda has approved the substance for safety and effectiveness since the fda 
does not regulate additives to public water supplies and has never specifically approved the use of fluoride as an additive to public water supplies,measure s effectively prohibits fluoridation.there is no question that the initiative was designed for that purpose.
city had begun its fluoridation project as required by health and safety code sections and section requires fluoridation of public water systems having at least service connections and authorizes the california department of health services dhs to adopt regulations to implement that requirement,subd.a,tit.section provides that a public water system is not required to fluoridate if sufficient funding is not available from an outside source,subd.a a.outside sources may include federal block grants or donations from private foundations,subd.e.outside sources do not include a system ratepayers or local taxpayers,subd.a a.
city water system meets the size requirements of section and funding had been offered by an outside california dental association foundation,but since the newly passed voter initiative prohibited fluoridation,city ceased work on the project and terminated the funding agreement.dhs issued an order directing city to fluoridate as required by section.because city could not comply with the dhs order without violating measure s,city filed the instant action.
city complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief.city requested a declaration that measure s is valid and enforceable and does not conflict with state law,and is not preempted and that city could legally prohibit the fluoridation of its public water supply.the requested injunction was to p ermanently enjoin dhs,from enforcing its compliance order.the california dental association foundation and the california dental association,both of which have worked to promote fluoridation throughout the state,successfully sought leave to intervene.
the trial court concluded that measure s was preempted by state law and that city was not exempt from its requirements.city has timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
issue and standard of review 
the only issue before us is whether measure s is preempted by state law this is a pure question of law subject to de novo review.gonzales city of san jose th,d.
preemption analysis 
city is a charter city.as such,city may make and enforce all ordinances and regulations in respect to municipal affairs subject only to restrictions and limitations provided in its charter.cal,art.xi,subd.a.city ordinances and regulations pertaining to municipal affairs supersede all inconsistent laws.ibid.however,a state law regulating a matter of statewide concern preempts a conflicting local ordinance or regulation if the state law is reasonably related to the resolution of the statewide concern and is narrowly tailored to limit incursion into legitimate municipal interests.johnson bradley cal th,d.this is so even where the local measure involves a traditionally municipal affair.where the subject of the local law implicates a municipal affair and poses a genuine conflict with state law,the question of statewide concern is the bedrock inquiry through which the conflict between state and local interests is adjusted.california fed.savings loan city of los angeles cal d.if the subject of the state law does not qualify as a statewide concern,then the conflicting charter city measure is beyond the reach of the state law.ibid.if,however,the court is persuaded that the subject of the state statute is one of statewide concern and that the statute is reasonably related to its resolution,then the conflicting charter city measure ceases to be a municipal affair pro tanto and the legislature is not prohibited by article xi,section subdivision a,from addressing the statewide dimension by its own tailored enactments.ibid.
measure s actually conflicts with state law 
we begin the analysis by determining whether there is an actual conflict between measure s and the state statute.if there is no true conflict,a choice between the conclusions municipal affair and statewide concern is not required.cal,supra,cal d at.
there is a conflict between a state law and a local ordinance if the ordinance duplicates or contradicts the state law,or if the ordinance enters an area fully occupied by general law,either expressly or by implication.american financial services city of oakland cal th,d.there is an actual conflict in this case because state law fully occupies the area of fluoridation of public water systems having more than hookups.the legislature express intent to fully occupy the area appears in section it is the intent of the legislature in enacting this article to preempt local government regulations,ordinances,and initiatives that prohibit or restrict the fluoridation of drinking water by public water systems with or more service connections,subd.b.
the legislature added section to the health and safety code in as part of senate bill.stats,ch.senate bill was introduced in response to local initiatives like measure s that were designed to curtail fluoridation.floor analysis,bill reg.sess.august.city argues that since section had not been enacted at the time judgment was entered in this case,it is inapplicable to our review.we disagree.it is well established that review of a judgment for injunctive relief is governed by the law in effect at the time the appellate court renders its decision.marine forests society california coastal com.cal th,d.even though,as city points out,this case involves declaratory relief as well as an injunction,given the nature of the declaration requested,it is appropriate to apply the current law.
the reason a reviewing court applies current rather than former law when reviewing an injunctive decree is because injunctive relief operates in the future.see witkin,cal.procedure ed.provisional remedies,cases cited see also witkin,cal.procedure,supra,appeal.it would be an idle gesture to affirm an injunctive decree because it was correct when rendered,with full knowledge that it is incorrect under existing law,and with full knowledge that,under existing law,the decree as rendered settles nothing so far as the future rights of these parties are concerned.tulare dist.dist.cal d.it does not matter whether the legislature intended the new law to be retroactive.the reviewing court is interested in the law prospective effect since that is when the decree under review will operate.
in our view,the same reasoning applies to a judicial declaration that has purely prospective effect.a declaratory judgment is to serve some practical end in quieting or stabilizing an uncertain or disputed jural relation.columbia pictures detoth cal d.when resolution of the uncertainty at issue does not affect vested rights and operates only with respect to the future rights and duties of the parties,we apply the law in effect at the time of review because that is the law under which the judicial declaration will have effect.furthermore,since the legislature enacted section having in mind the very dispute we are reviewing,we should apply the new law if it is otherwise appropriate to do so.texas brown.it would certainly be an idle act to measure city ordinance against former state law when the question is whether city may legally enforce its ordinance now and in the future.resolution of that question will not affect any vested rights.thus,the appropriate way to determine whether measure s conflicts with the state law is to examine the law as it currently exists.
notwithstanding the legislature express intent to preempt local fluoridation ordinances,city argues that there is no actual conflict.city contends that there are insufficient funds available to pay for a fluoridation system,which means that section does not require city to fluoridate,which,in turn,means that city may lawfully enforce measure s and prohibit fluoridation.therefore,according to city,there is no actual conflict and measure s is not preempted.in the same vein,city argues that it is not yet required to fluoridate because it is not at the top of the fluoridation priority list set forth in the regulations city argument is beside the point.there is an actual conflict between measure s and the state law because measure s purports to regulate an area that is fully occupied by express provisions of the state law.that is,since measure s purports to regulate fluoridation,it conflicts with the state law regardless of whether or not city is presently exempt from the fluoridation requirements of section.
city also contends that the legislature has not fully occupied the field of fluoridation because the state law does not encompass the numerous public water systems that have fewer than hookups.this argument,too,misses the mark.the legislature has chosen to define the field as fluoridation of public water systems having service connections or more.pursuant to settled preemption analysis,any local attempt to regulate within the field that the legislature has expressly occupied in full actually conflicts with the state law.since measure s would affect the fluoridation of a public water system having more than service connections,measure s conflicts with the state law.
fluoridation of public water systems is a statewide concern 
when there is a true conflict between a charter city measure and a state statute,the next question is whether the subject of the conflicting laws is one of statewide concern.johnson bradley,supra,cal th at,d.in this case,the legislature has declared promotion of the public health of californians of all ages by protection and maintenance of dental health through the fluoridation of drinking water is a paramount issue of statewide concern,subd.a.section,subdivision a reiterates that concern where it states that qualifying public water systems must be fluoridated in order to promote the public health of californians of all ages through the protection and maintenance of dental health,a paramount issue of statewide concern.although we give these pronouncements great weight,they are not controlling.domar electric,city of los angeles th,d.t he hinge of the decision is the identification of a convincing basis for legislative action originating in extramunicipal concerns.cal,supra,cal d at.
fluoride is introduced into the water supply for the purpose of preventing tooth decay.beck city council of beverly hills d.courts through the united states have uniformly held that fluoridation of water is a reasonable and proper exercise of the police power in the interest of public health.id.at.although the beck court stated over years ago that the matter is no longer an open question ibid,fluoridation battles such as this one continue to erupt.the two primary issues involved in these disputes are the concerns of public health and water quality.analysis,supra,at.
public health and water quality are matters of statewide concern.northern cal.psychiatric society city of berkeley d.lewis food state of california d,california water telephone county of los angeles d.of course,city has a vital interest in the health and safety of its inhabitants and in the quality of the water they drink and,therefore,both concerns may be deemed municipal affairs.we are convinced,however,that the state extramunicipal concerns tip the scales in favor of statewide regulation of water fluoridation.
one factor that makes fluoridation a matter of statewide concern is the need for uniform standards for water quality.the introduction of any substance,including fluoride,into the public drinking water necessarily implicates the quality of the water.indeed,the california safe drinking water act et defines contaminant as any physical,chemical,biological,or radiological substance or matter in water,subd.a.dhs is the agency responsible for the quality of the public drinking water supply,subd.g.pursuant to its legislative mandate,dhs has developed comprehensive drinking water standards,which include standards for fluoride,tit.
as the appellate court stated in paredes county of fresno d.paredes t he legislature has assigned to the dhs the duty to set standards regarding unhealthy levels of contaminants in drinking water.local decisions on the same subject,varying from county to county,can not be justified.paredes recognized that in people ex rel.deukmejian county of mendocino cal d,the supreme court permitted local regulation of aerial spraying of herbicides because differences such as the location of schools,dwellings,hospitals,and recreational areas required local flexibility.paredes distinguished that holding,noting in contrast,the degree of permissible levels of water contaminants depends upon scientific expertise and judgment which,difficult as that may be to resolve,applies generally to all users of water statewide t he legislature has dictated that statewide standards be set,and thus made it clear local health officers are to be concerned with enforcing,not creating,such standards.paredes,supra,d at.
the reasoning of paredes is directly applicable in this case.setting permissible levels for fluoride in the drinking water is no different than setting standards for any other substance in the water.it requires scientific expertise that applies generally to all users and does not require local flexibility.the only purely local issue of which we are aware is the possible existence of naturally occurring fluoride.section,subdivision a,however,expressly excludes from its scope any water system having natural fluoride in excess of specified levels.on the other hand,citizens throughout the state are entitled to the assurance that the water they receive conforms to all current public health standards.a patchwork of inconsistent local measures can not provide that assurance.
another issue that makes fluoridation of the drinking water supply a statewide concern is the cost of healthcare.the legislature has declared that one of the purposes of section is to decrease the burden the and the programs place upon the state limited funds,subd.c.this is,unquestionably,a statewide issue.indeed,the stated purpose of the sponsor of the legislation was to prevent a major economic health problem in decay tooth decay affects percent of our population and it estimated that it will cost our state program approximately million this year.of this amount,nearly half will be spent treating dental disease that can be prevented.health,statement by assem.speier,sponsor of assem.bill.reg.sess.
in view of these circumstances and concerns and the legislature express findings,we conclude that fluoridation of the state public water systems for the purpose of improving the dental health of the state citizens is a matter of statewide concern.
state law is reasonably related and narrowly tailored to the statewide concern 
we now consider whether the state law is reasonably related to the identified statewide concern and narrowly tailored to avoid infringing legitimate municipal affairs.city implicitly concedes the reasonableness of the relationship because its argument is directed solely to the final question,whether the state requirements are narrowly tailored.
city argues that the state law is not narrowly tailored to the state interest in improving the dental health of children since fluoridated water will affect all users.city also argues that there are other,less intrusive means of improving dental health,such as programs for topical fluoride and dental disease prevention programs in schools.these arguments are unavailing.first,the legislature has clarified that the state interest is in the dental health of all californians,not just c
