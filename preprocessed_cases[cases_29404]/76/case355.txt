this water rights case involves the interpretation of a decree in a stream adjudication and,more particularly,the interplay between the right to divert water to storage in a reservoir and the right to divert water for direct application to beneficial use.
the specific issue here is whether the trial court correctly interpreted a judgment and decree in an adjudication of the water rights on the susan river stream system the susan river decree.we conclude the court did not correctly interpret the decree.as we will explain,the trial court erred in determining that paragraph of the decree gives defendant lassen irrigation company the irrigation company a right to divert water from the susan river for direct application to beneficial use that is measured by the capacity of the irrigation company three reservoirs estimated at.properly interpreted,the susan river decree does give the irrigation company a right to divert water for direct application to beneficial use,but that right is provided in a different part of the decree and is measured in cubic feet per second cfs,not paragraph of the decree dictates when that right of direct diversion and the irrigation company right to store water can be exercised,but it does not establish a right to direct diversion itself.because the trial court erred in construing the decree,we will reverse the court order and remand the case for the court to enter a new order consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
the susan river system 
the susan river has its source on the east slope of the sierra nevada in the southwesterly portion of lassen county at an elevation of about feet.its channel follows a general easterly direction from silver lake through mccoy flat reservoir and through susanville and on to honey lake to which it is tributary 
susan river has four important tributaries,namely,piute creek which comes in from the north at susanville,gold run creek and lassen creek which come in from the south between susanville and johnstonville,and willow creek which is tributary from the north above standish.
under normal conditions the flows of lassen and gold run creeks and of susan river above susanville are fairly well sustained from melting snows until early in june.
the irrigation company use of the river 
the irrigation company provides water from the susan river to irrigate a total of acres that lie south of the river to the southeast of susanville the irrigation company owns and operates three reservoirs mccoy flat reservoir diversion,hog flat reservoir diversion,and the leavitt lake reservoir diversion mccoy flat reservoir which lies west of susanville is situated on the main channel of susan river and has a maximum capacity of about acre feet.the water stored in mccoy flat reservoir is released during the summer to supplement the water stored in hog flat and leavitt reservoirs described hereafter.
hog flat reservoir which lies east of mccoy flat and west of susanville is situated on hog flat branch of susan river and has a maximum capacity of about,acre feet.the water stored in hog flat reservoir is released during the summer to supplement the water stored in mccoy flat and leavitt reservoirs.
lake leavitt which lies east of susanville is formed by an earth dam or levee about one and miles in length which closes the open side of a natural basin.the lake has a normal capacity of about and is filled by the diversion of water from susan river through the a and b canal.that canal also known as the adams and batcheldor ditch or a and b ditch and identified as diversion runs from the south side of big slough channel of susan river.the canal consists of an earth ditch five and miles in length to where it empties into leavitt reservoir,and a number of laterals tap the main ditch along its course.at the time of the investigation leading to the susan river decree,t he maximum capacity of the ditch was measured as cubic feet per second and the normal diversion as about cubic feet per second.
a few shareholders of the irrigation company have land along the a and b canal and receive some of their water directly from the canal.according to the report,that land amounts to acres.the remaining acres of land receiving water from the irrigation company are irrigated with water released from lake leavitt into an outlet canal that is about eight miles long.thus,nearly percent of the land irrigated by the irrigation company is served exclusively by water that passes through lake leavitt.
the irrigation company also owns the colony dam,which is located on the susan river at the junction with willow creek.the dam is used primarily for regulatory purposes to maintain a steady flow of cubic feet per second of susan river water passing the dam when diversion of natural flow from the river is being made into leavitt lake reservoir.at the time of the hydrographic report,water could also be diverted at the dam into the colony dam ditch diversion,which was used as a supplemental direct diversion supply to the water stored in the leavitt reservoir.it appears,however,that the irrigation company no longer uses this point of diversion at this time.
the background of the susan river decree 
before the litigation that led directly to the susan river decree,there was a history of t rouble involving the use of water and ditches diverting water from susan river.in,a judgment was entered in a case involving water from the susan river entitled byers et chas.hartson,leavitt,hutchinson,et.super.lassen county.defendants leavitt and hutchinson were the predecessors in interest to the irrigation company.the judgment in the byers case gave leavitt and hutchinson,as against the plaintiffs in that case,the right to divert the water of susan river from the channel thereof for storage in their lake leavitt reservoir,and in other reservoirs.in particular,this storage right applied to all water flowing in the river between the first day of march and the first day of july in each and every year in excess of inches of water measured under a four inch pressure,at a point immediately above the mouth of willow creek and in excess of inches of water so measured at said point at all other times of each year.the judgment specified that b y inches of water measured under a four inch pressure is meant cubic feet of water per second.thus,between march and july,the predecessors of the irrigation company could divert to storage as long as they maintained a flow of cfs in the river immediately above willow creek,and at all other times they could divert to storage as long as they maintained a flow of cfs at that point.
from forward,various groups of water right owners were involved in a number of cases of water right litigation on willow creek,gold run creek,lassen creek,upper susan river,and on piute creek.the narrow scope of the issues involved rendered unsatisfactory results from the various cases,because as conditions changed different combinations of issues arose which threatened expensive and continued litigation.in view of this situation,more than ninety per cent of the water right owners entered into an agreement during the summer of to seek an adjudication of each right in respect to all other rights in the susan river stream system under the court reference procedure of former section of the water commission act.
following the above mentioned agreement,the case of fleming etal.sic bennett,etal.sic,was instituted in the superior court of california,in and for the county of lassen,on july,the case was referred by said court to the former division of water resources on august,under the provision of former section of the water commission act for investigation and report as referee.
a survey and map of the diversions and irrigated lands in the susan river stream system and an investigation of record facts were made by the referee between august,and march.a conference of the water users and their representatives was held at susanville on march,to acquaint them with the data that had been collected by the division.a program of future action for expeditio u s conduct of the investigation of the referee was discussed with the water users at the conference.
in order to expedite an investigation by the referee of the use of water on susan river and its tributaries,a tentative schedule for the distribution of waters during the season was recommended to the water users.the plan of distribution was agreed upon by all of the water users except the owners of the ridenour,satica,and jenkins ranches the schedule of allotments was based upon an assumed duty of one cubic foot per second to eighty acres of irrigated land and the plan of distribution was to be operative during the season only.the agreement contained a provision that the legal rights of the various parties should in no way be prejudiced by such distribution of water.it was further agreed that the conference with the division should be continued until a date to be later fixed by the division,said date to be subsequent to the end of the season,when the results of the distribution under the agreement would be available.water master service was furnished as an incident of the investigation from march to october.the agreement was based in part on the fact that it appear ed from the data collected by the division that it m ight be possible to work out an allocation of the waters of the susan river stream system that w ould be acceptable to all of the parties to the suit and afford the basis for a consent judgment in the proceedings.
the tentative allocation set forth in the agreement consisted primarily of water rights set forth in four schedules,each one of which was s ubject to all of the foregoing rights and provisions in the agreement schedule addressed rights on willow creek and its tributaries.schedule addressed rights on hills creek,gold run creek,lassen creek,and piute creek.schedule addressed rights on the susan river and willow creek.as particularly pertinent here,the paragraph of the agreement describing the water rights available under schedule paragraph contained the following language with respect to the irrigation company provided further,that the lassen irrigation company shall be entitled to divert under their right hereinafter provided from the flow of susan river in excess of cubic feet per second measured above the confluence of said river with willow creek during the period from march to july,and from the flow of said river in excess of cubic feet per second measured at said point at all other times.thus,the rights on the susan river provided in schedule were subject to the irrigation company right to divert,which was provided for later in the agreement.although the agreement did not provide any detail on the origin of the minimum flow aspect of this provision,it appears the minimum flow requirements to which the irrigation company was subject in the agreement came from the judgment in the byers case discussed above.
schedule of the agreement addressed additional rights on the susan river beyond those in schedule.the irrigation company appeared as the first user listed in schedule,with a right to cfs under the first of three priority classes in schedule.the cfs figure appears to have been derived by dividing the total acreage attributed to the irrigation company in the agreement by the assumed duty of one cfs to acres of irrigated land and rounding off to the nearest tenth.the paragraph of the agreement describing the water rights available under schedule paragraph specified that the diversion of all allotments set forth in said schedule shall be limited to the amounts directly applied to beneficial use with the exception of the allotments to lassen irrigation company,and to clarence dakin,et,which may be diverted to storage.
the next paragraph of the agreement paragraph then specified as follows 
subject to the foregoing rights and provisions,lassen irrigation company shall be entitled to impound the natural flow of susan river and its tributaries in the mccoy flat,hog flat,and lake leavitt reservoirs in an amount equal to the present combined capacity of said reservoirs,or approximately acre feet per annum,said water to be used for domestic and stock watering purposes and for supplemental irrigation of the lands of the stockholders of said company 
in february,following the trial distribution under the agreement,the division completed the hydrographic report.this report was comprehensive.it consist ed of pages of findings and conclusions and as many or more pages of schedules,tables and plates.it deal t with and recommend ed findings with respect to claimed rights of water users in the susan river watershed.fleming bennett cal d.
as the division explained to the court in june in its report of referee,following the division production of its comprehensive hydrographic report,a nother conference of the parties to the action and their representatives was called by the division of water resources on march,at susanville.a stipulation for judgment containing a plan of settlement of all of the water rights in the susan river stream system was presented by said division at the conference.the stipulation was based upon the schedule of trial distribution with such modifications as appeared necessary from the additional information gathered in.
paragraphs through of the stipulation for judgment dealt with the special class rights that are not at issue in this proceeding.paragraphs through dealt with the four schedules of interrelated rights,now numbered three through six schedule addressed rights on willow creek and on the susan river below willow creek.like schedule in the agreement,schedule in the stipulation addressed rights on hills creek,gold run creek,lassen creek,and piute creek.like schedule in the agreement,schedule in the stipulation addressed rights on the susan river and lower willow creek.the paragraph of the stipulation describing the water rights available under schedule paragraph contained the same language regarding the irrigation company right to divert that was previously contained in the paragraph governing schedule in the agreement.in other words,the stipulation recognized the irrigation company entitlement to divert under their right hereinafter provided from the flow of susan river in excess of cubic feet per second measured above the confluence of said river with willow creek during the period from march to july,and from the flow of said river in excess of cubic feet per second measured at said point at all other times.
like schedule in the agreement,schedule in the stipulation addressed additional rights on the susan river.again,the irrigation company appeared as the first user listed in this schedule.now,however,the irrigation company right to divert under the schedule was limited to cfs.indeed,the amounts of all the rights in schedule of the stipulation were reduced from the corresponding amounts in schedule of the agreement.paragraph of the stipulation continued to provide that all diversions under what was now schedule were limited to amounts directly applied to beneficial use with the exception of the allotments to the irrigation company and several other users,which could be diverted to storage.
like paragraph of the agreement,paragraph of the stipulation recognized the irrigation company right to impound water in its three reservoirs,although the total capacity of those reservoirs was now estimated at.
because the stipulation for judgment provided for allocation of the waters of the susan river system,and not simply during the irrigation season as the agreement had done,the stipulation contained a new paragraph paragraph governing seasons of use,to which each of the paragraphs discussing schedules through expressly referred paragraph provided in relevant part as follows 
t he season of diversion of water for general irrigation purposes under the rights hereinafter set forth in schedules,and,shall be for continuous usage during the period from march to october,and during said period all rights set forth in said schedules shall be superior to the storage rights hereinafter provided in paragraphs,and except further that diversion shall be made from the natural flow of susan river by lassen irrigation company between march and july of each and every year only from the flow of said river in excess of cubic feet per second measured immediately above the confluence of said river with willow creek,and at all other times only from the flow of said river in excess of cubic feet per second measured at said point.
as the division further explained to the court in the report of referee,t he parties to the proceedings desired to continue trial distribution of the waters of the susan river stream system under the plan contained in the stipulation for judgment during until the commencement of the haying season to afford a further demonstration of the operation thereof.circulation of the stipulation for judgment was commenced on july,among the various parties to the action for their approval.said stipulation for judgment was subscribed by parties to the proceedings.
as the division observed,the irrigation company subscribed an identical copy of the stipulation,but with certain reservations.those reservations were stated in pertinent part as follows 
executed by the lassen irrigation company upon the express condition that the exception contained in paragraph,commencing line,page six,shall be construed to give lassen irrigation company the right to divert,or store up to the present capacity of its reservoirs,estimated at,from the natural flow of susan river between march and july of each year when the flow of susan river is in excess of cubic feet per second,measured immediately above the confluence of said river with willow creek,and at all other times when the flow of said river is in excess of five cubic feet per second measured at said point,irrespective of and notwithstanding the allotments granted to users in schedules,and 
in the conclusions of law contained in the report of referee,the division incorporated virtually verbatim the irrigation company reservations to paragraph of the stipulation for judgment,writing in pertinent part as follows 
the intent of paragraph of the stipulation for judgment as intended by the various signatory parties is more clearly set forth by use of the following language and said paragraph should be construed as though written as follows 
t he season of diversion of water for general irrigation purposes under the rights hereinafter set forth in schedules,and,shall be for continuous usage during the period from march to october,and during said period all rights set forth in said schedules shall be superior to the storage rights hereinafter provided in paragraphs,and except further,that lassen irrigation company shall be entitled to divert,or store up to the present capacity of its reservoirs,estimated at,from the natural flow of susan river between march and july of each year when the flow of susan river is in excess of cubic feet per second,measured immediately above the confluence of said river with willow creek,and at all other times when the flow of said river is in excess of cubic feet per second measured at said point,irrespective of and notwithstanding the allotments granted to users in schedules and and to users of third priority class in schedule.
on april,the court rendered its final decree based in the main on the report filed by the referee.fleming bennett,supra,cal d at.thereafter,in august,the supreme court affirmed the decree.id.at.
the susan river decree 
the major provisions of the susan river decree,on which the resolution of this case turns,are as follows paragraph of the decree explains that the water rights involved fall into four classifications.the first set of rights,addressed in paragraphs through of the decree,are of independent character and absolute priority because under those rights the respective parties take all of the flow of various springs and small tributaries and have for more than five years prior to the commencement of this action long continued to do so.the decree describes these rights as special class water rights and characterizes them as independent of each other and as superior in priority and in right to all other rights in the susan river stream system.
the decree describes the other three sets of water rights as interrelated water rights.the first set of interrelated rights are t hose which derive their water supply from willow creek and the susan river below willow creek.those rights,which are divisible into two priority classes,are addressed in paragraph and in schedule of the decree 
the second set of interrelated rights are t hose upon gold run creek,lassen creek,piute creek and their tributaries,which are three separate units.those rights,which are divided into priority classes within each unit,are addressed in paragraphs,and and in schedule of the decree.
the third set of interrelated rights are t hose upon susan river and upon its tributaries above piute creek.those rights,which are divided into eight priority classes,are addressed in paragraphs and to and in schedules and of the decree.
the irrigation company rights under the decree 
the irrigation company has a first priority class right under schedule of the decree.that schedule gives the irrigation company the right to divert cfs at diversions,and to supply the company acres.regarding that schedule right,paragraph of the decree provides in relevant part as follows 
subject to all of the foregoing rights and provisions,the various parties hereinafter enumerated in schedule are entitled to rights in and to the use of the natural flow of susan river and its tributaries during the seasons hereinbefore defined in paragraph,for domestic,and irrigation purposes upon their respective lands as shown on said division of water resources map,and as hereinafter described under their respective names in schedule,in accordance with the acreages to be supplied,priorities and quantities of water allotted,and through the diversions as set forth in said schedule providedhowever,that diversion of all allotments set forth in said schedule shall be limited to the amounts directly applied to beneficial use with the exception of the allotments to lassen irrigation company and certain others which may be diverted to storage.
among other things,paragraph of the decree explains that a ll rights in first priority class hereinafter set forth in said schedule are subject and inferior to all rights set forth in said schedules,and,but are superior in priority and in right to all other rights set forth in said schedule.
in addition to its right to divert under schedule,the irrigation company has a right to store water under paragraph of the decree,as follows 
subject to the foregoing rights and provisions,lassen irrigation company is entitled to impound the natural flow of susan river and its tributaries in the mccoy flat,hog flat,and lake leavitt reservoirs at points designated respectively on division of water resources map as diversions,and as hereinafter described in schedule,in an amount equal to the present combined capacity of said reservoirs,or approximately per annum,during the season hereinbefore stated in paragraph,or as much of said amount of water as is impounded in said reservoirs and thereafter withdrawn from said reservoirs during the period from january to december of each year and applied to beneficial use for domestic and purposes and for the irrigation of the lands of the stockholders of said company as hereinafter described under the name of said company in schedule.
paragraph of the decree,which is referenced in both paragraph and paragraph and all of the other paragraphs in the decree granting water rights,and which lies at the heart of the dispute in this case,provides as follows 
all diversion for domestic,municipal and industrial purposes under the rights hereinafter provided and for irrigation purposes under the rights of special class hereinafter set forth in paragraphs to,inclusive,shall be for continuous usage without regard to season the season of diversion of water for general irrigation purposes under the rights hereinafter set forth in schedules,and,shall be for continuous usage during the period from march,to october,both dates inclusive,of each and every year and during said period all rights set forth in said schedules shall be superior to the storage rights hereinafter provided in paragraphs,and except that no water shall be diverted through diversions to,inclusive,said diversions being located as hereinafter described in schedule between june and august of each and every year except further,that lassen irrigation company shall be entitled to divert,or store up to the present capacity of its reservoirs,estimated at,from the natural flow of susan river between march and july of each year when the flow of said susan river is in excess of cubic feet per second,measured immediately above the confluence of said river with willow creek,and at all other times when the flow of said river is in excess of cubic feet per second measured at said point,irrespective of and notwithstanding the allotments granted to users in said schedules and and to users of third priority class in said schedule and that during the period from november of each and every year to the last day of february of the succeeding year,both dates inclusive,the rights hereinafter provided for the storage of the waters of said susan river and its tributaries shall be superior to all irrigation rights,from said stream system,but said storage rights shall at all times be inferior and subject to the rights from said stream system for domestic,municipal and industrial purposes of the parties hereto,who require water from said stream system for said domestic,municipal and industrial purposes.
the present dispute 
dow owns four ranches and leases one together,they comprise the dow ranch,on which he raises cattle and grows grass hay,alfalfa hay,alfalfa seed,corn,pasture,and grains.as the of these lands,dow possesses a number of water rights governed by the susan river decree amounting to an aggregate flow of cfs under schedules,and of the decree dow rights do not include any storage but instead are limited to diversion for direct application to beneficial use.all of dow points of diversion are downstream from the confluence of the susan river and willow creek and thus below all of the irrigation company points of diversion.
in the spring of,dow believed he was not receiving his full allotment of water under the decree,so he contacted the watermaster to find out what was happening he was informed that the irrigation company was being allowed to divert water into lake leavitt even though the irrigation company was simultaneously releasing water from the reservoir for use by its shareholders.believing this was not permitted by the decree,dow filed a complaint with the watermaster.in his complaint,dow asserted that the watermaster was allowing the irrigation company to divert schedule water when schedule water is not at allocation.in essence,it was dow position that by diverting water into lake leavitt at the same time it was releasing water from the lake,the irrigation company was directly diverting water to beneficial use under its schedule right,which was in violation of the priorities in the decree since schedule users like dow were not receiving all of their schedule water.
ultimately,in may,the watermaster formally denied dow claim.the watermaster interpreted paragraph of the decree as allowing the irrigation company to either store or directly divert to beneficial use up to per year.thus,the watermaster concluded that the irrigation company was not taking schedule water before all schedule users received their full allotment but instead was directly diverting water to beneficial use pursuant to its rights under paragraph of the decree.
in december,dow filed a motion in the fleming case to interpret and enforce the decree.by his motion,dow asked the court to confirm that the susan river decree gives the irrigation company only two water rights,one for storage under paragraph and one for direct diversion to beneficial use under schedule nothing in the decree authorizes or empowers the irrigation company to divert its storage right under paragraph for direct application to beneficial use and each year the irrigation company may fill each of its three reservoirs only once unless the irrigation company uses water available under its schedule rights or water determined to be excess to the system.the main thrust of dow argument was that the watermaster erred in interpreting the decree to allow the irrigation company to divert the continuous flow equivalent of acre feet to be directly applied to a beneficial use.
the irrigation company opposed dow motion,contending that the decree expressly allows the irrigation company to both divert or store susan river water as long as certain flows are maintained in the susan river.
the trial court sided with the irrigation company,concluding that the word divert,as used in paragraph,means diversion for direct application to beneficial use as opposed to storage.based on this interpretation,the court concluded that paragraph allows the irrigation company to either divert for direct application to beneficial use or store up to of water annually,subject to the minimum flow requirements immediately above willow creek.
dow filed a timely notice of appeal from the order interpreting the decree.
discussion 
on appeal,dow contends the trial court erred in construing the susan river decree with respect to the irrigation company rights.we agree.
the same rules apply in ascertaining the meaning of a court order or judgment as in ascertaining the meaning of any other writing.citation.the rule with respect to orders and judgments is that the entire record may be examined to determine their scope and effect local.bd.stan drive ins,supra,d at.individual clauses or provisions of a judgment,just as in a contract or any other document,are not to be separately considered and construed but,on the contrary,the entire document is to be taken by its four corners and construed as a whole to effectuate the obvious intention.lazar superior court cal d.
the main question here is whether,construing the susan river decree as a whole,paragraph of the decree can be reasonably understood as giving the irrigation company the right to directly divert to beneficial use up to of water annually provided the flow requirements immediately above willow creek are met.the answer to that question is no.
as dow points out,construing paragraph as giving the irrigation company a right to direct diversion not expressed elsewhere in the decree is inconsistent with the structure of the decree as a whole.as we have pointed out,paragraph of the decree specifies that the rights involved in the underlying action fall into four classifications and then sets out those classifications as follows 
a special class rights,as set forth in paragraphs to 
b interrelated rights on willow creek and the susan river below willow creek,as set forth in paragraph and schedule 
c interrelated rights on gold run creek,lassen creek,piute creek and their tributaries,as set forth in paragraphs,and and schedule and 
d interrelated rights on the susan river and its tributaries above piute creek,as set forth in paragraphs and to and schedules and.
similarly,paragraph explains that special class rights are set forth in paragraphs to and interrelated rights are set forth in paragraphs to and in schedules,and.
it is reasonable to conclude that if the court had intended paragraph to give the irrigation company a right to direct diversion not found elsewhere in the decree,the decree would have included paragraph in the lists of paragraphs in paragraphs and.the fact that the decree does not do so supports dow position that paragraph was not intended to give the irrigation company a right to direct diversion not expressed elsewhere in the decree.
this understanding is consistent with paragraph apparent role in the decree,when it is examined in connection with the remainder of the decree.in each paragraph in which water rights are granted or recognized,the decree specifies that the direct diversion or storage right can be exercised during the season hereinbefore stated in paragraph.thus,for example,paragraph specifies that the various parties enumerated in schedule are entitled to rights in and to the use of the natural flow of susan river and its tributaries during the seasons hereinbefore defined in paragraph.as another example,paragraph specifies that the irrigation company is entitled to impound the natural flow of susan river and its tributaries in the mccoy flat,hog flat,and lake leavitt reservoirs at points designated respectively on division of water resources map as diversions,and as hereinafter described in schedule,in an amount equal to the present combined capacity of said reservoirs,or approximately per annum,during the season hereinbefore stated in paragraph 
from these multiple references,it seems apparent that paragraph was not intended to grant any water rights,but instead was intended to qualify or limit rights granted elsewhere in the decree particularly by specifying when those rights can be exercised.to that end,paragraph begins by providing that a ll diversion for domestic,municipal and industrial purposes under the rights hereinafter provided and for irrigation purposes under the rights of special class hereinafter set forth in paragraphs to,inclusive,shall be for continuous usage without regard to season.in other words,paragraph first makes clear that there is no seasonal limitation on water diverted for domestic,municipal and industrial purposes or on water diverted for irrigation purposes by those with special class rights.
next,paragraph addresses irrigation rights for those with interrelated rights under schedules,and by specifying that the season of diversion of water for those rights shall be for continuous usage during the period from march,to october,both dates inclusive,of each and every year.paragraph then establishes the relative priority between these interrelated irrigation rights and the various storage rights hereinafter provided in paragraphs,and by specifying that from march through october the period during which the interrelated irrigation rights may be exercised those rights shall be superior to the storage rights.what then follow are a series of exceptions to the foregoing provisions on season of use and priority of irrigation rights over storage rights.
turning to the second of those exceptions beginning with except further,which is the one at issue here,we can see that construing that exception as granting the irrigation company a right to directly divert to beneficial use up to of water annually as the trial court did here is not only inconsistent with the overall structure of the decree and with paragraph apparent role in that structure as we have explained,but it is also inconsistent with the grammatical structure of the exception itself.the exception specifies that the irrigation company shall be entitled to divert,or store up to the present capacity of its reservoirs,estimated at,from the natural flow of susan river at certain times subject to certain flow requirements immediately above willow creek.while not controlling,punctuation is to be considered in the interpretation of a document.duncanson harrelson travelers indemnity d.where,as here,a phrase is set off from the rest of the main sentence by commas,it should be read as a parenthetical phrase because such a grammatical structure indicates an intent to segregate th e phrase from the rest of the sentence.ibid.
the irrigation company and the trial court reading of the language at issue fails to account for the use of the two commas to create a parenthetical phrase.the irrigation company focuses on the word or,which,as the irrigation company points out,i n its ordinary sense indicates an alternative such as either this or that.los angeles county medical center superior court d.according to the irrigation company,by its use of the word or the decree expressly gives the irrigation company the right to either divert or store the subject water.but this argument fails to account for the two commas that set off the phrase or store up to the present capacity of its reservoirs,estimated at from the remainder of the sentence had the drafters of the decree intended the meaning that the irrigation company advances and that the trial court found,there would have been no need for the comma before the word or.but they included that comma,and we need to give it meaning if we can.we do that by reading the phrase set off by commas as a parenthetical phrase.
dow contends that parenthetical phrase or store up to the present capacity of its reservoirs should be construed as a parenthetical phrase explaining the meaning of the word divert.thus,dow would have us read the phrase like this lassen irrigation company shall be entitled to divert,in other words,store up to the present capacity of its reservoirs,estimated at,from the natural flow of susan river.this is a recognized use of the word or.see,black law dict.ed,noting that or can be used to clarify what has already been said,and in such cases,means in other words,or that is to say.and this interpretation has the virtue of giving meaning to the two commas used to set off the phrase from the rest of the sentence by reading that phrase as parenthetical.in our view,however,this interpretation does not properly capture the intended meaning of the exception in paragraph.
first of all,if the drafters of the decree had intended this exception in paragraph to encompass only the irrigation company right to store water in its reservoirs,there would have been no need to use the words divert or or,or to use two commas to create a parenthetical phrase.instead,the provision could have simply provided that lassen irrigation company shall be entitled to store up to the present capacity of its reservoirs,estimated at,from the natural flow of susan river.or the drafters could have provided that the irrigation company shall be entitled to divert to storage up to the present capacity of its reservoirs the least likely explanation for the language the drafters used is the one dow advances that they intended the word divert to be the equivalent of store up to the present capacity of its reservoirs,estimated at.
while we have concluded that neither the interpretation offered by the irrigation company nor the interpretation offered by dow is satisfactory,there is a third option that recognizes the use of the two commas to create a parenthetical phrase which the irrigation company interpretation does not do but at the same time gives the word or its more ordinary meaning as a choice between alternatives and does not result in an artificial explanation for the use of the parenthetical phrase which dow interpretation does.this alternate interpretation treats the parenthetical phrase or store up to the present capacity of its reservoirs as an alternative to the word divert.reading the clause in that manner results in the following understanding of the operative exception in paragraph b etween march and july of each year when the flow of the susan river is in excess of cubic feet per second,measured immediately above the confluence of said river with willow creek,and at all other times when the flow of said river is in excess of cubic feet per second measured at said point,the irrigation company shall be entitled to divert from the natural flow of susan river or store up to the present capacity of its reservoirs,estimated at from the natural flow of susan river.
read in this manner,paragraph does not grant the irrigation company the right to directly divert to beneficial use an amount of water equal to the capacity of its reservoirs,as the trial court concluded.this makes particular sense in light of the fact that nowhere else in the decree is a right to direct diversion to beneficial use expressed in.an is the volume as of irrigation water that would cover one acre to a depth of one foot.merriam webster collegiate dict.ed.thus,it is a measure of water that is not moving.indeed,the decree consistently uses to describe the amount of water that may be stored in a reservoir.moving water,on the other hand that is,flowing water that is diverted for direct application to beneficial use is consistently described in the decree in terms of cubic feet per second.
while paragraph does not specify how many cubic feet per second of water the irrigation company is entitled to divert from the natural flow of susan river,that omission is easily explained in a manner consistent with our understanding of paragraph role in the decree.because paragraph does not grant any water rights,but instead only qualifies or limits water rights granted elsewhere in the decree,the reference to the irrigation company right to divert from the natural flow of susan river must be a reference to a right to direct diversion to beneficial use granted somewhere else in the decree.because the irrigation company has only one right to direct diversion to beneficial use under the decree the right provided in schedule it follows that the reference in paragraph to the irrigation company right to divert must be a reference to the irrigation company schedule right.
understood in this manner,the exception in paragraph under consideration serves to specify when the irrigation company may exercise its water rights under both schedule and paragraph of the decree.specifically,notwithstanding the general provisions in paragraph that the interrelated irrigation rights in schedules,and may be exercised only from march through october and that during that period those irrigation rights are superior to any storage rights in the decree,the irrigation company can either divert under its schedule right,at up to cfs,or store up to the capacity of its reservoirs,estimated at,between march and july when the flow of the susan river is in excess of cfs immediately above willow creek and at all other times when the flow is in excess of cfs 
this interpretation of paragraph of the decree is supported by the genesis of the language we are called on to interpret.to explain why,we need to delve back into some of the background facts set forth above.
recall that as far back as,it was recognized by the judgment in the byers case that,at least as against the plaintiffs in that case,the irrigation district predecessors in interest had the right to divert to storage in their reservoirs as long as they maintained the cfs minimum flows at willow creek.now,fast forward to.the division,acting as referee in the stream adjudication of all rights in the susan river stream system,recommended a plan for distribution of the water for the irrigation season based on an assumed duty of one cfs for every acres of irrigated land,and virtually all of the water users agreed to that plan.
under the agreement,certain rights on the susan river and willow creek were set forth in schedule.the paragraph governing that schedule specifically noted the irrigation company entitlement to divert under their right hereinafter provided as long as the minimum flows from the byers judgment were maintained at willow creek.
schedule in the agreement addressed additional rights on the susan river,including a right for the irrigation company to directly divert cfs under the first priority class in that schedule.the irrigation company was also entitled to divert this water to storage.immediately thereafter,paragraph of the agreement set forth the irrigation company right to store water up to the capacity of its reservoirs.
at this point,we pause to note that the paragraph governing schedule in the agreement contained an ambiguity with respect to the irrigation company,because it referred to the irrigation company entitlement to divert under their right hereinafter provided italics added as long as the required minimum flows were maintained at willow creek.in fact,the agreement thereafter contained two diversion rights for the irrigation company the right to divert cfs either for direct application to beneficial use or to storage under schedule and the right to divert to storage up to the capacity of its reservoirs under paragraph.the agreement was ambiguous because it was not clear which of these rights the paragraph governing schedule in the agreement was meant to refer to.
with that noted,we move on to the stipulation for judgment.in the paragraph describing the water rights under schedule schedule in the agreement,the same use of the singular right hereinafter provided appeared with respect to the irrigation company,even though the stipulation thereafter recognized the irrigation company right to direct diversion or diversion to storage under schedule and the irrigation company right to divert to storage under paragraph.additionally,the new paragraph regarding seasons of use paragraph contained a similar provision recognizing that diversion shall be made by lassen irrigation company subject to the minimum flow requirements at willow creek.like the language in the paragraph governing schedule,this reference to a singular diversion was ambiguous,because the stipulation thereafter recognized that the irrigation company had two diversion rights the right under schedule and the right under paragraph.
as we have noted,the irrigation company signed the stipulation for judgment with a specific reservation regarding the construction of paragraph,and in its report of referee the division proposed to the court that the language of the irrigation company reservation be used virtually verbatim for the seasons of use paragraph in the judgment.instead of simply providing that the irrigation company diversion would be subject to the minimum flow requirements at willow creek,the new language for the seasons of use paragraph provided that the irrigation company was entitled to divert,or store up to the present capacity of its reservoirs,estimated at,subject to the minimum flow requirements at willow creek,and the new language provided that this entitlement was irrespective of and notwithstanding the allotments granted to users in schedules and and to users of third priority class in schedule.
by specifically referring to the irrigation company right to divert,or store up to the present capacity of its reservoirs,we believe this revision of the seasons of use paragraph was intended to make clear reference to the two water rights set forth thereafter for the irrigation company,which the singular word diversion did not previously do.in other words,it appears the irrigation company wanted to be sure it was understood that the irrigation company was entitled to operate under the exception set forth in paragraph both in exercising its direct diversion rights under schedule as well as in exercising its right to divert to storage under paragraph.
this understanding of the language that the irrigation company proposed for use in paragraph is bolstered by what happened to the reference to the irrigation company in the paragraph governing schedule between the stipulation for judgment and the decree itself.as we have noted,the stipulation for judgment referred to the irrigation company entitlement to divert under their right hereinafter provided the decree,however,refers to the irrigation company entitlement to divert under their rights hereinafter set forth in paragraph the significance of this change is that the drafters of the decree found a way,in relation to schedule,to refer only to the irrigation company right to divert to storage in paragraph.had the drafters intended the exception in paragraph to have a similar limited scope,they reasonably could have been expected to use the same language.in other words,they could have written the exception in paragraph to provide that the irrigation company shall be entitled to divert under their rights hereinafter set forth in paragraph from the natural flow of susan river.the fact that they did not do so,but instead referred to the irrigation company entitlement to divert,or store up to the present capacity of its reservoirs,supports the conclusion that the drafters specifically intended to refer to something more than just the irrigation company storage rights under paragraph by using this language.we believe the something more the drafters intended to refer to was the irrigation company right to divert directly to beneficial use or storage under schedule.thus,the genesis of the language in paragraph supports our construction of that language to mean that,as long as the minimum flows at willow creek are met,the irrigation company can either divert under its schedule right,at up to cfs,or store up to the capacity of its reservoirs,estimated at.
significantly,the exception in paragraph pertaining to the irrigation company also specifies that the irrigation company rights to divert and store water subject to the flow requirements immediately above willow creek are irrespective of and notwithstanding the allotments granted to users in said schedules and and to users of third priority class in said schedule.this provision is significant because essentially it gives the irrigation company rights a different priority than they would otherwise have under the terms of the decree.to truly understand the effect of this altered priority,it is necessary to take a closer look at the schedules in the decree.
first,it must be noted that the exception in paragraph pertaining to the irrigation company rights does not mention schedule.this makes sense because,as we have noted,schedule involves rights on gold run creek,lassen creek,and piute creek,which are all tributary to the susan river.because the irrigation company points of diversion are all on the susan river itself,the irrigation company diversion of water from the river can have no direct effect on those water users entitled to divert under schedule,because those users take their water from the system before it ever reaches the susan river.
users like dow entitled to water under schedules,and,or at least some of them,stand in a different position with respect to the irrigation company because their water rights can be affected by the irrigation company exercise of its rights as we have seen,however,the exception in paragraph pertaining to the irrigation company entitles the irrigation company to exercise its rights irrespective of and notwithstanding the allotments granted to users in said schedules and and to users of third priority class in said schedule.the only users not mentioned in this clause are those in the first and second priority classes in schedule.a review of schedule reveals that the first and second priority classes in that schedule encompass points of diversion ranging from diversion to diversion.and an examination of the map included with the hydrographic report shows that all of those points of diversion lie along the susan river above the confluence of the river with willow creek,with diversion being the last point of diversion on the river before willow creek.
what this means is that,provided the required flow immediately above willow creek is met,the exception in paragraph pertaining to the irrigation company allows the irrigation company to exercise its rights to direct diversion under schedule or to storage under paragraph irrespective of the allotments granted to all other users on the susan river except for those with points of diversion above the confluence with willow creek.in essence,then,the irrigation company must leave enough water in the river to satisfy the users along the river from immediately below the mccoy flat and hog flat reservoirs down to the confluence of the river with willow creek,those users in the first and second priority classes in schedule and to meet the minimum flow requirements immediately above willow creek.if it does so,then the irrigation company can divert up to cfs for direct application to beneficial use or for storage under its schedule right or it can store up to the capacity of its reservoirs,estimated at,under paragraph.
based on this reading of the susan river decree,we conclude the trial court erred in construing the decree with respect to the irrigation company rights.specifically,the trial court was incorrect in its conclusion that under paragraph the irrigation company has a right to direct diversion to beneficial use that is measured by the capacity of its reservoirs,estimated at.the irrigation company only right to divert for direct application to beneficial use is its right under schedule,which is measured in cubic feet per second.
as we have explained,however,the irrigation company right to divert under schedule is subject to the terms of paragraph,and those terms give the irrigation company schedule right greater priority than it would otherwise have.for example,as long as the minimum flow requirements immediately above willow creek are satisfied and the irrigation company leaves enough additional water in the river to satisfy the users on the river above the confluence with willow creek,the irrigation company can directly divert up to cfs under its schedule right irrespective of other users like dow with rights under the third priority class in schedule and the first priority class in schedule.and this is true even if the irrigation company has already stored all the water it is entitled to store under paragraph of the decree.that means there may be times when dow is not receiving all of the water to which he is entitled under schedules and but the irrigation company is able to divert water into an otherwise full lake leavitt at the same time it is simultaneously releasing water from the reservoir for use by its shareholders.in such an instance,the water passing through the lake is water available to the irrigation company under its schedule right,which by the terms of paragraph takes priority over dow rights.
dow challenges this aspect of our interpretation of the decree on the ground that it conflicts with various other provisions in the decree relating to the issue of priority.we address and reject each of those arguments in turn.
first,he contends our interpretation of paragraph conflicts with paragraph and schedule.as dow points out,paragraph provides that the rights of the parties enumerated in schedule are s ubject to all of the foregoing rights and provisions,subject to the rights of the parties enumerated in schedules,and.dow also observes that paragraph provides that all allotments set forth in said schedule,which are within the same priority class,are equal in priority and corelative in right.finally,dow points out that schedule itself bears the title,allocations to various water users from susan river stream system subject to allocations set forth in schedules,and.in his view,all of these provisions serve to establish that schedule first class priority rights are inferior to rights under schedules,and,and equal to other schedule first class priority rights,and therefore our interpretation of the exception in paragraph as giving altered priority to the irrigation company rights under schedule creates a conflict in the decree.
this is not so,however,because,as even dow has recognized,paragraph provides that the rights of the parties enumerated in schedule are s ubject to all of the foregoing rights and provisions.among those rights and provisions are those set out in paragraph.thus,paragraph and schedule are expressly subject to whatever altered priority paragraph creates for the irrigation company rights,and therefore there is no conflict.
with respect to the decree structure and schedules overall,dow contends our interpretation of t he decree altered priority is inconsistent with the numbered schedules and the priorities established between those schedules.in effect,however,this argument adds nothing to dow previous argument.inasmuch as all of the paragraphs describing the interrelated rights under the schedules begin with the phrase s ubject to all of the foregoing rights and provisions,all of those interrelated rights are subject to the provisions of paragraph,and whatever altered priority those provisions may impose.
pointing to paragraph,however,dow contends that our interpretation of paragraph creates a conflict that can not be reconciled like those we have just discussed because paragraph does not begin with the same phrase.paragraph of the decree provides in pertinent part that a ll rights in first priority class hereinafter set forth in schedule are superior in priority and in right to all other rights set forth in said schedules and all rights in second priority class hereinafter set forth in said schedule are subject and inferior to said rights in first priority class set forth in said schedule,but are superior in priority and in right to all other rights set forth in said schedules and and all rights in third priority class hereinafter set forth in said schedule are
