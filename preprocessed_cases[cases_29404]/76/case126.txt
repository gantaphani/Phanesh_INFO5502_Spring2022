the bwcaw was one of the first wilderness areas recognized under the wilderness act of.note.as the largest wilderness area east of the rocky mountains and north of everglades national park,it comprises approximately acres of forest land encompassing over lakes connected by several hundred miles of streams and rivers.see minnesota block,cir.it provides habitat for hundreds of species,including the gray wolf,pine marten,bald eagle,black bear,moose,and lynx.
the wilderness act generally prohibits all motorboat use within wilderness areas protected by the act.however,the bwcaw was excepted from this general prohibition insofar as established motorboat use within the bwcaw and other motorboat use not undermining the ability to maintain the primitive character of the area were permitted.d.in,however,congress reconsidered the bwcaw exception to the wilderness act.i n reaction to threatened deterioration of the wilderness from excessive use,congress enacted the boundary waters canoe area wilderness act,stat.bwcaw act.see also block,at.
the bwcaw act prohibited all motorboat use within the bwcaw except on specifically enumerated lakes comprising approximately of its waters the motorboat use allowed by the bwcaw act is circumscribed the secretary of agriculture is directed to establish motorboat quotas restricting use to less than or equal to the average actual annual motorboat use of the calendar years,and.bwcaw act f the quota levels are based on such criteria as the size and configuration of each lake,and the amount of use on that lake.id.in determining the average actual annual motorboat use,motorboat use by lake homeowners and their guests and resort owners and their guests on that particular lake is not counted.id.
the bwcaw act was passed to ensure the bwcaw wilderness character would be preserved.see block,at congress passed the bwcaw act with the clear intent of insuring that the area would remain as a wilderness and could be enjoyed as such.limiting motorboat use is integral to preserving the wilderness values and primitive character of the area.see united states gotchnik,d,aff,cir.
in,the usfs initially calculated the average actual annual motorboat use.in doing so,the usfs considered computer data and analyses,wilderness permit data,records of motorboat use during,public comments,and interviews.for three chains of moose lake chain,the saganaga lake chain,and the farm lake usfs deemed use by home and resort owners as well as their guests within the lake chain encompassing their property to be exempt from the base period use calculation.the usfs determined the moose lake chain encompassed moose,sucker,newfound,and birch lakes the saganaga lake chain included saganaga lake,seagull river,and gull lake and the farm lake chain included white iron,farm,garden,and south farm lakes accordingly,the usfs concluded motorboat use by homeowners,resort owners,and their guests did not affect the base period use calculation or quota system and did not require permits when such use was limited to their lake chain.the usfs calculated the base period day opposed to overnight day trips for the bwcaw.the base period use calculated for the three lake chains at issue was day trips 
in,the usfs determined allowing motorboat use to the maximum extent possible under the statute was strain ing the wilderness environment and was tending to degrade the intended primitive and unconfined recreation experience of the bwcaw.it therefore established the boundary waters canoe area wilderness management plan and implementation schedule of bwca plan to set the motorboat quotas at approximately percent of the base period use calculation.the motorboat permit quota was set at permits for the entire bwcaw.the permit quota for the three lake chains was set at permits one permit can accommodate a group of up to four boats or multiple trips in one day.admin.exh,at.
in,this court concluded the usfs interpretation that homeowner,resort,and guest lake chain use did not require a permit was contrary to the plain language of the bwcaw act.friends of the boundary waters wilderness dombeck,cir.the court concluded the term particular lake in the bwcaw act did not mean a lake chain but referred to each lake.id.accordingly,dombeck held use by homeowners,resort owners,and their guests is exempted from a permit requirement only when such use is limited to the lake adjoining the owners properties.use on any other lake requires a permit 
because the usfs did not include homeowner,resort,or guest lake chain use when initially calculating the base period use,the quotas established by the usfs did not account for lake chain use.given the fixed quotas,the dombeck ruling increased demand for permits as homeowners,resorts,and guests were required to obtain permits for lake chain use.in,the usfs responded to this increased demand by recalculating the base period use and correlated quotas to include lake chain use.the recalculated base period use figures for the entire bwcaw establish a maximum quota of permits the usfs applied the bwca plan to establish quotas at percent of the recalculated base period use.accordingly,pursuant to the bwca plan,the recalculated total quota for the three lake chains at issue is permits 
friends challenged the recalculated base period use figure,arguing the usfs lacks authority to recalculate the base period use and the recalculation was arbitrary and capricious.friends also challenged usfs recalculated quotas as exceeding the base period use in violation of the bwcaw act.the district court agreed with friends,ruling at summary judgment the usfs was without authority to recalculate the base period use and the recalculation was arbitrary and capricious.the district court did not reach friends challenges to the quotas established by the usfs.

the usfs appeals the district court ruling it had no authority to recalculate the base period use.the usfs argues dombeck requires the usfs to recalculate the base period use to ensure congress intent in passing the bwcaw act is fulfilled.the usfs interprets the bwcaw act to give it the authority to correct a major error in its initial base period calculation made evident by a court ruling.friends argues dombeck does not require the usfs to recalculate the base period use and also argues that any recalculation of the base period use calculation effectively undermines the fixed nature of the quota maximum.
the usfs interpretation of dombeck is not entitled to deference.see ass of civilian technicians fed.labor rel,donovan,cir.we agree with friends dombeck does not mandate the usfs to recalculate the base period use,since its holding was limited to requiring a permit for homeowners and resorts when they engage in lake chain use.dombeck,at.however,our analysis does not end there.the usfs also interprets the bwcaw act as authorizing it to recalculate the base period use.accordingly,we must analyze this agency interpretation for reasonableness.
in determining whether to afford deference to the usfs interpretation of the bwcaw act,we must first determine whether the congressional intent is clear.specifically,we must determine whether congress intended the usfs to have the authority to recalculate the statutory cap based upon legal error.see chevron,at.
the bwcaw act prohibits the use of motorboats within the bwca except as specifically authorized by the act.bwcaw act c,stat.at.the act does not directly address whether the usfs has authority to recalculate the average actual annual motorboat use of the calendar years,and for each lake.we have not been directed to any legislative history materials directly addressing the issue.
agencies given the authority to promulgate a quota are presumed to have the authority to adjust that quota.see united gas improvement callery,d an agency,like a court,can undo what is wrongfully done by virtue of its order.see also regions hosp.shalala,d concluding an agency decision to recalculate a base amount in a fixed reimbursement system to prevent the distortion of future reimbursements was reasonable dun bradstreet.found.united states postal,cir it is widely accepted that an agency may,on its own initiative,reconsider its interim or even its final decisions,regardless of whether the applicable statute and agency regulations expressly provide for such review.
the bwcaw act creates a gap which must be filled by the usfs or,more precisely,by the secretary of agriculture the determination of the average actual motorboat use of the calendar years,and.the usfs is given no significant direction regarding this calculation.see dombeck,at.accordingly,the statute is silent on the issue and we must accord the usfs deference to its interpretation of the statute.
usfs interpretation that the bwcaw act allows it to recalculate the base period use to correct a major error made manifest by court opinion is reasonable and not contrary to the purposes of the bwcaw act.the usfs recalculated the base period use as a means of addressing the increased permit demand after the dombeck ruling.the purpose of the bwcaw act is to protect the wilderness values of the bwcaw while maintaining limited motorized access not inconsistent with those values.see dombeck,at.indeed,the purpose of the bwcaw act is to establish a maximum level of motorboat use based upon use patterns in.the usfs recalculation,if performed accurately,would not result in a base period use calculation higher than the average actual annual motorboat use of the calendar years,and.rather,if performed accurately,it would produce the actual use figure contemplated by the legislature in passing the bwcaw act.the usfs therefore acted reasonably and not contrary to the purposes of the statute when it recalculated the base period use to include uses previously excluded because of significant legal error made apparent by a court ruling.as such,the usfs reasonable interpretation must be upheld whether afforded deference under skidmore swift,or chevron.accordingly,the judgment of the district court as to the issue of the usfs authority to recalculate the base period use is reversed.
having determined the usfs has authority to recalculate the base period use to correct a significant legal error made manifest by court order,we now must determine whether the usfs recalculated the base period homeowner and resort use arbitrarily,capriciously,or in a manner contrary to its statutory authority.
the usfs claims the specific means of implementing motorboat use quotas is left to the discretion of the secretary.appellants reply at citing dombeck,at.the usfs also argues because t he methodology was tailored to the usfs knowledge of,and the best available information regarding,varying patterns of motorboat use within the three,that methodology is entitled to deference.appellants br.at.
while the methodology used by an agency is generally entitled to deference,this is only true where the methodology is not arbitrary,without foundation,or so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.see dombeck,at state farm mut.auto.ins,at.it is our view that some of the data relied upon and calculations performed by the usfs are so unreliable or inadequately explained as to make reliance on them arbitrary and capricious.
the usfs,in recalculating the base period use,sought to determine the amount of lake chain use.to do this,the usfs first estimated total homeowner and resort lake chain use.the usfs then estimated what percentage of such use was lake chain use.because the usfs relied upon different data and methodologies for each lake chain recalculation,we analyze the usfs calculations with respect to each lake chain separately.
we begin by analyzing the recalculated base period use on moose lake chain.we conclude the usfs recalculated the moose lake chain base period use in an arbitrary and capricious manner.
in calculating what percentage of use during the base period was lake chain use,the usfs relied upon deficient homeowner and resort owner surveys.the usfs acknowledges the surveys were not conducted in a statistically valid manner.however,it claims the surveys were adequate for the purposes for which they were used to supplement other data or to reduce use estimates from other data sources.accordingly,we must determine whether the usfs reliance upon the survey results was reasonable.we conclude it was not.
based upon aerial photographs from,the usfs concluded residences sixteen of which were resort residences or staff cabins existed on moose lake during the base period.the survey data relied upon by the usfs was obtained from a survey completed by thirteen homeowners on moose lake.the usfs limited its survey to current owners of moose lake properties who maintained ownership since the base period.the survey respondents were aware the survey was related to the usfs recalculation of the base period use.the survey asked two questions of property owners.the survey asked of use how many days did you use your stickered motorized watercraft in the bwcaw on moose,sucker,and newfound lakes of use,the questionnaire asked what percentage of your motorized watercraft use in the bwcaw was for accessing basswood,birch,knife lakes only five of the thirteen survey respondents provided answers to the survey question pertaining to motorboat use.those responses varied greatly by individual.we conclude the survey design and implementation was so inadequate as to make any reliance upon the data obtained from the survey unreasonable.
to establish the trustworthiness of a survey,it must be shown that a proper universe was examined and a representative sample was chosen that the persons conducting the survey were experts that the data were properly gathered and accurately reported and that the sample design,the questionnaires,and interviewers,as well as the respondents,were unaware of the purpose of the survey.
lutheran mut.life ins.united states,cir.although mechanical application of these factors may not be appropriate in every case,see,we are of the opinion the uses to which the survey results were put by the usfs counsel in favor of a more trustworthy survey.
the design of the survey was flawed for a number of reasons.first,there is no record evidence the usfs considered various sample populations to determine which respondents,if any,would provide accurate and representative results.there is no record evidence the usfs contemplated surveying property owners during the base period who have since transferred title or conducting other surveys to obtain more robust survey data.given the significant variation in the survey responses,we find it unreasonable for the usfs to rely upon the responses of only five current homeowners without considering other means,including performing additional interviews or surveys,to validate the responses.although the usfs attempts to justify its reliance by suggesting its approach is similar to statistically valid surveys involving a small percentage of the total population,this argument lacks merit.there is a substantial difference between relying upon survey data results from thousands of responses and relying upon five responses.indeed,the usfs acknowledges its survey was not statistically valid.while this does not invalidate the possibility of using survey data,it cautions the agency to identify the potential weaknesses in the data and to seek validation of the results obtained through other means or to apply correction factors to the survey data.see menorah med.ctr.heckler,cir noting the failure to respond to criticisms that a survey was untrustworthy makes reliance upon the survey arbitrary and capricious see also james hosp.heckler,cir i t is an agency duty to establish the statistical validity of the evidence before it prior to reaching conclusions based upon that evidence.
second,neither basswood nor knife lake was considered part of the moose lake chain in the usfs initial base period calculation the lakes had their own quotas.birch lake is considered part of moose lake,but motorized access to birch lake ended in and the moose lake chain quota was reduced accordingly.accordingly,the percentage of motorized use on basswood,birch,and knife lakes is irrelevant to the recalculation of the base period use on the moose lake chain,as adjusted for closures to motorized access pursuant to the bwcaw act.nevertheless,based upon answers to the second question,the usfs concluded percent of bwcaw use was located outside the moose lake chain.this conclusion can not be reasonably drawn from the survey results because it is dependent upon an incorrect determination birch lake exists outside the moose lake chain.further,the question does not consider the possibility use occurred outside the moose lake chain to lakes other than basswood,birch,or knife.we therefore find the usfs conclusion that percent of bwcaw use by moose lake chain resort and home owners was outside the moose lake chain to be arbitrary and capricious.
similarly,the usfs correlated conclusion percent of bwcaw use by moose lake chain resort and home owners during the base period was within the moose lake chain must be.the conclusion is questionable because,assuming arguendo the accuracy of the figure,it may not be reasonable to conclude all use on the moose lake chain was lake chain use.the record evidence clearly establishes some moose lake chain homeowner use was limited to moose lake.exh,at.the usfs did reduce by percent its estimated actual use figure for the moose lake chain,but that reduction was based on survey results for use on bass,birchwood,and knife lakes,not based on use of moose lake only.thus,the usfs conclusion all use on the moose lake chain was lake chain use is unsupported by the record.
aside from the survey design flaws and the arbitrary conclusions resulting therefrom,the survey was also performed in a manner to make the results unreliable.in particular,we find it unreasonable to rely exclusively upon survey results,without analyzing the potential for bias or adjusting the data based upon any bias found,when the respondents are aware of the purpose of the survey see lutheran mut.life ins,at menorah med,at james,at.further,it is unreasonable to rely upon survey responses regarding behavior twenty years earlier without considering the possibility such responses are not wholly accurate and either applying correction factors to the responses determined to be less than wholly accurate or attempting to verify the responses through other means.we are especially troubled by the usfs complete reliance upon the survey data,without even studying the results for possible inaccuracies,in spite of the fact only five of the thirteen respondents answered the survey question regarding use patterns in.
we agree with the district court that o ne does not need to be a statistician to apprehend the numerous flaws in this sample.friends of the boundary waters wilderness bosworth,wl,at.sample size,potential for bias,interviewing techniques,reliability of extrapolating data,and poor recollection are all relevant factors the agency failed to properly consider in analyzing the survey results,making the resulting estimates arbitrary and capricious.we believe these survey deficiencies are so obvious the usfs should have considered the potential impact these deficiencies might have on the trustworthiness of the surveys.its failure to do so renders reliance upon the survey results arbitrary and capricious.see menorah med,at.further,the survey res
