section a of the endangered species act esa,codified at a,requires consultation with the secretary of the interior or secretary of commerce if there is any action authorized,funded,or carried out by a federal agency here,the bureau of land management blm that could jeopardize any endangered or threatened species,or destroy or adversely modify habitat of such species.this appeal presents the question of whether the blm failure to regulate certain vested held by private landowners to divert water for irrigation uses constitutes action authorized,funded,or carried out by the blm so as to require consultation.the district court required the blm to consult it found the blm had discretion to regulate the diversions and that its failure to exercise such discretion constituted action.we conclude that the duty to consult is triggered by affirmative actions because there was no such action here,there was no corresponding duty to consult.accordingly,we reverse.
background 
western watersheds project and committee for idaho high desert collectively,western watersheds filed this action in against the blm and its regional officials,as well as the fish and wildlife service fws,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief regarding hundreds of river and stream diversions,dams and pipes on public lands in the upper salmon river basin of central idaho western watersheds challenges the blm acquiescence in selected diversions for agricultural and other irrigation uses by private parties holding vested to divert water.it appears undisputed for purposes of this appeal that the diversions could jeopardize threatened species of fish.
only count four violation of section a of the esa of the first amended complaint against the blm is at issue on appeal the parties agreed to litigate a set of six diversions and focus on the legal issue of whether the blm has a duty to consult under section a.the state of idaho intervened and,along with the blm,is an appellant 
at issue are held by private parties to access and use water as recognized and acknowledged by the local customs,laws,and the decision of courts pursuant to the act of july,stat,codified at repealed in part,the act.section of the act also known as revised statute and provides in pertinent part as follows 
whenever,by priority of possession,rights to the use of water for mining,agricultural,manufacturing,or other purposes,have vested and accrued,and the same are recognized and acknowledged by the local customs,laws,and the decisions of courts,the possessors and owners of such vested rights shall be maintained and protected in the same and the right of way for the construction of ditches and canals for the purposes herein specified is acknowledged and confirmed 
all patents granted,or preemption or homesteads allowed,shall be subject to any vested and accrued water rights,or rights to ditches and reservoirs used in connection with such water rights,as may have been acquired under or recognized by this section.
id.emphasis added.
the act embraced a doctrine of prior appropriation and a general policy of deference to state and local law regarding water rights.see hunter united states,cir.

the effect of these acts is not limited to rights acquired before.they reach into the future as well,and approve and confirm the policy of appropriation for a beneficial use,as recognized by local rules and customs,and the legislation and judicial decisions of the states,as the test and measure of private rights in and to the nonnavigable waters on the public domain.hunter,at quoting power beaver portland cement.that is,could be acquired well after and.see,grindstone butte project kleppe,cir discussing irrigation approved in under the act adams united states,cir affirming district court holding that landowners possessed vested water under the act,which were asserted in to.
the six diversions at issue here are on three streams or rivers in central idaho two on big timber creek,three on the pahsimeroi river,and one on mahogany creek.the big timber creek diversions are a pipe diversion and a carey act diversion.the pipe diversion was established under the act.the carey act diversion was apparently established under the act.the three diversions on the pahsimeroi river were vested under the act.the diversion on mahogany creek is also from the act.so,of the six diversions,five were acquired under the act and one under the act.the district court assumed the diversions were act for purposes of making its legal rulings 
in,congress changed the statutory regime regarding by enacting the federal land policy management act flpma.effective october,the flpma replaced a tangled array of laws granting across federal lands,with a single method for establishing a over public lands.united states jenks,cir.most important for present purposes,however,congress specifically chose to preserve vested rights such as those under the and acts.section a of the flpma provides 
nothing in this subchapter shall have the effect of terminating any or issued,granted,or permitted.however,with the consent of the holder thereof,the secretary concerned may cancel such a or and in its stead issue a pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter.
a.see also historical note a section of the flpma provided that nothing in this act,or in any amendment made by this act,shall be construed as terminating any valid lease,permit,patent,or other land use right or authorization existing on the date of approval of this act and h all actions by the secretary concerned under this act shall be subject to valid existing rights.
in turn,the blm issued a policy statement in declaring that ditches and canals constructed on public lands on or before october,under the authority of the act will be recognized as an authorized use of the public land and no further action is required by either the holder of the vested water right or the blm.it went on to guide that any construction activities taking place after passage of flpma that significantly alter the alignment or relocate the existing facility require a grant under title v of flpma.emphasis in original.
the blm promulgated consistent regulations in that provided 
grants issued on or before october.
a grant issued on or before october,pursuant to then existing statutory authority is covered by the provisions of this part unless administration of this part diminishes or reduces any rights conferred by the grant or the statute under which it was issued,in which event the provision of the grant or the then existing statute shall apply.
emphasis added.

b any substantial deviation in location or authorized use by the holder during construction,operation or maintenance shall be made only with prior approval of the authorized officer.
b emphasis added.
after the district court issued its decision,the blm completed major amendments to its regulations,effective june.see.april.among the many changes,the blm issued a new regulation regarding the scope of its authority,similar to section quoted above 
the regulations in this part apply to 
grants issued on or before october,under then existing statutory authority,unless application of these regulations would diminish or reduce any rights conferred by the original grant or the statute under which it was issued.where there would be a diminishment or reduction in any right,the grant or statute applies.
emphasis added.at.
the new regulations also replaced section b with a section requiring a holder to obtain blm approval before beginning a use or activity that requires a substantial deviation from the grant.b.at.it continues you must obtain blm approval before you begin any activity that is a substantial deviation.id.
another new statement specifies that the blm regulations do not apply to reservoirs,canals,and ditches constructed under the authority of section of the act.b.at.the blm did this to clarify that the regulations do not apply to existing rights for private reservoirs,ditches,and canals established prior to flpma under the mining act of july.we think this clarification will be helpful in eliminating any confusion associated with the previous regulatory language found in former section.at.in so doing,it gave the following rationale 
this final rule therefore reflects law and blm historical practice by clarifying that act are not subject to regulation so long as a is being operated and maintained in accordance with the scope of the original rights granted.because under the act are perpetual and do not require renewal,no authorization under flpma exists or is required in the future.therefore,unless a holder undertakes activities that will result in a substantial deviation in the location of the ditch or canal,or a substantial deviation in the authorized use,no opportunity exists for blm to step in and regulate a by imposing terms and conditions on the operation and maintenance.simply stated,there is no current blm authorization to which such terms and conditions could be attached.therefore,title v of flpma and blm regulations do not apply to these.
this does not mean,however,that blm can not take action to protect the public lands when a holder of an act undertakes activities that are inconsistent with the original.in such a situation,if the holder does not approach blm for a flpma permit authorizing such activities,flpma and blm trespass regulations provide blm with the discretion to take an enforcement action against the holder.
section a of the esa requires a federal agency to initiate consultation as follows 
each federal agency shall,in consultation with and with the assistance of the secretary,insure that any action authorized,funded,or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat of such species.
a emphasis added.
in turn,fws and nmfs national marine fisheries service regulations provide 
action means all activities or programs of any kind authorized,funded,or carried out,in whole or in part,by federal agencies in the united states or upon the high seas.examples include,but are not limited to a actions intended to conserve listed species or their habitat b the promulgation of regulations c the granting of licences,contracts,leases,easements,permits,or or d actions directly or indirectly causing modifications to the land,water,or air.
in particular,a regulation states that section and the requirements of this part apply to all actions in which there is discretionary federal involvement or control.emphasis added.
after narrowing the scope of the litigation by designating the six diversions,the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court ruled in favor of western watersheds,determining that the blm had discretion to impose conditions on the diversions.it concluded that the esa requires the blm to consult with the appropriate federal fish and wildlife agency over its decision not to impose conditions on certain water diversions.the court gave the term action in section a an expansive definition,and found an agency decision to ignore actions by others to be such action.it reasoned 
there is no principled distinction between a blm decision to operate diversions across its lands that may affect bull trout a blm decision to award a permit to a rancher who operates diversions across public lands that may affect bull trout and a blm decision to ignore a rancher who operates diversions across public lands that may affect bull trout.
the district court also found the blm regulations and instruction memorandum to constitute a continuing agency decision not to impose conditions on diversions arising under the act of.in so holding,the court reasoned that the blm had discretion to impose conditions on diversions arising under the act.such discretion meant that section a applied under section and the requirements of this part apply to all actions in which there is discretionary federal involvement or control.not only was the blm required to consult under the esa,the court went on to conclude the blm failed to perform a mandatory duty and could be compelled to perform it under the administrative procedure act apa.
that is,the district court found the required action in the blm continued application of the blm regulatory interpretations made some years requiring a substantial deviation in either location or intended use by the private users,before regulatory power arose the district court reasoned that the blm could have chosen to regulate the at issue,and thus had discretionary federal involvement.it found the blm acted either by not exercising its residual discretion to regulate the,or by continuing to follow the restrictive regulations themselves.
following the grant of partial summary judgment in favor of western watersheds,the court entered an injunction ordering the blm to initiate consultation within days for three of the diversions,and within days for the remaining diversions.the blm and intervenor state of idaho timely appealed from this injunction under a.

discussion 
the appeal turns on whether the blm failure to exercise any discretion it might have had to regulate the diversions at issue in this appeal constitutes a blm action that authorizes,funds,or carries out the diversions.the question is whether such a failure to exercise discretion assuming the blm had discretion is an agency action for purposes of section a,so as to require consultation.
our answer is no.we start with the plain language of section a,which refers to agency action as any action authorized,funded,or carried out by such agency.of particular significance is the affirmative nature of these words authorized,funded,carried and the absence of a failure to act from this list.this stands in marked contrast to other sections of the esa,which explicitly refer to an agency failure to act.see,g c authorizing citizen suits where there is alleged a failure of the secretary to perform any act or duty which is not discretionary.emphasis added 
both sides look to the esa regulations for support.the regulations define action to mean all activities or programs of any kind authorized,funded,or carried out,in whole or in part,by federal agencies in the united states.emphasis added.western watersheds emphasizes of any kind and argues that a decision not to regulate fits such broad language.in response,the blm points to the examples given in the regulation,which are,the promulgation of regulations and the granting of.id.
although the term agency action is to be construed broadly,see natural res.def.council houston,cir,ninth circuit cases have emphasized that section a consultation stems only from affirmative actions.this point was recently reiterated in defenders of wildlife epa,cir.defenders of wildlife repeatedly emphasized that section a consultation stems from affirmative actions only.it found a duty to consult under section a in an epa decision to approve a transfer of a clean water act permitting program from federal to state control.most important for present purposes,the opinion studied section a,analyzed ninth circuit case law,and emphasized over and over that action under section a must be affirmative.id.at section a specifies that ag
