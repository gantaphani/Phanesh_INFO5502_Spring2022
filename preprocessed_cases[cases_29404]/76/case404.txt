introduction 
appellants,the owners of two parcels of property in contra costa county discovery bay community,filed suit against the respondent district,which had previously repaired a levee on the properties.via two separate orders,one relating to appellants initial complaint,and the second relating to its amended complaint,the superior court sustained demurrers to six of the seven causes of action alleged by appellants without leave to amend.it also sustained the district demurrer to another cause of action alleged in appellants amended complaint,albeit with leave to amend.appellants opted not to amend their complaint,instead dismissing it with prejudice.appellants appeal,contending the trial court was incorrect in the legal bases upon which it sustained,without leave to amend,the district demurrers to its six causes of action.they also appeal from the trial court order granting special demurrers and a motion to strike filed by the district.we shall affirm the judgment of dismissal.
ii.factual and procedural background 
as noted,appellants,as trustees of the tilton family trust,are the owners of two residences and parcels built on an urban levee,which lies within the jurisdictional boundaries of respondent district the district was alleged to be a reclamation district formed pursuant to water code section et,a governmental entity located in contra costa county,and pursuant to water code section,responsible for supervising the maintenance and operation of reclamation works within its boundaries.
in june,appellants allegedly learned from a report prepared by the district engineer that,in and either or,there had been failures in the levee underlying the property,failures that had caused damage to the property.they also alleged that in,the levee on the lots failed again,causing further damage to them.appellants alleged that the failure was due to improper maintenance of the levee by the district,and that both the and failures were caused either by riprap placed on top of the levees which caused instability therein the failure of the district to properly stabilize the levee after the earlier failures.appellants alleged that,as a result of these three failures,the rear of the homes on the two lots are pulling away from the structures and that the structures themselves have become and there is fear that the lots are slowly sliding into the bay.
in september,appellants submitted a claim for damages allegedly owing from the district pursuant to the tort claims act,government code section et.the district denied the claim in may.in november,appellants filed their first complaint against the district it consisted of seven causes of action for inverse condemnation,negligence,trespass,nuisance,failure to provide lateral and subjacent support,maintaining public property in a dangerous condition,and a violation of united states code section.
the district demurred to all causes of action,and the issues raised thereby were fully briefed and argued to the trial court.on april,it sustained the district demurrer without leave to amend as to the inverse condemnation and section causes of action,but with leave to amend as to the remainder.four days later,appellants filed their amended complaint,this time realleging only the five causes of action as to which it was granted leave to amend,namely negligence,failure to provide lateral and subjacent support,nuisance,trespass,and dangerous condition on public property.they sought to recover an amount in excess of million.
the district again demurred and the issues raised were again fully briefed and argued to the trial court.on july,that court sustained the general demurrer without leave to amend as to the first four causes of action on the ground that the appellants had failed to plead a statutory basis for the district liability under government code section,that none of the statutes alleged by appellants imposed a mandatory duty upon the district.as to appellants fifth cause of action,the trial court sustained the district demurrer,but this time with leave to amend.it also granted a motion to strike filed by the district.in so doing,it ruled that appellants had failed to comply with code of civil procedure section regarding their damage claim,appellants had failed to indicate the amounts of general and special damages being sought,and to the extent appellants were seeking damages for the alleged and damage to their lots,the claim was barred by the statute of limitations set forth in government code section because of appellants failure to plead facts showing their inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence.
on august,appellants filed a request for dismissal of their fifth cause of action with prejudice,which request was granted on august.on august,a judgment of dismissal of the entire action was entered in favor of the district,with the district being awarded its costs.appellants filed a notice of appeal on october.
iii.discussion 
in reviewing a lower court ruling sustaining a demurrer,our standard of review is,of course,de novo.as our supreme court has recently held when reviewing a judgment dismissing a complaint after the granting of a demurrer without leave to amend,courts must assume the truth of the complaint properly pleaded or implied factual allegations.citation.courts must also consider judicially noticed matters.citation.in addition,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and read it in context.citation.if the trial court has sustained the demurer,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to state a cause of action.if the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,as here,we must decide whether there is a reasonable possibility the plaintiff could cure the defect with an amendment.citation.if we find that an amendment could cure the defect,we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion and we reverse if not,no abuse of discretion has occurred.citation.the plaintiff has the burden of proving that an amendment would cure the defect.citation.schifando city of los angeles cal th,d.
a.the demurrer was properly sustained to appellants two taking causes of action.
in their briefs,the parties first discuss the correctness of the trial court ruling sustaining the district demurrers,without leave to amend,to the causes of action for inverse condemnation and the alleged violation of united states code section set forth in appellants initial complaint we will follow the parties lead and address that issue first,also.and,as they do,we will deal with those causes of action in tandem because,as appellants pled in their initial complaint,the basis of the section action was alleged to be that the district failure to properly maintain the levee upon which appellant property is located constitutes a taking in violation of section.this is substantively the same allegation appellant made in its inverse condemnation cause of action in the same initial complaint.
we agree with the trial court that,as pled,these causes of action fail to state a claim in either inverse condemnation or for a taking of private property for a public use.this conclusion derives,at least in part,from our supreme court decision in customer city of sacramento cal th,d,customer.in that case,the court held that the defendant city of sacramento could not be liable in inverse condemnation for allegedly extensive property damage caused to a grocery and liquor store when the police fired tear gas into the store in an effort to capture an apparently armed and dangerous felony suspect.id.at,d.in the course of so holding,the court discussed extensively the breadth and limits of the inverse condemnation principle.the decision especially addressed the impact of the term or damaged as used in the opening sentence of article i,section,of the california constitution private property may be taken or damaged for public use only when just compensation,ascertained by a jury unless waived,has first been paid to,or into court for,the owner.cal,art.i,emphasis added.in an extended opinion by justice george,the court effectively held that the addition of the term or damaged to the former just compensation provision of the constitution was not intended to expand the scope of the constitutional compensation provision beyond the ambit of eminent domain and public improvements.it appears,instead,that the words or damaged were added to clarify that the government was obligated to pay just compensation for property damaged in connection with the construction of public improvements,even if the government had not physically invaded the damaged property.customer,supra,cal th at,d,emphasis added.
in support of this interpretation of the amendment,the court stated it seems apparent that the addition of the words or damaged to the constitution was intended to clarify that application of the just compensation provision is not limited to physical invasions of property taken for public use in eminent domain,but also encompasses special and direct damage to adjacent property resulting from the construction of public improvements.there is nothing that indicates the provision was intended to expand compensation outside the traditional realm of eminent domain customer,supra,cal th at,d.
in further support of this interpretation,the court proceeded to cite and discuss numerous consistent precedents both of its own and of the courts of appeal.among them was house county flood control dist.cal d,which the customer court summarized as holding that damage caused by the design of a public project gave rise to an inverse condemnation action customer,supra,cal th at,d.but that court then went on to quote,and indeed emphasize,the concurring opinion of traynor that t he destruction or damaging of property is sufficiently connected with public use as required by the constitution,if the injury is a result of dangers inherent in the construction of the public improvement as distinguished from dangers arising from the negligent operation of the improvement.id.at,d.
next,the court discussed bauer county of ventura cal d,bauer,where the court,while allowing the property owners to recover for damage caused by floodwaters diverted onto their property by a public watercourse and drainage system,took pains to carefully limit that principle in a sentence also emphasized in the customer opinion damage resulting from negligence in the routine operation having no relation to the function of the project as conceived is not within the scope of the rule applied in the present case.customer,supra,cal th at,d.
but perhaps the closest case factually to the present one cited approvingly by the customer court see customer,supra,cal th at,d,is hayashi alameda county flood control d,hayashi,a case authored by justice raymond peters of division one of this court.in that case,the plaintiffs greenhouse and suffered substantial damage when the levee maintained by the defendant flood control district along alameda creek suffered a break in december.the plaintiffs notified the defendant district of the break and the threat of damage,but no repairs were made,with the result that water and debris carried by the water damaged the plaintiffs property twice in january.the plaintiffs sued for both negligence and inverse condemnation.although the appellate court sustained their negligence count under the law then applicable to such counts,it held that the district had no liability to the plaintiffs under a theory of inverse condemnation,stating the most recent cases have made a distinction between negligence which occurs when a public agency is carrying out a deliberate plan with regard to the construction of public works,and negligence resulting in damage growing out of the operation and maintenance of public works.these cases hold that the damage resulting from the former type of negligence is compensable under article i,section,whereas damages resulting from the second type of negligence are not recoverable in an inverse condemnation proceeding,but are recoverable,if at all,only in a negligence action.citing bauer and other cases.it has been definitely held that a property owner may not recover in an inverse condemnation proceeding for damages caused by acts of carelessness or neglect on the part of a public agency.citation.in the present case the district did not cause the original break in the levee,nor is it charged that such occurred by reason of negligence.negligent design or construction is not charged,nor did the district deliberately divert the water onto the plaintiffs lands.it is charged with negligent failure to act thereafter,that is,with negligence in the operation and maintenance of its property.in our opinion that does not charge a taking of property for public use under the constitution.id.at.
a year after hayashi was decided,this court,in an opinion authored by justice murray draper,cited it approvingly in a similar case,kambish santa clara valley water conservation district d.kambish.there,the plaintiff land and personalty id.at.were damaged by flooding from overflows of los alamitos creek.those overflows resulted from heavy rains in december,rains that caused the almaden dam reservoir to fill up quickly and send a large volume of water down its spillway,into the creek,and thence some onto plaintiff property.a lower court had found liability by the defendant district based solely on inverse condemnation,but this court disagreed.citing both bauer and hayashi,we held damage resulting from negligence in routine operation having no relation to the function of the project as conceived is not a taking for public use and thus not a basis for inverse condemnation.id.at.
more recently,in a case also involving damage to real property from water overflowing from city streets,a division of the second district held to the same effect i nverse condemnation does not involve ordinary acts of carelessness in the carrying out of the public entity program.citations.property is only deemed taken or damaged for a public use if the injury is a necessary consequence of the public project.sheffet county of los angeles d.sheffet,emphasis added.
appellants argue that two cases decided by courts of appeal since customer clarify that defective maintenance of flood control or water retention systems can indeed provide a valid legal basis for an action for inverse condemnation.the cases they rely upon are arreola county of monterey th,d arreola and paterno state of california th,d paterno.the first,arreola,involved the failure of the pajaro river levee on the river forming the boundary between monterey and santa cruz counties.paterno involved the failure of the linda levee in yuba county,at the confluence of the yuba and feather rivers.in both cases,the courts of appeal agreed that the defendants or at least one of them was liable in inverse condemnation for their respective failures.but both opinions,although not citing customer,are entirely consistent with the principles laid down in that case as well as the rulings in hayashi,kambish and sheffet.
this is particularly true of the arreola decision,which not only cites hayashi but carefully distinguishes the fact situation there,a defendant charged with merely routine maintenance of a levee,from a defendant which designed,constructed and was thereafter charged with implementing a plan for its maintenance.that opinion states a public entity maintenance of a public improvement constitutes the constitutionally required public use so long as it is the entity deliberate act to undertake the particular plan or manner of maintenance.citing bauer.the necessary finding is that the wrongful act be part of the deliberate design,construction,or maintenance of the public improvement.the fundamental justification for inverse liability is that the government,acting in furtherance of public objectives,is taking a calculated risk that private property may be damaged.citations.that is why simple negligence can not support the constitutional claim.for example,in hayashi supra,d,the appellate court held that the plaintiffs had not stated a cause of action for inverse condemnation because,although the defendant failure to repair a levee within to days was negligence,it was not a deliberate plan with regard to the construction of public works.id.at.that is not to say that the later characterization of a public agency deliberate action as negligence automatically removes the action from the scope of the constitutional requirement for just compensation.so long as the entity has made the deliberate calculated decision to proceed with a course of conduct,in spite of a known risk,just compensation will be owed we conclude that in order to prove the type of governmental conduct that will support liability in inverse condemnation it is enough to show that the entity was aware of the risk posed by its public improvement and deliberately chose a course of the face of that known risk.arreola,supra,th at,d.
similarly,in paterno,justice morrison,writing for a panel of the third district,summarized that court holding as follows w e conclude paterno damages were directly caused by an unreasonable state plan which resulted in the failure of the linda levee and the state is liable to pay for paterno damages.in large part our conclusion is based on the fact that the levee system benefited all of california and saved billions of dollars,and to require paterno to bear the cost of the partial failure of that failure caused by construction and operation of an unstable violate locklin city of lafayette cal th,d.a basic part of the state flood plan was to accept existing levees as much as possible,to reduce the cost of an extensive,coordinated,flood control system.the people benefited from that feature.however,the record shows the state never tested the linda levee,or reviewed the records of its construction,to see if it was as strong as the global plans assumed it was,and the state even ignored specific warnings about the levee weaknesses.in such circumstance,the costs of the levee failure must be deemed part of the deferred costs of the project.paterno,supra,th at,d,emphasis added.
both arreola and paterno are thus entirely consistent with the principle articulated by justice george in customer,by justice peters in hayashi,and by this court in kambish,that,although there may be liability in inverse condemnation where levee failures are integrally connected with a flawed plan for those levees flawed construction,there is no such liability where similar failures are the result of negligent or inadequate operation and maintenance 
unfortunately for appellants,their initial complaint in this case the only pleading raising the taking issue puts them on the wrong side of that line.all they ever pled on the issue of the district involvement with maintenance of the levee were rather standard and perfunctory allegations that defendant is responsible for the maintenance of the levee,the failure was due to defendant maintaining the levee in a manner such that it was too steep for underwater conditions,defendants substantially participated in the maintenance of the levee upon which plaintiffs property is located and that such participation was for the use benefit of the public,and p laintiffs are further informed and believe that plaintiffs have been damaged as a direct and proximate result of defendants failure to properly maintain the levee.
these allegations do not meet the test we derive from the precedents just discussed,that garden variety inadequate maintenance,as distinguished from a faulty plan involving the design,construction and maintenance of a levee,is not an adequate basis for an inverse condemnation claim.moreover,our examination of the record of the pleadings filed in the first round of demurrers,when this issue was addressed and determined by the trial court,reveals no suggestion by appellants that it could allege anything regarding the district involvement in any underlying flawed plan for the maintenance of the levee in question.nor do appellants make any such suggestion in their briefs to us.
appellant failed to allege the required mandatory duty.
which brings us to the trial court grant of the district demurrer,without leave to amend,as to four tort causes of action pled again in appellants amended complaint,namely those for negligence,nuisance,trespass,and failure to provide lateral and subjacent support.as noted above,the trial court sustained the district demurrer without leave to amend as to these causes of action because,it held,as a matter of law the district was not under a mandatory duty to prevent leakage of its levees.
the whole concept of mandatory duty had its genesis in the adoption by the legislature of the tort claims act,government code section et section of that law provides in pertinent part except as otherwise provided by statute a a public entity is not liable for an injury,whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other person.
section then follows with this critical language where a public entity is under a mandatory duty imposed by an enactment that is designed to protect against the risk of a particular kind of injury,the public entity is liable for an injury of that kind proximately caused by its failure to discharge the duty unless the public entity establishes that it exercised reasonable diligence to discharge the duty.
the entire crux of the parties arguments to us regarding the trial court sustaining of the district demurrer to the four tort causes of action of appellants amended complaint focuses on whether the california legislature,or any other pertinent body,has imposed by an enactment a mandatory duty upon bodies such as the district to avoid leakage or similar failures of their levees.but,before getting into those specifics,some background on the current state of the law regarding when a mandatory duty is and is not found to have been imposed is pertinent.
our supreme court recently focused on this issue in haggis city of los angeles cal th,d.haggis there,a majority of the court found that,mainly because of the mandatory duty requirement of section,the city was not liable to a homeowner for damages he suffered after purchasing a developed piece of property on unstable land.id.at,d.the court summarized the applicable tests under that statute as follows first and foremost,application of section requires that the enactment at issue be obligatory,rather than merely discretionary or permissive,in its directions to the public entity it must require,rather than merely authorize or permit,that a particular action be taken or not taken.citation.it is not enough,moreover,that the public entity or officer have been under an obligation to perform a function if the function itself involves the exercise of discretion.citation.whether an enactment creates a mandatory duty is a question of law whether a particular statute is intended to impose a mandatory duty,rather than a mere obligation to perform a discretionary function,is a question of statutory interpretation for the courts.citation.the enactment language is,of course,a most important guide in determining legislative intent,but there are unquestionably instances in which other factors will indicate that apparent obligatory language was not intended to foreclose a governmental entity or officer exercise of discretion.citation.second,but equally important,section requires that the mandatory duty be designed to protect against the particular kind of injury the plaintiff suffered.the plaintiff must show the injury is one of the consequences which the enacting body sought to prevent through imposing the alleged mandatory duty.citation.our inquiry in this regard goes to the legislative purpose of imposing the duty.that the enactment confers some benefit on the class to which plaintiff belongs is not enough if the benefit is incidental to the enactment protective purpose,the enactment can not serve as a predicate for liability under section.citation.id.at,d,see also,to substantially the same effect,creason department of health services cal th,d,nunn state of california cal d,macdonald state of california d.clausing san francisco unified school dist.d.
appellants do not contend that any state or federal statute imposes the requisite mandatory duty in this case.indeed,in their reply brief,they expressly disclaim any argument that water code sections or create any mandatory duty on the part o
