in two separate actions,city of burbank and city of los angeles challenged effluent limitations in wastewater discharge permits issued by california regional water quality control board for the los angeles region regional board.the trial court set aside the permits and directed regional board to issue new permits in accordance with certain instructions.regional board and state water resources control board state board collectively water boards appeal the judgments,contending that some of the instructions do not comply with the federal clean water act or the state water quality control act.
we conclude that effluent limitations in the permits must ensure compliance with state water quality standards,and that in establishing permit effluent limitations regional board need not consider the economic burden imposed on the discharger or weigh the cost of compliance against the environmental benefits.we find that title united states code section b c did not sunset in and continues to be good law.we also conclude that some of the other requirements imposed by the trial court are erroneous.
burbank and los angeles appeal postjudgment orders denying their motions for attorney fees under code of civil procedure section.we dismiss the appeals as moot.in the interest of judicial economy and to guide the trial court on remand,however,we address the principal legal issue presented in the appeals.we conclude that a public entity can recover attorney fees under the statute only if the public entity litigation costs are disproportionate to the public entity interests at stake.
factual and procedural background 
burbank owns and operates a publicly owned treatment works called the burbank water reclamation plant,which treats wastewater from municipal sources.some of the treated wastewater is discharged to the burbank western wash,which drains into the los angeles river,a water of the united states.
los angeles owns and operates a publicly owned treatment works called the donald tillman water reclamation plant and jointly owns,together with city of glendale,a publicly owned treatment works called the los water reclamation plant.both plants treat wastewater from municipal sources and discharge some of the treated wastewater into the los angeles river.
regional board issued a permit in july governing wastewater discharge from the burbank plant.the permit,designated order and npdes permit,imposes numerical effluent limitations on the discharge of certain pollutants,in addition to other restrictions.regional board issued a separate time schedule order in september allowing delayed compliance with certain effluent limitations and establishing interim limitations.
regional board also issued permits in july governing wastewater discharge from the two los angeles plants.the permits,designated orders and and npdes permits and,impose numerical effluent limitations on the discharge of certain pollutants,in addition to other restrictions.regional board issued separate time schedule orders in september allowing delayed compliance with certain effluent limitations and establishing interim limitations.
burbank and los angeles both appealed to state board to review the permits and time schedule orders.state board declined review.
burbank filed a petition for writ of mandate in the superior court in december challenging certain permit provisions,and filed an amended petition in march.los angeles filed a petition for writ of mandate in the superior court in december and filed an amended petition in january.the superior court granted the petitions and entered judgments setting aside the permits and directing regional board to issue new permits in accordance with the court statements of decision.
the superior court stated in the statements of decision that in establishing effluent limitations for a permit,regional board must consider the economic cost of compliance with those limitations.the superior court stated further that the cost of compliance must be reasonable in light of the environmental benefit.the superior court concluded that in establishing effluent limitations,regional board must consider potential environmental impacts,alternatives to the proposed requirements,and mitigation measures for any requirements adopted that the schedule of compliance must be part of the permit rather than a separate order and that the narrative toxicity objective of regional board water quality control plan provides insufficient information as to how regional board will regulate discharges based on the narrative criteria,and therefore violates a federal regulation cfr a.the superior court also concluded that regional board must comply with rulemaking requirements of the administrative procedures act,et when imposing permit conditions to implement the narrative toxicity objective.
the trial court also sustained the petitions on the grounds that regional board failed to adequately show how numerical permit effluent limitations were derived from the narrative criteria that adequate findings and evidence in the administrative record do not support the effluent limitations that the permits improperly impose daily maximum limits rather than average weekly and average monthly limits and that the permits improperly specify the manner of compliance.water boards do not challenge this latter group of rulings on appeal and acknowledge that they must issue new permits in compliance with these rulings.
burbank and los angeles each moved for an award of attorney fees under code of civil procedure section.the trial court denied the motions on the ground that the cities litigation costs were not disproportionate to the cities pecuniary interests at stake,and on other grounds.
we have consolidated for oral argument and consideration in one opinion water board appeals from the two judgments and burbank and los angeles appeals from the orders denying attorney fees.
contentions 
water boards contend that effluent limitations imposed in the permits must be designed to attain water quality standards without regard to the economic cost of permit compliance,and regional board need not perform an individualized analysis to justify permit effluent limitations regional board need not consider potential environmental impacts,alternatives to the proposed requirements,and mitigation measures for any requirements adopted in establishing permit effluent limitations the permits can not allow delayed compliance with effluent limitations for certain pollutants the narrative toxicity objective of regional board water quality control plan provides sufficient information as to how regional board will regulate discharges based on the narrative criteria and that regional board need not comply with rulemaking requirements of the administrative procedures act when imposing permit conditions to implement the narrative toxicity objective.
burbank and los angeles dispute these contentions and contend that a public entity need not show that its litigation costs are disproportionate to its interests at stake in order to recover attorney fees under code of civil procedure section.
discussion 
clean water act 
the united states congress enacted the clean water act in as amendments to the federal water pollution control act et,stat.the federal water pollution control act now is commonly known as the clean water act.the objective of the clean water act is to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.a.to achieve this objective,the act establishes the national goal that the discharge of pollutants into the navigable waters be eliminated by,a.
the clean water act requires individual polluters to minimize effluent discharge.point sources,meaning pipes and other discrete conveyances from which pollutants may be discharged,are subject to effluent limitations,meaning restrictions on the discharge of pollutants.
the clean water act establishes standards for effluent limitations and authorizes the environmental protection agency epa to establish uniform effluent limitations consistent with the statutory standards for categories and classes of point sources.du pont de nemours train,d epa state water resources control board,d.the amendments stated that by july,effluent limitations must be set for point sources,other than publicly owned treatment works,that require application of the best practicable control technology currently available.b a.by the same date,effluent limitations for discharge into a publicly owned treatment works then in existence must comply with pretreatment requirements ibid,and effluent limitations for discharge by publicly owned treatment works then in existence must be based on secondary treatment id.b b 
the statute also states that by july,any more stringent limitation,including those necessary to meet water quality standards established pursuant to any state law or regulations under authority preserved by section of this title or any other federal law or regulation,shall be achieved b c.water quality standards generally state the permissible amounts of pollutants in a defined water segment.rodgers,environmental law air and water.water quality standards supplement effluent limitations so that numerous point sources,despite individual compliance with effluent limitations,may be further regulated to prevent water quality from falling below acceptable levels.citation.arkansas oklahoma,d.section b c expressly identifies the achievement of state water quality standards as one of the act central objectives.arkansas oklahoma,at.
the amendments also provided that water quality standards that were adopted by the states and approved by epa as required under the federal water pollution control act before the amendments continued to remain in effect.a.states must revise those water quality standards and submit them to epa for approval every three years,c.revised water quality standards must designate water uses and establish water quality criteria designed to protect those uses,c a.states must engage in a continuing planning process to implement the clean water act and revise water quality standards,e.states continue to have authority to adopt and enforce their own effluent limitations and water quality standards,provided that the state limitation or standard is no less stringent than the federal limitation or standard under the clean water act,pud of jefferson cty.washington of ecology,d.

water quality control act 
the california legislature enacted the water quality control act,et in stats,ch,stating,activities and factors which may affect the quality of the waters of the state shall be regulated to attain the highest water quality which is reasonable,considering all demands being made and to be made on those waters and the total values involved,beneficial and detrimental,economic and social,tangible and intangible.
the act states that state board and regional water quality control boards have the primary responsibility for water quality control.state board formulates statewide policy for water quality control.regional boards formulate water quality control plans for waters within each region.regional water quality control plans must be approved by state board.
a water quality control plan consists of water quality objectives designed to protect designated beneficial water uses and a program to achieve those objectives,subd.j.water quality objectives are standards that limit the levels of water quality constituents or characteristics,subd.h.water quality objectives must be designed to ensure the reasonable protection of beneficial uses and the prevention of nuisance however,it is recognized that it may be possible for the quality of water to be changed to some degree without unreasonably affecting beneficial uses.in establishing water quality objectives,a regional board must consider not only beneficial uses but also economic considerations,housing needs,and other factors.
regional boards issue waste discharge requirements,or permits,governing the discharge of waste.the permits must require compliance with the water quality control plan,subd.a.
the legislature amended the porter cologne act in to ensure consistency with the clean water act and to provide for california to administer the npdes permit program as contemplated by the clean water act,stats,ch,see b.water quality objectives and beneficial uses adopted and designated by regional boards in water quality control plans constitute water quality standards under the clean water act,and therefore must comply with the clean water act and be approved by epa.see,c a.permits issued by regional boards must ensure compliance with the clean water act together with any more stringent effluent standards or limitations necessary to implement water quality control plans,or for the protections of beneficial uses,or to prevent nuisance,accord,b c.water code section states that water code sections to prevail over any inconsistent provisions of the act.
regional board must consider economic costs when it establishes water quality standards but need not consider economic costs when it establishes effluent limitations in a permit 
contentions 
the trial court concluded that regional board must consider the economic cost of compliance with effluent limitations when establishing effluent limitations in a permit,and that the cost of compliance must be reasonable in light of the environmental benefit.water boards contend permit effluent limitations must be designed to attain water quality standards without regard to the economic cost of permit compliance,citing title united states code section b c,part d of the epa regulations d,and water code section.
burbank and los angeles contend that title united states code section b c required publicly owned treatment works to achieve effluent limitations based on water quality standards by july,but the statute does not apply after that date code of federal regulations part d does not apply to publicly owned treatment works because publicly owned treatment works are not subject to effluent limitations guidelines or standards under the clean water act construing section b c to provide and unrestrained authority to impose more stringent effluent limitations conflicts with other clean water act provisions that provide for more stringent effluent limitations section b c is preceded by an or in section b b,so section b c does not apply if effluent limitations comply with secondary treatment requirements under section b b congress intended for publicly owned treatment works to comply with pretreatment requirements rather than comply with stringent effluent limitations regional board was required to consider the economic impact of the waste treatment plan b e,and state board was required to report to epa concerning the economic impact of california compliance with the clean water act b d,but they failed to do so,so regional board should consider the economic impact of effluent limitations imposed in the permit other clean water act provisions,b also require consideration of economic costs and water code sections,and require regional board to consider the economic costs of permit compliance when establishing effluent limitations in the permit.
statutory and regulatory framework 
title united states code section b b states that publicly owned treatment works are subject to effluent limitations based on secondary treatment as defined by epa.section b and b c also states,in order to carry out the objective of this chapter there shall be achieved c not later than july,any more stringent limitation,including those necessary to meet water quality standards,treatment standards,or schedules of compliance,established pursuant to any state law or regulations under authority preserved by section of this title or any other federal law or regulation,or required to implement any applicable water quality standard established pursuant to this chapter.
thus,title united states code section b c provides that effluent limitations for publicly owned treatment works such as those at issue here must comply with water quality standards established under state or federal law and must do so not later than july.title united states code section a and states that an npdes permit issued by either epa or a state authorized to administer the permit program must ensure compliance with section and other clean water act provisions.neither section,section a,nor any of the other provisions referenced in section a states that the permitting authority can consider the economic cost of permit compliance when establishing effluent limitations in a permit or that a permit need not ensure compliance with water quality standards if compliance would cause an economic burden on the discharger.
part d of the epa regulations implementing the clean water act d states that an ndpes permit must ensure compliance with any requirements in addition to or more stringent than promulgated effluent limitations guidelines or standards under sections,and of cwa,necessary to achieve water quality standards established under section of the cwa,including state narrative criteria for water quality.thus,epa construes the clean water act to require effluent limitations in an ndpes permit to ensure compliance with water quality standards established by a state under title united states code section.the regulations do not state that the permitting authority can impose less stringent effluent limitations if effluent limitations that ensure compliance with water quality standards would cause an economic burden on the discharger.epa construction of a statutory scheme that it is entrusted to administer,expressed in epa rule,is entitled to considerable deference.chevron natural res.def.council,d.
water code section states that a permit issued by a regional water quality control board must ensure compliance with the clean water act together with any more stringent effluent standards or limitations necessary to implement water quality control plans,or for the protection of beneficial uses,or to prevent nuisance.section does not state that a regional board can consider the economic cost of permit compliance when establishing effluent limitations in a permit or that a permit need not ensure compliance with water quality standards in a water quality control plan if compliance would cause an economic burden.
these authorities are consistent and compelling.these provisions do not contemplate relaxation of effluent limitations at the permit level.rather,effluent limitations in a permit must comply with effluent limitations established by epa and also must comply with any more stringent effluent limitations necessary to achieve water quality standards established by the state.
a regional water quality control board must consider economic costs and benefits and other factors when it establishes water quality standards.water quality standards therefore reflect economic considerations,including presumably whether the environmental benefits justify the costs of compliance.once a regional board establishes water quality standards reflecting an appropriate balance of the various factors,the regional board is not required to revisit those same considerations each time it establishes effluent limits in a permit.rather,a permit must implement and require compliance with the established,generally applicable state water quality standards economic costs are not a valid consideration at the permit level.ackels cir,see defenders of wildlife browner cir,opn.mod.
c.the cities arguments are unpersuasive 
title unites states code section b c is an integral part of a permitting authority continuing obligations under the clean water act and has been recognized as such in numerous opinions.see,pud of jefferson cty.washington of ecology,supra,at.fn.the act also allows states to impose more stringent water quality controls.see b c arkansas oklahoma,supra,at.epa state water resources control board,supra,at.ackels,supra,at american paper institute,see also rodgers,environmental law air and water,supra.the opinions cited by burbank united states steel train cir,state water control bd.train,affd.cir neither hold nor suggest that section b c is ineffective after july.
we construe the reference in part d of code of federal regulations to effluent limitations guidelines or standards to include not only guidelines for effluent limitations under title united states code section b and effluent standard s under section a,as burbank and los angeles maintain,but also applicable standards under other provisions cited in the regulation,including section d.part d refers to effluent limitations guidelines or standards under sections,and,not only those under sections and as burbank and los angeles construe the regulation.accordingly,we reject the argument that part d does not apply to publicly owned treatment works.
contrary to burbank and los angeles argument,the requirements that a state agency must consider economic costs in establishing both an areawide waste treatment management plan b e and a waste treatment system,a,b and that each state must report to the united states congress concerning the economic impact of achieving the objective of the clean water act,b d do not indicate that the permitting authority must consider the cost of compliance with effluent limitations when establishing effluent limitations in a permit.similarly,the requirement that a regional water quality control board must consider economic costs in establishing water quality standards of general application,subd.d does not indicate that the regional board must consider the economic burden on each individual discharger when establishing effluent limitations in a permit.
water code section lists several factors that a regional water quality control board must consider in establishing water quality objectives,water quality standards,including economic considerations,subd.d.water code section,subdivision a states that a permit shall implement any relevant water quality control plans that have been adopted,and shall take into consideration the beneficial uses to be protected,the water quality objectives reasonably required for that purpose,other waste discharges,the need to prevent nuisance,and the provisions of section.the trial court concluded that section,subdivision a requires regional board,when establishing effluent limitations in the permits,to consider anew the factors under section and the reasonableness of costs imposed on burbank and los angeles.
the trial court construction of water code section would render water quality standards established under section illusory and would multiply the burden imposed on the regional boards,because each discharger would be entitled to an individualized consideration of the various factors in order to establish water quality standards appropriate for each individual discharger.we reject this construction.we construe section,subdivision a to mean that permit requirements must implement established water quality standards and that in implementing water quality standards a regional board must consider the origin and purposes of those standards,that is,the factors previously considered under section in establishing the standards.those considerations can not mitigate or relieve a discharger from full compliance with water quality standards.to relieve a discharger from compliance with water quality standards would conflict with the state obligation under the clean water act to enforce water quality standards.b c,a.
our conclusion that regional board need not consider anew the factors listed in water code section when establishing effluent limitations in the permits is consistent with the statutory construction consistently applied by state board in administrative appeals.in these circumstances,an administrative agency construction of a statute that it is charged with enforcing is entitled to consideration and respect,although t he ultimate interpretation of a statute is a legal issue that we review de novo.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d.
burbank and los angeles other arguments are essentially policy arguments as to why publicly owned treatment works should not be subject to effluent limitations based on state water quality standards where those effluent limitations are more stringent than secondary treatment required by epa.we reject those arguments as inconsistent with the clean water act,as explained ante.
regional board is exempt from the eir requirement and need not consider matters that would be contained in an eir as required by the trial court 
trial court ruling 
burbank and los angeles alleged in their petitions for writ of mandate that permits issued by regional board did not comply with the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et in two ways by failing to adequately consider the potential environmental impacts of the wastewater treatment facilities that will be needed to comply with the effluent limitations and by failing to analyze alternatives to the effluent limitations and mitigation measures.
addressing the ceqa count,the trial court stated that water code section exempts regional board from the requirement to prepare an environmental impact report eir or negative declaration before issuing the permit,but regional board must consider environmental factors in issuing waste discharge permits.elsewhere in the statements of decision,discussing the factors listed in water code section,the court stated,the regional board was,thus,statutorily required to consider certain factors,including,economics,reasonably achievable water quality conditions,potential environmental impacts,alternatives to the proposed requirements,and mitigation measures for any requirements adopted.the administrative record does not contain any evidence demonstrating that the regional board took these factors into consideration when developing the contested effluent limits in the permits,or when adopting the water quality objectives upon which these effluent limits were based.italics added.
water code section lists several factors that a regional water quality control board must consider in establishing water quality objectives to ensure the reasonable protection of beneficial uses and the prevention of nuisance.ante,fn.potential environmental impacts,alternatives to the proposed requirements,and mitigation measures for any requirements adopted are not among the factors listed in the statute.by requiring regional board to consider these factors,the trial court incorporated ceqa requirements into the permit process.
contentions 
water boards contend regional board is exempt from ceqa compliance pursuant to water code section.burbank and los angeles contend section exempts regional board from compliance with only the requirement to prepare an eir and related documents,but does not excuse regional board from compliance with ceqa policy provisions,including the requirements to consider potential environmental impacts,alternatives to the proposed effluent limitations,and mitigation measures before issuing the permit.
water code section 
water code section states,neither the state board nor the regional boards shall be required to comply with the provisions of chapter commencing with section of division of the public resources code prior to the adoption of any waste discharge requirement,except requirements for new sources as defined in the federal water pollution control act or acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto.chapter of division of the public resources code encompasses sections through governing preparation of an eir for projects that state agencies propose to carry out or approve.
ceqa requirements 
ceqa declares several policies concerning environmental protection,including the policy that all public agencies responsible for regulating activities affecting the environment must give major consideration to preventing environmental damage.pub.resources code,subd.g.public resources code section states,it is the policy of the state that public agencies should not approve projects as proposed if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen the significant environmental effects of such projects,and that the procedures required by this division are intended to assist public agencies in systematically identifying both the significant effects of proposed projects and the feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures which will avoid or substantially lessen such significant effects.
procedurally,ceqa implements this policy mainly by requiring preparation of an eir.in order to achieve the objectives set forth in section,the legislature hereby finds and declares that the following policy shall apply to the use of environmental impact reports prepared pursuant to this division a the purpose of an environmental impact report is to identify the significant effects on the environment of a project,to identify alternatives to the project,and to indicate the manner in which those significant effects can be mitigated or avoided.pub.resources code.a public agency shows that it has considered the environmental consequences of its actions by certifying that it reviewed and considered the information in the eir before approving the project,subd.c guidelines,subd.a 
in addition to ceqa procedural requirements concerning preparation of an eir and related documents,ceqa also imposes a substantive mandate that a public agency can not approve a project if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures that have not been adopted that would substantially lessen the significant environmental effects identified in the eir.mountain lion foundation fish game com.cal th,d,citing pub.resources code.this substantive requirement depends on the contents of the eir.
public resources code section states that if significant environmental effects identified in the eir can not be avoided by project alterations,the public agency can not approve the project unless it finds that the project alternatives and mitigation measures identified in the eir are infeasible and that particular project benefits outweigh the adverse environmental effects,subds.a,b guidelines,subd.a,subd.b.public resources code section expressly states that these requirements are pursuant to the policy statement in public resources code sections and.
thus,public resources code sections,and all rely on the eir process in implementing the policy that public agencies should not approve projects as proposed if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen the significant environmental effects of such projects.ceqa also relies on the eir process in implementing the policy that public agencies responsible for regulating activities affecting the environment must give major consideration to preventing environmental damage,as discussed ante.see,subd.g,subd.c guidelines,subd.a.apart from the eir process and required findings relating to information disclosed in the eir,ceqa provides no other procedural mechanism or substantive mandate to implement these policies.
judicial review of a public agency consideration of significant environmental effects,alternatives to the project,and mitigation measures would be meaningless without a record showing the environmental effects,alternatives,and mitigation measures that the agency considered.the eir provides that record where an eir is required.the trial court conclusion that regional board failed to consider potential environmental impacts,alternatives to the proposed requirements,and mitigation measures is based on the absence of an eir,which was not required.
we conclude that water code section not only relieves regional board of the requirement to prepare an eir or cause an eir to be prepared pub.resources code,subd.a,but also relieves regional board of those ceqa obligations that ordinarily are satisfied through preparation and consideration of an eir,including the obligation to consider potential environmental impacts,project alternatives,and mitigation measures.regional board obligation in issuing an npdes permit is to ensure compliance with both secondary treatment requirements imposed by epa and state water quality standards,as stated ante.ceqa imposes no additional procedural or substantive requirements in these circumstances.
in light of our conclusion,we need not consider other questions raised by burbank and los angeles analysis,such as defining the project for ceqa purposes and whether a categorical exemption should apply.see pub.resources code,guidelines.
the permits can not contain a schedule of compliance for a pollutant unless a state law or regulation so authorizes 
the clean water act defines a schedule of compliance as a schedule of remedial measures including an enforceable sequence of actions or operations leading to compliance with an effluent limitation,other limitation,prohibition,or standard.a schedule of compliance may include interim effluent limitations designed to lead to compliance with effluent limitations.
the clean water act authorizes states to adopt plans that provide for schedules of compliance as part of their continuing planning process.e a,f.thus,a water quality control plan may provide for schedules of compliance.
title united states code section b c states that effluent limitations must ensure compliance with water quality standards or schedules of compliance,established pursuant to any state law or regulations or any other federal law or regulation effluent limitations in a permit that implement a schedule of compliance therefore satisfy section b c,provided that the schedule of compliance was established pursuant to state or federal law or regulations.absent a schedule of compliance established pursuant to state or federal law or regulations,effluent limitations in a permit must ensure compliance with water quality standards and can not permit delayed compliance.ibid.
our construction of the clean water act is consistent with that of the epa administrator in caribe,wl.the administrator concluded that a permit may authorize delayed compliance with effluent limitations that are necessary to achieve water quality standards only if the state water quality standards or implementing regulations provide for schedules of compliance.although the matter involved a permit issued by epa,the administrator noted that epa permitting authority is the same as the states permitting authority pursuant to title united states code section a.thus,if a state lacks authority to establish schedules of compliance for instance,if it elected not to include the necessary enabling authority language in its water quality standards,epa would also lack that authority because of its derivative relationship to the state.caribe,wl.
epa has consistently followed this construction of the clean water act see,city of ames,iowa,wl,and objected to preliminary drafts of the burbank and los angeles permits that included schedules of compliance and interim effluent limitations on these grounds.epa suggested that if burbank and los angeles are unable to comply with the effluent limitations immediately upon issuance of the permit,regional board should issue enforcement orders allowing delayed compliance.see a a.regional board heeded epa suggestion by issuing final permits without schedules of compliance and then issuing separate time schedule orders allowing delayed compliance with certain effluent limitations.
epa consistent construction of a complex,technical statute that it is charged with enforcing is entitled to consideration and respect,although ultimately the interpretation of a statute is a legal issue that we review de novo.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization,supra,cal th at,d.
the water quality control plan here provides for schedules of compliance only for ammonia.it does not authorize delayed compliance with other effluent limitations that are necessary to achieve water quality standards either in the water quality control plan,the implementing regulations,or in any other state or federal law or regulation.
epa enacted water quality standards for certain toxic pollutants in may due to california failure to comply with its obligation to do so.california toxics rule,et.may,see c.the california toxics rule provides for schedules of compliance where prompt compliance with a new or more restrictive effluent limitation is infeasible.e.state board enacted a comprehensive policy to implement water quality standards established in the california toxics rule,water quality control plans,and other authority,tit,summarizing the policy for implementation of toxics standards for inland surface waters,enclosed bays,and estuaries of california.the implementation policy provides for schedules of compliance for toxic pollutants listed in the california toxics rule or national toxics rule d.see,tit,subd.b.water boards acknowledge that the california toxics rule and state board implementing policy authorize schedules of compliance and interim effluent limitations for the pollutants covered therein,so the new permits can include schedules of compliance for those pollutants.
based on the foregoing,we conclude that the permits can not include schedules of compliance that allow delayed compliance with effluent limitations that are necessary to achieve water quality standards,excepting only the effluent limitations for ammonia and the pollutants covered by the california toxics rule and state board implementing policy.
the federal statutes and regulations cited by burbank and los angeles authorize states to provide for schedules of compliance in their water quality standards e a and to include schedules of compliance in a permit when appropriate a see,but do not authorize schedules of compliance in a permit where the water quality standards or implementation policy do not provide for schedules of compliance.similarly,water code section,subdivision c,stating that waste discharge requirements may contain a time schedule,and the water quality control plan,stating that an npdes permit generally includes time schedules and interim reporting deadlines for compliance italics omitted,do not expressly or impliedly authorize schedules of compliance that allow delayed compliance with effluent limitations necessary to achieve water quality standards where the state water quality standards or implementing regulations do not provide for schedules of compliance.
attorney fees 
our reversal of the judgments renders moot the appeals from the orders denying attorney fees,because any grant or denial of attorney fees under code of civil procedure section must follow the entry of judgments on remand and must be based on the results obtained in the new judgments.
the trial court denied burbank and los angeles motions for attorney fees based primarily on its conclusion that the cities burden of enforcement was not disproportionate to their pecuniary interests.burbank and los angeles contend the trial court misconstrued code of civil procedure section and applied an incorrect legal standard.since the parties have briefed this legal question and presented it to this court for decision and since the same question may be presented to the trial court on remand if a party moves for attorney fees,we will decide the issue.code civ.
