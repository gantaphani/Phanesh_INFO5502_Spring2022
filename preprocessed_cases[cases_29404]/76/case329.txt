california requires public owners of water conveyance facilities with unused capacity to make them available to others in return for fair compensation.in this dispute between central san joaquin water conservation district central,which supplies surface water to agricultural customers,and stockton east water district stockton east,which operates the conveyance system through which the water flows,the trial court was required to determine whether the compensation demanded by stockton east for transporting wheeling central water was fair under the provisions of water code section,subdivision c.stockton east sought a wheeling rate of approximately per of water,an amount sufficient to recover percent of all costs of owning and operating the conveyance system,in which percent of the water flow was for central benefit.central disagreed and argued the rate should reflect the incremental costs directly resulting from the additional water flowing through the conveyance system,making use of the capacity that would otherwise go unused,a much lower rate.
the trial court found the wheeling statutes wat.code et must be read as a whole and the language read in light of the purposes and policies of the statutes to facilitate the voluntary exchange of water,noting that the legislature could have provided for a pro rata cost allocation but chose to omit reference to any specific formula or methodology and instead set forth a number of factors that must be considered in setting a wheeling rate.in light of the statutory language,rates must be set on a basis,and in this case,stockton east failed to consider all of the appropriate factors,including incremental costs and the value of offsetting benefits from the wheeling.the rates set ran counter to an analysis of competitive pricing and violated the statutes directive that such rates be reasonable.
because the trial court determination is supported by substantial evidence and correctly applies the relevant statutes,we shall affirm.
factual and procedural background 
stockton east is a water conservation district that supplies surface water to farmers and three municipal entities,city of stockton,san joaquin county,and defendant in intervention california water service company cal water,who in turn supply water to residents and businesses.stockton east is governed by water code section et and by special legislation passed in stats,ch,as amended part of stockton east mandate is to develop water resources to reduce and control overdraft of groundwater stocks.
central is also a water conservation district governed by section et,organized to deliver surface water to agricultural customers within its service boundaries.central source of water is a contract with the united states,allowing it to purchase up to of water annually from the new melones unit of the central valley project,subject to availability.to reach central,water stored in the new melones reservoir is wheeled through stockton east conveyance system.there is no other feasible means for central to access this surface water.
central is not a member of stockton east.it is a customer,purchasing stockton east conveyance services.cal water is a california corporation providing municipal water services to areas of the city of stockton and san joaquin county.cal water is one of stockton east customers.
construction of the conveyance system 
initially,central and stockton east proposed the construction of the conveyance system as a joint project.both ownership and costs of construction,operation,and maintenance of the conveyance system would be shared.however,stockton east ultimately decided to construct the conveyance system on its own,without central participation.
construction began in the late and early.the conveyance system is over miles long and includes a dam,a tunnel,canals,improved natural creek channels,and a pipeline to transport water from the new melones reservoir to central and stockton east service areas.stockton east built the conveyance system to be large enough to wheel water for central and other entities,which would pay fees for the service.
construction of the conveyance system cost approximately million and was financed by issuance of certificates of participation,similar to bonds.stockton east urban customers,including cal water,the city of stockton,and san joaquin county,guaranteed payment of the certificates.the cost of operating and maintaining the conveyance system is over million per year,and the cost of servicing the construction debt exceeds million per year.
the wheeling contracts 
in and stockton east and central entered into contracts by which stockton east would wheel water for central through the conveyance system to central service area.the contract price was set at per of water.the rate was based on stockton east operation and maintenance costs,including debt service and central proportionate amount of water being wheeled.
although a dispute arose between the parties over central payments under the contracts,stockton east continued to wheel water for central.in stockton east informed central that it was terminating the contracts effective january.as a possible resolution of the dispute,stockton east proposed that it and central consolidate.during those negotiations,the parties entered into a contract under which stockton east would wheel central water during for per.
negotiations broke down,and in november stockton east informed central it would not wheel water for central in under the terms of the contract.central offered to pay stockton east per for wheeling its water in.
stockton east rejected the offer.instead,stockton east calculated its fair compensation under the statutes to be per,based on a proportional allocation of the costs of the conveyance system,but offered to wheel for per.the latter amount reflected the price the parties negotiated in their original and contracts.central rejected the offer and argued stockton east could only charge for incremental costs directly arising from wheeling central water.
subsequent litigation 
central filed an action for declaratory relief against stockton east,challenging the wheeling rate and seeking an injunction to prevent stockton east from withholding wheeling services from central during and requiring negotiations for a reasonable rate.the trial court issued a preliminary injunction ordering stockton east to wheel central water during at per with any credits or adjustments to be made by the parties once a final rate was adjudicated.we upheld the trial court judgment,concluding the trial court had not determined what fair compensation is,did not rule that stockton east could only recover incremental costs,and did not abuse its discretion by issuing a preliminary injunction.central san joaquin water conservation district stockton east water district june,nonpub.opn.stockton east filed a for declaratory relief and quantum meruit.cal water filed a complaint in intervention.
in stockton east adopted a wheeling rate for central water during the season.the rate was based on a strict proportional share of the costs of the conveyance system.central filed a first amended complaint adding a challenge to the wheeling rate.
following extensive oral argument,the court issued a statement of decision following a bifurcated court trial.after summarizing the facts and arguments of both parties,the court presented four findings.
first,after construing the applicable wheeling statutes and legislative history,the court found the setting of wheeling rates necessarily or reasonably includes consideration of the owner incremental or marginal costs resulting from the purchaser use,as well as consideration of the owner capital,maintenance and replacement costs,the costs of supplemental power,and offsets for benefits not otherwise captured in the pricing.the wheeling rates set by stockton east in and were not reasonable since they failed to consider incremental costs and other factors.
second,the court rejected stockton east contention that a conveyance system owner may compel a nonmember agency to pay a wheeling rate calculated on the basis of a strict proportionate share of capital,overhead,maintenance,and other fixed or ongoing costs.under the wheeling statutes,those factors may be considered,but a conveyance owner may not simply total its costs and enforce a pro rata application in all cases.although such a pro rata application may be permissible with a member agency,it is not reasonable to use this formula with a nonmember agency.third,the court also rejected central interpretation of the wheeling statutes as requiring a conveyance owner to charge only its marginal or incremental costs.
finally,the court determined that the wheeling statutes dictate that a conveyance system owner must act in a reasonable manner consistent with the requirements of law to facilitate the voluntary sale,lease,or exchange of water,which requires a consideration of the particular facts in each case.according to the court,the wheeling statutes allow stockton east to consider charges incurred by the owners,including capital,operation,maintenance,and replacement costs,and costs of supplemental power.however,stockton east must consider also the fact that central is not a member agency,and was not included in the decision to construct the conveyance system.most importantly,the wheeling statutes taken together evince the legislature intention that the wheeling rates bear some resemblance to real world price setting that is,a conveyance owner may not exploit a position vis a vis a agency,but is required to set reasonable rates.in the context of this case stockton east setting of reasonable rates must include consideration of the incremental costs incurred by reason of central use,and consideration of the cost of competitive alternatives here,the price or cost to central of pumping groundwater.
accordingly,the court found substantial evidence did not support stockton east fair compensation determinations of and.since stockton east methodology was fundamentally flawed,a full evidentiary hearing would not be appropriate since no amount of evidence could overcome a fundamental flaw.the court deferred resolving the issue of reasonable credit for offsetting benefits,finding it an issue of fact.
the court found the wheeling statutes require rates to be determined in a manner to facilitate water transfers.however,the court rejected central interpretation that wheeling rates must always be less than the purchaser cost to pump groundwater.the court found no such requirement and noted that such an interpretation may be inconsistent with the owner right to fair compensation.instead,the owner need only consider the purchaser reasonable available alternatives,the cost to pump groundwater,along with other relevant factors.under such a calculation,a wheeling rate could exceed the purchaser cost to pump groundwater and yet still be fair and consistent with the legislature policy promoting water transfers.
the court concluded that stockton east and wheeling rates could not be upheld under the wheeling statutes.following entry of judgment,stockton east and cal water filed timely notices of appeal.

applicable wheeling statutes 
central to the arguments of the parties and the trial court findings are several statutes governing wheeling.since it has been the declared policy of this state to facilitate the voluntary transfer of water.the wheeling statutes addressed a potential impediment to wheeling transfers.public and private water rights holders who wanted to sell surplus water could do so only by agreement with the owners of conveyance systems.otherwise,there was no practical way to move water from seller to buyer.however,some conveyance system owners had refused to wheel water,or had allowed wheeling only after protracted negotiations.metropolitan water district imperial irrigation district th,metropolitan.
the legislature recognized the sale of excess water could be a source of income for farmers while also promoting efficient use of a scarce resource.to effectuate these goals,the wheeling statutes prohibit state,regional,or local agencies from withholding use of their water conveyance systems by others provided that unused wheeling capacity is available and fair compensation is paid to the conveyance owner.metropolitan,supra,th at.
section states,in relevant part notwithstanding any other provision of law,neither the state,nor any regional or local public agency may deny a bona fide transferor of water the use of a water conveyance facility which has unused capacity,for the period of time for which that capacity is available,if fair compensation is paid for that use section,subdivisions c and d define the terms fair compensation and replacement costs as follows c fair compensation means the reasonable charges incurred by the owner of the conveyance system,including capital,operation,maintenance,and replacement costs,increased costs from any necessitated purchase of supplemental power,and including reasonable credit for any offsetting benefits for the use of the conveyance system.d replacement costs means the reasonable portion of costs associated with material acquisition for the correction of irreparable wear or other deterioration of conveyance facility parts that have an anticipated life that is less than the conveyance facility repayment period and which costs are attributable to the proposed use.
section states the state,regional,or local public agency owning the water conveyance facility shall in a timely manner determine the following a the amount and availability of unused capacity.b the terms and conditions,including operation and maintenance requirements and scheduling,quality requirements,terms or use,priorities,and fair compensation.
section specifies review under the wheeling statutes in making the determinations required by this article,the respective public agency shall act in a reasonable manner consistent with the requirements of law to facilitate the voluntary sale,lease,or exchange of water and shall support its determinations by written findings.in any judicial action challenging any determination made under this article the court shall consider all relevant evidence,and the court shall give due consideration to the purposes and policies of this article.in any such case the court shall sustain the determination of the public agency if it finds that the determination is supported by substantial evidence.
metropolitan 
the metropolitan decision,involving wheeling rate setting by the metropolitan water district,is heavily cited and relied on by both sides.we discuss it in detail,though stark differences exist between the metropolitan water district and the two districts involved in the present controversy.the parties are not identically situated the lead challenger in metropolitan is a member agency but the opinion considers issues and announces principles relevant to the present case.
the plaintiff metropolitan water district supplies percent of the water used in southern california.it is comprised of member agencies,cities,municipal water districts,and one county water authority.the district is governed by a board of directors.each member agency is entitled to one director and may appoint an additional director for every percent of the total assessed valuation of the district service area within the member agency.voting shares are also based on assessed valuation.the board of directors sets policy and guides the actions of the district.metropolitan,supra,th at.
approximately percent of the district revenue is generated through rates charged to supply water to its member agencies.member agencies pay a fixed rate for each of water delivered,which does not depend on the portions of the facilities used or the distance the water travels.the district estimated percent of its costs are fixed and unavoidable,regardless of how much water is sold.metropolitan,supra,th at.member agencies pay for these fixed costs of the district conveyance system in a bundled rate.the agencies purchase water from the district as needed and are not required to purchase any set amount.id.at.
the district owns and operates a massive water conveyance system.to finance the system,including future projects,the district issued bonds.debt service and operation and maintenance costs for the system are included in the water rates charged to member agencies.in addition,the district is pursuing water conservation programs,the costs of which are included in the fixed rate for water purchased by member agencies.metropolitan,supra,th at.
the district board of directors adopted a fixed wheeling rate for its member agencies during nonshortage periods of per of untreated water.all of the member agencies,except san diego county water authority,voted to adopt the fixed rate.metropolitan,supra,th at.the wheeling rate is based on the amount of water transported without regard to the source of the water,the facilities used,or the distance the water travels.the rate is based on the same costs that the district includes in the rates it charges for the water it sells to member agencies.these charges compensate the district for its capital investment and costs.the wheeling rate of per equals the rate charged to member agencies purchasing the district water less the costs of the water.id.at.
however,the wheeling rate applies only to member agencies.rates for entities other than member agencies are to be established by the metropolitan water district board of directors on a basis consistent with applicable law,the metropolitan water district resolution adopting the fixed wheeling rate,and the wheeling principles adopted by the metropolitan water district board of directors.metropolitan,supra,th at.
in setting the rates the district concluded member agencies receiving comparable service must pay comparable costs for the service wheeling transactions should not cause harm,in terms of reliability,quality or financial impact,on nonparticipant member agencies wheeling charges must fully recover properly allocable fixed and variable costs of conveying water through the metropolitan water district system and in short,if a member agency purchasing water from the metropolitan water district pays for the fixed,unavoidable costs of the system,including transmission and storage and supply,in a bundled full service rate,then member agencies using that same system for wheeling must contribute to the metropolitan water district fixed costs on equivalent basis.metropolitan,supra,th at.
the district filed suit against dissenting san diego county water authority and several other parties to validate its wheeling rate.the trial court,after considering the wheeling statutes,determined as a matter of law that the district could not set a fixed wheeling rate in advance of a particular transaction,without regard to the nature of the specific proposal.the court also found the district could not include costs in calculating its wheeling rate.the court entered judgment against metropolitan water district and in favor of the defendants.metropolitan,supra,th at.
the appellate court reversed.the court first considered whether the wheeling statutes mandate that a water conveyance facility owner recover reasonable capital,operation,and maintenance costs incurred only with respect to the particular facilities used in the wheeling transaction.the parties dubbed such a calculation point to point.metropolitan,supra,th at.
after carefully considering both the statutory language and legislative intent,the court determined neither supported the conclusion that,as a matter of law,costs could not under any circumstances be included in a wheeling rate calculation.metropolitan,supra,th at.the court noted that had the legislature intended to limit recoverable capital,operation,and maintenance costs to actual costs,it would have used specific language to that effect.id.at.
the court also reasoned that,under the statutes,a water conveyance system owner is entitled to reasonable charges it incurs for the use of the system.giving the word incurred its usual and ordinary meaning,the court concluded that charges incurred refers to the costs a person becomes subject to or liable for because of an act or transaction.metropolitan,supra,th at at.therefore,the fair compensation the owner is entitled to for wheeling includes reasonable capital,maintenance and operation costs occasioned,caused,or brought about by the use of the conveyance system,subd.c.fair compensation includes charges the owner,in this case the metropolitan water district,becomes subject to or liable for in using the conveyance system,subd.c to wheel water when it has unused capacity.id.at.
finally,the court rejected the defendants contention that wheeling rates must be determined on a basis as transactions are proposed.to the contrary,determining a fixed rate for wheeling by member agencies in advance of a particular transaction did not violate the timeliness requirement of section.metropolitan,supra,th at.
the present case 
metropolitan figures prominently in the trial court reasoning and the arguments of both parties.the trial court thought metropolitan informative but not dispositive of the issues before it,because the facts are distinguishable.whereas in metropolitan,the dispute was between a conveyance owner and a member agency,the dispute here is between a conveyance owner and a third party would be purchaser of conveyance services.the contention that only two choices exist that the wheeling statutes allow stockton east to charge central for its proportionate use of the the conveyance system,or instead that stockton east is limited to charging only the incremental cost incurred to wheel water for central is rejected.this court does not read the wheeling statutes as permitting a conveyance system owner to essentially capture dependent agencies,nor does this court read the relevant provisions as limiting stockton east to only incremental marginal costs.
stockton east and cal water insist that nothing in the wheeling statutes justifies treating member agencies or system any differently from any third party invoking the wheeling statutes.that metropolitan involved member agencies had nothing to do with the opinion decision or analysis of the statutory language.citation.again,any factual findings about whether or not cal water and central are member agencies are wholly irrelevant to the methodology legal issue.
stockton east and cal water read metropolitan too narrowly.from the outset,metropolitan outlined the part the member agencies played in the district process,including the setting of wheeling rates.member agencies were represented on the district board of directors.metropolitan,supra,th at.metropolitan also observed that the wheeling rate applies only to member agencies.rates for entities other than member agencies are to be established by the metropolitan water district board of directors on a basis consistent with applicable law and the wheeling principles adopted by the metropolitan water district board of directors.id.at.
to suggest the member agency status of the challengers in metropolitan had nothing to do with the court analysis is to ignore part of the court analysis.in rejecting the argument that
