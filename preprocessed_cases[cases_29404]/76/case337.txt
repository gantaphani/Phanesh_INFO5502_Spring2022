monopolists have long been unpopular in this country.when king george iii choke hold on government led to intolerable levels of taxation,he was forced to divest his holdings.at the end of the nineteenth century,congress passed the sherman antitrust act with only a single dissenting vote.stat,as amended.introducing his landmark bill,senator sherman summed up the prevailing sentiment if we will not endure a king as a political power we should not endure a king over the production,transportation,and sale of any of the necessaries of life.cong.rec.
nothing is more necessary to life than water.residents of ojai,fed up with sky high water bills,voted to oust appellant golden state water company golden state,the private utility that monopolizes water service to their city,and replace it with respondent casitas municipal water district casitas,a municipal utility that they hope will be more responsive to their concerns.they plan to finance this transaction by selling bonds pursuant to the mello roos community facilities act of mello roos act or act,et 
golden state is unwilling to sell its business.casitas therefore plans to acquire the assets by eminent domain.golden state contends that the mello roos act can not be used to finance eminent domain actions or to acquire intangible property.we disagree.the act facilitates the purchase of property regardless of whether the seller consents to the sale or is compelled under force of law.moreover,financing the acquisition of intangible property incidental to the real or tangible property being purchased is consistent with the act text and purpose.accordingly,we affirm.
facts and procedural history 
casitas is a publicly owned water utility encompassing square miles in western ventura county.its territory includes the city of ojai,but for historical reasons most of ojai and some adjacent areas receive water from golden state.golden state charges its customers rates that are more than double those charged by casitas,and the disparity is growing.over a year period,golden state average annual rate increase was nearly twice that of casitas.
after several failed attempts to redress their grievances with the public utilities commission puc,golden state regulatory agency,local residents formed respondent ojai friends for locally owned water ojai flow,an interest group with the intent to declare independence from the economic tyranny of golden state.ojai flow,supported by ojai city council and more than registered voters,petitioned casitas to take over golden state water service in ojai.
casitas concluded that the ojai community would benefit from having its water utility run by a locally controlled entity rather than an corporation seeking to maximize profits for its owners.casitas board members live in the community and its customers have the right to participate in management decisions.unlike golden state,casitas is subject to the brown act et and the california public records act et,and its meetings are conducted in public within its service area.under proposition cal,art.xiii d,casitas rates can be reduced by a majority of voters in its service area.bighorn desert view water agency verjil cal th.the only recourse for golden state customers is to contend with the formal puc process involving officials and staff located hundreds of miles away,whereas casitas customers can express their wishes at the local level.
casitas determined that the mello roos act would be an appropriate means of financing the transaction in light of its objective to place the financial burden on ojai residents rather than on its existing water customers.pursuant to the act,casitas formed a community facilities district,respondent casitas municipal water district community facilities district ojai casitas cfd.casitas passed resolutions listing the facilities to be acquired,declaring the necessity of raising bond revenue to finance their acquisition,and submitting the matter to voters for their approval in a special election.the ballot measure asked voters to authorize casitas cfd to issue up to million in bonds to finance the acquisition of golden state property and property rights in ojai.to pay for the bonds,a special tax would be levied on property in casitas cfd.
golden state filed a reverse validation complaint and petition for writ of mandate code civ,et,seeking to invalidate and set aside casitas resolutions.the trial court stayed the case until after the vote.at the special election that drew in more than half of eligible voters,percent of the electorate approved the measure.the trial court subsequently ruled against golden state on all issues and entered judgment in favor of respondents.
golden state contends that the mello roos act can not be used to finance a taking of property by eminent domain or the acquisition of intangible property and property rights.in addition,it contends that the act can not be used by one service provider to supplant another service provider using the same facilities and serving the same customers.we review these issues of statutory construction de novo.ceja rudolph sletten,cal th.
discussion 
golden state concedes that casitas may lawfully exercise the power of eminent domain,but asserts that mello roos is not the only way to finance property acquisition.golden state is sure that casitas can come up with other alternatives.for example,golden state suggests that casitas could issue revenue bonds id.or form an improvement district to issue bonds id.respondents dispute this assertion,arguing that mello roos financing is the only viable tool for the job and that other methods are impractical.
if golden state is correct that respondents have alternative ways to finance the transaction that are both legal and practical,then the injury it complains of the imminent taking of its assets does not turn on the resolution of this lawsuit.if that were the case,golden state would lack standing to pursue this action.see city of santa monica stewart th,a party lacks standing if it does not have an actual and substantial interest in,or would not be benefited or harmed by,the ultimate outcome of an action wilson wilson city council of redwood city th,suit for declaratory relief to protect plaintiff property from possible future condemnation based on city statement that it would use its best efforts and legally available means to acquire it did not present live controversy.
although we can evaluate the legality of alternative financing methods,the trial court first would have to assess their feasibility.people superior court plascencia th,trier of fact must conduct evidentiary hearing when resolution of the question of standing turn s upon disputed issues of material fact.we will not remand to the trial court to make the factual determination on which golden state standing turns,however,because respondents do not contest the issue see action apartment,city of santa monica cal th,fn,because addressing the merits is in the public interest see california water telephone county of los angeles d,and because we can resolve the appeal more easily by reaching the merits see california medical brown th,fn.

when construing a statute,our objective is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citation.we look first to the words of the statute,because they generally provide the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citation.we give the words their usual and ordinary meaning citation,while construing them in light of the statute as a whole and the statute purpose citation.citation.if there is no ambiguity in the language,we presume the legislature meant what it said and the plain meaning of the statute governs.citation.only when the statute language is ambiguous or susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation,may the court turn to extrinsic aids to assist in interpretation.citation.ceja rudolph sletten,supra,cal th at.
the mello roos act provides an alternative method of financing certain public capital facilities and services.although it was designed for use especially in developing areas and areas undergoing rehabilitation ibid,it is not limited to such contexts.
any local agency defined as any city or county,special district,school district,joint powers entity,redevelopment agency,or any other municipal corporation,district,or political subdivision of the state,subd.h may use mello roos financing.the process is straightforward.the local agency legislative body or governing board first establishes a community facilities district whose sole purpose is to finance authorized facilities and services,subds.b,g.subject to approval by of district voters,the district may issue bonds to finance facilities but not services and the local agency may levy and collect a special tax on real property in the district to pay for the bonds or to finance facilities and services directly.see azusa land partners department of indus.relations th.
with respect to facilities,the act authorizes a community facilities district to finance the purchase,construction,expansion,improvement,or rehabilitation of any real or other tangible property with an estimated useful life of five years or longer or to finance planning and design work that is directly related to the purchase,construction,expansion,or rehabilitation of any real or tangible property.the issue here is whether a purchase must be voluntary for both parties or whether the term includes compensation for facilities acquired by the local agency through its eminent domain power.we conclude that the latter construction of the statute is more plausible and better effectuates the drafters intent.
the word purchase connotes acquisition,often in exchange for compensation,regardless of whether the thing being acquired is relinquished voluntarily.see black law dict.ed,defining purchase as either an instance of buying or t he acquisition of real property by one own or another act as by will or gift rather than by descent or inheritance merriam webster collegiate dict.ed,defining purchase as acquir ing real estate by means other than descent or inheritance,obtain ing by paying money or its equivalent,or obtain ing by labor,danger,or sacrifice.for this reason,eminent domain is sometimes referred to as compulsory purchase.black law,supra,at.when a public entity condemns property,it must pay the owner the same price the owner would receive from a private party purchasing the property in an arm length transaction.saratoga fire protection dist.hackett th,the measure of compensation provided by the eminent domain law is the fair market value defined as the highest price on the date of valuation that would be agreed to by a willing seller,under no obligation nor necessity to sell,and a willing buyer,under no similar obligation or necessity to buy,each dealing with the other with full knowledge of all the uses and purposes for which the property is reasonably adaptable and available.
our supreme court has addressed a similar issue of statutory construction.the statute at issue in people superior court cal d provided for a special commission that would purchase or acquire farm lands by unconditional gift or use of lands owned by the state in order to construct a state prison facility.stats,ch.the supreme court concluded that this language was sufficient to legally authorize the special commission to condemn land.people superior court,supra,cal d at.
in light of the statute purpose of acquiring land for governmental purposes,the average citizen would realize that,after the special commission selected the most desirable site,for any one of various reasons the owner thereof might be averse either to the sale or other disposition of his property even for ordinary uses.people superior court,supra,cal d at,accord,posner,economic analysis of the law ed once the railroad or pipeline has begun to build its line,the cost of abandoning it for an alternative route becomes very high.knowing this,people owning land in the path of the advancing line will be tempted to hold out for a very high price a price in excess of the actual opportunity cost of the land.the average citizen would further assume that the only means by which the government might accomplish its purpose in that regard would be by an action in the exercise of the right of eminent domain.people superior court,supra,at.thus,the statutory language would not deceive,mislead or defraud the general public concerning the authority of the state to condemn any suitable property to construct the prison.id.at.
moreover,the statutory power to purchase lands imports authority not only to acquire lands by bargain and sale agreement for their agreed cash value,by possible exchange of some land by the state for other land that might be more suitable for prison purposes,or even by the means that was adopted and sought to be made effective herein,to wit by means of an action in the exercise of the right of eminent domain.in other words,that the word purchase is broad enough to include within its meaning any means other than by descent.people superior court,supra,cal d at.
this logic applies here with equal force.the mello roos act,like the prison statute,authorizes a public agency to purchase real property in order to construct and develop government facilities.given the obvious practical need in certain circumstances of using eminent domain power to acquire property for this purpose,the word purchase should be construed in its broadest sense,which includes a taking by eminent domain in exchange for just compensation.see people ex rel.bay.com.town of emeryville cal d,w here a word of common usage has more than one meaning,the one which will best attain the purposes of the statute should be adopted,even though the ordinary meaning of the word is thereby enlarged or restricted and especially in order to avoid absurdity or to prevent injustice.
lest there be any doubt,the act provides that it shall be liberally construed in order to effectuate its purposes.it continues no error,irregularity,informality,and no neglect or omission of any officer,in any procedure taken under the act,which does not directly affect the jurisdiction of the legislative body to order the installation of the facility or the provision of service,shall void or invalidate such proceeding or any levy for the costs of such facility or service,italics added.put differently,if the public agency otherwise has the power to acquire the facilit
