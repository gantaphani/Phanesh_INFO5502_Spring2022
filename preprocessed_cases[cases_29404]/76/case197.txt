siskiyou regional education project srep and intervenor miners robert barton barton and gerald hobbs hobbs appeal the district court rulings in favor of the united states forest service forest service on claims brought in connection with the forest service interpretation of mineral management standard and guideline,a directive contained in the forest service northwest forest plan nfp.
the nfp provides that standards and guidelines do not apply when contrary to existing law or regulation.although a,a forest service mining regulation,was in force when was adopted,and a conflict in the extent of regulatory oversight of small mining operations in riparian reserves.specifically,a confers discretionary authority on district rangers to determine whether mining activity will result in significant disturbance to surface resources and therefore require a plan of operations.appears to conflict with a because it directs the district ranger to require a plan of operations for all mining activity within riparian reserves.to resolve this apparent conflict,in february the forest service interpreted to impose the same threshold standard for a plan of operations as a.the forest service interpretation of lies at the heart of this dispute.
the district court rejected srep challenge to the forest service interpretation of,and granted summary judgment to the forest service.the district court also limited intervention by barton and hobbs to the remedial phase of the litigation,if necessary.the court dismissed as moot barton separate action that had been consolidated with srep suit.the court also struck hobbs answer to srep first amended complaint on the ground that it raised claims that exceeded hobbs limited role in the litigation.
on appeal,srep challenges the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the forest service.srep maintains that the forest service interpretation of as contrary to a,and thus without force insofar as it imposes additional restrictions on mining activity in riparian reserves,was arbitrary and capricious.barton appeals the district court denial of his motion to intervene at the merits phase of srep suit against the forest service,which would have permitted him to assert that the forest service lacks the authority to regulate mining under the nfma.he also challenges dismissal of his separate action as moot.barton argues that because the national forest management act of nfma does not grant the forest service authority to regulate mining,its attempt to do so in the nfp is unenforceable barton further argues that even if the forest service is vested with this authority,its interpretation of was reasonable and entitled to deference.last,hobbs argues that the counterclaims and affirmative defenses he raised in his answer to srep first amended complaint were improperly stricken.
at the outset,we conclude that,contrary to the forest service objections,we have jurisdiction over final agency action pursuant to.we affirm both the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the forest service,and the court rulings regarding barton and hobbs.
factual and procedural history 
streams and mining in the siskiyou national forest 
the siskiyou national forest contains streams and rivers that provide habitat for several fish species,including coho and chinook salmon and steelhead trout.several of these species,including coho salmon,have been listed as threatened or at risk under the endangered species act.see,june.many of these same waterways have also been subject to gold mining claims since the.currently,gold miners work the streams and rivers within the forest with suction dredges,machines that separate gold from streambed material using a motor that draws streambed material up through a flexible,intake hose and then discharges the material back into the stream bed.the of protected fish species and mining operations in streams and rivers raises concern because suction dredges are a popular method of mining the waterways within the forest,yet may cause harm to endangered fish 
regulatory history 
a complex,interlocking web of statutes and regulations sets forth the forest service authority to regulate mining operations in the streams and rivers within the siskiyou national forest.historically,mining operations on public lands were subject to little regulation.see generally laura ziemer,the mining law and the century collide a rediscovery of limits on mining rights in wilderness areas and national forests,envt l.the general mining act of codified as amended in scattered sections of,and the national park service organic act of organic act codified as amended in scattered sections of granted the forest service the authority to promulgate regulations for mining in national forests.see united states shumway,cir quoting and.pursuant to its authority under the organic act,the forest service first adopted mining regulations in.see.when the forest service issued its february interpretation of that srep challenges here,a provided in pertinent part 
a except as provided in paragraph a of this section,a notice of intention to operate is required from any person proposing to conduct operations which might cause disturbance of surface resources.such notice of intention shall be submitted to the district ranger having jurisdiction over the area in which the operations will be conducted.if the district ranger determines that such operations will likely cause significant disturbance of surface resources,the operator shall submit a proposed plan of operations to the district ranger 
a see a.although this regulation requires a notice of intent in certain circumstances,it vests discretion in the district ranger to determine if the mining operation will likely cause significant disturbance of surface resources.id.in the event of such a determination,the mining operator must submit a proposed plan of operations.
section a contained five exceptions to the plan of operations requirement,including an exception for individuals desiring to search for and occasionally remove small mineral samples or specimens,and an exception for prospecting and sampling that does not cause significant surface resource disturbance or involve removal of more than a reasonable amount of mineral deposit for analysis and study.id.at a i iv.further,a provided that a notice of intent need not be filed i where a plan of operations is submitted for approval in lieu thereof,ii for operations excepted by the provisions in a i v,and in certain other circumstances.id.at a.
additionally,the nfma requires the forest service to prepare for each forest a management plan that contains standards and guidelines specifying how the forest shall be managed.a,e lands council powell,cir the nfma requires the forest service to create a comprehensive forest plan for each national forest.citations omitted.pursuant to this requirement,the forest service first adopted a plan for the siskiyou national forest in.that plan was amended in,in response to president clinton call for management reform of federal lands and waters within the range of the northern spotted owl.see record of decision for amendments to forest service and bureau of land management planning documents within the range of the northern spotted owl,summary,april,available at http www.reo.gov library reports newroda.pdf hereinafter record of decision.
the nfp contains an aquatic conservation strategy acs,the purpose of which is to protect fish habitat and to maintain or restore riparian and aquatic ecosystems.id.at.the acs designates certain streams in the forest as riparian reserves,portions of watersheds where resources receive primary emphasis.id.at see also michael blumm,the amphibious salmon the evolution of ecosystem management in the columbia river basin,ecology,discussing policy and procedures of acs.to implement this strategy,the nfp contains standards and guidelines that address matters such as timber management,road construction,grazing,and restoration.record of decision at.
these binding standards and guidelines restrict certain activities within areas designated as riparian reserves or key watersheds.pacific coast fed of fishermen ass n,marine fisheries,cir see i.by their own terms,however,the standards and guidelines do not apply where contrary to existing law or regulation.standards and guidelines for management of habitat for and forest related species within the range of the northern spotted owl,at april,available at http www.reo.gov library reports newsandga.pdf hereinafter standards and guidelines see also id.at.
as noted above,the provision central to this dispute is standard and guideline,which provides 
require a reclamation plan,approved plan of operations,and reclamation bond for all minerals operations that include riparian reserves.such plans and bonds must address the costs of removing facilities,equipment,and materials recontouring disturbed areas to near topography isolating and neutralizing or removing toxic or potentially toxic materials salvage and replacement of topsoil and seedbed preparation and revegetation to meet aquatic conservation strategy objectives.
standards and guidelines at emphasis added.read in isolation,appears to require a plan of operation for all mineral operations that include riparian reserves.unlike a,which draws a distinction between mining operations that require only a notice of intent and those that require a more comprehensive plan of operations,draws no such distinction for operations within riparian reserves.
the forest service addressed the tension between and a in a memorandum that it issued on february,
to apply s g to activities not meeting the likely cause significant disturbance test is not appropriate,and is contrary to law and regulation.if no significant surface disturbance is occurring,we have no reason to require a reclamation bond,nor would we be able to determine bond amount.in the areas covered by the northwest forest plan or covered by other general management guidance or strategies,forest users can conduct surface disturbing activities without filing plans of operations per the intent of the forest service mining regulations.a notice of intent to operate noi will still be required if the proposed activity might cause disturbance of surface resources and it does meet the provisions of cfr a.the standard and guideline applies only when the proposed activity is likely to cause significant surface disturbance.because would require plans of operations where a would not,it was contrary to existing regulation insofar as it was interpreted to include plans of operation for all mining.
memorandum to regional foresters february.after the forest service issued this management directive,the forest service began to allow miners to undertake mining operations in riparian reserves within the siskiyou national forest upon the filing of a notice of intent,without requiring the submission or approval of a plan of operations.barton and hobbs mining operations were among those that were allowed to proceed without an approved plan of operations.
procedural history 
in,srep filed suit,alleging that the forest service february interpretation of violated the nfp and the nfma,and,therefore,its decision to allow suction dredge mining operations in riparian reserves without a plan of operations was arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act apa,et shortly after srep filed suit,hobbs,barton and the waldo mining district wmd moved separately to intervene.the district court granted intervention to barton and hobbs only as to the remedial phase of the litigation.barton and wmd then filed a separate suit against the forest service,which the district court consolidated with srep suit 
all parties filed for summary judgment.in barton suit against the forest service,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the forest service.the court concluded that barton claims were moot in light of the forest service policy decision to require a plan of operations under only when the mining operation posed a risk of significant surface disturbance.in srep suit against the forest service,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the forest service,concluding that was contrary to a and that the forest service narrow interpretation of was reasonable and thus entitled to deference.srep,barton and hobbs timely appealed.
ii.jurisdiction 
final agency action 
the forest service argues that we lack jurisdiction because srep complaint failed to challenge a final agency action and constituted an improper programmatic attack on the forest service policies.the right of judicial review under the apa is limited to final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.see lujan wildlife fed n,d.a wholesale improvement for a program can not be sought by court decree,rather than in the offices of the agency or the halls of congress,where programmatic improvements are normally made.norton utah wilderness alliance,d citing lujan,at.rather,u nder the terms of the apa,respondent must direct its attack against some particular agency action that causes it harm.id.
srep has expressed more than a generalized dissatisfaction with the forest service decision to limit the application of,even though srep does not challenge the promulgation of the nfp itself or the a regulations.srep complaint refers to specific instances of suction dredge mining operations that took place without an approved plan of operations in waterways administered by the forest service.the complaint further alleges that barton and hobbs have mined their claims,and intend to do so in the future those mining operations occurred without an approved plan or plans of operations,and without a reclamation plan or bond,where required.
srep allegations challenge specific instances of the forest service actions taken pursuant to its interpretation of,and therefore constitute more than a programmatic attack or a vague reference to forest service action or inaction.see oregon natural desert ass united states forest,cir.we therefore reject the forest service arguments to the contrary,and conclude that,in light of srep challenges to final agency action,we have jurisdiction pursuant to 
standard of review 
we review de novo a grant of summary judgment.native ecosystems council united states forest,cir citing ground zero ctr.for action united states dep t of navy,cir.the judicial review provisions of the apa govern our review of agency under the nfma,because the nfma does not contain an express provision for judicial review.id.an agency decision may only be set aside under the apa if it was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.this standard,while narrow,nonetheless requires the court to engage in a substantial inquiry,a thorough,probing,review.native ecosystems council,at.t he agency must present a rational connection between the facts found and the conclusions made.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
iii.discussion 
standard and guideline 
as noted above,the nfp specifies that none of the standards and guidelines,including,apply if they are contrary to existing law or regulation.standards and guidelines at.the forest service february memorandum to regional foresters interpreted narrowly,concluding that a broader interpretation would result in a conflict between and a.as we explain below,we agree with the forest service that its interpretation of is entitled to deference.
whether the forest service interpretation is entitled to deference 
agencies are entitled to deference to their interpretation of their own regulations,including forest plans.native ecosystems council,at citation and internal quotations omitted see also hells canyon alliance united states forest,cir.indeed,although forest plans are adopted under a,we have effectively treated forest plan directives as equivalent to federal regulations adopted under the apa,deferring to the forest service interpretation of plan directives that are susceptible to more than one meaning unless the interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the directive.see forest guardians united states forest,cir citing thomas jefferson shalala,d hells canyon alliance,at citing auer robbins,d 
in contrast,where neither the scope nor the effect of the regulation in question is ambiguous,t here is no call for deference to the agency legal interpretation.lands council powell,cir the forest service asserts that we owe its interpretation deference as a reasonable interpretation of an ambiguity in a forest plan there is no call for deference to the agency legal interpretation of these two standards,however,because neither the scope nor the effect of the two standards is ambiguous.citation omitted see also christensen harris county,d auer deference is warranted only when the language of the regulation is ambiguous.thus,an agency may not,under the guise of interpreting a regulation,create de facto a new regulation.christensen,at.the fact that an agency interpretation has fluctuated over time,however,does not make it unworthy of deference.kennedy plan adm r for dupont sav.inv.plan,d citing long island care at home,coke,d.
srep contends that irrespective of the mandatory language in,it is not contrary to the discretionary elements of a.according to srep,simply makes the decision for the line officer that mining in a riparian reserve requires a plan of operations.thus,srep argues,this blanket requirement imposes a supplemental guideline that is consistent with,not contrary to,a.
indeed,srep points out that the forest service knew when it was developing the nfp that would significantly limit mining operations in riparian reserves,and that was in fact adopted to fulfill the forest service duties under the nfma to provide for a diversity of species.as support for its position,srep relies on statements in a draft of the forest service final supplemental environmental impact statement for the nfp to show that it was intended to significantly affect mining operations in order to protect wild salmon 
the development of mineral resources may be limited by the land allocations and the standards and guidelines proposed in the alternatives.however,the more likely effect of designating areas for habitat for the northern spotted owl and other and related species would be that additional measures to protect habitat would be required under mineral leases and in plans for locatable mineral development.
draft final supplemental environmental impact statement,chapter,affected environment and environmental consequences,srep excerpts of record at.
while srep interpretation is not unreasonable,we agree with the forest service assessment,as reflected in the february memorandum,that the meaning of is not entirely free from doubt.bassiri xerox,cir quoting providence health.thompson,cir.the first part of requires plans of operations for all mineral operations involving riparian reserves.this provision conflicts with a,which was adopted long before and requires a plan of operations only when a district ranger determines that the proposed mining operations will likely cause significant disturbance of surface resources.that is,while a contemplates that a district ranger will undertake a determination of whether a plan of operations is needed,appears to impose such a requirement on all mining operations in riparian reserves.
the second part of,however,as noted in the february memorandum,refers to recontouring of disturbed areas,salvage and replacement of topsoil,and other details that must be included in an approved plan of operations.this provision of appears to encompass the same threshold standard as a,implying that only where the mining operation poses a risk of significant surface disturbance will a plan of operations or bond be required.the past disputes over the meaning of in light of a further highlight its opacity see supra see also bassiri,at.
as previously noted,the nfp declares that any standard and guideline,including,shall not apply when contrary to existing law or regulation.because is susceptible to different interpretations and given the discretionary elements of a,we agree with the forest service that is ambiguous.it is not clear whether reference to all mining operations that include riparian reserves applies to those mining operations that are not likely to cause any significant disturbance of surface resources,or whether it applies to every operation in these designated areas.
thus,we will defer to the forest service interpretation of unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with.under this standard,we defer to the agency interpretation of its regulation unless an alternative reading is compelled by the regulation plain language or by other indications of the agency intent at the time of the regulation promulgation.bassiri,at quoting shalala,at.internal quotation marks omitted.the same reasons that compel the conclusion that is ambiguous lead us to hold that the forest service narrow interpretation is a reasonable reconciliation of and a.
the forest service interpretation of is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with 
in light of the text of and the binding force of the nfp standards and guidelines,srep mandatory interpretation would not be problematic if were the only forest service directive at issue.as previously noted,however,none of the standards and where they would be contrary to existing law or regulation.
under srep interpretation of,it requires a reclamation plan,approved plan of operations,and reclamation bond for all minerals operations that include riparian reserves emphasis added.section a,in contrast,provides that a plan of operations shall be required only i f the district ranger determines that such operations will likely cause significant disturbance of surface resources.emphasis added.we agree with the forest service that a provides that a plan of operations is required only when significant disturbance of surface resources is therefore one is not required when significant disturbance is not likely.in other words,determining which operations are likely to cause significant disturbance of surface therefore require a plan of a discretionary determination by a district ranger 
neither by its express terms,nor as interpreted by srep,does account for such a discretionary determination.instead,it eliminates discretion by requiring plans of operations for mining activity that might cause disturbance of surface resources,yet are not likely to do thus would require only a notice of intent under a.the forest service february interpretation is a reasonable effort to address and resolve the inconsistency between the two directives.
we note that the forest service interpretation is also consistent with congress interest in the development of mineral resources.see a ll valuable mineral deposits in lands belonging to the united states,both surveyed and unsurveyed,shall be free and open to exploration and purchase see also acknowledging the secretary of agriculture authority under,and other provisions,to prescribe rules and regulations to prevent depredations upon the public forests and national forests but noting such authorization shall not be construed as prohibiting any person from entering upon such national forests for all proper and lawful purposes,including that of prospecting,locating,and developing the mineral resources thereof discussing how the united states right to manage and dispose of vegetative surface rights must be balanced against the prospecting,mining,or processing operations of miners.the forest service acknowledges,and we have recognized,that mining rights may not be unreasonably restricted in the performance of forest service duties.see united states shumway,cir internal citation omitted.
in sum,is susceptible to several reasonable interpretations.to adopt srep interpretation would require a plan of operations for every mining operation involving riparian reserves,and would be contrary to a specification that a plan of operations is required only after the district ranger so determines.the forest service narrow february interpretation of is a reasonable attempt to reconcile the conflict between the two directives,and was neither legally erroneous nor contrary to.we therefore defer to the forest service interpretation,and affirm the grant of summary judgment to the forest service.
