the north gualala water company ngwc appeals from a judgment denying two consolidated petitions for writ of mandate.the petitions challenge the state water resources control board board jurisdiction to compel ngwc to obtain a permit to pump groundwater from two wells located near the north fork gualala river,as well as the board interpretation of pumping limitations placed on the permit.in an issue of first impression,the parties dispute the proper construction of the statutory phrase,subterranean streams flowing through known and definite channels,which has defined the board permitting jurisdiction over the state groundwater resources since as a fallback position in the event that the board statutory permitting authority over the wells is upheld,ngwc argues that the board has placed unwarranted conditions on the company permit.we affirm the trial court judgment denying ngwc petitions.
background 
permit and term 
ngwc provides municipal water service to approximately customers in,or near,the town of gualala.between and,ngwc diverted surface water directly from the north fork of the gualala river north fork by means of an infiltration gallery located at the confluence of the north fork and the little north fork gualala river this diversion was authorized by appropriative permit permit,issued by the board predecessor in.
permit authorized ngwc to divert two cubic feet per second from the north fork.to resolve a protest to its permit application by the california department of fish and game dfg,ngwc agreed to accept limitations on its right to divert water from the river that were intended to maintain instream flows for the protection of fish life.these limitations were set forth in term of the permit.however,given flow conditions in the north fork at that time,term in its original form never actually limited ngwc diversions.
in,as a result of a further protest by dfg and after discussions between ngwc and dfg,the board amended term to read as follows for the protection of fish and wildlife,permittee shall during the period a from november through february,bypass a minimum of cubic feet per second b from march through may,bypass a minimum of cubic feet per second c from june through november,bypass a minimum of cubic feet per second.the total streamflow shall be bypassed whenever it is less than the designated amount for that period.under certain flow conditions,the amended term did restrict ngwc right to divert water from the north fork.
ngwc production wells proceedings 
in and,ngwc developed two production wells,wells and,in an area adjacent to the north fork known as elk prairie.both wells were located approximately feet from the river.one purpose of constructing the wells was to improve the quality of water and reduce water treatment costs.the wells draw groundwater from depths of approximately and feet below the ground.
when ngwc developed well it did not seek any water right permit for it because ngwc believed that well was pumping percolating groundwater which is not subject to the board permitting jurisdiction.see.in a june letter replying to a third party complaint lodged against ngwc by the gualala river steelhead project,the chief of the board division of water rights addressed the jurisdictional issue as follows your letter also requested information regarding ngwc river deep well.our information indicates that the well is located near the north fork gualala river,about feet upstream of ngwc point of diversion.the well is about feet deep.analysis of the well water indicates that it has a composition different than the surface supply which suggests that well water is percolating ground water,not river underflow.the board does not have jurisdiction over the use of percolating ground water.
in november,a groundwater geologist hired by the sea ranch water company,richard slade,reported to the board that relatively impermeable rock formations underlie the north fork channel,that the stream valley itself is filled with alluvial deposits of unconsolidated layers of gravel,sand,silt,and clay,and that a water quality analysis indicated that the source of the well water was the gualala river system.the report concluded that the groundwater extracted by well from the alluvium underneath elk prairie was from a subterranean stream as defined by the board.based on the slade report,the board staff notified ngwc that its extraction from well was an illegal diversion of water,and advised it to submit a water right application for the well.
in february,ngwc filed a petition to change the authorized points of diversion in permit to include well.in its petition,ngwc stated that it was reserving the right to challenge the board conclusion that well pumped water from a subterranean stream after conducting additional field work.ngwc filed a petition to add well to permit in.
in january,ngwc consultants,luhdorff scalmanini consulting engineers,filed a technical report with the board regarding the groundwater pumped by wells and.based on its own measurements and data collection,luhdorff scalmanini concluded that the groundwater in the alluvial deposits under the elk prairie is not recharged from the north fork and is not flowing in a subterranean stream.contrary to the conclusion of the slade report,luhdorff scalmanini found that the groundwater underneath elk prairie is maintained by a combination of deep percolation of surface precipitation during the rainy season and subsurface flow from the underlying bedrock formations into the alluvium during the dry season.also contrary to slade analysis,luhdorff scalmanini concluded that the underlying bedrock beneath elk prairie was not relatively impermeable,but was highly fractured and permeable,most likely due to its proximity to the san andreas fault zone.
the chief of the board division of water rights responded to ngwc that,after reviewing luhdorff scalmanini analysis,the division of water rights still believed the groundwater pumped by wells and was flowing in a known and definite channel,and thus was subject to the board jurisdiction.citing slade analysis,other studies of the area,and the board own investigations,the division of water rights rejected luhdorff scalmanini critical finding that the bedrock was permeable to water relative to the overlying alluvium.it opined instead that it appears that the bedrock is sufficiently impervious relative to the alluvial aquifer material to form the bed and banks of a subterranean stream.the division of water rights advised that if ngwc wished to withdraw its petition to change the point of diversion,it would recommend that the board hold a groundwater classification hearing to resolve the issue of the board permitting authority.
ngwc made no formal request for a groundwater classification hearing at that time.it informed the board that it wished to continue the process of petitioning to change the point of diversion,while reserving the issue of groundwater classification for any future hearing to be held on its change petitions.
in august,the board adopted order which granted ngwc petitions to substitute wells and for the previous points of diversion.dfg and other fishing interests protested the change sought by ngwc.the protestants expressed concern that ngwc was not meeting the bypass flow requirements of term,and that the company would have trouble supplying the water demand of its customers if it was required to reduce diversions from the wells to meet these requirements.to address these concerns,order required as a condition of the approval that ngwc submit a surface flow measurement plan to ensure compliance with term of permit.a subsequent order,order wr,added a further condition that ngwc prepare a water supply contingency plan to address how municipal water needs would be met if the natural flow of the north fork fell below the minimum amounts specified in term.
ngwc did not challenge any of the findings or conditions in the orders,but proceeded to develop and file proposed plans for measuring surface flows and addressing water supply contingencies.in january and august,the board staff requested changes in these plans.through its attorneys,ngwc agreed to some of the changes.at the same time,ngwc asserted that the board had never issued a formal decision on the issue of whether the groundwater pumped by wells and was part of a subterranean stream or percolating groundwater,and that ngwc had not waived its rights on that issue.in addition,ngwc disputed whether,by its terms,the second sentence of term t he total streamflow shall be bypassed whenever it is less than the designated amount for that period placed any limitation on the pumping of groundwater from wells and so long as the pumping did not reach a level that would reverse the normal groundwater gradient between the wells and the river,thereby reducing surface streamflows.ngwc requested that its issues concerning the classification of the groundwater and the application of term be resolved through a formal hearing.
in april,the chief of the division of water rights informed ngwc that its plans were not approved.the chief letter explained that term applied to any diversions of water under the permit,and since wells and are the only points of diversion in the permit,term applied to them.ngwc petitioned the board for reconsideration of the chief decision.the petition asked the board to hold a hearing on the legal classification of the groundwater pumped by wells and and on the interpretation of term.
in order wr,issued in june,the board upheld the chief decision that ngwc water measurement and water supply plans were inadequate determined that a groundwater classification hearing was not properly part of a proceeding seeking reconsideration of the chief decision to disapprove the two plans submitted by ngwc discussed and rejected ngwc interpretation that term was not a limitation on its ability to pump groundwater from wells and and invited ngwc to petition to change the bypass flow requirements in term and to bring the groundwater classification issue before the board,either by raising it as a defense to a future enforcement action or by initiating an independent proceeding.
in july,ngwc filed a complaint for declaratory relief and petition for writ of mandate challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support order wr mandate petition.ngwc mandate petition also challenged the board interpretation of term.the trial court stayed the case in december to allow ngwc to formally petition the board for a groundwater classification hearing and to permit the board to resolve that issue before the case proceeded.
groundwater classification hearing 
ngwc filed its request for a groundwater classification hearing in january and a hearing was conducted on june and.in addition to ngwc,the participants included dfg and a permitting team from the division of water rights.by established board procedure,the permitting team was separated by an ethical wall from the hearing team that assisted the hearing officer and board members in the hearing.
the board proposed to apply a test for determining whether groundwater fell within its permitting authority that it had first utilized in a decision concerning the garrapata water company f or groundwater to be classified as a subterranean stream flowing through a known and definite channel,the following physical conditions must exist.a subsurface channel must be present.the channel must have a relatively impermeable bed and banks.the course of the channel must be known or capable of being determined by reasonable inference and.groundwater must be flowing in the channel.in re garrapata water june,state wat.resources control bd.as of may,garrapata.the board based the garrapata test on its reading of an california supreme court case,city of los angeles pomeroy cal,pomeroy.
ngwc accepted the test with certain qualifications,but argued that the groundwater pumped by wells and did not satisfy its requirements because the only subsurface channel present,that formed by the alluvial materials in the vicinity of the north fork,does not narrow or contract in the direction of the alleged flow as would be required under a correct reading of pomeroy the franciscan bedrock forming the bed and banks of the alluvial channel is not sufficiently impermeable to satisfy the second element of the test and the groundwater underneath elk prairie is not in fact flowing in the channel,but in a direction perpendicular to it.
dfg expressed its concern that absent regulation by water right permit,ngwc could significantly expand its pumping and reduce river flows to levels inadequate for fish protection.
the board found in order wro that all elements of its test had been met and that the water pumped from ngwc wells required a water right permit.upon ngwc ensuing petition for reconsideration,the board rejected ngwc argument that the water in a subterranean stream must always be flowing in a direction parallel to the sides of the subsurface channel.the board found that water is in fact flowing generally downstream within the channel under elk prairie,following a hydraulic gradient and following the path of least resistance.
mandate petition 
in may,ngwc filed a new petition for writ of mandate,challenging order wro,which was eventually consolidated with ngwc mandate petition.
the trial court concluded that the board test was the appropriate means of making the determination required by section.the court applied the substantial evidence standard to each of the four elements,and found that substantial evidence existed to support the board findings as to all four elements.the court denied ngwc consolidated petitions for writ of mandate,and entered judgment in favor of the board on december.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
the parties differ over the applicable standard of review.the board concedes that its interpretation of the subterranean stream language in section is subject to de novo review,but argues that if the garrapata test properly effectuates the intent of that language,the board findings that the various elements of the test have been satisfied must be upheld unless they are unsupported by substantial evidence.ngwc maintains that this court must conduct a de novo review of the board determination that it has jurisdiction over the wells because the board made no findings of fact on the principal disputed factual issues.
ngwc had maintained that to be part of a subterranean stream coming within section the groundwater must flow in a direction generally parallel to the subterranean channel and not be maintained by subsurface inflows emanating from fractures in the underlying bedrock.it asserts that order wro contained no findings of fact on these disputed factual issues.according to ngwc,the board must therefore have determined as a matter of law that the groundwater is part of a subterranean stream for purposes of section based solely on the fact that the groundwater occurs in alluvial deposits which are more permeable than the franciscan bedrock underlying them.although we do not believe this accurately characterizes the board findings or methodology in this case,we concur that the materiality of groundwater source and flow direction present questions of law that we will consider de novo.
in sum,both parties agree that the board interpretation of the subterranean stream clause of section presents a question of law subject to de novo review.issues regarding the materiality of groundwater source and flow direction under section also present questions of law subject to de novo review.to the extent that ngwc disputes any of the facts found by the board,as opposed to disputing the legal methodology the board applied to determine its jurisdiction,the board findings must be upheld unless they are unsupported by substantial evidence,subd.c code civ,subd.c.
deference due to board interpretation of section 
the parties also differ over the degree of deference which this court should give to the board interpretation of section.according to the board,because the legislature has delegated a designated field of expertise to the board,the board statutory interpretation should generally be followed unless it is clearly erroneous.san mateo city school dist.public employment relations bd.cal d.ngwc maintains that the proper standard is that applicable when a court must decide whether an agency regulation exceeds the authority delegated to the agency by the legislature.see yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,fn,d,yamaha environmental protection information center department of forestry fire protection th,d.according to ngwc,when an agency is construing a statute affecting its own jurisdiction,the proper standard of review is therefore one of respectful nondeference.environmental protection information center department of forestry fire protection,at,d.
yamaha distinguishes between two types of administrative rulemaking t here are two categories of administrative rules one an authentic form of substantive lawmaking within its jurisdiction,the agency has been delegated the legislature lawmaking power.citations.when a court assesses the validity of such rules,the scope of its review is narrow.if satisfied that the rule in question lay within the lawmaking authority delegated by the legislature,and that it is reasonably necessary to implement the purpose of the statute,judicial review is at an end.t he other class of administrative rules,those interpreting a statute,does not implicate the exercise of a delegated lawmaking power instead,it represents the agency view of the statute legal meaning and effect,questions lying within the constitutional domain of the courts.but because the agency will often be interpreting a statute within its administrative jurisdiction,it may possess special familiarity with satellite legal and regulatory issues.it is this expertise,expressed as an interpretation whether in a regulation or less formally,that is the source of the presumptive value of the agency views.an important corollary of agency interpretations,however,is their diminished power to bind.because an interpretation is an agency legal opinion,however expert,rather than the exercise of a delegated legislative power to make law,it commands a commensurably lesser degree of judicial deference.yamaha,supra,cal th at,d,italics omitted.
the interpretation of section that the board has formulated in the context of deciding the garrapata and subsequent groundwater cases comes within the class of administrative rules interpreting a statute under yamaha.deciding these cases is not an exercise of the board power to adopt regulations of general applicability.thus,we reject the board proposed on case we must defer to the board interpretation of section unless it is clearly erroneous.at the same time,the issue before us is not whether the board has adopted a regulation or test that is outside of the realm of authority delegated to it by the legislature.whether the board interpretation of section is correct or not,its power to formulate and apply a construction of that statute in the course of adjudicating permitting disputes is not in question in this proceeding.the board could not decide groundwater classification issues if it did not have that power.ngwc proposed standard of respectful nondeference is thus also inapplicable.
the degree of deference to which the board interpretation of section is entitled depends on a series of factors identified in yamaha there are two broad categories of factors relevant to a court assessment of the weight due an agency interpretation those indicating that the agency has a comparative interpretive advantage over the courts,and those indicating that the interpretation in question is probably correct.citations.in the first category are factors that assume the agency has expertise and technical knowledge,especially where the legal text to be interpreted is technical,obscure,complex,or entwined with issues of fact,policy,and discretion.a court is more likely to defer to an agency interpretation of its own regulation than to its interpretation of a statute,since the agency is likely to be intimately familiar with regulations it authored and sensitive to the practical implications of one interpretation over another.citation.the second group of factors those suggesting the agency interpretation is likely to be indications of careful consideration by senior agency officials an interpretation of a statute contained in a regulation adopted after public notice and comment is more deserving of deference than one contained in an advice letter prepared by a single staff member citation,evidence that the agency has consistently maintained the interpretation in question,especially if it is citation a vacillating position is entitled to no deference citation,and indications that the agency interpretation was contemporaneous with legislative enactment of the statute being interpreted.if an agency has adopted an interpretive rule in accordance with administrative procedure act include procedures,notice to the public of the proposed rule and opportunity for public comment that enhance the accuracy and reliability of the resulting administrative product that circumstance weighs in favor of judicial deference.however,even formal interpretive rules do not command the same weight as rules.because the ultimate resolution of legal questions rests with the courts citation,judges play a greater role when reviewing the persuasive value of interpretive rules than they do in determining the validity of rules.yamaha,supra,cal th at,d.
the relevant situational factors in this case counsel in favor of limited deference to the board interpretation of the statutory language,as embodied in the garrapata test.the language in issue is unique to section,and has no analogue elsewhere in the statutes of this state.judging from the record before us,even expert hydrologists disagree about the physical conditions and range of naturally occurring phenomena to which the subterranean stream language might refer.translating that language into a usable and practical legal test therefore necessarily draws upon areas of the board technical expertise,experience,and familiarity with its own prior precedents.although the garrapata test does not reflect a administrative interpretation of section,it has been adopted and applied by the agency highest officials in a considered manner following contested proceedings.these factors warrant some degree of deference on our part to the test the agency has formulated.at the same time,our analysis of the history,text,and intent of the subterranean stream language leads us to the conclusion that the board jurisdiction over groundwater was intended to be the exception rather than the rule when the legislature adopted the language in issue.where the board appears to be seeking endorsement for a more expansive construction of its potential jurisdiction,as in its reading of los angeles hunter cal,hunter,we have not deferred to the board views.
historical roots of the subterranean stream language in section 
california is the only western state that still treats surface water and groundwater under separate and distinct legal regimes.sax,we do do groundwater a morsel of california legal history.water,hereafter we do do groundwater.the persistence of these alternative regimes inevitably leads to thorny issues of classification and.as the present case illustrates,classification disputes in this field quickly take on an quality because the legal categories,subterranean streams flowing through known and definite channels,percolating water are drawn from antiquated case law and bear little or no relationship to hydrological realities.see generally,we do do groundwater,at.because the legislature has shown little inclination to reformulate this area of law,we are left to try to construe and apply a legal classification that is borrowed from cases decided more than years ago.
origin of section 
section derives from section of the water commission act of,which was passed by the legislature in as part of assembly bill,and became effective following a public referendum on december.see stats,ch,people shirokow,supra,cal d at,fn.the water commission act grew out of a report by the california conservation commission commission,which found that the means of regulating the appropriation of water and water rights did not adequately protect the public interest in the state water resources,and did not effectively settle disputes over water rights.regarding underground water,the commission called for its statutory regulation and predicted that the failure to enact such legislation would result in increasing litigation over the use of underground water.
as introduced in january,assembly bill would have given the board predecessor,the state water commission,the power to investigate and determine appropriative rights to water or the use of water in all streams,stream systems,portions of stream systems,lakes,or other bodies of water in the state.assem.bill reg.sess.section of the bill as introduced provided that t he word water in this act shall be construed as embracing the term or use of water and the term or use of water in this act shall be construed as embracing the word water.the bill broad grant of authority to the water commission made no apparent distinction between underground and surface water.however,by amendments made on april and,the following sentence limiting the state water commission jurisdiction to surface water was added to section whenever the terms stream,stream system,lake or other body of water or water occurs in this act,such term shall be interpreted to refer only to surface water.italics added.finally,on april,the phrase and to subterranean streams flowing through known and definite channels was added to this sentence of section.
the record before us contains no evidence of contemporaneous statements discussing the legislative intent of the subterranean stream language in section of the water commission act,and no published court cases have interpreted the phrase since its enactment into law in.from the sequence of amendments made to section of assembly bill,it appears that the legislature deliberately rejected wording that might otherwise have supported a broad assertion of jurisdiction over subsurface water.the addition,a few weeks later,of the phrase and to subterranean streams flowing through known and definite channels can not reasonably be construed as an attempt to restore any major part of that jurisdiction.first,in contrast to the broad and inclusive list used to describe the state water commission surface water jurisdiction stream,stream system,lake or other body of water,the phrase subterranean streams flowing through known and definite channels seems deliberately narrow.virtually every word in it sets a limiting condition,flowing,known,definite,channel that seems to reduce its breadth.second,the use of the word only in the sentence is inconsistent with any legislative intent or understanding that jurisdiction over subterranean streams would encompass a major part of the state groundwater resources.
as discussed below,the concept of a subterranean stream flowing through a known and definite channel did not spring fully formed from the deliberations over assembly bill.the concept played an important role in a series of california supreme court water rights cases going back to.one california supreme court case,pomeroy,used language identical to that adopted by the legislature in.the parties have therefore properly focused our attention on these water law authorities.see people lawrence cal th,d,where the language of a statute uses terms that have been judicially construed there is a strong presumption that the terms carry the same technical meaning that had been placed upon them by the courts.
distinction between flowing and percolating groundwater 
in several cases decided between and,the california supreme court addressed the distinction between groundwater flowing in subterranean streams and groundwater that was considered to be merely percolating through the soil.the former was governed by riparian and appropriative restrictions on use while the latter was until subject to the unrestricted ownership rights of the overlying property owner.thus,in hanson mccue cal,the court observed that a subterranean stream of a defined character,and flowing in a defined channel would be subject to the same riparian rules that govern the use of similar streams flowing upon the surface of the earth.in contrast,w ater filtrating or percolating in the soil belongs to the owner of the the rocks and minerals found there.hanson mccue,at see also,southern pac.dufour cal,gould eaton cal,pomeroy,supra,cal.at,vineland irr.dist.azusa irr.cal,katz walkinshaw cal,katz hunter,supra,cal.at.under the case law,groundwater was presumed to be percolating the burden of showing that it flowed instead in a defined subterranean stream rested with the party asserting rights in such a stream.see hanson mccue,at pomeroy,at,arroyo and baldwin cal.
the pomeroy case 
among all of the cases,pomeroy contains the most extended and detailed discussion of how to classify groundwater as either water flowing in a subterranean stream or percolating in the soil.it also utilizes language identical to that later adopted by the legislature in section of the water commission act.the specific phrase,subterranean streams flowing through known and definite channels,appeared for the first time in pomeroy and the pomeroy court emphasized that the main question in the case was the proper definition of a subterranean stream.pomeroy,supra,cal.at.pomeroy accordingly provides the best available evidence of the original legislative intent of the phrasing now found in section.
the central issue in pomeroy was the valuation of lands condemned by the city of los angeles under its eminent domain powers.pomeroy,supra,cal.at.the lands were to be used for the purpose of constructing a tunnel and filtration galleries to divert water flowing underneath the bed of the los angeles river at its narrow outlet from the san fernando valley,to supply the city inhabitants.id.at.the city asserted that the groundwater on the defendants property was part of the river underflow for which the city would not have to pay compensation.id.at.the defendants maintained that the groundwater was percolating groundwater which they owned and for which compensation must be made in the jury award.id.at.after being instructed in detail about how to distinguish percolating groundwater from water flowing in a subterranean stream,the jury made no award for the value of the water.id.at.on appeal in the supreme court,the defendants challenged several of the jury instructions on this issue.id.at.the court affirmed the judgment and upheld the trial court instructions.id.at.
pomeroy rejected the defendants claim that all water passing through sand,gravel,and boulders is percolating water and instead endorsed the view that a subterranean stream can exist when the material through which the water forces itself fills a channel with impervious sides and bed.pomeroy,supra,cal.at.later in the opinion,the court observed that such a channel could be formed by the comparatively impervious mountain sides creating the opening through which the disputed water passed out of the san fernando valley.id.at,italics added.
turning its attention to the proper definition of a subterranean stream,the pomeroy court quoted in full from and endorsed as a correct statement of the law the following discussion found in clesson kinney volume,a treatise on the law of irrigation hereafter kinney on irrigation subterranean or underground water courses are,as their names indicate,those water currents that flow under the surface of the earth.a large portion of the great plains and valleys of the mountainous regions of the west is underlaid by a stratum of sand and gravel,and fed by the water from the mountain drainage.this stratum is of great thickness,the water is moving freely through it,is practically inexhaustible,and,if it can be brought to the surface,will irrigate a large portion of the country overlying it.in and near the mountains many streams have a bed which was originally a rocky canyon,but has been filled up with boulders and coarse gravel.in this debris a large portion or all of the water sinks from sight,to reappear only when some rocky reef crosses the channel and forces the water to the surface.the movement of this water through the porous gravel,owing to the declivity of the stream,is often quite rapid,and a considerable volume may thus pass down the channel hidden from sight.
these watercourses are divided into two distinct whose channels are known or defined,and those unknown and undefined.it is necessary to bear this distinction in mind in our discussion,as they are governed by entirely different principles of law.and in this connection it will be well to say that the word defined means a contracted and bounded channel,though the course of the stream may be undefined by human knowledge and the word known refers to knowledge of the course of the stream by reasonable inference.regarding the laws governing these two classes,it must be known that if underground currents of water flow in and known channels,the course of which can be distinctly traced,they are governed by the same rules of law that govern streams flowing upon the surface of the earth.
the owner of land under which a stream flows can,therefore,maintain an action for the diversion of it if such diversion takes place under the same circumstances as would enable him to recover if the stream had been wholly above ground.but for this purpose the underground water must flow in known and channels in order that the riparian owner or appropriator may invoke the same rules as are applied to surface streams,or otherwise the presumption will be that they have their sources in the ordinary percolations through the soil.this rule practically disposes of the second class of subterranean whose channels are unknown and there are undoubtedly a great many underground streams whose waters flow in confined channels but whose courses are not known,and,following the above rule,these are all classed with percolating waters.pomeroy,supra,cal.at,quoting kinney on irrigation,supra,italics added.
the pomeroy court goes on to apply these definitions and distinctions to the case before it in this case the boundaries of the channel and the existence and course of the underground stream were unknown and undefined except so far as they could be inferred,but there was a great amount of evidence from which a reasonable inference could be drawn that the channel was bounded and defined by the sloping sides of the cahuenga and verdugo hills meeting under ground,and that there was a subsurface flow corresponding with the surface flow from west to east out through the gap.without any excavation beneath the surface,or other test or experiment,all this could be inferred from the topography of the country,the amount of rainfall and the gradually augmenting volume of the surface stream in its approach to the narrowest point in the pass.and the court was certainly justified in submitting to the jury the question whether the subsurface flow was a part of the stream unless the mere fact that it was forcing its way through sand and gravel and boulders deprived it of the character of a stream.upon this point we are satisfied that the view of the superior court was the reasonable and just view and not opposed to anything that has ever been decided in this court.pomeroy,supra,cal.at.
parties conflicting analyses of section 
as an initial matter,the board claims that ngwc can not challenge whether the garrapata test reflects a correct interpretation of section on this appeal because ngwc failed to exhaust its administrative remedies.the board maintains that both sides explicitly accepted the garrapata framework in their arguments and presentation of evidence before the board,but merely disputed whether certain elements of the test were satisfied as applied to the groundwater pumped by ngwc wells.see san franciscans upholding the downtown plan city and county of san francisco th,d exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine bars party from offering its own property appraisal methodology for the first time on appeal.ngwc insists that it did exhaust its administrative remedies because it expressly argued to the board that the garrapata test must be qualified in specified respects,and the arguments and evidence on which it relies on appeal are in substance identical to those it advanced in the administrative proceedings.with the possible exception of one argument,discussed below,that ngwc raised for first time in the trial court,we agree with ngwc and the trial court that there was no failure to exhaust administrative remedies.we will therefore consider ngwc arguments on their merits.
with one exception,ngwc does not disagree that the wording of the board test,as far as it goes,is consistent with pomeroy.thus,ngwc does not disagree that under pomeroy the existence of a subterranean stream flowing through a known and definite channel requires that a subsurface channel be present,that the course of the channel be known or capable of being determined by reasonable inference,and that groundwater be flowing in the channel.ngwc also agrees that the channel must have a bed and banks,although it disagrees that a bed and banks composed of relatively impermeable materials would suffice under pomeroy.in essence,ngwc argues that the garrapata test omits important limiting factors that are found in or implicit in the case law.without these limitations,ngwc maintains that the test is over inclusive and therefore overstates the board statutory jurisdiction 
meaning of contracted 
first,ngwc argues that pomeroy definition of a defined channel as a contracted and bounded channel means that the width of the channel must be narrowing rather than widening as the groundwater flows through it.according to ngwc,this was clearly the case in pomeroy where the court was concerned with a relatively narrow outlet from the san fernando valley.in contrast,the channel posited by the board in this case is not contracted at elk prairie,but widens at that location.
ngwc places too much weight on the word contracted.pomeroy quoted the phrase contracted and bounded from kinney on irrigation.pomeroy,supra,cal.at.the phrase apparently derived from two earlier irish cases.see kinney on irrigation,supra,fn.black ballymena township cmmrs.ewart belfast guardians.a few cases from other jurisdictions have also quoted this formulation,citing kinney on irrigation.see huber merkel,deadwood cent.barker.none of these authorities,including pomeroy,support ngwc thesis that unless the channel through which the groundwater is flowing is narrowing or contracting the water is not flowing in a definite channel.aside from the bare use of the word contracted none of the authorities discusses or endorses any such restriction in classifying groundwater.in context,the word contracted appears to mean simply that the channel constrains and controls the flow of the groundwater compared to how the water would behave if the channel did not exist.there is no indication in pomeroy or any of the other authorities that determining whether a subterranean channel is narrowing,widening,or maintaining the same width is essential to the classification of the groundwater flowing in it.
meaning of bounded 
second,ngwc argues that the bed and banks of a subterranean channel must be more than relatively impermeable.in ngwc view,the proper test under pomeroy is whether the bed and banks present a significant boundary to groundwater flow.in ngwc formulation,the relative permeability of the materials composing the bed and banks is a potentially relevant but never dispositive factor in that determination.the critical question,according to ngwc,is whether the bed and banks are sufficiently impermeable that they prevent the transmission of all but relatively minor quantities through the channel boundary quoting language actually used by the board in its garrapata decision.ngwc argues that the second element of the test,as so modified,has not been established.according to ngwc expert,the majority of the groundwater in the alluvium under wells and originates in the franciscan formation north of elk prairie and then flows south across the interface between the franciscan rock and the alluvium.if so,then the channel boundary between the bedrock and alluvium at elk prairie is not an effective barrier to the transmission of groundwater.
according to the board,the critical question in deciding whether a definite subterranean channel exists is whether groundwater,once it enters the channel,will be confined to it.this,in turn,is a function of the permeability of the materials filling the channel compared to those forming the channel bed and banks,as well as of the gradient or slope at which the groundwater is descending toward sea level.the board cites the testimony of ngwc expert that the flow of water across the interface between the bedrock and the alluvium on the north side of elk prairie is a flow water flows into the alluvium but no water flows back out into the bedrock.the board also notes,and ngwc implicitly concedes,that no natural,geologic boundary is percent impermeable.
in our view,the board position is more consistent with pomeroy and other case law than is ngwc.these cases focus not on the source of the water gathered in a subterranean stream,but on the physical coherence of the stream once it is formed where percolating waters collect or are gathered in a stream running in a defined channel,no distinction exists between waters so running under the surface or upon the surface of land.cross kitts cal.water passing through the soil,not in a stream,but by way of filtration,is not distinctive from the soil itself the water forms one of its component parts.in this condition it is not the subject of appropriation.when,however,it gathers in sufficient volume,whether by percolation or otherwise,to form a running stream,it no longer partakes of the nature of the soil,but has become separate and distinct therefrom and constitutes a stream of flowing water subject to appropriation.de wolfskill smith.as stated in one of the jury instructions approved in pomeroy if such underground watercourse exists,it is immaterial,so far as the watercourse is concerned,from or through what lands the waters flow in reaching the channel,or whether they reach the same by percolation or by clearly defined streams.pomeroy,supra,cal.at.
thus,nothing in the case law suggests that the seepage of water into a subterranean or surface stream through bedrock fissures or fractures,as posited by ngwc expert,negates the existence of a known and definite subterranean channel,any more than the infiltration or seepage of water into a surface stream negates its character as a defined surface channel 
the type of comparative analysis required by the board test is certainly consistent with pomeroy,which described the mountain sides forming the bed and banks of the alluvial channel in issue there as comparatively impervious.pomeroy,supra,cal.at.just as the bed and banks of surface streams necessarily permit some seepage of water,an absolute standard that subterranean channels be watertight would be entirely unrealistic.as stated in one of the jury instructions approved in pomeroy,the bed of a subterranean watercourse may consist of any material which keeps the waters from penetrating below a certain depth and such banks or sides may consist of any material which has the effect of confining the waters within circumscribed limits.id.at.we find nothing in pomeroy nor any evidence in the administrative record suggesting that a subsurface channel boundary that is two and or three orders of magnitude less permeable to water than the materials it contains is insufficient for those purposes.
while the board relatively impermeable bed and banks requirement might profit from greater specificity,we can not say that ngwc significant boundary formulation is an improvement,or that it is more consistent with the case law.it fails most notably to draw any distinction between the various means by which groundwater may enter the channel and the degree to which the channel contains and confines the water once it has entered.
relevance of flow direction 
third,ngwc points out that section and pomeroy both refer to subterranean streams flowing through a known and definite channel.pomeroy,supra,cal.at.ngwc construes this to mean that the groundwater flow must be parallel to the channel or,if not precisely parallel to it,then at least flowing in the same general direction at all times.ngwc maintains that the water pumped by wells and flunks this essential test because its flow direction underneath elk prairie is perpendicular to the alluvial channel forming the bed and banks of the asserted subterranean stream.in ngwc view,the flow direction is caused by the significant amounts of groundwater entering the alluvial channel through fractures in the bedrock north of elk prairie.according to ngwc,this stream is flowing across the defined alluvial channel,not through it as contemplated by section.ngwc rejects as inconsistent with the available data any theory that the groundwater underneath elk prairie is merely channelized groundwater moving in a westerly direction along the alluvial channel that has been deflected south by the damning effect of a subsurface geological formation.
dfg expert presented an alternative theory to account for the flow direction at elk prairie.he cited evidence which was disputed as insufficient by ngwc that groundwater is flowing from east to west through the subsurface channel just upstream of elk prairie,before it encounters a relatively impermeable clay layer under elk prairie which deflects it toward the south.he also believed that the proximity of the san andreas fault zone immediately to the west of elk prairie could contribute to the bend in subsurface flow direction toward the north fork.dfg expert rejected as speculative and unsupported ngwc theory that the bedrock north of elk prairie could be a significant source of groundwater flow into the alluvium that would account for its flow direction at elk prairie.
in its decision in this case,the board held specifically as follows the fourth element in the garrapata test does not require that the flow direction within the subterranean streamflow be parallel to the channel further,any directional deviation of the subterranean stream from parallel to the channel is irrelevant to the issue of whether ngwc wells are taking water from a subterranean stream in a known and definite channel.nothing in water code section or in the relevant case law requires that a subterranean stream exactly follow the course of the channel.therefore,the test is satisfied as long as the water is flowing within the channel.the board asserted that this analysis was consistent with the behavior of surface streams in a surface stream,the flow may deviate or even reverse at points from the general direction of flow as water enters from a tributary,flows around a barrier,or moves along the bottom of the stream.likewise,such deviations may occur in a subterranean stream.
subject to certain qualifications,we agree with the board position.nothing in the relevant case law requires that a subterranean stream precisely follow the course of the channel.as in surface streams,flow direction need not be parallel to the banks of the channel at all locations along its length.the presence of local obstructions or seasonal variations in flow volume,among other conditions,may affect flow direction.thus,a directional deviation of the subterranean stream from parallel to the channel at the point of diversion would,in general,be irrelevant to the issue of whether the board would have jurisdiction over appropriations from the stream,as the board stated in order wro.
at the same time,the further statement in the board decision that the garrapata test is satisfied as long as the water is flowing within the channel is gratuitous,and may invite an overbroad application of the garrapata test in future cases.construed together,the words of the subterranean stream clause clearly contemplate that the stream flows in the same general direction as the channel.the following sentence from pomeroy is illustrative t here are undoubtedly a great many underground streams whose waters flow in confined channels but whose courses are not known,and,following the above rule,these are all classed with percolating waters.pomeroy,supra,cal.at,quoting kinney on irrigation,supra.thus,as stated in kinney on irrigation,and as the supreme court recognized in pomeroy,a subsurface stream only avoids classification as percolating water if the course of the stream is known and definite.that the course of the channel through which it flows is known and definite matters only insofar as that course defines the course of the stream,and allows the latter to be ascertained.this point is underlined by the critical passage in pomeroy in which the court,using kinney on irrigation,defined the key terms later borrowed for section t he word defined means a contracted and bounded channel,though the course of the stream may be undefined by human knowledge and the word known refers to knowledge of the course of the stream by reasonable inference.pomeroy,at,italics added.
thus,the subterranean stream clause of section can not properly be construed to grant jurisdiction over a groundwater stream that wanders independently of the banks of the putative channel.such a reading would be inconsistent with pomeroy and with the original legal rationale for treating water flowing in definite underground streams differently from percolating groundwater.where,as in this case,the flow direction of the underground stream is perpendicular or nearly perpendicular to the banks of the asserted channel,some explanation is required for the stream extreme deviation from the general course of the channel.contrary to ngwc position,such a deviation or even a reverse flow at the point of diversion does not negate the existence of a subterranean stream flowing through a known and definite channel if such a flow direction can be satisfactorily explained by localized conditions that obstruct or divert the stream from its path along the channel.
the board recognized the need in this case to explain the flow direction of the stream under elk prairie in order wro by citing in a footnote to the testimony of dfg expert on this point.in its subsequent petition for reconsideration of order wro,ngwc attacked the expert opinions on this point as being unsupported and misleading.the board order denying reconsideration discussed the dfg expert testimony at some length and responded to ngwc contentions in relevant part as follows ngwc wants the footnote to state that it is just a report of the opinion of the dfg witness,and impliedly wants it not to be a finding of the board.further,ngwc argues that the entire footnote ignores ngwc rebuttal testimony.ngwc asserts that its rebuttal testimony was successful in demonstrating that the opinions of the dfg expert regarding flow direction are not supported by the available data and are contrary to basic principles of groundwater hydrology.the board disagrees with this assertion.the footnote points out that the record does contain substantial evidence in the form of testimony and exhibits presented by a qualified expert witness that explains why the groundwater is flowing from north to south at ngwc production wells.first,due to the subsurface conditions beneath elk prairie,one would not expect the groundwater to flow parallel to the channel at that location at the location of the wells,the clay sediments in the alluvium near the wells tend to force the subterranean streamflow into the more permeable parts of the alluvium,making it easier for the groundwater to flow around,rather than through,the clay sediments.second,the presence of clay deposits influences the groundwater gradient beneath ngwc property by causing the groundwater to flow in a more southerly direction in that area w ater in the channel flows in a gradient from a higher to a lower elevation within the channel.based on the evidence,the observed deviation of the groundwater flow direction at the wells from a predominantly east to west direction of the channel is consistent with a general downstream flow of the subterranean stream the evidence in the record demonstrates that water is in fact flowing generally downstream within the channel under elk prairie,following a hydraulic gradient and following the path of least resistance.

construing order wro and the board ensuing order denying reconsideration together,we believe the board did make adequate findings explaining the perpendicular flow direction of the stream underneath ngwc wells.the board found the flow direction at that site was caused by clay sediments under elk prairie that deflected the water toward the south.this explanation is consistent with and supportive of the board ultimate statutory finding that the groundwater in issue comes from a subterranean stream flowing through a known and definite channel.
ngwc also contends that the board failed to make a finding as to the source of the groundwater under its wells.however,it is inherent in the theory advanced by dfg the flow direction turns in a southerly direction at elk prairie due to subsurface geologic the alluvium to the east is a major source of the groundwater being pumped.this finding,and the evidence supporting it,was explicitly discussed in the board order denying reconsideration.
ngwc contends in the alternative that any findings made by the board concerning flow direction and water source are not supported by the evidence.while acknowledging that complex,conflicting evidence on the issue was presented by ngwc and dfg experts,ngwc merely asserts in conclusory fashion that the opinions on source and flow direction offered by the dfg expert were demonstrated to be incorrect by of him and by rebuttal evidence submitted by ngwc.we disagree.based on our review of the record,both sides drew reasonable but conflicting inferences from the very limited data points available.our task on appeal is not to decide whether different findings would have been more reasonable,but to determine whether any substantial evidence in the administrative record supports the board findings.code civ,subd.c northern inyo hosp.fair emp.practice com.d.in our view,the testimony and opinions of the dfg expert concerning flow direction and water source do constitute substantial evidence supporting the board findings on those issues.
ngwc proposed alternative approach 
finally,ngwc proposes that the garrapata test be scrapped altogether in favor of a classification of groundwater found in a treatise authored by samuel wiel,water rights in the western states.according to ngwc,three classes of underground water are recognized in the case law percolating water,the underflow of surface streams,and definite known underground streams.ngwc maintains that pomeroy and other cases involving water flowing in alluvial channels are underflow cases.on the other hand,groundwater flowing in definite known underground streams,according to ngwc,is limited exclusively to water flowing through open,voids,and bedrock formations.wiel states that definite known underground streams are of rare occurrence,and the presumption is against their presence in any given case.wiel,water rights in the western states ed ch.on this theory,water flowing in the alluvium underneath elk prairie could not be subject to the board jurisdiction under section unless it was part of the underflow of the north fork.since the board made no finding that wells and are drawing on river underflow,ngwc argues that it erred in asserting jurisdiction.
as an initial matter,we note that ngwc did not advance its proposed
