the opinion filed on january,and published at cir,is amended as follows.the sixth sentence of the final paragraph in section states 
the impact of isolated placer mining,which often involves only operations,in our view is not germane to the cumulative impacts assessment of the rock creek mining project.
that sentence is deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following language 
the corps also considered the cumulative impact of placer mining in the region.in our view,the impact of the isolated,placer mining that exists in the nome region today is not germane to the cumulative impacts assessment of the hard rock mining project at issue here.in addition,we understand that reclamation is required at the end of placer mining projects.see alaska stat.because nearly all of the nome district has been previously mined,much of it prior to the introduction of reclamation requirements,any new placer mining projects will result in remediation of historic mining impacts.
the panel has unanimously voted to deny the petition for panel rehearing.judges kleinfeld and gould voted to deny the petition for rehearing en banc,and judge fletcher has so recommended.the petition for en banc rehearing has been circulated to the full court,and no judge has requested a vote on whether to rehear the matter en banc.fed.b.the petition for panel rehearing and the petition for rehearing en banc are denied.no further petitions for rehearing or rehearing en banc will be accepted.
it is so ordered.
this appeal concerns a permit issued to alaska gold company agc,by army corps of engineers the corps for a major project near nome,alaska.the permit was issued pursuant to section of the clean water act cwa,which authorizes the corps to issue permits for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters of the united states.
the project,known as the rock creek mine project,would consist of two gold mines at separate locations outside of nome,plus facilities built for recovering and processing gold ore.once the project is commenced,about cubic yards of fill from the mine will be placed in wetlands totaling acres.
bering strait citizens for responsible resource development,susan steinacher,and jana varrati collectively,bsc,allege that the corps violated the cwa and the national environmental policy act nepa by granting a permit for the rock creek mine project.bsc appeals the district court denial of its motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction,and the district court dismissal of the suit on summary judgment.we conclude that the corps complied with the requirements of the cwa and nepa,and affirm the judgment of the district court.
the rock creek mine project is a project of agc.it has a projected life of four to five years and is expected to process tons of gold ore per day when operable.the complete project consists of two sites.the first,the rock creek,lies six miles north of nome,alaska in the snake river watershed.when completed,the rock creek site would consist of a open pit gold mine,a gold recovery plant,a paste tailings storage facility,two generating development rock stockpiles,a facility for crushing and processing the gold ore,and buildings used for storage and maintenance purposes.
the second facility,the big hurrah mine,lies miles east of nome,alaska.when completed,the big hurrah mine would consist of a open pit gold mine,ore stockpiles,and additional buildings for storage and maintenance purposes.ore from the big hurrah mine would be trucked to the rock creek site for processing,so the big hurrah mine would not include processing or tailings storage facilities.both sites are controlled by agc,through outright ownership or through leases from local native corporations.
the sites of both the rock creek and the big hurrah mine were historically mined and contain debris and tailing piles from earlier mining activities.at the rock creek site,rock stockpiles from previous mining operations now occupy acres of wetlands.at the big hurrah mine,the area that would become the open pit mine at this time contains tailings from previous gold mining activities,and big hurrah creek adjacent to the big hurrah mine contains tailings that have diverted the creek from its natural path.
both sites figured prominently in alaska early gold rush history,commencing late in the nineteenth century.technological advances and current gold prices have rendered the mining claims economic once more,and impelled the evaluation of prospective development combined with rehabilitation of the sites.the corps and agc hope for an economic advantage and environmental improvement as a result.agc observes that nome has unemployment rates over twice the state average and that the region currently offers limited opportunities for economic development,and the corps considered the region economic conditions when assessing the permit.
the construction and operation of the rock creek mine project will result in the permanent destruction of acres of existing wetlands.most of these wetlands are located at the rock creek site,where two rock stockpiles,the tailings storage facility,and other facilities would be constructed in existing wetlands.development of the big hurrah mine would destroy five acres of existing wetlands to widen and improve the existing road to the big hurrah mine.
the permit issued by the corps requires measures to mitigate environmental damage from this project and earlier mining activities at the sites.at the rock creek,these measures include the removal of the rock stockpiles from existing wetlands for placement in storage facilities,the reclamation of wetlands disturbed by previously constructed systems,and the conversion of the mining pit to a pit lake the mining pit will be filled with water.at the big hurrah mine,these measures include the use of historic waste rock for improvements to the big hurrah access road,the removal of tailings from the big hurrah creek flood plain to restore the natural flow of the creek,and the conversion of the mining pit to a pit lake.the corps calculates that these mitigation measures will result in the reclamation of acres of wetlands and the creation of acres of new wetlands.taking these mitigation measures into account,the rock creek mining project will result in a net loss of acres of wetlands.
agc applied for a permit from the corps for the rock creek mine project in may.the corps posted a public notice describing the project on its website on june.the notice included information about a public meeting to be held in nome on june,and the notice was delivered in electronic or format to federal,state,and local agencies,the community of native alaskans residing in or near nome,the city of nome,the neighboring community of solomon,adjacent property owners,the nome postmaster,and any member of the community who requested a copy.
in response to the corps request for comment,the environmental protection agency epa requested a extension of the comment period.the corps responded by granting a extension.epa said that it did not have sufficient information to conclude that the project met the requirements of the cwa.specifically,epa argued that the project did not appear to be the least damaging practicable alternative,that information regarding mitigation measures and the closure of the site provided by agc was incomplete,that the corps had not adequately considered the cumulative effects of all potential mining activities in the area,and that the project did not adequately consider damage to wetlands in the area.epa response also included a list of seven conditions that it wanted included in any permit for the project.
the fish and wildlife service usfws joined epa request for an extension of the comment period and gave proposed conditions to be added to the permit.along with a series of highly specific conditions usfws proposed a permit condition that requires agc to work with the corps,the usfws,the epa,and the alaska department of natural resources to identify additional mitigation opportunities in the project area that will benefit birds.
local agencies,organizations,and individuals also responded to the request for comment.the city of nome asked for additional study of the project.business organizations,including the nome chamber of commerce,supported the project,while many scientific and environmental organizations opposed the project or requested additional study in addition to these agencies and organizations,companies and individuals wrote in support of the project,while seven individuals opposed it.
in august,the corps issued a permit for the rock creek mine project.thereafter,bsc filed suit in the united states district court for the district of alaska challenging the permit.in december,the corps withdrew the permit,informing agc that the corps needed additional time to confirm that the permit evaluation and decision document pedd the document on which permitting decisions are factually complete,accurate,and consistent with applicable law.the corps then moved for a voluntary remand,which the district court granted.
in february,the corps issued a revised pedd for the rock creek mine project.the revised pedd reviewed the comments received on the project,the environmental consequences of the project,and the alternative project designs considered.the corps adopted the seven conditions proposed by the epa,but dismissed the epa concerns about the analysis of alternatives,cumulative impacts,and natural events.the corps also adopted usfws recommendations,including the requirement that agc discuss additional mitigation opportunities with the corps and usfws after the project is underway.an environmental assessment ea and a finding of no significant impact fonsi are also included in the pedd pursuant to.because of the fonsi,the corps determined that it was not required to prepare an environmental impact statement eis for the project.
on march,the corps issued a new permit for the project.on april,bsc filed a second complaint in the district court challenging the rock creek project and seeking a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order to prevent the project from moving forward.the district court denied the motions for a preliminary injunction and for a temporary restraining order,and dismissed the suit with prejudice in a june,opinion.the district court concluded that the corps properly considered the relevant factors required under the cwa and nepa,and that it was unlikely that additional study would have changed the corps view on the project.also,the district court concluded that no injunctive relief was justified because most of the relevant wetlands were filled during the weeks that passed between the corps issuance of the second permit and the filing of bsc second complaint.
on june,the district court issued an amended opinion clarifying its intention to convert the plaintiffs motion for a temporary injunction and for a temporary restraining order into a motion for summary judgment,and correcting a factual error in the june,opinion 
on july,bsc filed an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal.that motion was denied on july.this appeal followed.

the permit at the center of this dispute was issued by the corps pursuant to section of the cwa,which authorizes the corps to issue permits for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable waters of the united states if certain conditions are met.d.the section permit process is governed simultaneously by corps regulations,parts,and by epa guidelines,part.both sets of rules must be observed.hintz,at.
the section permitting process is also governed by nepa.nepa was enacted in pursuit of two objectives first,it places upon an agency the obligation to consider every significant aspect of the environmental impact of a proposed action.second,it ensures that the agency will inform the public that it has indeed considered environmental concerns in its decisionmaking process.baltimore gas res.def,d internal citations and quotation marks omitted.unlike the cwa,nepa does not contain substantive environmental standards,nor does the act mandate that agencies achieve particular substantive environmental results.ctr.for biological diversity forest,cir.judicial review of agency under nepa is limited to the question of whether the agency took a hard look at the proposed action as required by a strict reading of nepa procedural requirements.churchill county norton,cir.
we first address bsc claims under the cwa.
a key issue under the cwa presented by bsc is whether the corps adequately considered practicable alternatives to the rock creek mining project design that was ultimately approved.a provides that no discharge of dredged or fill material shall be permitted if there is a practicable alternative to the proposed discharge which would have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem,so long as the alternative does not have other significant adverse environmental consequences.a practicable alternative is one that is available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost,existing technology,and logistics in light of overall project purposes.id.in evaluating whether a given alternative site is practicable,the corps may legitimately consider such facts as cost to the applicant and logistics.in addition,the corps has a duty to consider the applicant purpose.sylvester army corps of engineers,cir citation omitted.
where a proposed project does not require access to water,it is not water dependent,the availability of practicable alternatives is presumed.a.the parties agree that the rock creek mining project is not water dependent.
the record shows that the corps extensively and properly considered alternatives to the design of the rock creek mining project that was ultimately approved.the pedd reflects the corps consideration of different alternatives,including different placements of the mine pits and related facilities,alternative designs for the pits and tailings storage facilities,of tailings and development rock together,and relocation of access roads.after extensive consultation with agc,the corps determined that all alternatives were impracticable because the nearby uplands were too steep to stabilize the facilities,because the alternative designs would require the destruction of higher value wetlands,or would expand the project footprint,or because alternatives were cost prohibitive or undesirable for other reasons.this rationale is acceptable under the cwa.
bsc challenges this result on several bases.first,bsc argues that the corps failed to apply the correct presumption of practicable alternatives for projects that are not water dependant.however,the pedd reflects that the corps explicitly concluded that the project is not a water dependant activity and that therefore pursuant to a,practicable alternatives not involving special aquatic sites are presumed to be available.the corps applied the proper presumption.
second,bsc argues that the corps improperly rejected all possible upland relocation options for the individual mine facilities by evaluating only an all uplands alternative,the placement of the entire project in uplands,without considering the relocation of individual facilities.specifically,bsc argues that the corps failed to consider the option of relocating only the north waste dump at the rock creek site to an upland site.in support of this claim,bsc cites to the pedd rejection of an alternative design that would place all facilities in uplands and claims that the corps failed to consider the relocation of some,but not all,of the facilities.
this is incorrect.the corps considered and rejected the all uplands alternative but,contrary to bsc assertion,that was not the only alternative design considered.although the pedd does not discuss the relocation of the north dump alone,it reflects the corps consideration of different design alternatives.while an argument can be made that one of these sites was suitable,it would not be appropriate for the court to overturn the corps contrary finding.hintz,at.the pedd also reflects the corps careful review of the data collected by agc consultants before the corps issued the permit,and the pedd notes that representatives from agc discussed alternative sites with the corps state officials on at least occasions.the corps reasonably reviewed the feasible options and reasonably concluded that the proposed design was the best design alternative.
bsc next argues that the corps did not properly weigh the public interest as required by b.that section provides that n o permit will be granted unless the district engineer concludes,on the basis of the analysis required in paragraph a of this section,that the benefits of the proposed alteration outweigh the damage to the wetlands resource.id.paragraph a of includes factors to be considered,including,without limitation 
conservation,economics,aesthetics,general environmental concerns,wetlands,historic properties,fish and wildlife values,flood hazards,floodplain values,land use,navigation,shore erosion and accretion,recreation,water supply and conservation,water quality,energy needs,safety,food and fiber production,mineral needs,considerations of property ownership and,in general,the needs and welfare of the people.
bsc argument is unavailing.the pedd reviews many relevant factors under a in a discussion spanning more than twenty pages.in addition to the significant environmental considerations included in the pedd,the corps also properly considered the significant economic benefits that are expected to result from the project.given the relatively poor condition of the local economy in relation to the state overall,we agree that these benefits are weighty in this case.bsc may disagree with the corps determination,but in making that determination the corps did not arbitrarily or capriciously evaluate the public interest.
in a related claim under the cwa,bsc argues that the corps did not properly consider whether the rock creek mining project would cause or contribute to significant degradation of the waters of the united states as required by.under this section,the corps is directed to consider the effects of the project while placing special emphasis on the persistence and permanence of the effects of the project much briefing on this issue relates to the substantive merits of the corps scientific and factual conclusions on the ecological effects of the project.however,the issues properly considered here are whether the corps decision to issue the permit was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.marsh oregon res.council,d.
we conclude that the corps acted properly.the pedd demonstrates that the corps correctly considered a variety of impacts from the project,and determined that the impacts would be localized or limited in time.moreover,the corps stressed that the wetlands that would be filled during the project are not unique to the site,and that the usfws has determined that wetlands of the type filled in this project are the common habitat in the alaska and the nome region,exceeding forty percent of the land in the state of alaska.accordingly,the corps concluded that the project will likely have no impact on the greater ecosystem beyond the project site.because the corps thoroughly and rationally considered the relevant factors under,it can not be said that its determination was arbitrary and capricious,or that its conclusion was contrary to law.
bsc contends that the corps has not adequately evaluated the hydrological impacts of the project,which it claims may violate of the clean water act.however,under d the corps may accept a certification of compliance with from the relevant state authority in lieu of conducting its own independent analysis.this certification was issued by alaska department of environmental conservation on august.although bsc argues that the alaska department of environmental conservation certification does not include consideration of the underground injection system to be used at the site,the certification mentions that system,and the alaska department of environmental conservation was aware of it when issuing the certification.under the corps regulations,the certification is conclusive with respect to water quality considerations.hintz,at.the corps was not required to undertake the additional analysis that bsc raises,and in any case the corps included a sufficient discussion of water quality effects in the pedd.the corps determination that the rock creek mining project would not cause or contribute to significant degradation of the waters of the united states was neither arbitrary and capricious,nor contrary to law.
bsc next argues that the corps did not require the appropriate mitigation measures required by the cwa.requires that the corps include appropriate and practicable mitigation measures in permits issued under of the cwa.d see also r explaining the general mitigation policy.
bsc contends that the corps did not implement all of the mitigation measures suggested by the epa.however,the record demonstrates that the corps considered epa initial concerns,addressed them,and explained why it found them unpersuasive.cal.trout schaefer,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the corps implemented all of the epa concrete conditions in the permit and rejected only the more general statements from epa,the substance of which were addressed elsewhere in the pedd.the permit includes an array of required mitigation measures,and the corps has explained its rejection of the other measures considered.
bsc also contends that the mitigation measures provided in the permit are insufficient because some mitigation measures have not been fully developed.specifically,bsc urges that the permit condition requiring that agc meet with the corps and usfws within three months of permit issuance to identify additional mitigation opportunities shows that the corps has not fully developed the required mitigation plan for the project.
we have not squarely addressed the question of whether plans to develop additional mitigation measures in the future can satisfy the cwa mitigation requirements.however,in a related context,we have held that prospective mitigation plans satisfied nepa mitigation requirements where the plans were developed to a reasonable degree.wetlands action network army corps of eng rs,cir see also tillamook county army corps of eng rs,cir holding that the corps was not required under nepa to develop a complete mitigation plan detailing the precise nature of the mitigation measures nor were the measures required to completely compensate for adverse environmental impacts.internal quotation marks omitted.
the mitigation measures contained in the permit here satisfy the cwa mitigation requirements.the mitigation measures that are to be developed after permit issuance are only one part of the overall mitigation requirements included in the permit.where the corps has undertaken a genuine effort to develop a detailed mitigation plan,the mere fact that one aspect of the plan is not yet finalized will not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the corps decision was arbitrary and capricious.also,the usfws,not the corps,suggested that the mitigation measures be developed after the permit was issued.this belies any suggestion that the corps was attempting to skirt its responsibilities under the cwa by delaying the development of a mitigation plan.see also robertson methow valley citizens council,d it would be incongruous to conclude that the forest service has no power to act until the local agencies have reached a final conclusion on what mitigating measures they consider necessary.finally,the corps may be perfectly reasonable in its belief that additional mitigation opportunities will present themselves once the project is underway.that the corps intends to pursue additional mitigation opportunities at a later time does not conflict with the requirements of the cwa unless the mitigation measures that have been fully developed are inadequate.we conclude that the corps decisions regarding mitigation measures were not arbitrary and capricious,and complied fully with law 
we next address bsc claims under nepa.
bsc argues that the corps did not provide adequate public notice and comment under nepa because it did not circulate a draft ea before the final ea was completed.bsc claims that a draft ea must be circulated in order for the corps to comply with,which requires the corps to involve environmental agencies,applicants,and the public,to the extent practicable in the preparation of the ea.the corps and agc argue in response that nepa does not require the circulation of a draft ea.
our law currently does not make clear whether nepa requires the circulation of a draft ea.the regulations do not answer the question.requires the circulation of a draft eis,but does not speak to the necessity of a draft ea.requires that agencies m ake diligent efforts to involve the public in preparing and implementing their nepa procedures,but does not expressly require the circulation of a draft ea.
nor does current ninth circuit case law decide the question.in anderson evans,we stated that t he public must be given an opportunity to comment on draft eas and eiss,and public hearings are encouraged to facilitate input on the evaluation of proposed actions,cir.however,the dispute in anderson concerned whether the government was required to prepare an eis,not whether there was adequate public notice and comment on the fact,a draft ea was circulated in anderson.the statement in anderson about the circulation of a draft ea is a dictum.
in other ninth circuit cases we have held that the ninth circuit has not established a minimum level of public comment and participation required by the regulations governing the ea and fonsi process.citizens for better forestry of,cir.the citizens for better forestry opinion quotes anderson for the proposition that a draft ea must be circulated,but the decision itself relies not on anderson dictum,but rather on the fact that the public was given no notice of the preparation of the ea at all.see id.at it is evident,therefore,that a complete failure to involve or even inform the public about an agency preparation of an ea and a fonsi,as was the case here,violates these regulations.this case presents the first opportunity for us to squarely address the question in a case where the issue is presented.
we hold today that the circulation of a draft ea is not required in every case.we do not say that it is always required or that it is never required.instead,we stress that the regulations governing public involvement in the preparation of eas are general in approach,see,requiring the circulation of a draft ea in every case would apply a level of particularity to the ea process that is foreign to the regulations.also,requiring the circulation of a draft ea in every case could require the reversal of permitting decisions where a draft ea was not circulated even though the permitting agency actively sought and achieved public participation through other means.the regulations do not compel such formality.see.
our conclusion is consistent with the views of other circuits,which uniformly have not insisted on the circulation of a draft ea.see alliance to protect nantucket sound,of army,cir concluding that n othing in the ceq regulations requires circulation of a draft ea for public comment,except under certain limited circumstances,and rejecting anderson contrary language as dicta pogliani army corps of eng rs,cir holding that a draft ea must be circulated only in certain limited circumstances greater yellowstone coalition flowers,cir nepa public involvement requirements are not as well defined when an agency prepares only an ea and not an eis.fund for animals,rice,cir t here is no legal requirement that an environmental assessment be circulated publicly and,in fact,they rarely are.
however,a significant question remains.given our conclusion that nepa does not always require the circulation of a draft ea,what level of public disclosure is required under nepa before issuance of a final ea each ea will be prepared under different circumstances,and the regulations have not specified a formal practice for affected agencies.for this reason,practices have not been uniform,and so we will elaborate the factors that should guide the agency.in sierra nevada forest protection campaign weingardt,d at,the united states district court for the eastern district of california considered precisely this issue.after concluding that the agency there the united states forest service need not circulate a draft ea,the court explained 
the regulations require that the public be given as much environmental information as is practicable,prior to completion of the ea,so that the public has a sufficient basis to address those subject areas that the agency must consider in preparing the ea.depending on the circumstances,the agency could provide adequate information through public meetings or by a reasonably thorough scoping notice.
the district court in sierra nevada forest protection campaign evaluated this issue soundly,and we commend its approach.as that court observed,the way in which the information is provided is less important than that a sufficient amount of environmental much as provided so that a member of the public can weigh in on the significant decisions that the agency will make in preparing the ea.id.stated another way,we now adopt this rule an agency,when preparing an ea,must provide the public with sufficient environmental information,considered in the totality of circumstances,to permit members of the public to weigh in with their views and thus inform the agency process.
the corps satisfied this rule here.information about the project was widely disseminated throughout the community and environmental information was reasonably and thoroughly tendered to the public.indeed,in response,the corps received a high level of public comment from the nome community,most of it favoring the project.in addition to these significant efforts by the corps,agc made substantial efforts to provide additional information to the public,including a weekly newspaper column on the project status that ran for about eighteen months,local presentations,radio interviews,and joint efforts with state agencies to explain the permitting process.the quality of the corps dissemination of environmental information to the public and its consideration of public comment,before issuing its ea,was reasonable and adequate.
bsc next argues that the ea prepared by the corps for the rock creek mining project is inadequate by four different measures.first,bsc argues that the ea did not adequately discuss cumulative impacts.second,bsc argues that the alternatives analysis in the ea is inadequate.third,bsc argues that the corps reliance on mitigation plans that are not yet fully developed is inadequate.finally,bsc argues that the corps failed to adequately analyze environmental impacts in the ea.
nepa requires that an eis be prepared for all major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.however,if,as here,an agency regulations do not categorically require the preparation of an eis,then the agency must first prepare an ea to determine whether the action will have a significant effect on the environment.metcalf daley,cir.the ea is designed to provide sufficient evidence and analysis for the agency to determine whether to prepare an eis or to issue a fonsi.id.at see also describing the purposes of the ea.here,the corps determined on the basis of the ea that an eis was unnecessary,and bsc challenges the sufficiency of the ea.
bsc contends that the ea did not adequately discuss the cumulative impact of the project.cumulative impact is defined in the regulations as the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency federal or or person undertakes such other actions.we have held that 
a proper consideration of the cumulative impacts of a project requires some quantified or detailed information g eneral statements about possibl
