the california energy commission cec petitions for review of an order of the department of energy doe denying cec request for a waiver of preemption under the energy policy and conservation act epca.the cec sought this waiver in order to establish water efficiency standards for residential clothes washers,as set forth in its state regulations,regs.tit,p.to obtain such a waiver,cec was required to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the state regulation was needed to meet unusual and compelling state or local water interests.d b.the doe rejected the cec petition for three separate reasons,but asserts that each of these reasons flowed from cec failure to provide adequate information to doe to allow the federal agency to make an informed decision.the doe also challenges this court jurisdiction under the epca to review the denial of the waiver,raising an issue of first impression in this circuit.we hold that this court has jurisdiction under the epca.because the doe stated justifications demonstrate an arbitrary and capricious failure meaningfully to address the cec application for a waiver,we reverse the doe ruling and remand for further proceedings.
factual background 
california is experiencing a severe water crisis,and that crisis is worsening.the need for water continues to grow,as the state population is expected to increase greatly in the next three decades.at the same time,current water supplies are decreasing.california surface water sources are significantly,and its groundwater aquifers are severely overdrafted.a variety of problems have exacerbated the water shortage,including salt water contamination and environmental degradation.california has no new significant conventional supplies available to increase the amount of water available to its citizens.it thus must pursue alternative solutions to the crisis,including efforts at water recycling,desalination,and increased water efficiency.california views improved water use efficiency as the most promising means of alleviating its water crisis.
as part of this effort,the california legislature in required the cec to establish water efficiency standards for residential clothes washers,which were said to account for percent of the water use in a typical household.cal.assemb.kelley,cal.stat.ch,b enacting cal.pub.e.in response,the cec adopted the proposed standards at issue in this case.regs.tit,p.these standards are expressed in terms of a water factor wf,which is the ratio of the gallons of water used per load to the capacity,in cubic feet,of the washtub.id.thus a clothes washer that has cubic feet of capacity and uses gallons of water per load would have a wf of,while a machine of the same capacity that uses only gallons per load would have a wf of.these standards would apply to both and clothes washers,and were divided into two tiers with differing times at which they were scheduled to take effect.tier,initially scheduled to take effect on january,would require all washers and to perform with a wf of no greater than.tier,initially scheduled to take effect on january,would require all washers to perform with a wf of no greater than.the cec asserts that these standards,if implemented,would result in annual water savings equal to the city of san diego current water usage.
the epca expressly preempts state regulation of energy efficiency,energy use,or water use of any product covered by federal energy efficiency standards.b d.in,the doe adopted federal energy efficiency standards for residential clothes washers,pursuant to.g.the doe decided,however,that it did not have the authority to prescribe water efficiency standards for residential clothes washers.nevertheless,because the doe regulates energy efficiency standards for residential clothes washers,the epca expressly preempted state agencies from regulating the energy or water efficiency of that appliance.in,the cec adopted both energy and water efficiency standards for commercial clothes washers this step was permissible because commercial clothes washers were not covered by any federal regulation.regs.tit,p.the california legislature,however,also directed the cec to adopt water efficiency standards for residential clothes washers.recognizing that such regulation was expressly preempted by the epca because of the doe regulation of energy efficiency standards for residential clothes washers,the california legislature required the cec to petition the doe for a rule waiving preemption.cal.stat.ch.enacting cal.pub,e.
the cec filed a petition for a waiver with the doe,which was accepted as complete on december.the doe denied this petition one year later,citing three reasons 
first,cec proposed regulations purported to take effect on january,far less than the statutory minimum,and cec did not provide any information necessary to support a different effective date.second,cec did not meet the statutory standard,which requires a state to show unusual and compelling water interests.cec contended that a analysis showed that its regulation would be preferable to alternatives,but cec petition did not support its conclusions with the underlying data that would have allowed doe to determine whether the statutory standard was satisfied.third,the record demonstrated that cec proposed regulation would make a class of washers unavailable in california,requiring denial of the waiver petition.
the cec requested reconsideration.following doe inaction for days,the request was denied by operation of law on february.the cec then filed its petition for review with this court.
discussion 
we must resolve two primary issues in this appeal.first,the doe has contested our jurisdiction,arguing that the epca provides for direct review in the courts of appeals only of rule s prescribed under section,or of title,whereas the action challenged here is an order issued pursuant to d.see b.second,if jurisdiction properly lies in this court,we must determine whether any of the doe three stated reasons for rejecting the cec petition can support that action under the relevant standard of review.
this court properly has jurisdiction under the epca 
the doe contends that the epca does not grant this court jurisdiction to review the denial of a preemption waiver,and that the cec should have sought judicial review in federal district court under the administrative procedure act apa.its argument is based on the following provision of the epca governing judicial review 
any person who will be adversely affected by a rule prescribed under section,or of this title,may file a petition with the united states court of appeals for judicial review of such rule.
b.the doe contends that the cec is not challenging a rule adopted pursuant to,or but instead is challenging the denial of a waiver that was sought pursuant to d.accordingly,argues the doe,we lack jurisdiction to proceed.
despite the surface plausibility of doe argument,we conclude that it does not effectuate the intent of congress for the review scheme of the epca.it is true that review of agency action is typically located in the district courts under the apa absent a specific statutory provision to the contrary.indep.drivers ass skinner,cir u nless congress specifically maps a judicial review path for an agency,review may be had in federal district court under its general federal question jurisdiction.the provisions of,taken as a whole,are not consistent,however,with a view that congress intended default jurisdiction to lie in the district courts for all review except direct challenges to rules adopted under,or.
the epca specifically confers jurisdiction on the district courts for two categories of actions under the epca suits to determine state compliance with requirements of the epca,and suits challenging the denial of rulemaking to amend a product standard.c.these provisions would appear to be unnecessary if congress intended district court jurisdiction under the apa to apply to every challenge other than direct challenges to rules adopted under,or.it seems most likely that congress listed one group of cases to be decided initially by the circuit courts,and another class to be decided in the first instance by the district courts.for unlisted matters,considerations of efficiency,consistency with the congressional scheme,and judicial economy may be employed to determine whether initial review in the circuit courts best accomplishes the intent of congress.see.power light lorion,d.these considerations militate in favor of jurisdiction in this court for the present controversy.
first,the denial of cec petition for a waiver of preemption is closely intertwined with the exercise of doe authority under.it was the statutory and regulatory adoption of residential washing machine standards for energy efficiency that caused the preemption of cec regulations.denial of the waiver leaves the cec preempted by the effect of the statute and subsequent doe energy regulations.to some extent,therefore,cec is adversely affected by a rule prescribed under section within the meaning of b,which confers jurisdiction on the circuit courts of appeals.s tatutes authorizing review of specified agency actions should be construed to allow review of agency actions which are functionally similar or tantamount to those specified actions.thermalkem,epa,cir quoting vineland chem.epa,cir.
considerations of practicality and consistency with the congressional scheme also militate in favor of review by the court of appeals.in addressing those considerations,we are aided by the decision of the second circuit in nrdc abraham,cir nrdc,the only case addressing a similar jurisdictional issue under the epca.there,the court reviewed a doe rule promulgated under section,as well as related orders concerning the effective date of implementation of that rule.the court rejected the petitioner argument that review of the orders belonged in the district court.the second circuit acknowledged that the epca does also specifically provide for jurisdiction in the district court in limited circumstances,citing the two inapplicable provisions set forth in c.id.at.it continued by holding that,when there is a specific statutory grant of jurisdiction to the court of appeals,it should be construed in favor of review by the court of appeals.id.at.
nrdc also provided several policy reasons why jurisdiction in the court of appeals was appropriate,and those considerations apply equally here.nrdc drew a sharp distinction between r ulemaking proceedings which do not ordinarily necessitate additional factfinding by a district court to effectuate the review process and the exceptions to review by a court of appeals found in which ordinarily would entail additional factfinding,as they do not reflect the culmination of a structured rulemaking process with its attendant record.id.at emphasis added.holding that the latter exceptions are therefore appropriately reserved for review by the district court,the second circuit based its distinction between these two types of cases on the records they would present to their respective courts.id.at.
it is quite clear that doe denial of a waiver of preemption falls into the category of r ulemaking proceedings which do not necessitate additional factfinding by a district court to effectuate the review process.id.at.here,we are presented with a full record upon which the agency has deliberated.no further factfinding is necessary to determine whether the doe acted arbitrarily and capriciously in rejecting the waiver petition.we should not presume,without supporting evidence,that congress would intend to implement a review system that created an entirely duplicative process whereby both the district courts and the circuit courts would review the same record under the same legal standards.
the doe attempts to differentiate the denial of a waiver of preemption from its normal rulemaking function.it argues that,if it were to adopt water conservation rules under,the doe must determine national standards in the broad context of the national need for water conservation,but a waiver proceeding is a much narrower inquiry,guided by different statutory factors,which are focused on state or local interests.but the decision to grant or deny a waiver certainly involves consideration of such national factors,and requires an evaluation of whether a waiver is consistent with the goals of the national scheme or frustrates those goals.we discern no qualitative difference in the two types of decisions that militates in favor of initial review of the decisions in different courts.
the case of nrdc abraham nrdc,cir,relied on by doe,is inapposite.in nrdc,the court held that it lacked original jurisdiction to hear a case challenging a decision arising under the atomic energy act,which did not explicitly provide for direct review in appellate courts.the petitioner in nrdc argued that the court could assert jurisdiction under a different nuclear waste policy though the challenged ruling was quite clearly issued under the atomic energy act.id.at.the court appropriately rejected this argument.in our case,however,the question is not whether resort may be had to another statute,but simply whether the epca provides jurisdiction in the courts of appeals.nrdc therefore does not apply.
finally,the doe attempt to analogize the case of public citizen,nhtsa,also fails,and there is much within that case that suggests that we should find jurisdiction in our case.in public citizen,the petitioners sought an order prescribing a motor vehicle safety standard under the safety act,but were not granted that order.id.at emphasis omitted.like to the epca,the safety act provides that such orders,when issued,are reviewable in the first instance by the courts of appeals.a.however,denials of requests to initiate proceedings to consider orders or rules are clearly governed by a,which does not provide for direct appellate review.public citizen,at.the public citizen petition was denied at this early stage.the circuit held that the plain terms of the statute dictate that judicial review of nhtsa denial of a petition for rulemaking must begin in district in courts of appeals.id.
the circumstances here are quite different.we are presented with no comparable statutory command.moreover,the same policy considerations that support our conclusion are consistent with the result in public citizen.the court in public citizen rejected jurisdiction when the agency refused to act on a petition,and thus had compiled no record whatsoever.without such a record,any circuit court would find it difficult or impossible to determine whether the administrative agency had acted legally a district court with its capability was a more appropriate venue.in our case,however,we are presented with a record addressing all of the statutory requirements demanded of the cec.the type of review required of us is qualitatively no different from the sort that we would engage in upon review of a rule promulgated under,over which we are expressly assigned jurisdiction under the epca.
for all of these reasons,we conclude that we have jurisdiction to entertain cec petition for review.
the doe rejection of the cec petition was arbitrary and capricious 
our review of the doe administrative decision is governed by b,which provides for review in accordance with the administrative procedure act.that act states that the reviewing court shall compel agency action unlawfully withheld and hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with the law a see envtl.def.ctr.epa,cir,cert.denied,d.
under this standard,we will uphold an agency decision only on the basis of the reasoning articulated therein.anaheim mem l hosp.shalala,cir.we will overturn a decision as arbitrary and capricious when the agency relied on a factor that congress did not intend it to consider failed to consider an important factor or aspect of the problem failed to articulate a rational connection between the facts found and the conclusions made supported the decision with a rationale that runs counter to the evidence or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise or made a clear error in judgment.envtl.def.ctr.epa,at.
