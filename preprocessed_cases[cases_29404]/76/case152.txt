the salton sea the largest inland body of water in california is a creature of accident.in,water from the colorado river breached an irrigation canal and flooded the salton basin.after the initial flood,irrigation runoff from the imperial and coachella valleys supplied by the colorado river sustained the sea for more than a century.the sea has become a unique attraction for recreation in the harsh southern california desert.
the sea continued access to colorado river water is in jeopardy.over the last few decades arizona and nevada began to claim their full entitlements to the stream.california,which has long used more than its share,has been required to conserve.the affected california water districts ultimately agreed to transfer some colorado river water from the imperial valley to urban areas in southern california.the secretary of the interior who controls the delivery of river water prepared an environmental impact statement eis,which,among other things,analyzed the effect of these agreements on the salton sea.despite noting some potentially serious environmental consequences,the secretary eventually approved the agreements and implemented a new water delivery schedule.
plaintiffs imperial county and the imperial county air pollution control district the air district then sued the secretary,claiming that the eis did not comply with either the national environmental policy act nepa or the clean air act caa.the imperial irrigation district imperial irrigation,san diego county water authority san diego water,coachella valley water district coachella,and metropolitan water district of southern california metropolitan,parties to the transfer agreements,intervened as defendants.the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants,finding that neither plaintiff had standing to sue.we disagree as to standing,but nonetheless affirm the judgment,because the district court correctly found in the alternative that the secretary did not violate nepa the record below also makes plain that the secretary did not violate the caa.
background 
in,the colorado river basin states agreed to divide the river waters among upper and states.colorado river compact,cong.rec.in,congress ratified the compact in the boulder canyon project act,stat.codified as amended at.california,arizona,and nevada are the states.
in,various southern california irrigation and water districts agreed to a framework for distributing the state share of colorado river water.this seven party agreement created seven priorities and unrealistically assuming an everlasting surplus of river water divided million acre feet per year mafy among the contracting districts.priorities,a,b,a,and b in the seven party agreement were either unquantified or shared among the districts.agreement requesting apportionment of california share of the waters of the colorado river among the applicants in the state,available at.the secretary and the california districts then incorporated the terms of the agreement into water delivery contracts.see.
in,the supreme court held that the boulder canyon project act limited california colorado river allotment to mafy.arizona california.california could exceed this annual allowance only if the other states did not use their allotments or there was actually surplus water.id.at.the secretary then promulgated regulations defining surplus.see pt.
the immediate effects of arizona california on california were mitigated,however,because the secretary designated water as surplus rather liberally,proclaiming surpluses when none truly existed.but eventually the secretary made plain that it was time for california to live within its mafy means.in response,the states,the california water districts,and the secretary considered methods to reduce california dependence on colorado river water.
in,imperial irrigation and san diego water reached a preliminary agreement under which imperial irrigation would conserve up to thousand per year kafy of water,which would then be transferred to san diego water.in,the secretary and imperial irrigation initiated a joint nepa and california environmental quality act ceqa study to consider the effects of the proposed transfer imperial irrigation diego county water authority water conservation and transfer project.this transfer eis,which is not at issue today,considered impacts of the transfer and possible environmental mitigation measures.see id.
in,several water districts negotiated preliminary quantification settlement agreements to reduce colorado river water usage,to quantify and cap priorities and in the seven party agreement,and to authorize interdistrict transfers of conserved imperial irrigation water.these agreements would have limited imperial irrigation priority a to mafy.
in,prompted by the proposed quantification settlement agreements,the secretary announced that she would prepare the eis challenged here the implementation agreement eis to consider the consequences of delivering a portion of imperial irrigation water at different diversion points on the colorado river for use outside the imperial valley.see the implementation agreement for secretarial actions associated with california parties quantification agreement.the bureau of reclamation proposed studying the consequences of changing the points of delivery of up to kafy,the implementation of an overrun accounting and payback policy,and potential biological conservation measures.id.the bureau filed a draft implementation agreement eis and notice of availability in january.the comment period for the draft implementation agreement eis and the draft transfer eis overlapped after the comment period ended,the secretary filed both final eiss in november.
the final implementation agreement eis discussed,among other things,the environmental impacts of altering colorado river delivery diversion points,the indirect effects of changing the amount of water received by the california districts,and potential mitigation measures to reduce ecological consequences.because the various proposed mitigation agreements were discussed extensively in the transfer eis,the final implementation agreement eis also summarized and those findings.
in october,the secretary,imperial irrigation,san diego water,metropolitan,and coachella ratified several revised quantification settlement agreements.minor changes to the proposed master implementation agreement the colorado river water delivery agreement crwda and to proposed environmental mitigation measures had not been discussed in the final implementation agreement eis.these included an amendment by various districts of timelines,a modification by imperial irrigation and coachella of their salton sea environmental mitigation plan,and a revision by the bureau of reclamation of its proposed species conservation plan after consultation with the fish and wildlife service.the secretary prepared an environmental evaluation of the modifications,determined that a supplemental eis was unnecessary,and issued a final record of decision.
this action,in which the plaintiffs allege violations of nepa and the caa,ensued.after the water districts intervened,all parties for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants,holding that plaintiffs lacked article iii standing and alternatively rejecting their nepa but not caa claims on the merits.this appeal followed.

plaintiffs assert that the secretary violated nepa and the council on environmental quality ceq regulations interpreting it plaintiffs also allege that the secretary should have made a caa conformity determination because the crwda will expand the salton sea shoreline and thus increase airborne levels of particulate matter with a diameter of ten microns or less.both alleged injuries are procedural.thus,plaintiffs must establish that the secretary violated procedural rules designed to protect their concrete interests,and that the challenged action will threaten those interests.citizens for better forestry dep t of,cir.for procedural rights,our inquiry into the imminence of the threatened harm is less demanding,hall norton,cir,and the causation and redressability requirements are relaxed,cantrell city of long beach,cir.
procedural injury 
plaintiffs established article iii standing first,they plainly alleged that the secretary violated procedural rules.nepa requires federal agencies to analyze the environmental impacts of their actions,dep t of transp.pub.citizen,and the caa mandates a conformity determination when an agency action increases pollutants in nonattainment regions,c.imperial county argued,both to the agency and in the courts,that the implementation agreement eis was insufficient under nepa and the caa.
second,nepa and the caa were designed to protect the plaintiffs interests.nepa provides that local agencies,which are authorized to develop and enforce environmental standards may comment on the proposed federal action.douglas cnty.babbitt,cir quoting c v.under california law,the air district may sue on behalf of the state for a violation of the state implementation plan sip.cal.health safety code.we have also held that the caa conformity requirement was designed to protect a actor interest in clean air.city of las vegas faa,cir.

identification of facts 
the secretary claims that plaintiffs did not identify sufficient facts below to establish standing.we reject the argument.plaintiffs argued below that the crwda will increase pm levels and undermine the air district ability to enforce air quality regulations.their summary judgment motion included a declaration from the air pollution control officer documenting that the crwda would increase fugitive dust by expanding the salton sea shoreline and thus undermine the air district ability to develop an attainment strategy and comply with its sip.
plaintiffs also identified specific facts in support of their claim that the secretary action will undermine imperial county land management.the planning director of the imperial county land use department declared that the project would frustrate the county plans,reduce its water supply,and impair its housing development.this declaration is no less specific than that of the city manager in sausalito,at.
mechanism of review 
the district court held that plaintiffs lacked standing to assert a caa claim because they recharacterized their complaint as an enforcement action and failed to identify an applicable waiver of sovereign immunity.we disagree.
plaintiffs claim arose from the secretary alleged caa violations.the complaint stated that the secretary action will increase levels,interfere with the california sip,exceed de minimis emission thresholds,and be regionally significant.thus,the complaint asserted,the secretary should have conducted a conformity determination.plaintiffs made identical arguments in their summary judgment briefing.
plaintiffs and the secretary agree that the administrative procedure act apa is the proper statutory mechanism to challenge the secretary action.the apa creates a right of action for persons suffering legal wrong,but provides review only if there is no other adequate remedy in a court.although we have not held that the apa authorizes judicial review when an air district asserts a federal conformity violation,we have assumed as much.see coast air quality mgmt.dist.ferc,cir sierra club epa,amended by cir pub.citizen dep t of,cir,rev on other grounds.that assumption has solid statutory grounding the caa provides a cause of action against a federal agency which violates an emission standard or limitation under this chapter a a.as relevant here,an emission standard or limitation is in turn defined as a schedule or timetable of compliance,emission limitation,standard of performance or emission standard.f.the caa clause requiring a conformity determination,however,is not a schedule or timetable of compliance,an emission reduction,a standard of performance,or an emission limitation.conservation law,busey,st cir,cited with approval by natural res.def.council,coast air quality mgmt,cir.judicial review thus is available under the apa,as no other adequate remedy exists.id.at see also city of olmsted falls faa.

tiering and incorporation 
ceq regulations encourage agencies to tier with a previous eis to eliminate repetitive discussions of the same issues and to focus on the actual issues ripe for decision.an agency may tier to a nepa document,klamath siskiyou wildlands ctr.bureau of land,cir,if the subsequent statement is either of lesser scope or a statement or analysis at a later stage.
the ceq regulations also require agencies to incorporate by reference nepa and documents.agencies shall incorporate material into an environmental impact statement by reference when the effect will be to cut down on bulk without impeding agency and public review of the action.see also j agencies shall reduce excessive paperwork by i ncorporating by reference.any material incorporated by reference must be cited in the statement,briefly described,and reasonably available for inspection by potentially interested persons,but need not be physically attached to an eis,a requiring an appendix to c onsist of material prepared in connection with an environmental impact statement as distinct from material which is not so prepared and which is incorporated by reference forty most asked questions concerning ceq national environmental policy act regulations,t he material which is incorporated by reference does not accompany the eis.
plaintiffs argue that the final implementation agreement eis either a did not clarify whether it incorporated the state transfer environmental impact report eir or the federal transfer eis,or b improperly cited to a document the transfer eir.they are incorrect on both counts.
the secretary and imperial irrigation originally agreed to conduct a joint nepa and study for the imperial diego water transfer agreement.imperial irrigation,however,later prepared a separate study in june the transfer eir because ceqa has slightly different reporting requirements than nepa.the bureau of reclamation prepared its own transfer eis in november the final transfer eis the secretary then approved a final transfer eis imperial irrigation district water conservation and transfer project,california.
the final implementation agreement eis clearly distinguished between the transfer eir and the transfer eis,explaining that i n order to comply with ceq regulations reclamation is preparing a fully integrated,stand alone final,and incorporating the transfer eis by reference.as plaintiffs note,the secretary,in an apparent effort to avoid confusion,cited to the transfer eir ceqa version and the transfer eis nepa version as if they were a single document in the final implementation agreement eis.but,plaintiffs fail to identify relevant material discussed solely in the transfer eir or significant information excluded from the transfer eis see or.envtl.council kunzman,cir the reviewing court may not fly speck an eis and hold it insufficient on the basis of inconsequential,technical deficiencies.quoting nw.indian cemetery protective ass peterson,cir.and although the secretary once cited the transfer eir and transfer eis as a single document in her district court briefing,that minor misstatement does not prejudice our review 
plaintiffs next argue that the secretary improperly tiered to documents,citing to ten pages in the implementation agreement eis.these documents are federal statutes,state environmental impact reviews,and eiss from other colorado river projects they are cited to provide a road map of colorado river programs,not to sidestep the secretary nepa obligations.the implementation agreement eis at most incorporated these documents,which are properly cited in the statement,briefly described,and reasonably available for inspection by potentially interested persons.
more specifically,plaintiffs argue that the final implementation agreement eis cited to the coachella valley water management plan program eir,which was not released for public review during the comment period for the implementation agreement eis however,a final eis may include information not cited in a draft recirculation is required only if there is significant new information or circumstances relating to the proposed action.westlands water dist.dep t of interior,cir citing c ii.the secretary cited the coachella valley water management program eir only to respond to comments from the bureau of indian affairs and to further discuss secondary environmental consequences of the crwda,not to identify a new proposal or to describe previously unconsidered environmental consequences.plaintiffs interpretation of nepa would require an agency to submit a new draft eis or supplemental eis for any update,regardless of its significance.every draft eis would then be,in effect,a final eis.
plaintiffs next argue that the implementation agreement eis improperly stated that it tiers to and incorporates by reference the quantification settlement agreement program eir and the coachella valley water district management plan program eir.the secretary would indeed have erred if she had tiered to these documents,as they are state environmental reports,not nepa documents.klamathsiskiyou,at.however,the secretary tiers to language is a scrivener error.the documents were plainly incorporated by reference,and accidently referring to a document as tiered to and incorporated rather than just incorporated is harmless.see ass of home builders defenders of wildlife,declining to remand when an agency made a stray statement,which could have had no effect on the underlying agency action being challenged.
finally,plaintiffs argue that pacific rivers council united states forest service,cir,requires all discussion of environmental impacts to be in the text of an eis,rather than incorporated by reference.plaintiffs also contend that the secretary too heavily incorporated indirect impact analysis when discussing the salton sea.our pacific rivers opinion,however,was vacated as moot,and,in any event,provides little help.the court there determined that a forest service supplemental eis failed to discuss the impact of logging on individual species of fish.pac.rivers,at.the forest service attempted to save the supplemental eis by claiming that it had incorporated two biological assessments which discussed these impacts.those assessments,however,were not described and analyzed in the text of the supplemental eis,contained no analysis of the manner or degree to which the alternatives may have affected these fish,and applied to only one group of fish species.id.at.unlike the forest service supplemental eis in pacific rivers,the text of the implementation agreement eis extensively considered the environmental effects that the crwda will have on the salton sea.
segmenting 
plaintiffs next argue that the secretary improperly segmented the quantification settlement agreements by preparing two eiss.proposals or parts of proposals which are related to each other closely enough to be,in effect,a single course of action shall be evaluated in a single impact statement.a.to prevail,plaintiffs must show that the secretary acted arbitrarily by not preparing a single eis.kleppe,at resolving these issues requires a high level of technical expertise and is properly left to the informed discretion of the responsible federal agencies.we apply an independent utility test to determine whether multiple actions are so connected as to mandate consideration in a single eis.the crux of the test is whether each of two projects would have taken place with or without the other and thus had independent utility.great basin mine watch hankins,cir quoting wetland actions network army corps of eng rs,cir.
the secretary did not act arbitrarily by separately preparing a transfer eis and an implementation agreement eis.the implementation agreement eis analyzed the onriver effects of altering the colorado river diversion points,and the transfer eis considered a separate agreement among the districts and proposed habitat conservation programs.the secretary did not prepare two eiss to avoid consideration of an entire action effects on the environment.radio servs.glickman,cir.rather,the implementation agreement eis considered both the impact of changing the colorado river diversion points and the secondary,consequences of reducing imperial irrigation water.
supplemental eis 
the secretary also did not abuse her discretion by concluding that a supplemental eis was unnecessary.a supplemental eis is required if a the agency makes substantial changes in the proposed action that are relevant to environmental concerns or b there are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts.c.but,supplementation is not required when two requirements are satisfied the new alternative is a mi
