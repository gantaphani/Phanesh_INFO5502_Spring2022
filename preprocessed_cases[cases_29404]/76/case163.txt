the federal water pollution control act,or clean water act the act,a,allows a citizen to sue to enforce the act prohibition against discharging water pollutants without a national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit.in this citizen suit,plaintiff,california sportfishing protection alliance,a conservationist organization,alleges that defendants,chico scrap metal,george scott,george scott,and george scott,revocable inter vivos trust,have violated an npdes permit that governs industrial storm water discharges at three scrap metal recycling facilities that defendants operate.
the district court dismissed this action after ruling that.b b bars plaintiff claims.on appeal,defendants argue that another statutory bar,g a ii,also applies.we hold that b b does not apply because the state has commenced no action in court to require compliance with the storm water permit and that g a ii does not apply because the state has commenced no administrative penalty action comparable to one under the act.we therefore reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings

the act allows citizens to enforce its standards.a.but any of four statutory bars may prohibit a citizen suit if the state or federal government is pursuing enforcement actions with respect to the same alleged violations.g a i iii,b b.defendants argue that two of those statutory bars,b b and g a ii,apply here.for the reasons that follow,we disagree.
section b b 
the first diligent prosecution bar at issue is contained within the same statutory section that authorizes citizen suits to enforce the act,which provides,in relevant part 
a except as provided in subsection b of this section and g,any citizen may commence a civil action on his own behalf 
against any person who is alleged to be in violation of a an effluent standard or limitation under this act or b an order issued by the epa or a state with respect to such a standard or limitation 
b no citizen suit under a may be commenced 
b if a state or federal authority has commenced and is diligently prosecuting a civil or criminal action in a court of the united states,or a state to require compliance with the standard,limitation,or order 
our prior decisions clarify two points with respect to the interpretation of b b.first,we have held that only an action that is in a court triggers the statutory bar administrative proceedings do not.sierra club chevron,cir.second,we have construed the phrase has commenced and is diligently prosecuting,as it appears in g a ii,though not as it appears in b b.in the former context,we have held that the phrase requires an inquiry as to whether the government was diligently prosecuting its action at the time when the citizen filed his or her complaint.knee deep cattle bindana inv,cir citizens for a better env t cal.union oil of,cir.we now extend that construction to the identical statutory phrase,as it appears in b b see sprint telephony pcs,county of san diego,cir en banc when c
