the clean water act cwa makes it unlawful to discharge dredged and fill material into the waters of the united states except in accord with a permitting regime jointly administered by the army corps of engineers corps and the environmental protection agency epa.see united states riverside bayview homes,d.fairbanks north star borough fairbanks seeks judicial review of a corps approved jurisdictional determination,which is a written,formal statement of the agency view that fairbanks property contained waters of the united states and would be subject to regulation under the cwa.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm the district court dismissal on the pleadings for lack of jurisdiction.the corps approved jurisdictional determination is not final agency action within the meaning of the administrative procedure act apa.
the burden of federal regulation on those who would deposit fill material in locations denominated waters of the united states is not trivial.rapanos united states,d plurality opinion.under the cwa,any discharge of dredged or fill materials into waters of the united states is forbidden unless authorized by a permit issued by the corps of engineers pursuant to section of the cwa,which is codified at.leslie salt united states,cir see also riverside bayview,at.se.alaska conservation council army corps of eng rs,cir.the corps has issued regulations defining the term waters of the united states,solid waste agency of cook county army corps of eng rs,d,to include most wetlands adjacent to waters of the united states that are not themselves wetlands,see a.
fairbanks wishes to develop a acre tract of property for its residents recreational use.it intends to build playgrounds,athletic fields,concession stands,restrooms,storage buildings,road s,and parking lots,the construction of which will include the placement of fill material.in october,fairbanks wrote to the corps to ask for its review and determination that it could place fill material on its property without further ado.it asked the corps to provide a detailed,scaled drawing showing the wetlands in relation to the lot boundaries.the corps thereafter issued a preliminary jurisdictional determination finding that fairbanks entire parcel contained wetlands.fairbanks then requested that the corps provide an approved jurisdictional determination.in december,the corps obliged fairbanks and replied 
based on our review of the information you furnished and available to our office,we have determined that the entire parcel described above contains waters of the united states under our regulatory jurisdiction this approved jurisdictional determination is valid for a period of five years unless new information supporting a revision is provided to this office 
the corps letter went on to remind fairbanks that section of the clean water act requires that a permit be obtained for the placement or discharge of dredged fill material into waters of the,including wetlands,prior to conducting the work.fairbanks took a timely administrative appeal of the approved jurisdictional determination,which the corps found to be without merit in may.fairbanks has not since applied for a section permit.nor has the corps initiated any or enforcement action.
in august,fairbanks brought this suit to set aside the corps approved jurisdictional determination.according to fairbanks,the corps acted unlawfully in asserting that its property was subject to cwa regulatory jurisdiction.fairbanks contended that its property could not possibly be a wetland because it is underlain by shallow permafrost at a depth of inches that does not exceed zero degrees celsius at any point during the calendar year.a corps regulation,which is not challenged here,provides that 
the term wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support,and that under normal circumstances do support,a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.
b.to identify wetlands under this regulation,the corps uses its wetlands delineation manual manual.see energy and water development appropriations act,stat,united states deaton,cir.
the manual explains that wetlands have the three general diagnostic environmental characteristics of vegetation,soil and hydrology.manual b.generally,evidence of a minimum of one positive wetland indicator from each parameter hydrology,soil,and vegetation must be found in order to make a positive wetland determination.id.c.fairbanks alleged that its property lacks wetlands hydrology,because it is not periodically inundated and does not have saturated soils during the growing season.id.the manual defines growing season as t he portion of the year when soil temperatures at in.below the soil surface are higher than biologic zero c and notes that f or ease of determination this period can be approximated by the number of days.id.at app.fairbanks asserted that the corps jurisdictional determination improperly relied on a special definition of growing season,which fairbanks calls the alaska rule,inconsistent with the manual definition.the alaska rule states that the period based on a degree air temperature best fits the observed growing season in most parts of alaska.see army corps of engineers,alaska district,special public notice july.by using the alaska rule,fairbanks claimed,the corps could establish a growing season even when a property is underlain by shallow permafrost,and never has a subsurface soil temperature higher than biologic zero consequently,the corps finding that fairbanks property was a wetland subject to cwa regulatory jurisdiction was erroneous.
the district court granted the corps motion for judgment on the pleadings,concluding that the approved jurisdictional determination did not constitute final agency action under the apa,that fairbanks challenge was unripe and that the cwa statutorily precluded judicial review.fairbanks timely appealed.

discussion 
as a matter of first impression,we hold that the corps issuance of an approved jurisdictional determination finding that fairbanks property contained waters of the united states did not constitute final agency action under the apa for purposes of judicial review as a general matter,two conditions must be satisfied for agency action to be final first,the action must mark the consummation of the agency decisionmaking must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature.and second,the action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined,or from which legal consequences will flow.bennett spear,d internal citations and quotation marks omitted.the approved jurisdictional determination represented the corps definitive administrative position that fairbanks property contained wetlands.but,as we shall explain,it did not impose an obligation,deny a right,or fix some legal relationship.ukiah valley med.ctr.ftc,cir quoting chicago air lines,waterman.because finality is a jurisdictional requirement to obtaining judicial review under the apa,the district court correctly dismissed fairbanks action.see or.natural desert ass n,at.we do not reach the issues of ripeness and statutory preclusion of judicial review.
we agree with fairbanks that an approved jurisdictional determination upheld in the corps administrative appeal process mark s the consummation of the agency decisionmaking process for determining whether the corps conceives a property as subject to cwa regulatory jurisdiction.there is no question that the corps has asserted its ultimate administrative position regarding the presence of wetlands on fairbanks property on the factual circumstances upon which the determination is predicated.see alaska dep t of envtl.conservation epa,cir alaska i see also alaska dep t of envtl.conservation epa,cir,aff,d alaska ii.the approved jurisdictional determination states on its face that it is valid for a period of five years and that the corps position would change only if new information supporting a revision is provided.it is devoid of any suggestion that it might be subject to subsequent revision or further agency consideration or possible modification.see city of san diego whitman,cir quoting ontario epa,and epa.
by regulation,the corps has established a formal procedure for a ffected part ies to solicit its official position about the scope of cwa regulatory jurisdiction.see.a jurisdictional determination is a written corps determination that a wetland is subject to regulatory jurisdiction under the cwa.see also jurisdictional determinations,corps regulatory guidance letter,at june,an approved jurisdictional determination is an official corps determination that jurisdictional waters under the cwa are either present or absent on a particular site.after the district engineer approved jurisdictional determination has been upheld by the division engineer,no further administrative appeal is possible.see at that point,the approved jurisdictional determination is deemed to be final corps agency action and a final corps decision for administrative purposes.id.a,a emphasis added the regulations thus delimit the stopping point of the corps decisionmaking process for the issuance and review of jurisdictional determinations.an approved jurisdictional determination upheld on administrative appeal is the agency last word on whether it views the property as a wetland subject to regulation under the cwa.see sierra club nrc,cir.no further agency decisionmaking on that issue can be expected,a clear indication that the first prong of the bennett finality test is satisfied.see id.
the corps argues that an approved jurisdictional determination merely helps parties determine where they stand on potential permitting issues and necessarily entails the possibility of further administrative proceedings,like permit applications.as such,the determination is only a step leading to an agency decision,rather than the final action itself.see ecology,forest,cir.fairbanks correctly responds that this argument conflate s one decision with a future yet distinct administrative process.the corps regulations throughout treat jurisdictional determinations and permitting decisions as discrete agency actions notably,jurisdictional determinations do not include determinations that a particular activity requires a permit.the corps reliance on city of san diego is misplaced in view of the agency provision of a formal procedure for acquiring its settled views about the scope of cwa jurisdiction outside of and apart from the permitting process.city of san diego,at reasoning that letter did not mark consummation of decisionmaking process because it was only upon completion of the permit appeal process that agency would decide applicability of statute.that fairbanks might later decide to initiate some other corps process after obtaining the approved jurisdictional determination does not detract from the definiteness of the determination itself.
an approved jurisdictional determination announces the corps considered,definite and firm position about the presence of jurisdictional wetlands on fairbanks property at the time it is rendered.accordingly,we conclude that it marks the consummation of the agency decisionmaking process as to that issue.
although fairbanks is correct that the first bennett requirement is satisfied,the second is not.we hold that the corps approved jurisdictional determination finding that fairbanks property contained wetlands subject to cwa regulatory jurisdiction is not an action by which rights or obligations have been determined,or from which legal consequences will flow.bennett,at.see also or.natural desert ass n,at examining whether challenged action has any legal effect that would qualify it as a final agency action under bennett second finality requirement.from this it follows that judicial review under the apa is unavailable.
fairbanks rights and obligations remain unchanged by the approved jurisdictional determination.it does not itself command fairbanks to do or forbear from anything as a bare statement of the agency opinion,it can be neither the subject of immediate compliance nor of defiance.see ftc standard oil,d.up to the present,the corps has expresse d its view of what the law requires of fairbanks without altering or otherwise fixing its legal relationship.see at t eeoc.this expression of views lacks the status of law or comparable legal force.see ukiah valley med,at in any later enforcement action,fairbanks would face liability only for noncompliance with the cwa underlying statutory commands,not for disagreement with the corps jurisdictional determination.see b c,g providing criminal,civil and administrative penalties for violation of the cwa,but not referring to approved jurisdictional determinations.valley auth.whitman,cir reasoning that clean air act compliance orders have status of law because statute undeniably authorizes s penalties based solely upon noncompliance with them.
at bottom,fairbanks has an obligation to comply with the cwa.if its property contains waters of the united states,then the cwa requires fairbanks to obtain a section discharge permit if its property does not contain those waters,then the cwa does not require fairbanks to acquire that permit.in either case,fairbanks legal obligations arise directly and solely from the cwa,and not from the corps issuance of an approved jurisdictional determination.see gallo cattle usda,cir agency decision not final agency action because potential legal consequences flowed only from the plaintiff disregard of its statutory obligation.whether fairbanks property is a jurisdictional wetland,contains waters of the united states depends on its vegetation,soil and hydrology the land is what and where it is.the corps does not alter that physical reality or the legal standards used to assess that reality simply by opining that a particular site contains waters of the united states.see ass of home builders norton,agency action that left the world just as it found it can not be fairly described as implementing,interpreting,or prescribing law or policy internal quotation marks omitted.
in withholding judicial review of the corps approved jurisdictional determination,we do not impair fairbanks ability to contest the existence of cwa regulatory jurisdiction.see indus.customers of nw.utils.bonneville power,cir see also ass of home builders,at.it is settled law that the federal courts have the final say on the scope of the cwa in exercising that authority,we would not give the government position that cwa regulatory jurisdiction exists any particular deference simply because the corps views on the matter were formulated in the context of an approved jurisdictional determination rather than,for example,a permit application or enforcement proceeding.
despite all this,fairbanks urges that the corps approved jurisdictional determination has three legal consequences it prevents fairbanks from claiming in mitigation that it had acted with good faith it effectively requires fairbanks to submit to the cwa permitting regime before proceeding with construction and it deprives fairbanks of a negative jurisdictional determination,which might have been relied upon as a defense to enforcement action we do not consider these arguments persuasive and shall address each in turn.
in determining the amount of a civil penalty the court shall consider any efforts to comply with the applicable requirements of the cwa d emphasis added.as even the corps recognizes,an approved jurisdictional determination could eventually be evidence on the issue of whether a particular course of conduct was undertaken in good or bad faith.but the possibility that fairbanks might someday face a greater risk of increased fines should
