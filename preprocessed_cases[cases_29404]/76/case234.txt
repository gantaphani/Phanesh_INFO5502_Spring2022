in anticipation of a legal settlement,the terms of which would alter the amount of water the irrigation districts receive from the project each year for distribution to landowners and other users within their respective districts,the landowners filed this civil action in arizona state court against the conservation district.the landowners sought declaratory relief to prevent modification of the existing contracts,claiming vested water rights pursuant to state and federal law,and pursuant to the terms of the project contracts.the conservation district removed the action to federal court.the landowners moved the district court to abstain from exercising federal jurisdiction and to instead remand their action back to state court.the district court denied the landowners motion to abstain and remand.it then dismissed their complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm.
congress enacted the reclamation act of,ch,stat,to provide federal financing,construction,and operation of water storage and distribution projects throughout the western united states.pursuant to the act,congress in enacted the colorado river basin project act,supp project act,to further the development of the water resources of the colorado river basin,and to apportion those resources among several states.id.the project act authorized construction and operation of the central arizona project to store and to deliver colorado river water to arizona and western new mexico for irrigation and municipal and industrial use see id.the project act also authorized the secretary of the interior to enter into a master contract with a political subdivision of each state to arrange for repayment of project construction and operation costs.see id.
to this end,the arizona legislature created the conservation district.see.et.the conservation district was directed to contract with the secretary of the interior to finance the construction and operation of the project.id.this master contract was executed in,and amended in master contract.
state law additionally authorized the conservation district to enter into subcontracts with irrigation districts for the delivery of project water.the irrigation districts,in turn,would levy property taxes on landowners within the districts to assist in repayment of the project costs pursuant to the terms of the master contract.id.the irrigation district subcontracts were executed in,following the secretary apportionment of the rights to purchase project water each irrigation district contracted with the conservation district and with the united states to receive a particular percentage of the agricultural priority project water,and in return,each irrigation district agreed to repay the costs related to construction and operation of the facilities needed to deliver their portion of the project water.the master contract and each of the subcontracts were subsequently validated by arizona state court judgments as required by the terms of the contracts.
the landowners each entered into memoranda of understanding and water service agreements with their respective irrigation districts.these agreements provide that the relevant irrigation district will deliver project water for irrigation purposes to the landowners,such right to be appurtenant to the land,in exchange for which the landowners agree to pay taxes and water service fees.the agreements also provide that wells and other groundwater rights associated with the land are to be conveyed to the irrigation districts,in accordance with state law.neither the conservation district,nor the united states,is a party to the memoranda of understanding or to the water service agreements between the irrigation districts and the landowners.
in november,the landowners filed an action in state court against their respective irrigation districts.smith irrigation drainage,no.filed.the landowners alleged that the irrigation districts were in the process of considering a settlement arizona water settlement would offer the irrigation districts partial debt relief on their project financing obligations,and,in return,would require the irrigation districts to relinquish all or part of their allocated rights to agricultural priority project water.id.the landowners sought a declaratory judgment to preempt the possibility that the irrigation districts would give up these water rights through the proposed settlement.see id.the landowners action was stayed for approximately one year,with the stay lifted in march following the conservation district formal approval of the arizona water settlement agreement 
following formal approval of the settlement,the landowners continued to litigate the smith irrigation drainage district state court action,and in addition they filed this declaratory judgment action in state court against the conservation district.the landowners alleged possession of vested property rights to reclamation water pursuant to state and federal law,the master contract,and the project subcontracts,and sought a declaration prohibiting the conservation district from interfering with those rights.the landowners alleged,notwithstanding the arizona water settlement agreement,that the conservation district is obligated to continue to deliver project water to the irrigation districts for the benefit of the landowners.
the conservation district removed the present case to federal court,and then moved to dismiss the landowners complaint for failure to state a claim,arguing that the landowners could not obtain the requested relief because they are neither parties to,nor beneficiaries of,the relevant contracts.alternatively,the conservation district sought dismissal for failure to join the united states as an indispensable party.the landowners opposed the motion to dismiss and moved the district court to abstain and to remand the case to state court,arguing that dismissal pursuant to colorado river water conservation district united states,d was warranted in light of the pending related state action,smith irrigation drainage district.
the district court denied the landowners motion to abstain and remand.the district court concluded that a stay or dismissal of the federal action was not warranted because the pending state court action was an entirely separate proceeding involving claims distinguishable from those presented in the federal action.the district court then granted the conservation district motion to dismiss the landowners complaint for failure to state a claim,determining that because the landowners were neither parties to nor beneficiaries of the master contract or the project subcontracts,the landowners could not bring suit to enforce those contracts.because the landowners had failed to state a claim,the district court found it unnecessary to evaluate the conservation district contention that the united states is an indispensable party.this appeal followed.

in colorado river,the supreme court was concerned with the problem posed by the contemporaneous exercise of concurrent jurisdiction by state and federal courts.gilbertson albright,cir en banc.in such cases,the court recognized there may be circumstances in which traditional abstention principles do not apply,yet considerations of wise judicial administration,giving regard to conservation of judicial resources and comprehensive disposition of litigation,nonetheless justify a decision to stay or dismiss federal proceedings pending resolution of concurrent state court proceedings.colorado river,at.quoting kerotest fire equip.such circumstances are,however,exceedingly rare.as we have previously observed,the colorado river doctrine is a narrow exception to the virtually unflagging obligation of the federal courts to exercise the jurisdiction given them.holder,at quoting colorado river,at.

when a district court decides to dismiss or stay under colorado river,it presumably concludes that the parallel litigation will be an adequate vehicle for the complete and prompt resolution of the issues between the parties.if there is any substantial doubt as to this,it would be a serious abuse of discretion to grant the stay or dismissal at all

having reviewed the pleadings in both the state and federal actions,we conclude that the likelihood of the state court proceeding adequately addressing the issues presented in the federal proceeding was,at the time of the district court decision,unclear at best although the landowners in their complaint in the state action referenced the project subcontracts as a basis for their asserted water rights,it was by no means clear from their state action complaint that they sought a determination of their rights under the project subcontracts.rather,the relief they sought focused on their rights against the irrigation districts under the memoranda of understanding and water service agreements.moreover,there was little to indicate that the state court proceeding would necessarily entail an examination of the landowners rights,if any,under the master contract or the project subcontracts.in these circumstances,substantial doubt existed regarding whether the state court action would resolve the claims at issue in this federal proceeding.we therefore agree with the district court that a stay or dismissal pursuant to colorado river was unwarranted.

the landowners contend that state law,rather than federal law,controls the interpretation of the master contract and the project subcontracts,and that,under state law,the landowners are beneficiaries of those federal subcontracts.we disagree.
federal law governs the interpretation of contracts entered into pursuant to federal law and to which the government is a party.united states,cir.although we have recognized limited circumstances in which state law may apply to the interpretation of a federal contract,such as when the united states is not a party,or when the direct interests and obligations of the government are not in question,see,flagstaff med,sullivan,cir,such circumstances do not exist in the present case.the united states is a party to the master contract and to each of the relevant subcontracts.moreover,the claims asserted by the landowners implicate the government obligations and interests the arizona water settlement agreement facilitates the united states government obligations to certain indian tribes,while protecting the government interest in ensuring eventual repayment of the project construction costs.

the landowners contend,whether the contracts are interpreted pursuant to state or federal law,the landowners are properly classified as beneficiaries of the contracts who can therefore assert claims against the conservation district.having reviewed the text and purpose of the master contract and the relevant subcontracts,we conclude the landowners are not intended beneficiaries.

we held that the irrigators would not be entitled to enforce the contract unless they could qualify as beneficiaries.id.at.applying federal law,we described the relevant analysis 
to sue as a beneficiary of a contract,the third party must show that the contract reflects the express or implied intention of the parties to the contract to benefit the third party.the intended beneficiary need not be specifically or individually identified in the contract,but must fall within a class clearly intended by the parties to benefit from the contract.
