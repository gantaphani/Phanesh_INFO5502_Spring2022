in this water law litigation,climax molybdenum company climax appeals the district court denial of its motion to intervene in a set of consolidated cases over which the district court retained jurisdiction after first deciding them more than fifty years ago.the appeal presents an issue of first impression in this circuit whether a proposed intervenor may establish standing,and thus federal court jurisdiction over its motion to intervene,by piggybacking on the standing of an existing party to a lawsuit over which the district court has retained jurisdiction but within which there is no current,active dispute among the parties.
exercising appellate jurisdiction under,we conclude that within litigation over which a district court has retained jurisdiction after entering a final decree,a proposed intervenor may not establish piggyback standing where the existing parties in the suit are not seeking judicial resolution of an active dispute among them.because climax is unable to establish either piggyback or independent standing in the cases at issue,we vacate the district court order and remand with instructions to dismiss climax motion for lack of jurisdiction.
background 
the multifaceted litigation behind this appeal turns on the adjudication and administration of water rights on colorado blue river,a tributary of the colorado river on the state western slope.the blue river rises in summit county and flows north through breckenridge,dillon,and silverthorne,joining the colorado river just south of kremmling.
ca in summit county district court 
climax owns the climax mine the mine,a molybdenum mine and mill in colorado summit,lake,and eagle counties.in,as part of a supplemental stream adjudication in summit county district court,water district and pursuant to its mining,milling,manufacturing and domestic purposes.at,climax was decreed five conditional rights to divert water from tenmile creek,which is a tributary to the blue river.this adjudication was denominated civil action ca.
the summit county court assigned two of climax conditional rights,for supply canal and supply canal,priority dates of august,it assigned the remaining three rights,for tenmile diversion ditch,tenmile diversion ditch,and chalk mountain ditch,a priority date of june.the court further assigned these rights priority numbers,and,respectively.climax later perfected its conditional ca rights,and the mine was operated continuously from through.
ca and ca in summit county district court 
the same year that climax secured its conditional rights to divert from tenmile creek,congress authorized a reclamation project known as the thompson project cbt.city of grand junction city county of denver.the cbt purposes,along with congress directives for implementing the project,were laid out in senate document,congress,session.those purposes included diverting water from colorado western slope to provide for the irrigation of approximately acres of irrigated land on the state eastern slope.aplt.app.at.the cbt was also intended,however,to generate hydroelectric power and supply additional water for agricultural and industrial uses on the western slope.in re application of city county of denver,cir.in accordance with senate document,the united states built the green mountain reservoir and power plant on the blue river,roughly sixteen miles southeast of kremmling,colorado.the green mountain facility is downstream of climax tenmile creek diversion points.
in,after construction on the green mountain reservoir and power plant had been completed,a number of appropriators of blue river the city and county of denver denver and the city of colorado springs colorado springs initiated in summit county district court two adjudications for claims to water from the blue river and its tributaries in water district.aplt.app.at.these two proceedings,civil actions ca and ca,were intended to determine,respectively,relative priorities to blue river water for purposes of irrigation and for purposes other than irrigation.the cases were consolidated for trial in the summit county court.
at issue for denver in ca and ca were water rights for its blue river diversion project,which diverted the waters of the blue river,the snake river and tenmile creek at or near their confluence,together with the waters naturally tributary thereto,to the denver metropolitan area for use in the water works system owned by denver.at.the blue river diversion project impounded water in the dillon reservoir and transmitted it to the north fork of the south platte river via the montezuma tunnel,later renamed the roberts tunnel.the dillon reservoir and roberts tunnel are situated downstream of climax tenmile creek diversion points and upstream of the green mountain reservoir and power plant.
the united states entered ca and ca in,claiming water rights for the green mountain reservoir and power plant under the cbt.in,while the summit county cases were pending,the united states withdrew its claim in those proceedings and brought a declaratory judgment action in federal court,asking the court to declare its rights and obligations in connection with the operation of the cbt under senate document,to determine its rights to the use of water from the colorado river,the blue river,and other tributaries of the colorado river,and to quiet title to those water rights as against a group of defendants including denver and colorado springs collectively,the cities.id.at.this federal case was denominated civil action ca.
the summit county district court decided ca and in march of.the united states having withdrawn from the proceedings,the colorado river water conservation district crwcd instead appeared as the claimant for water rights for the green mountain reservoir and power plant in its judgment and decree,the county court adjudicated denver blue river diversion project claims by awarding conditional rights with a priority date of june,it further adjudicated conditional rights for colorado springs,with a priority date of may.the court denied the claim of the colorado river water conservation district for a decree for the green mountain reservoir,finding that the evidence submitted for that claim was insufficient to justify the court in entering any decree of water rights for the green mountain facility.id.at.see city county of denver,at.
ca and ca reached the colorado supreme court in.sitting en banc,the court affirmed the summit county court adjudication of blue river rights and priority dates for denver and colorado springs.id.at.the court reversed the denial of any decree to the green mountain reservoir and power plant,remanding to the summit county court with instructions to adjudicate rights for the green mountain facility.city county of denver,at.water rights can not in fact be adjudicated as to part of the claimants only,the court reasoned t hey are relative both as to time and amount,so that n one is certain unless all are determined.id.at.
c.the consolidated cases in federal court 
on remand of ca and ca,in april of,the united states was served with notice and a summons pursuant to the mccarran amendment,which congress had passed in.the united states promptly removed ca and ca to federal court.denying the cities motion to remand the cases to state court,the district court specifically limited the issues in those removed cases to be in accordance with the mandate of the supreme court of the state of colorado.aplt.app.at.removed cases ca and ca were civil action ca and civil action ca,and they were consolidated for trial with the united states declaratory judgment action,ca.ca,ca,and ca became known as the consolidated cases in the united states court for the district of colorado 
the district court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law and final decree in the consolidated blue river decree in october of.the blue river decree,which incorporated the parties settlement agreement and stipulation,adjudicated the united states right to divert blue river water for the green mountain reservoir and power plant,with a priority date of august.the decree incorporated by reference the summit county district court decrees in ca and ca,insofar as those decrees adjudicated the cities water rights.the decree also included a stipulation between the united states and the cities permitting the cities,under certain circumstances,to divert blue river water as against the green mountain power plant right.climax refers to this stipulation as the power interference agreement.aplt.br.at.
the power interference agreement provided that the cities diversions of blue river water were subject to the rights of the united states of america to fill each year the green mountain reservoir to a capacity of acre feet for utilization by the united states of america in accordance with senate document.aplt.app.at.these diversions thus were subject to the decision of the secretary of the interior that they will not adversely affect the ability of green mountain reservoir to fulfill its function except only as to the production of power.id.
the power interference agreement further provided that the cities could divert water as against the green mountain power plant right solely for municipal purposes,and only if the cities delivered to the united states electrical energy in substantially the same amounts,at approximately the same hours and at substantially the same rates of delivery that the green mountain power plant would have generated in the absence of the diversions.id.at.in addition,the agreement dictated that the cities will at all times bypass water in quantities sufficient to meet all legal calls of downstream water rights on the blue river,and within colorado below the confluence of that stream with the main stream of the colorado river.id.at.
the district court retain ed continuing jurisdiction for the purpose of effectuating the objectives of the blue river decree,which was approved by the united states congress in,congress,april.id.at.invoking that continuing jurisdiction,the parties to the consolidated cases have returned to the district court to settle a number of disputes since the decree was issued in.climax has never successfully intervened in those disputes.
climax first moved to intervene in the consolidated cases in,when denver and the crwcd argued in summit county district court ca that all matters involving water rights in water district had been removed to the federal court as a result of the removal of civil actions and.aplt.app.at.in a june order denying the motion to intervene,the district court held that ca had not been removed to federal court,and that there was no federal court jurisdiction over that action.the district court explained,
under the laws of the state of colorado this court can take no action in the removed civil action federal ca affecting the vested property rights of american metal climax,which it has obtained in civil action 
american metal climax,is not and will not be bound by the judgment of this court in these consolidated actions entered october,or by any future judgment,order or decree of this court entered in civil action.
id.at.climax again moved to intervene in the consolidated cases during a dispute among the parties,but voluntarily withdrew that motion before it was decided.
climax instant motion to intervene 
following its almost fifty years of continuous operation from through,the mine generally has been dormant since.climax plans to return the mine to full operation this year,and it will need to exercise all of its water rights to operate the mine at full capacity.aplt.br.at.climax ca rights account for between and percent of the mine water supply.
according to climax,at a february,meeting of colorado river water users,the colorado state state primary administrator of water that he planned to administer climax ca rights as junior to both the federal green mountain power plant right and denver blue river project diversion right under the power interference agreement.climax believes that its ca rights are senior to both the green mountain power plant right and denver right to divert blue river water under the power interference agreement,and thus disputes the state engineer planned method of administration.
after attempting,unsuccessfully,to resolve the dispute short of litigation.at,climax filed its motion to intervene in the consolidated cases,along with a petition on intervention for declaratory relief.climax ultimately sought a declaratory judgment announcing the relative priority of its water rights on the blue river those rights decreed by the district court to other parties in the blue river decree.dist.order at.the northern colorado water conservancy district ncwcd and the cities opposed the motion to intervene the crwcd,grand valley water users association,orchard mesa irrigation district,palisade irrigation district,grand valley irrigation company,and middle park water conservancy district responded to the motion but did not oppose it and the united states did not respond to the motion.
the district court denied climax motion as to both intervention of right and permissive intervention under.the court held that climax could not meet the requirement for intervention as of right under rule a,because the rule requires that a intervenor be so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede its ability to protect its interest.dist.order at quoting.a emphasis and alteration added by district court.the court explained that a s a matter of plain meaning,this phrase requires some pending action or judgment of the court the intervenor practically impair its interest.id.emphasis added by district court.here,there is no currently pending motion or proceeding before the court in the consolidated cases,and the district court reasoned that granting the motion could raise grave concerns as to a intervenor ability to skirt standing requirements.id.at.
the court went on to deny permissive intervention under rule b on the ground that,based on climax dispute with the state engineer,the state engineer likely would become a necessary party to the consolidated cases,thus causing undue delay for,or prejudice to,the existing parties.the court also concluded that state water court appears to present the most natural forum for assessing the relative priority of climax ca rights those rights adjudicated in the blue river decree.id.at.
climax timely appealed.

standard of review 
if we reach the merits of climax appeal,our review of the district court denial of the motion to intervene as of right will be de novo,while our review of the denial of the motion for permissive intervention will be for abuse of discretion.dejulius new eng.health care employees pension fund,cir.
however,b efore turning to the merits,we must address the threshold question of whether climax has standing to intervene in the consolidated cases.wyoming ex rel crank united states,cir.any party,whether original or intervening,that seeks relief from a federal court must have standing to pursue its claims.dillard chilton county comm n,cir per curiam,cert.denied,green chilton county comm n,d.furthermore,although the district court did not rule on whether climax had standing to intervene,and a lthough neither side raises the issue here we are required to address the issue,city of dallas,d,overruled on other grounds,city of littleton gifts,d.the federal courts are under an independent obligation to examine their own jurisdiction,and standing is perhaps the most important of the jurisdictional doctrines.id.at.quoting allen wright,d alteration omitted see also new eng.health care employees pension woodruff,cir.we review questions of standing de novo.crank,at.
