after a bench trial,the court ruled that the plaintiffs acquired prescriptive rights to take water from a spring on the defendants property and to maintain a water line across the defendants property for that purpose.
the defendants appeal,claiming the trial court decision was based on legal error and its findings of fact were not supported by substantial evidence.the defendants contend that prescriptive rights to surface water are not recognized by california law,substantial evidence does not support the finding that the water line was visible,open and notorious,the purported visibility of the water line was not sufficient to provide constructive notice of the diversion of water from a spring unknown to defendants,and plaintiffs failed to prove their use of the water and water line was hostile and adverse.we will reject each of these arguments and affirm the judgment.
part ii.of this opinion is published because it addresses a question noted and not resolved by the california supreme,whether prescriptive rights in surface water may be perfected as between private parties.people shirokow cal d,fn.we conclude that california law recognizes prescriptive water rights as between private parties in the circumstances presented by this case.
in part iii.of this opinion,we conclude that substantial evidence supports the trial court findings regarding open and notorious use that was hostile and adverse to the defendants rights.we publish the portion of part iii.that explores new ground relating to the impact of recognition by the claimant of the record owner rights.
plaintiffs lyle brewer and elizabeth brewer acquired property in in eastern fresno county.at the time of their purchase,the water source for the property was a spring located on a parcel now owned by defendants dean murphy and keith klein.the parcel owned by defendants is approximately one mile to the east of plaintiffs property.the spring water is transported to plaintiffs property through a galvanized pipe that runs from the spring,through a culvert beneath tollhouse road,and across other parcels until it reaches plaintiffs property.brewer testified that he has used the spring and water line to supply a house on his property since.
defendant murphy acquired the parcel containing the spring in may.the parcel contains acres of land and is located approximately one and a half miles northeast of tollhouse,california.the parcel western boundary is about half a mile long and fronts tollhouse road.the spring is located near tollhouse road in the parcel southwest corner,which is steep terrain.
defendant murphy hunted on the mountain where his parcel is located when he was young.despite his familiarity with the area,he did not know there was a spring on the property when he acquired it in.he testified that in the many times he drove by the property on his way to and from shaver lake he never saw the water line.he also testified he had not seen the spring box until december.
in,defendant murphy transferred an undivided interest in the parcel to defendant klein.defendant klein,an architect from south lake tahoe,looked at the property before the transaction and looked at it several times after the transaction.in,he did not see the water line or the spring box,and he did not inspect the culverts running from the property under tollhouse road.he was not told and did not ask if there was a water source on the property.
downhill from tollhouse road and defendants is,to the a parcel owned by stephen hagg.hagg purchased the parcel in december.the hagg parcel occupies about three quarters of a mile of road frontage between defendants parcel and plaintiffs property.there are a few parcels between hagg property and plaintiffs.the water line from the spring to plaintiffs property runs across the hagg parcel.
the culvert through which the water line runs is made of corrugated metal pipe that is two feet in diameter.the culvert is beneath tollhouse road and a flat turnout area on the uphill,or east,side of tollhouse road.the turnout area was created using fill the bottom of the culvert is about three feet lower than the surface of the turnout area.the testimony of the parties regarding the visibility of the water line to someone standing at the edge of the fill and looking down at the culvert is set forth in more detail in part.a,post.
the spring box is located in the bed of an intermittent stream.it is made of concrete and is approximately two feet square.the spring box is up a ravine or gully approximately to feet east of the culvert.the elevation of the spring box is about feet higher that the road.the to feet of water line closest to the culvert is above ground,while the portion nearest the spring box is buried 
shortly after hagg acquired the parcel,brewer and he had a discussion about the water line,and brewer told him not to connect to the water line.nevertheless,hagg tapped into the water line and used water for a horse trough.as a result,plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against hagg and olivia hagg to stop their interference with the water line.
while the litigation with the haggs was pending,plaintiffs filed an application to appropriate unappropriated water with the california state water resources control board swrcb for the purpose of obtaining a permit to divert the water at the spring.in completing item.d of the application,which asks what steps have been taken to obtain right to access,plaintiffs responded.item of the application is titled existing water right and asks the applicant to check one of three boxes.box b corresponds to a statement that applicant claims an existing right for use of water sought by this application but agrees not to exercise said right so long as a permit or license for such use remains in effect.box c corresponds to a statement that the water sought by this application is for additional water over that claimed under an existing right.plaintiffs did not check any of the boxes,but a question mark was placed in the margin to the right of boxes b and c.in a table below the boxes,which is to be completed if box b or c is checked,plaintiffs indicated that the nature of their rights were appropriative,the year of first use was,the uses were year round for residential,garden and livestock,and the source was a spring.
brewer testified that he believed he had an existing right to use the water from the spring.the defendants did not contest plaintiffs application.
in september,the swrcb issued certificate no.to plaintiffs,which stated that the water appropriated was limited to gallons per day and the maximum amount diverted was limited to per year.the certificate also stated the appropriation was subject to prior rights and this registration shall not be construed as conferring upon the registrant the right of access to the point of diversion.
in february,before the lawsuit between plaintiffs and the haggs was finished,hagg filed a water right complaint with the swrcb.
in july,plaintiffs obtained a judgment against the haggs.the judgment decreed that plaintiffs were the sole owners of an easement feet wide for the use,maintenance,operation and repair of the water line situated on the haggs parcel.the judgment enjoined the haggs from interfering with plaintiffs use of the easement,prohibited the haggs from extracting water from the existing water line,and required them to remove a that had been installed into the water line.
approximately two months after the entry of the judgment,the swrcb issued its report on hagg water right complaint.the swrcb september,report stated 
t o the extent that water would reach the hagg property,he would be able to use water pursuant to a riparian right.likewise,to the extent that water would reach the hardwick and brewer properties,they would be able to use water under riparian right.during the wet months winter and spring there may be sufficient flow to reach all of the properties and allow each owner to divert under a riparian claim of right.however,during the dry season it is not likely that water would reach either the brewer or hardwick properties that are located almost a mile downstream.
the swrcb report concluded that plaintiffs certificate no.should not be revoked as long as plaintiffs fully complied with its requirements and direct diversion of the spring water for use on the hagg property could be made under a claim of right as an upper riparian.the staff of the swrcb advised plaintiffs that they should get permission from defendants to access the property on which the spring was located.
as a result,in late september,plaintiffs contacted defendants about obtaining permission for access to the spring.the negotiations between plaintiffs and defendants is reflected in part in a series of letters exchanged during september and october.the negotiations did not lead to an agreement between plaintiffs and defendants.one point of disagreement was defendants requirement that plaintiffs abandon their claim to any prior rights.
in contrast to plaintiffs,hagg was able to reach an agreement with defendants and,under that agreement,ran a separate pvc pipe from his property to the spring box.
proceedings 
on august,plaintiffs filed suit against defendants and others seeking injunctive relief and a judgment to quiet title.specifically,plaintiffs requested a judgment acknowledging they owned a prescriptive easement to extract water from the spring and transport the water through the existing water line across defendants property to their residence.
a court trial began on december.
the trial court filed its statement of decision on october,which stated that plaintiffs have met their burden of proof with respect to the establishment of their right to an easement by prescription.citations.the extent of the easement would be for the maintenance,operation,and repair of the waterline and the right to divert in accordance with the permit issued by the state of california up to gallons per day with a maximum diversion per year not to exceed acre feet.
judgment was filed in favor of plaintiffs on october.
discussion 
standards of review 
when an appellate court reviews a statement of decision issued by a trial court,questions of fact are reviewed under a standard different from that applied to questions of law.brasher cascade auto auction valley auto sales leasing th,d.
findings of fact 
the trial court findings on questions of fact are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.crawford southern pacific cal d,substantial evidence rule.that standard for review has been described by our supreme court as follows 
where findings of fact are challenged on a civil appeal,we are bound by the elementary,but often overlooked principle of law,that the power of an appellate court begins and ends with a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,to support the findings below.crawford southern pacific,supra,cal d.we must therefore view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,giving it the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolving all conflicts in its favor in accordance with the standard of review so long adhered to by this court.jessup farms baldwin cal d.
evidence is substantial for purposes of this standard of review if it is of ponderable legal significance,reasonable in nature,credible,and of solid value citations.grappo coventry financial d.
conclusions of law 
a trial court conclusions of law are subject to independent review by an appellate court.see ghirardo antonioli cal th,d,questions of law are subject to independent review.in other words,an appellate court decides a question of law without deference to how it was answered below.coburn sievert th,d.
ii.prescriptive rights and riparian users 
contentions of the parties 
defendants argue that by law,water rights may not be acquired by adverse possession,because the california water code provides the exclusive means of acquiring appropriated water.plaintiffs contend that,because they are riparian landowners,they fall within an exception to this rule.defendants respond by asserting that plaintiffs are not riparian landowners because their property is not adjacent to a watercourse emanating from defendants property 
legal issue presented on appeal 
in support of the proposition that water rights can not be obtained by prescription,defendants rely on the california supreme court decision in people shirokow,supra,cal d.there,an upstream landowner impounded stream water behind a dam and used the water for livestock and irrigation.id.at.the landowner had not obtained a permit from the swrcb.ibid.the state sought an injunction against the diversion,arguing it constituted a trespass under water code section.people shirokow,supra,at.the landowner argued that he had acquired a prescriptive right against all downstream users and the state and,therefore,his use of the water could not be enjoined.id.at.the court rejected the landowner argument and reversed,holding that a claim of prescriptive rights in water can not lie as against the state when the state seeks to enjoin unauthorized use pursuant to water code section.people shirokow,supra,cal d at,fn.the court limited the scope of its decision,however,by stating that it did not reach the question of whether and under what circumstances prescriptive rights in water may be perfected as between private parties.ibid.
at least two opinions that predate shirokow hold that a lower riparian owner who directly diverts water from an upper riparian owner land may acquire prescriptive water rights as a result of adverse use.lindsay king d,see saxon dubois d.following lindsay king d water,prescriptive water rights running upstream.defendants have failed to convince us that these authorities should not be followed accordingly,as did the trial court,we reject defendants contention that the water code presented the exclusive method by which plaintiffs could obtain rights to water from the spring.
factual issues challenged on appeal 
the contentions of the parties raise the questions whether plaintiffs property is adjacent to a watercourse and whether that watercourse emanates from defendants property.we must examine the record to determine if substantial evidence supports plaintiffs factual assertions.see part,ante.
brewer testified that the spring box was located within an intermittent stream that ran from defendants property to his property.he also testified that the stream ran from the spring box toward the culvert.various photographs showed the spring box,water line running from the spring box,the dry stream bed,and the culvert.
klein testified that,a s the water board referred to it,it is an stream,which means it does not hold water year round.it only runs water when it rains.he also testified that he had not seen any water running from his property to other properties.
hagg,the owner of property located between defendants property and plaintiffs property,testified that the creek originated on defendants property and flowed down to his property.he testified that the water line was in a heavily vegetated creek bed.
we conclude brewer testimony,hagg testimony,and the related photographs and documents constitute substantial evidence to show that an intermittent stream existed and that plaintiffs were lower riparian owners.accordingly,we reject defendants assertion,which has not been supported by citations to the record,that plaintiffs land was not adjacent to a watercourse emanating from defendants property.
iii.sufficiency of proof of the elements of prescription 
essential elements of a prescriptive rights claim 
the elements that create a claim of prescriptive water right,like a claim for prescriptive easement,include use that is actual,open and notorious,hostile and adverse to the original owner,continuous and uninterrupted,under a claim of right,for the statutory period of five years,city of barstow mojave water agency,supra,cal th at,d,see also saxon dubois,supra,d at.prescriptive water right is established when t he use was for more than five years,was open,notorious,continuous,peaceable,and uninterrupted under a claim of right.
whether the elements of prescription are established is a question of fact for the trial court.warsaw chicago metallic ceilings,cal d.
