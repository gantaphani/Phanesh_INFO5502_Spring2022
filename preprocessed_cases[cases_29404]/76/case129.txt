appellants brought this case against the united states army corps of engineers alleging that the corps had violated the national environmental policy act the act in connection with its grand prairie area demonstration project the project in east central arkansas and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.both sides moved for summary judgment,and the district court granted judgment to the corps.appellants argue on their appeal that the cumulative impact analysis in the final environmental assessment fea was inadequate and that a supplemental environmental impact statement seis should have been prepared.we affirm.
the grand prairie region consists of over acres located between mississippi and arkansas,and it is a major rice producing area.this region relies on groundwater primarily from the alluvial aquifer and the sparta aquifer.the alluvial aquifer provides ninety percent of the agricultural water used in the region,and it will be depleted by unless protective action is taken.depletion of the alluvial aquifer would cause severe economic hardship to the region seventy seven percent of the irrigated crop would be lost,and rice production would decline by twenty three percent.the sparta aquifer provides drinking water to local residences and supplies the water needs of local industry,but the suitability of its drinking water will eventually be destroyed if it continues to be diverted for other uses as the alluvial aquifer is depleted.
the grand prairie project was designed by the corps to allow continued irrigation of the agricultural region while preserving the alluvial aquifer.the corps issued a draft environmental impact assessment eis for public comment in early.in july in response to the public comments,the corps issued a draft general reevaluation report grr.the final environmental impact assessment feis was issued in,and a record of decision rod was signed in.the feis and rod selected alternative as the plan to be implemented.the project has five components conservation of water by increasing agricultural efficiency of water usage,reduction of water withdrawals from the alluvial aquifer so that there is no net loss of water and an end to drawing on the sparta aquifer for irrigation,additional on farm reservoirs,construction of a system that would pump excess water from the white river into the grand prairie region,and various environmental improvement features.since the signing of the rod in,twenty four percent of the total estimated cost of the project has already been invested.
arkansas wildlife federation awf filed suit in february,alleging that the corps had failed to comply with the act and seeking a preliminary and permanent injunction against the construction of the water import feature of the project.awf alleged that the corps had not considered all reasonably feasible alternatives before adopting alternative,that the feis and rod had not adequately considered the cumulative impacts of the proposed project,that the corps had not adequately considered the direct and indirect impacts of the project on the white river basin,and that the corps improperly tiered the minimum flow requirements of the arkansas state water plan to the feis.
in march,the corps issued for public comment a draft environmental assessment dea and a finding of no significant impact fonsi.the dea included a list of proposed changes to the original plan,including converting miles of canals into pipelines,providing water delivery by pipeline instead of existing streams,use of acres of borrow pits to store materials for constructing levees instead of hauling material from a farther distance,construction of a separate building to house the control system,widening of a canal,alignment changes to canals and pipelines,replacement of canal with multiple small pipelines,and rehabilitation of existing reservoirs.
the corps issued a final environmental assessment fea and a fonsi in july which approved the changes proposed in the dea.the corps determined that the changes adopted by the fea were minor and would cause no significant unmitigated environmental impacts not already considered and that preparation of a seis was therefore not required.awf amended its pleadings to challenge this finding and argued that a seis was required.
both sides moved for summary judgment.the district court found that awf four year delay in challenging the feis,grr,and rod was unreasonable and that those claims were barred by laches.alternatively,the district court held that the corps had complied with the act in connection with the feis,grr,and rod.the court additionally held that the corps had adequately considered the cumulative impacts and the direct and indirect effects of the project and that a seis had not been required following the changes adopted by the fea.awf appeals,arguing that the district court erred in finding no seis was required because the cumulative impact analysis by the corps had been inadequate,substantial changes in the project had been made,and significant new information had been discovered.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.nunley department of justice,cir,but challenges to agency action are reviewed for whether it was arbitrary and capricious.a marsh oregon natural resources council,d.we are not free to substitute our own judgment for that of the agency,but rather our role is to ensure that the agency has adequately considered and disclosed the environmental impact of its actions.mid states coalition for progress surface trans,cir quoting baltimore gas natural resources defense council,d.
awf contends that neither the feis nor the fea adequately considered the cumulative impacts of past,present,and future action on the project.in order to evaluate the fea properly awf argues we must first review the adequacy of the feis.the corps responds that awf failure to appeal the district court ruling on laches prevents it from now challenging the adequacy of the cumulative impact analysis in the feis.awf contends that it is not challenging the feis directly,but rather arguing that the feis was not sufficiently comprehensive to permit its cumulative impact analysis to serve as the basis for that in the fea.it asserts that it was therefore improper for the fea to incorporate or be tiered upon the feis cumulative impact analysis.
although we have implied that any prior environmental impact statement eis should be reviewed in determining whether an fea is adequate,newton county wildlife ass rogers,cir sierra club forest service,cir,there appears to be no case indicating that such a rule should apply to an feis when review of it is barred by laches.we need not address the question of whether laches bars consideration of this feis as it relates to the fea,however,because we conclude that the cumulative impact analysis in both the feis and the fea was adequate.
the act requires that the agency proposing any action which may significantly affect the environment study and consider the environmental impacts of the proposed action,any unavoidable adverse environmental impacts,and the relationship between local short term uses of the environment and productivity.c.this requires study of the direct,indirect,and cumulative impacts of the proposed action.cumulative impacts,a focus of this appeal,are the impact s on the environment which result from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency federal or or person undertakes such action.
in complaining that the feis only lists additional projects,but does not analyze the cumulative environmental impacts,awf relies on statements of the environmental protection agency,the fish and wildlife service,and other state and private organizations critical of the cumulative impact analysis by the corps.although other government agencies urged the corps to wait for the completion of comprehensive studies of the white river basin by other entities,the act only requires that the corps consider and respond to the comments of other agencies.the act does not require the corps to wait for other agencies to complete their studies,en
