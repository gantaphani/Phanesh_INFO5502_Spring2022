this appeal is the latest chapter in the saga of pacific northwest native american treaty fishing rights a saga that has spanned many generations and over forty years of federal litigation.if history is our guide,it will not be the last chapter written.after a remand from this court,the district court conducted a trial primarily based on expert anthropological opinions,documents,and reliable hearsay.the confederated tribes and bands of the yakama indian nation yakama appeal,and the confederated tribes of the colville indian reservation colville on behalf of their wenatchi constituent tribe wenatchi,the district court finding that they share joint fishing rights at the wenatshapam fishery on icicle tributary to the wenatchee river which flows into the columbia an agreement between the united states and the yakama.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
for over a the result of broken and forgotten wenatchi fishing rights at their aboriginal home and fishing station have been in doubt.we hold that the district court ruling is supported by historical evidence establishing that it was the intent of the negotiators to grant the wenatchi fishing rights at wenatshapam,that the yakama did not sell all of their fishing rights at wenatshapam,and that both tribes fishing rights are.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
before the arrival of settlers,the wenatshapam fishery was the aboriginal salmon fishing ground of the wenatchi more than any other place,the wenatshapam fishery was the hub around which the wenatchi cycle of life rotated.the center of the wenatshapam fishery was the confluence of icicle creek and the wenatchee river in north central washington state near the town of leavenworth.
in,the united states began a hasty effort to clear land occupied by indians for development by settlers in washington territory.united states oregon,cir oregon i,as amended,cir.territorial governor isaac stevens,under pressure to extinguish indian title to all lands,consolidated small tribes or bands into larger tribal entities for the purposes of the treaties.id.the wenatchi tribe was one of the fourteen tribes represented at the negotiation of the yakama treaty.the treaty specified that tribes for the purposes of this treaty,are to be considered as one nation,under the name of yakama.united states oregon,cir oregon ii quoting treaty with the yakamas,june,stat.hereinafter treaty internal quotation marks omitted.
under the treaty the tribes gave up most of their lands in return for a specific reservation with set boundaries.oregon ii,at.the land for the reservation was subsequently surveyed and set apart as provided in the treaty.id.with regard to fishing rights,article iii of the treaty provided,
the exclusive right of taking fish in all the streams,where running through or bordering said reservation,is further secured to said confederated tribes and bands of indians,as also the right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places,in common with citizens of the territory,and of erecting temporary buildings for curing them together with the privilege of hunting,gathering roots and berries,and pasturing their horses and cattle upon open and unclaimed land.
treaty at.in addition,tribal leader spokesman for the fourteen tribes that would constitute the yakama on a reservation at wenatshapam where the indians take many fish.this was done at the request wenatchi leader tecolekun.accordingly,article x of the treaty set aside a second reservation,providing,
that there is also reserved and set apart from the lands ceded by this treaty,for the use and benefit of the aforesaid confederated tribes and bands,a tract of land not exceeding in quantity one township of six miles square,situated at the forks of the pisquouse or wenatshapam river,and known as the wenatshapam fishery,which said reservation shall be surveyed and marked out whenever the president may direct,and be subject to the same provisions and restrictions as other indian reservations.
despite the promise made in article x of the treaty,no attempt was made by the united states to survey the reservation for almost forty years.the wenatchi remained at this wenatshapam fishery reservation and fished there during this time,firmly believing that a survey would be made and they would be secure in this reservation.oregon ii,at.
the wenatchee valley remained difficult to reach by settlers for much of the late,but by,the great northern railroad reached the area,laying tracks up the wenatchee river and through the wenatshapam had never been taken out of the public leavenworth,a townsite developed by the railroad.
in july,yakama reservation indian agent jay lynch contacted the commissioner of indian affairs,browning,inquiring as to whether or not the wenatshapam fishery reservation had ever been definitely located and what disposition ha d ever been made of it,if any.letter of july,from jay lynch to comm r of indian affairs,reprinted in exec.doc.at hereinafter senate doc.as a result of this letter,the acting secretary of the interior,william sims,authorized a survey of the reservation in.senate doc.at.however,before the survey commenced,agent lynch was removed from his post.
the survey went forward,slowly setting out an area at the confluence of the wenatchee river and icicle creek.oregon ii,at.this prompted several settlers in the wenatchee valley to complain that to form a new reservation across this valley from mountain to mountain,as is proposed,it not only embraces the great northern railway,but many settlers.senate doc.at.commissioner browning responded,
in reply you are advised that the wenatchee is not established as a new reservation,but as the fulfillment of a treaty obligation,which had been heretofore overlooked or neglected by the government since the ratification of the yakima treaty in.it is now as much indian land as the yakima indian reservation itself,the only difference being that the one had distinct boundaries named and described in the treaty,while the other was referred to as a tract of land not exceeding in quantity one township of miles square,situated at the forks of the pisquause or wenatchapam river,which the government stipulated and agreed should be surveyed and marked out whenever the president might direct.this was not done until last fall when the president ordered the survey and the location of this tract,which is now being made.
id.commissioner browning suggested that the settlers petition the president to enter into negotiations with the indians for the purchase of the article x reservation,which they did.id.
before the survey could be completed,the newly appointed yakima indian agent,lewis erwin,ordered the surveyor to stop the surveying and to destroy all the monuments and trees that had markings.instead,he directed the surveyor to survey an area some distance away in the mountains next to a lake,but not near the river.oregon ii,at.shortly thereafter,settler james chase,contacted commissioner browning.significantly,he observed,
i am convinced there are quite a number of indians old in years who were born and have always lived on the wenatchee river,and on the very land which they now claim should be the reservation,and who at the time helped build and owned a part in all the fisheries on the wenatchee river 
senate doc.at.he concluded,there is no doubt in my mind but what the intention was to secure the reserve to the indians who owned the fisheries and that while the contract or treaty of mentioned the yakimas it really intended to give the land to the indians who owned the fisheries id.at.
once former agent lynch learned that the proposed location of the wenatshapam fishery reservation had now been moved far above the confluence,he wrote a letter decrying a great injustice done to the yakima indians by reason of a recent survey of the boundary line of a reservation known as the wenatchapam fishery.id.at.in the letter he quoted an old indian who protested,
does our great father at washington think a salmon is an eagle that lives on top of a mountain,or does he think a salmon is a deer that lives in the woods and hills,or does he think a salmon is a mountain goat that lives among the rocks of the snow covered mountains 
tell our great father the indian does not care for the little trout in the lake,but wants the salmon that lives in the rocky places in the river where the indian can find him.our fishery is in the river where you saw it,and was destroyed by white men and the indians driven away.we want our fishery in the river where governor stephens gave it to us a long time ago.
secretary sims subsequently authorized commissioner browning to enter into negotiations to purchase the wenatshapam reservation,specifically noting,it seems from letters submitted with your communication that there are indians other than the yakimas living in the neighborhood of this reservation who have,or claim,some rights therein.the rights of such indians in land or fishing privileges should be taken into consideration and protected.id.at.
on october,commissioner browning authorized agent erwin to enter into negotiations.id.he reiterated secretary sims observation that indians other than the yakimas were living at wenatshapam and the secretary express instruction that the rights of such indians in lands or fishing privileges should be taken into consideration and protected.id.at.he also instructed agent erwin to take great care in recording the proceedings,which prompted the agent in to hire a stenographer to produce a transcript of the negotiations.the district court heavily relied on that transcript in rendering its factual findings supporting the decision we review here.
agent erwin convened a tribal council at the yakama reservation on december,to open negotiations for the purchase of the article x reservation.id.at.four wenatchi leaders,including chief john harmelt,made the mile journey from wenatshapam to attend.agent erwin began the negotiations by reading commissioner browning letter offering to purchase the land,but promising not to deprive the indians of the use of the fisheries.id.
agent erwin proposed that the council sell the incorrectly located mountain reservation and that the wenatchi take allotments in the wenatchee valley where they resided.id.importantly,he stated,i have something further that i want to say about the fishery privilege and that is that even if you should agree to sell,the department says that you shall have the lawful use of the fisheries in common with the white people.id.
chief harmelt did not initially agree to the sale.he stated,i myself alone have heard what you said and if all the indians over at wenatchee would hear what you said,then they would decide on this land.i think those people out ought to know about this matter,then let the decision come afterwards.id.at alteration in original.chief harmelt suggested he return to wenatshapam to inform the wenatchi of the proposal.id.after the yakama proposed a price of per acre,however,chief harmelt stated,i am well satisfied between you two.whatever they ask for the land that is my same price.id.at.
on december,special agent john lane informed the council that he would telegraph the department of the interior to see if the price was agreeable,and would reconvene the council when he received a reply.he then stated,if the wenatchee indians are not here then we will send a letter over there to notify them of the condition of affairs.id.the council adjourned.id.the wenatchi representatives returned to their homes.
the agents reconvened the council at the yakama reservation on january,without wenatchi representatives present.id.at.the agents rejected the yakama proposal of per acre and proposed a lump sum of or.id.yakama members protested the fact that the wenatchi were not present.charley skummit said,
i will not sell this piece of land away from the wenatchee indians that owns the land.we all heard what you said when these indians said they would sell you said you would allot them other lands.these wenatchee indians said they wanted land where they lived.it was the land of his fathers and he wanted to stay there we are having another council here and i feel that i have no right to take this land away from the indians because they are the right owners of it.
id.agent erwin promised in reply,just what we said to those wenatchee indians we will carry out.id.
tom simpson,speaking for the yakama,then,all the headmen agree to finishing this matter up we will relinquish all our rights to the wenatshapam fishery for id.at.
the agreement was ultimately signed by members of the yakama nation in person,and seven by proxy.id.at.in relevant part,the agreement provided,
the said indians hereby cede and relinquish to the united states all their right,title,interest,claim,and demand of whatsoever name or nature of,in,and to all their right of fishery,as set forth in article of said treaty aforesaid,and also all their right,title,interest,claim,or demand of,in,and to said land above described,or any corrected description thereof and known as the wenatshapam fishery.
article ii.
in consideration of the foregoing cession and relinquishment the united states hereby agrees to pay or expend through their indian agent,yakima agency,twenty thousand dollars,which said sum is to be deposited in a united states depository for their use and benefit as soon as approved by congress,and subject to their order,the indians reserving the right to dispose of said money as they may decide in general council to be held by them and for that purpose.after the ratification of this agreement by congress and the further consideration that the indians known as the wenatshapam indians,residing on the wenatchee river,state of washington,shall have land allotted to them in severalty in the vicinity of where they now reside,or elsewhere,as they may select,in accordance with article of the general allotment law 
agreement with the yakama nation of indians in washington,act of,ch,stat,hereinafter agreement.
despite the promise in the agreement to provide allotments to the members of the wenatchi still living at the fishery,the government again failed to fulfill its promise,as it never made the allotments available to the wenatchi.oregon ii,at.the wenatchi remained and fished on their aboriginal lands at the wenatshapam fishery until they were moved by the federal government in and to the colville reservation.id.at.chief harmelt never enrolled at the colville reservation,located some miles east of wenatshapam,although he attended several wenatchi enrollment hearings.he continued to reside in the wenatchee valley and advocated for wenatchi rights at wenatshapam by traveling to washington,twice before his death.
the united states initiated the underlying litigation in on behalf of certain indian tribes in oregon and against the state of oregon to define,at least in part,the indians treaty rights to take fish at all usual and accustomed places on the columbia river and its tributaries.oregon i,at citing sohappy smith.
originally,four tribes asserted treaty fishing rights the yakama indian nation,the confederated tribes and bands of the warm springs reservation of oregon,the confederated tribes of the umatilla reservation,and the nez perce tribe of idaho.id.at.in,the district court ruled that the tribes were entitled to treaty rights providing them a fair share of the columbia river salmon.sohappy.at.
in and,the states of washington and idaho intervened.oregon i,at.in,the district of oregon adopted a comprehensive fish management plan.id.
in,the colville sought to intervene on behalf of five constituent tribes that they maintained were parties to the yakama treaty of the wenatchi,the entiat,the chelan,the columbia,and the palus.id.colville has never explained why it waited over twenty years after united states oregon was initiated and why it did not seek to intervene while the district court was considering the comprehensive management plan adopted in.id.after considering voluminous exhibits,stipulations and evidence presented during a court trial,the district court denied colville intervention motion,finding that colville could not assert treaty fishing rights reserved to its constituent tribes.id.at.
in,we affirmed the district court denial of colville motion to intervene and as a result foreclosed the wenatchi from exercising treaty fishing rights at the wenatshapam fishery.see id.at.we reasoned,r ights under a treaty vest with the tribe at the time of the signing of the treaty,id.at citing united states washington.boldt,aff,cir washington i,cert.denied,but indians later asserting treaty rights must establish that their group has preserved its tribal status,oregon i,at citing united states washington,cir washington ii,cert.denied.
we ruled that the constituent the not maintained political cohesion with the tribal entities created by the treaties and receiving fishing rights.oregon i,at.we relied upon the district court factual findings relating to the history of the bands who sought to trace their cultural and political lineage to the tribes that signed the treaty,and we concluded that the tribes,prior to being subsumed in the colville confederacy,were separate bands who disengaged from the yakima nation by refusing to relocate to the reservation established by the treaty.id.at.
we subsequently amended our opinion to note that the f ailure to move onto a reservation is not the determinative factor in deciding whether a group has retained treaty rights.united states oregon,cir.instead,we reasoned,it is only one consideration relevant to an essentially factual,whether a group claiming treaty rights has maintained sufficient political continuity with those who signed the treaty that it may fairly be called the same tribe.id.
throughout this litigation,whether they were permitted or not by the terms of any treaty,descendants of the wenatchi have fished at their aboriginal wenatshapam fishery.in,the yakama nation sought and obtained an injunction preventing these wenatchi from fishing at wenatshapam.the wenatchi opposed the injunction by arguing that they had the right to fish at wenatshapam under the agreement.the district court concluded res judicata prevented the wenatchi from asserting this claim.the wenatchi appealed.
in we reversed,concluding,through unfulfilled promises and procedural rulings,the wenatchi would,under the district court ruling,lose both the land they were guaranteed adjacent to the fishery and their fishing rights.oregon ii,at.we further reasoned,
the agreement was not set forth as an amendment to the treaty.rather,it was an agreement for the sale of the wenatshapam fishery that had been given to the tribes of the yakama nation by the treaty,with specific benefits being reserved for the wenatchi tribe,which had continued to reside and fish there.
id.at.we then held,colville is not precluded by res judicata from asserting the claim of the wenatchi tribe to fishing rights at the wenatshapam fishery based on the agreement.id.at.we remanded for a trial on the merits to determine fishing rights under that agreement.id.
following a bench trial primarily relying on expert testimony and the transcript of the and negotiations,both parties submitted extensive briefing.the united states also filed a brief addressing only one issue the government argued that the agreement did not in any way limit yakama from taking fish at usual and accustomed places under article iii of the treaty.the united states took no position on whether the wenatshapam fishery is a usual and accustomed fishing place of the yakama,or whether the wenatchi obtained fishing rights at wenatshapam under the agreement.the district court found,
the events leading up to the agreement,and the negotiations themselves,demonstrate that yakama tribal members were concerned about protecting the wenatchi right to the fishery.as a result,the agents promised yakama that the government would provide fishing rights and land to the wenatchi in exchange for the sale of the article x reservation.
united states oregon,wl,at.it cited the letter exchange between the secretary of the interior,the commissioner of indian affairs,agent erwin,special agent lane,and the settlers living at wenatshapam,as well as the statements made during the negotiations,as evidencing a conscious effort to protect wenatchi fishing rights at the wenatshapam fishery.id.
the court found the evidence establishes an agreement that the wenatchi were to have the right to fish at the wenatshapam fishery.id.at.it reasoned that the yakama are entitled to usual and accustomed article iii fishing rights at wenatshapam under the treaty,because the tribe only sold its exclusive fishing rights at that location.id.at.finally,the court determined that wenatchi fishing rights at wenatshapam are not superior to those of the yakama,but are instead of the same character.id.at.in effect,the district court ruling formally recognized that the wenatchi have the legal right to fish at their aboriginal home and fishing station.
yakama now argues that the district court erred in finding an implied agreement to provide the wenatchi with fishing rights at wenatshapam.on,the wenatchi argue the district court erred in finding that yakama has fishing rights at wenatshapam,and,in the alternative,erred in failing to find wenatchi fishing rights superior to yakama fishing rights.
we review the district court interpretation of treaties,statutes,and executive orders de novo.united states idaho,cir.findings of historical fact,including the district court findings regarding treaty negotiators intentions,are reviewed for clear error.id.at.we therefore review for clear error all of the district court findings of historical fact,including its findings regarding the treaty negotiators intentions.we then review de novo whether the district court reached the proper conclusion as to the meaning of the agreement given those findings.united states washington,cir.
as a preliminary matter,we consider whether our analysis should be limited to the four corners of the agreement yakama whether we should also consider the document introduced in the senate prior to ratification that contains the transcript of the negotiations and the letters exchanged regarding the agreement.see senate doc.
the agreement contains two articles relevant to our inquiry.as we noted in our opinion,
both provisions appear to be ambiguous in light of the context in which the agreement took place,the statements of the parties concerning the meaning of the terms of the agreement,and the recognition that this was an agreement drafted by the government to reflect the understanding of the indians,who had a lesser familiarity with the legal technicalities involved.
oregon ii,at.
the supreme court has repeatedly instructed us that when interpreting a treaty or agreement between the united states and native americans,it must always be borne in mind,
that the negotiations for the treaty were conducted,on the part of the united states by representatives skilled in diplomacy,understanding the modes and forms of creating the various technical estates known to their law,and assisted by an interpreter employed by themselves that the treaty was drawn up by them and in their own language that the indians,on the other hand were wholly unfamiliar with all the forms of legal expression,and whose only knowledge of the terms in which the treaty was framed was that imparted to them by the interpreter employed by the united states and that the treaty must therefore be construed,not according to the technical meaning of its words to learned lawyers,but in the sense in which they would naturally be understood by the indians.
jones meehan.with regard to treaties negotiated between the united states and the yakama,we have observed,t he inadequacy of the treaties is further exacerbated by the fact that the indians signing the treaties generally did not speak english,and the indian argot into which the treaty provisions were translated was inadequate to convey the meaning of the treaties.oregon i,at citing washington i,at.
the supreme court has often held that treaties with the indians must be interpreted as they would have understood them,and any doubtful expressions in them should be resolved in the indians favor.choctaw nation oklahoma,internal citation omitted.this principle has been applied to treaties,agreements,and executive orders negotiated with native americans.see united states washington,cir noting that the principle that ambiguities in agreements and treaties with native americans are to be resolved from the native standpoint extends to executive orders.
in determining the sense in which treaties would naturally be understood by native americans,the supreme court has looked beyond the written words to the larger context that frames the treaty,including the history of the treaty,the negotiations,and the practical construction adopted by the parties.minnesota mille lacs band of chippewa indians,quoting choctaw nation united states,see also south dakota yankton sioux tribe,considering the manner in which the transaction was negotiated,the negotiations themselves,and the tenor of legislative reports presented to congress internal quotation marks omitted rosebud sioux tribe kneip,considering the face of the act,the surrounding circumstances,and the legislative history internal quotation and citation omitted.
the agreement is silent as to the wenatchi fishing rights.as previously noted,b oth provisions of the agreement appear to be ambiguous.oregon ii,at.given the agreement ambiguity as to the fishing rights of the wenatchi and the supreme court direction to construe native american treaties in the sense in which they would naturally be understood by the native americans,we consider the transcript of the agreement negotiations in order to ascertain how those present at the council understood the agreement.jones,at.
the district court found that the native americans present at the negotiations understood the agreement as providing the wenatchi with fishing rights at wenatshapam.the record supports that finding.
the wenatchi and yakama disagree as to whether the district court determination is a finding of fact reviewed for clear error,or a conclusion of law reviewed de novo.a finding as to what a negotiator understood involves the same kind of factual analysis as a finding of for example the consideration of the events leading up to a negotiation,statements made during a negotiation,and the overall context of the is entitled to deferential clear error review.see idaho,at.we accordingly review for clear error the district court findings as to the understanding of the native americans present at the negotiations 
the transcript of the and negotiations is helpful in discerning the motivations and understandings of those present.it is evident from the transcript that,as the district court found,the yakama were concerned about protecting wenatchi rights over wenatshapam.captain eneas,a yakama,said,
i am not going over to my friends house and throw him off his place and tell him i would get rich and fat off of his place.it is for the government to treat these wenatchee indians right.you talk to these wenatchee indians and ask them what they want for that land,but not the yakimas.
senate doc.at.joe stwire,a yakama,said,there are four men here from wenatchee.whatever the four men from wenatchee decide,the yakimas will decide as soon as we know what they say.id.at.thomas simpson said,it is true you all know that i am not fit to talk about the wenatchee lands.my desire is not to throw the wenatchee out of this land so that i may fill up myself out of it.id.at.
in addition,the transcript reveals a desire on the part of the united states to negotiate not only with the yakama,but with the wenatchi as well.agent erwin specifically addressed chief harmelt and asked,can we arrive at any agreement by which your lands are to be allotted to you and you relinquish your claims in the wenatshapam fishery for ten or fifteen thousand dollars id.at.the agents also expressed to both accordance with their instructions from commissioner the rights of the wenatchi in their land and fishery were to be protected.agent erwin explicitly stated,
there is one thing i want to impress on these indians from the wenatchee,and this is that they are not to be robbed of an acre of land,but on the contrary,the government proposes to give them land where they now are.the selling of this fishery does not interfere with their rights at all.
id.at.agent erwin repeatedly read the letter from commissioner browning and secretary sims providing that the rights of such indians living near wenatshapam in land or fishing privileges should be taken into consideration and protected.id.most importantly,agent erwin promised,you shall have the lawful use of the fisheries in common with the white people.id.at.
finally,the district court correctly observed that after the agents reconvened the negotiations in january without the wenatchi present,the yakama were hesitant to consummate an agreement.charley skummit said,we are having another council here and i feel that i have no right to take this land away from the wenatchi indians because they are the right owners of it.id.at.when the yakama were uncomfortable proceeding without the wenatchi,agent erwin reassured them,stating,just what we said to those wenatchee indians we will carry out.id.only then did the yakama agree to sell their rights in the article x reservation.
in sum,the yakama instructed the agents,it is for the government to treat these wenatchee indians right,id.at,agent erwin promised the wenatchi,you shall have the lawful use of the fisheries in common with the white people,id.at,and the yakama would only agree to the sale after agent erwin reiterated his promises to the wenatchi.based on this record,the district court correctly held that the evidence establishes the native americans present at the negotiations understood the agreement to provide the wenatchi with the right to fish at their aboriginal home and fishing wenatshapam consideration for the yakama sale of the article x reservation.
although the written agreement is ambiguous as to the fishing rights of the wenatchi,agreements with the indians must be interpreted as they would have understood them,and applying that principle,we must interpret the agreement as securing the rights of the wenatchi to fish at wenatshapam choctaw nation,at see also iowa tribe of indians united states.cl,t he evidence taken in connection with the circumstances of the case clearly establishes the existence of an agreement,the terms of which are not expressed in the written contract.
on,the wenatchi do not challenge the district court conclusion that wenatshapam can be considered a usual and accustomed fishing station of the yakama under article iii of the treaty.instead,the wenatchi contend to only fishing rights the yakama possessed at wenatshapam were exclusive fishing rights through article x of the treaty,and that when the yakama signed the agreement ceding all their right of fishery,as set forth in article,they relinquished every fishing right they possessed at wenatshapam.we disagree.
the wenatchi correctly note that yakama derives all of its fishing rights at wenatshapam from article iii of the treaty.contrary to the wenatchi assertions,however,that article reserved to the yakama two distinct fishing rights at wenatshapam.
first,the yakama had the exclusive right of taking fish in all the streams,where running through or bordering reservations.treaty at.this article iii right entitled the yakama to exclusive fishing rights at the reservation established in article second,the yakama had the right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places,in common with citizens of the territory.id.this article iii right entitled the yakama to an share of fish at all usual and accustomed fishing stations.the exclusive article iii fishing right depended on the existence of the article x reservation,whereas the fishing right existed independently of article x and depended on whether or not wenatshapam could be considered a usual and accustomed fishing ground.
evidence in the record indicates that two treaty signatory wenatchi and the fished at wenatshapam both at and before treaty time.it is well established that,
every fishing location where members of a tribe customarily fished from time to time at and before treaty times,however distant from the then usual habitat of the tribe,and whether or not other tribes then also fished in the same waters,is a usual and accustomed ground or
