this is an appeal from an order denying a petition for a writ of mandate.the petition challenged a discharge permit respondent california regional water quality control board,san diego region the regional board,issued to real parties in interest department of the navy et.navy.we affirm.although the regional board could have issued a permit that imposed numeric limits on chemicals in the navy storm water discharges into san diego bay,under provisions of the federal water pollution control act et,commonly known as the clean water act cwa,and applicable regulations,the regional board was authorized to instead require that the navy limit its storm water chemical discharges by employing best management practices bmp.given these circumstances,we reject appellant divers environmental conservation organization divers contention that the permit was defective for its failure to analyze or impose numeric limits on chemicals in the navy storm water discharges.
in november the regional board issued a national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit to the navy governing discharges from the naval base san diego complex the base complex to san diego bay.the permit includes regulations governing storm water discharges from the base complex to the bay.in particular,the permit requires that the navy develop and adopt a storm water pollution prevention plan the prevention plan,which employs bmp designed to reduce or eliminate pollutants received into the bay from industrial activities at the base complex.the permit requires that the prevention plan identify and evaluate sources of pollution that might effect storm water discharges from the base complex and then implement site specific bmp to reduce or prevent pollutants in the base complex storm water discharges.under the permit the navy is required to consider implementing bmp,such as good housekeeping,preventative maintenance,spill response procedures,material handling and storage procedures,employee training programs,recycling procedures,and erosion controls.where bmp are not effective,the permit requires that the navy consider structural bmp,such as structures which cover chemicals and other pollutants,retention ponds,berms and other devices which channel runoff away from pollutant sources and treatment facilities,such as vegetative swales,which reduce pollutants in storm water discharges.
in addition to the prevention plan and based on the regional board study of water quality,the permit contains a numeric limit on the amount of toxicity in the navy total effluent.this limitation requires that test organisms be able to survive in the effluent.the permit also prohibits the discharge of the first quarter inch of runoff from areas.
the regional board study of water quality noted that levels of copper and zinc in storm water runoff were matters of concern.in addition to the bmp and limitation on toxicity in the total effluent discharges,the permit set forth benchmarks for copper and zinc.the permit requires the navy to measure the concentration of copper and zinc in its storm water discharges and if they exceed the benchmark levels,the navy must commence an iterative process of reviewing and upgrading its bmp.
the permit requires that the navy annually review all bmp to determine whether the bmp are properly designed,implemented,and are effective in reducing and preventing pollutants in storm water discharges.in the event the regional board finds the prevention plan does meet the requirements of the permit,the permit requires the plan be revised to implement additional bmp.
before the permit was finally adopted by the regional board,divers challenged it administratively.divers argued that applicable federal regulations required that instead of regulating the navy industrial storm water discharges by way of a bmp based prevention plan,the regional board was required to set numeric water quality based effluent limitations wqbel on the navy storm water discharges and that before setting those numeric wqbel the navy was required to conduct an analysis of particular pollutants for which there was a reasonable potential the storm water discharges would cause or contribute to a violation of any state water quality standard.the regional board rejected divers argument and adopted the permit without numeric wqbel and without performing any analysis of particular pollutants in the navy storm water discharges.divers filed an administrative petition with respondent state water resources control board state board.the administrative petition was dismissed on the grounds it failed to raise substantial issues appropriate for review by the state board.
divers filed a petition for a petition for a writ of administrative mandate code civ,against the state board and the regional board.the trial court dismissed the state board as a defendant.as against the regional board,divers alleged the board abused its discretion in failing to conduct an analysis of the reasonable potential impact of particular storm water pollutants on state water quality standards and in failing to impose numeric wqbel on the navy storm water discharges.the trial court denied divers petition.divers filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
istandard of review 
o ur standard of review must extend appropriate deference to the administrative agencies in this case,and their technical expertise.citations.and while interpretation of a statute or regulation is ultimately a question of law,we must also defer to an administrative agency interpretation of a statute or regulation involving its area of expertise,unless the interpretation flies in the face of the clear language and purpose of the interpreted provision.communities for a better environment state water resources control bd.th,d communities.
the clean water act 
in,congress enacted the federal water pollution control act et,commonly known as the clean water act cwa.citation.the goal of the cwa is to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.a see arkansas oklahoma,d arkansas.generally,the cwa prohibits the discharge of any pollutant except in compliance with one of several statutory exceptions.citation.citation.the most important of those exceptions is pollution discharge under a valid npdes permit,which can be issued either by the environmental protection agency epa,or by an state permit program such as california.citations.npdes permits are valid for five years.citation.communities,supra,th at,d.
initially,the cwa regulated permittees by requiring them to adopt effluent limitations.b a.these are limitations based on the best available or practical technology for the reduction of water pollution.
after july,permittees were required to not only adopt effluent limitations but more stringent water effluent limitations wqbel.in the cwa,congress supplemented the technology based effluent limitations with water limitations so that numerous point sources,despite individual compliance with effluent limitations,may be further regulated to prevent water quality from falling below acceptable levels.citations.communities,supra,th at,d.
in general terms the cwa and governing regulations require that in addition to determining an applicant obligations by focusing on what technology can be used on the applicant discharges,the permitting agency must also focus on the quality of the body of water into which the applicant is discharging pollutants.thus under code of federal regulations section d i,wqbel must be imposed on applicants whenever the permitting agency determines that pollutants are or may be discharged at a level which will cause,or have the reasonable potential to cause,or contribute to an excursion above any state water quality standard communities,supra,th at,d.under code of federal regulations section d ii in making the determination about whether wqbel are required the permitting authority shall use procedures which account for existing controls on point and nonpoint sources of pollution,the variability of the pollutant or pollutant parameter in the effluent,the sensitivity of the species to toxicity testing when evaluating whole effluent toxicity,and where appropriate,the dilution of the effluent in the receiving water.
when,after employing the procedures and analysis required by code of federal regulations section d ii,a permitting agency determines that an applicant discharges has the reasonable potential to cause an excursion above a state water quality standard for an individual pollutant the permit must contain effluent limits for that pollutant.d iii.
as we explain more fully below,this appeal rests in large measure on divers contention that code of federal regulations section d mandated a numeric analysis of individual pollutants in the navy storm water and numeric wqbel for pollutants which would cause the bay to exceed applicable water quality standards.as we explain,we do not adopt this interpretation of the regulations.briefly,as we read the regulations,the analysis which is mandatory in all cases is the more general analysis required by section d ii only if that analysis results in a finding that discharges are likely to exceed state numeric criteria for a particular pollutant are limits for that pollutant required.however,as we believe is the case here,an analysis of storm water discharges may satisfy the requirements of section d ii without any numeric analysis of individual pollutants and hence without giving rise to any obligation to impose specific pollutant limitations under section d iii.
storm water discharges 
before the cwa did not expressly regulate storm water discharges in congress added subdivision p to section of the cwa p,which expressly requires npdes permits for storm water discharges either associated with industrial activity or from municipal storm sewer systems.section p a of the cwa gave the administrator of the epa until to promulgate regulations governing storm water discharges from industrial polluters and large municipalities applicants for storm water permits were given until to make applications and the epa or state was given until to issue or deny the permit.
in regulating storm water permits the epa has repeatedly expressed a preference for doing so by way of bmp,rather than by way of imposing either or water numeric limitations.unlike discharges of process wastewater where numeric effluent limitations are typically used to control the discharge of pollutants from industrial facilities,the primary permit condition used to address discharges of pollutants in a facilities storm water is a pollution prevention plan.the development and implementation of a storm water pollution prevention plan is considered to be the most important requirement of the epa and state issued storm water general permits.storm water pollution prevention plans allow permittees to develop and implement best management practices,whether structural or,that are best suited for controlling storm water discharges from their industrial facility.npdes permit writers manual see also interim permitting strategy approach for water effluent limitations in storm water permits,and questions and answers.in addition to the rationale it has expressed,the epa also adopted code of federal regulations section k so that the regulation reads,in part,as follows e ach npdes permit shall include conditions meeting the following requirements when applicable 
k best management practices bmps to control or abate the discharge of pollutants when 
authorized under section e of the cwa for the control of toxic pollutants and hazardous substances from ancillary industrial activities 
authorized under section p of the cwa for the control of storm water discharges 
numeric effluent limitations are infeasible or 
the practices are reasonably necessary to achieve effluent limitations and standards or to carry out the purposes and intent of the cwa.
as we explain more fully below,essentially code of federal regulations section k allows permitting agencies to treat bmp as the type of wqbel appropriate for control of storm water discharges.
reasonable potential analysis 
in its first argument on appeal divers contends that because the regional board did not identify and analyze the numeric level of particular pollutants in the navy storm water discharges,it did not perform the reasonable potential analysis required by code of federal regulations section d.
contrary to divers argument,code of federal regulations section d does not require that in all cases a permitting authority analyze the particular pollutants in an applicant storm water discharges.as we have seen,the procedures a permitting agency must engage in in performing the required reasonable potential analysis are set forth in code of federal regulations section d ii.by its terms that portion of the regulation does not require any analysis of particular pollutants.rather,it only requires that the permitting authority use procedures that account for existing controls,the variability of the pollutants in effluent,the sensitivity of species to toxicity,and the dilution of effluent in receiving waters.d ii.while,as divers points out,a numeric analysis of particular pollutants would in most instances be the most effective means of meeting the requirements of code of federal regulations section d ii,that is not the only means of meeting the requirements of the regulation.as the trial court noted,the regional board performed a water quality analysis and made extensive findings with respect to the toxicity of copper and zinc in the navy discharge and established benchmarks for concentrations of those chemicals in the navy discharges.the fact the studies the regional board performed did not produce numeric analysis of all the potential pollutants in the navy storm water discharges did not prevent the regional board from nonetheless concluding,on the basis of the studies it did perform,that the storm water discharges had a reasonable potential to cause or contribute to pollution in the bay above state water quality standards.as the regional board points out and the epa has repeatedly noted,storm water consists of a variable stew of pollutants,including toxic pollutants,from a variety of sources which impact a receiving body on a basis which is only as predictable as the weather.given these circumstances the regional board could reasonably conclude that any attempt to provide a numeric analysis of pollutants in storm water discharges was not the most effective means of determining whether wqbel were nonetheless needed for the navy storm water discharges.
inherent in the flexibility we find in code of federal regulations d ii is our conclusion the bmp authorized by code of federal regulations section k are in fact wqbel,which a permitting authority may employ when it has found that storm water discharges may cause a receiving body to exceed state water quality standards.in reaching this conclusion we are persuaded by the reasoning the court adopted in communities,where the opponent of a permit argued that numeric wqbel were required by code of federal regulations section d.case law is limited.a few cases seem to assume that a wqbel is always a number,but the cases do not squarely address and decide the issue.citations.but natural resources defense council,costle costle,suggests that congress did not intend numeric effluent limitations to be the only limitation on pollution discharges under the cwa,but intended a flexible approach including alternative effluent control strategies.citation.
we find instructive a prior decision of the state board,of which we have taken judicial notice in the matter of the petition of citizens for a better environment,save san francisco bay association,and santa clara valley audubon society order no.wq,may,wl.in that order,the state board stated the petitioners contend that the clean water act,and regulations and court decisions interpreting the act,require the inclusion of numeric effluent limitations in npdes permits we have reviewed these authorities,and also opinions we have received from epa,and conclude that numeric effluent limitations are not legally required.further,we have determined that the program of prohibitions,source control measures and best management practices set forth in the permit constitutes efflue
