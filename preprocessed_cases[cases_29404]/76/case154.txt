the alaska eskimo whaling commission aewc,representing certain alaska native villages that engage in subsistence hunting of bowhead whales,petitions for review of the beaufort permit the permit issued by the environmental protection agency under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes provisions of the clean water act.the permit authorizes the discharge by oil and gas exploration facilities of waste streams into marine waters of the beaufort sea in accordance with the effluent limitations,monitoring requirements,and other conditions set forth in the permit.aewc does not seek to have the permit vacated,but asks us to remand it to the epa for further proceedings leading to additional restrictions on discharges.we have jurisdiction to review the epa issuance of the permit pursuant to b f.we deny in great part aewc petition,but we grant on one issue on which the epa has admitted an error in the record we remand to the epa for a determination regarding whether the discharge of cooling water alone or in combination with other authorized discharges into the beaufort sea will cause unreasonable degradation of the marine environment,e,because of the effect of such discharge on bowhead whales,including deflection from their migratory paths.we deny the petition in all other respects.
background 
following the expiration of the arctic npdes general permit for offshore oil and gas exploration,the epa replaced that permit with two separate general permits for exploration discharges one for the beaufort sea and one for the chuckchi sea.only the beaufort permit is the subject of this appeal.the permit allows discharges only in connection with oil exploration actual oil development and offshore production are not within the permit.
in january,the epa issued for public review and comment a draft of the beaufort permit.during the comment period,public meetings were held and testimony was taken in communities,including the nuiqsut community,on the north slope and in anchorage.aewc and several other organizations also submitted to the epa extensive written comments on the draft permit.
in october,the epa issued the permit permit no.pursuant to sections and of the clean water act.the permit authorizes the discharge of waste in accordance with the effluent limitations,monitoring requirements,and other conditions set forth therein,and it is effective from november,through november.the permit includes one limitation and one monitoring requirement relevant to the issues on appeal.first,the permit imposes a seasonal limitation on discharge drilling fluids and drill cuttings,prohibiting all such discharge during fall bowhead whale hunting in the beaufort sea by the nuiqsut and kaktovik communities.second,the permit requires permittees to monitor to the maximum extent possible for possible deflection of marine mammals when discharging discharge and discharge cooling water.the permit provides that it may be modified or revoked if,on the basis of any new data,the director or dec determines that continued discharges may cause unreasonable degradation of the marine environment.
aewc now appeals,arguing that the epa failed to consider adequately the extent to which discharges authorized under the permit will interfere with subsistence uses of the beaufort sea,particularly the subsistence communities fall hunt for bowhead whales.aewc contends that the permitted discharges will divert the whales far from their normal seasonal migratory routes,making the hunting of them less productive and far more dangerous.aewc challenges the epa failure to include in the permit the following two sets of restrictions first,a total prohibition zero discharge restriction on the discharge of six of the thirteen authorized waste streams drilling fluids and cuttings,sanitary and domestic waste,ballast water,bilge water,and certain muds,cuttings,cement at the seafloor and second,a prohibition during the fall bowhead hunting season of the discharge of an additional five waste streams cooling water and,if not brought within the zero discharge restriction,sanitary and domestic waste,bilge water,and certain muds,cuttings,cement at the seafloor.
challenges to epa actions under section b of the clean water act,b,are reviewed under the arbitrary and capricious standard of the administrative procedure act.akiak native cmty.epa,cir.under this deferential standard of review,we will not vacate an agency decision unless it has relied on factors which congress had not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.id.quoting ass of home builders defenders of wildlife,internal quotation marks omitted.
ii.the error in the record 
along with the permit,the epa issued three documents that,taken together,explain the bases for the epa permitting decision its response to comments,which includes the epa responses to all comments it received its ocean discharge criteria evaluation,issued to review the discharges authorized under the permit and evaluate their potential to cause unreasonable degradation of the marine environment,and its environmental justice analysis in support of the permit.in its response to a comment requesting a seasonal restriction on the discharge of cooling water and related chemicals,sanitary and domestic wastes,and bilge water,because these waste streams risk deflecting bowhead whales from their migratory paths,the epa stated that it concluded that cooling water will not result in an unreasonable degradation to the marine environment due to the permit restrictions and monitoring requirements placed on this discharge and because temperature is expected to dissipate and achieve complete mixing within meters of the discharge location.similarly,in the ocean discharge criteria evaluation,the epa stated that it used a model to evaluate the dilution of all the effluents associated with each of the discharges authorized by the beaufort general permit,and that t he predicted dilution for th e scenario was approximately at meters from the discharge point.
on the eve of oral argument,the epa filed with this court a letter in which it candidly acknowledged its discovery of a misstatement in the record and in its brief.in its letter,the epa reported that the modeling it cited in support of its statements that the temperature of cooling water would dissipate and mix within meters of discharge,and that all discharges would dilute to a ratio of within meters of discharge,in fact did not include cooling water in the model.that model was for effluents,not cooling water.epa letter further stated that cooling water was included in other modeling that applied to a wide range of discharges.an attachment to the letter contained a table table that included a list of numbers and figures for the temperature effects at various cooling water discharges.
under the controlling rule for the review of administrative agency actions,a reviewing court,in dealing with a determination or judgment which an administrative agency alone is authorized to make,must judge the propriety of such action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency.if those grounds are inadequate or improper,the court is powerless to affirm the administrative action by substituting what it considers to be a more adequate or proper basis.sec chenery chenery ii.we must remand rather than combing the record for evidence on which the agency may have relied.id.
here,neither the epa letter and its attachment,nor the epa representations at oral argument,explained the import of the agency error.in addition to the table in its attachment,the letter discusses a list of other figures and tables in the further excerpts of record.these figures and tables are no substitute for the agency explanation of what the evidence showed and how that evidence supports its ultimate conclusions.the epa erroneous statement that cooling water would be mixed and diluted to a ratio of suggested that this level of mixing and dilutio
