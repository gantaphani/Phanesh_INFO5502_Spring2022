smith,circuit judge 
in late summer,the bureau of reclamation bor released trinity river water from the lewiston dam,above and beyond the amount designated in the applicable water release schedule a schedule that was devised to benefit only the trinity river basin.that water flowed down the trinity river and into the lower klamath river,where salmon were beginning their migration upriver to their spawning grounds.bor released the water to help prevent a mass of these salmon in the lower klamath,which are threatened when the klamath river runs low.bor asserted that the act of august,act gave it the power to release this extra water.the act authorized and directed the secretary of the united states department of the interior doi to adopt appropriate measures to insure the preservation and propagation of fish and wildlife.we agree with bor.the broad language of this clause gave bor the authority to implement the water release.
in implementing the water release,bor also did not violate the central valley project improvement act or california water law and correspondingly the reclamation act of,which requires agencies to comply with state water law,as alleged by san luis water authority and westlands water district.finally,lack standing to pursue their endangered species act claim.
background 
the trinity river begins in the trinity alps of northern california.the river runs south and then wends its way northwest,picking up tributaries along the way.it eventually flows into the klamath river at the town of weitchpec.the water then flows forty additional miles down the lower klamath before entering the pacific ocean.
the trinity river was once known for its abundant populations of salmon and steelhead.before the construction of dams on the trinity,up to chinook salmon are estimated to have migrated from the pacific ocean to the north fork of the trinity river each year.the yurok and hoopa valley indian tribes living along the klamath and trinity rivers have relied on the fish as their primary dietary staple.in recognition of the tribes rights to harvest these fish,the federal government established reservations for the tribes in the that endure to this day.the trinity river bisects the hoopa valley reservation,and the lower klamath river bisects the yurok reservation.
at the same time,water management has always been a central concern for the state of california.for as long as it has been a state,california has adopted laws to manage its water resources.in the early,california began drafting a comprehensive,statewide water plan.california recognized that,while most of its water resources were located in the northern part of the state,the majority of the demand came from the state southern regions.in addition,the population demand for water did not align with the seasonal rainfalls and snow melt.with its statewide plan,california hoped to control salinity and flooding,while managing the storage and distribution of water.one of the primary goals of the plan was to transfer water from the sacramento river to the san joaquin valley and from the san joaquin river to the southern regions of the central valley,the heart of california farmland.in,the california legislature authorized this statewide plan,known as the central valley project cvp.because the state was unable to fully fund the plan,the united states took over in.construction of what would become the largest federally managed water project began in.see generally san luis water auth.jewell,cir.cent.delta water agency united states,cir.united states state water res.control,cal.rptr,cal.app.eric stene,the central valley project,bureau of reclamation last updated.
california statewide water plan originally included plans to divert water from the trinity river to the central valley.although these initial plans were abandoned before the cvp was authorized,congress began the possibility in the.during this investigation,doi estimated that more than million of water flowed from the upper trinity river basin each year reports suggested that only of water were needed to maintain the fishery resources of the trinity and lewiston rivers.these reports also suggested that the construction of dams on the trinity would actually help the fishery resources.congress ultimately concluded that of the trinity annual flow was being lost to the pacific ocean and could be diverted to the central valley without harming the trinity or lower klamath rivers.accordingly,in,congress authorized the construction of the trinity river division trd,an addition to the cvp in northern california.act of,pub,stat.the purpose of the trd was to divert water from the trinity river to the sacramento river for irrigation and other beneficial uses in the central valley.id.nevertheless,congress designed the trd with a view to maintaining and improving fishery conditions,which were an important asset to the whole north coastal area,at.accordingly,in the act,congress specifically directed the secretary of doi to preserve and propagate fish and wildlife,stat.at.
under the authority granted by the act,bor constructed two dams along the trinity river the trinity and the lewiston.the trinity dam blocks water flowing from the upper trinity river,and several other tributaries,and forms trinity reservoir after passing through trinity dam,water flows approximately eight miles downstream before reaching lewiston dam,which forms lewiston reservoir.at lewiston dam,the water either continues flowing down the trinity river,or bor diverts it toward the sacramento river via the clear creek tunnel for use in the cvp.if diverted,the water passes through several additional dams before reaching the sacramento river.water that is not diverted at the lewiston dam continues to flow down the trinity river.as it did before the dams were constructed,the water eventually passes through the hoopa valley indian reservation and into the klamath river at the town of weitchpec.the water then flows forty miles down the lower klamath and through the yurok indian reservation until it reaches the pacific ocean.
the trd became fully operational in.for the next ten years,bor diverted an average of percent of trinity river annual inflow to the sacramento river basin.
the construction and operation of the trd had devastating effects on the trinity river environment and fish populations.westlands water dist.dep t of interior,cir.the dams blocked significant upstream fish habitat.id.the low flows caused the trinity river to narrow and the banks to steepen,resulting in increasingly fast and uniform water velocities.id.these effects destroyed resting pools and vital spawning grounds.id.within a decade,the trd had significantly diminished the salmon and steelhead populations in the trinity river.id.at.
trinity river basin fish and wildlife task force 
in response to the effects of the trd,the trinity river basin fish and wildlife task force trbfw task force or task force formed in the early.the task force was comprised of federal,state,and local agencies.it studied the impact of the trd and it worked to develop a plan for the management of the fish population and habitat in the trinity river basin.
secretarial decision of 
in the late and early,in recognition and support of the task force,the fish and wildlife service fws,the bureau of indian affairs,and the water and power resources service studied the effects of increased water releases from the lewiston dam into the trinity river.the agencies drafted an environmental impact statement eis that considered eight alternative water release schedules.the agencies agreed that the best alternative was to begin water releases from the lewiston dam at annually,and incrementally increase this flow to annually in normal years.bor would release less water in dry years.the agencies also agreed to study and draft a report on the effect of restoration flows during the first twelve years of the revised flow releases trinity river flow evaluation study.in,of the interior,cecil andrus,gave legal effect to this agreement in a secretarial decision.

f.the record of decision 
as directed by the secretarial decision and cvpia section b a,fws biologists conducted flow evaluation studies annually from to.in june of,fws and the hoopa valley tribe released the final report for the trinity river flow evaluation study a few months later,bor,the hoopa valley tribe,fws,and trinity county issued a draft trinity river mainstem fishery restoration environmental impact.the eis addresse d the environmental issues,alternatives,and impacts associated with restoration of the natural production of anadromous fish on the trinity river mainstem downstream of lewiston dam.the eis identified and analyzed four alternative actions and identified a preferred alternative.in a record of decision rod,doi adopted the preferred alternative,finding it to be the action which best meets the statutory and trust obligations to the hoopa valley and yurok tribes of the department to restore and maintain the trinity river anadromous fishery resources.
under the preferred alternative,bor would,among other things,release a designated amount of water from the lewiston dam into the trinity river each year,based on that year hydrology.this amount would range from in critically dry years to in extremely wet years.
in september,two fish pathogens,ich and columnaris,caused approximately fish to die in the klamath river.these pathogens are normally present in the river,but a combination of factors caused the pathogens to proliferate and become lethal.the low river flow that year was not attractive to migrating adult salmon,so the salmon congregated in the warm waters of the lower klamath river.the low flows,warm water temperatures,and high density of fish triggered an epizootic of ich and columnaris that spread throughout the fish population.
in april,judge oliver wanger of the eastern district of california issued an order permitting bor to release additional of water from the lewiston dam above the annual instream flow release set by the rod to reduce the likelihood of a recurrence of the fish.to ensure that this flow augmentation release would have no impact on the cvp water users,bor entered into an agreement with the metropolitan water district of los angeles to exchange water from the trinity reservoir for deliveries.in august,bor notified the eastern district of california of its plan to release of water from the lewiston dam as a preventative measure,while holding the additional of water in case an emergency release was needed.
in,bor notified the eastern district of california of its plan to release an additional of water in late summer,again to prevent another fish.bor had of water left over from its exchange with the metropolitan water district of los angeles.bor also purchased of water from willing sellers in the sacramento river water contractors association to cover the remaining water needed for the flow augmentation release.
over the next eight years,conditions improved such that bor did not find it necessary to augment the river flow.then,in,bor predicted that the of adult salmon in the klamath basin would be incredibly large the largest since it began keeping records in,while the flows in the klamath river would be relatively low.accordingly,in order to prevent another potential fish,bor studied and proposed a flow augmentation release of an additional from the lewiston dam.bor drafted an environmental assessment ea and a finding of no significant impact fonsi,concluding that an eis was not required because the flow augmentation release would not significantly impact the quality of the human environment.in the final ea for the flow augmentation release,bor stated that the act provide d the principle authorization for implementing the release.bor ultimately released an additional of water in.
in,bor proposed releasing an additional of water from the lewiston dam in the late summer to reduce the likelihood of a mass fish in the lower klamath river.the agency drafted an ea and a fonsi for the proposed release,again concluding that an eis was not required.on august,bor issued the final ea and fonsi for the flow augmentation release.bor also concluded again in its final ea for the flow augmentation release that the act provide d the principal authorization for the release.due in part to the current legal action,bor ultimately released only during the flow augmentation release.
san luis water authority is an agency comprised of local water districts in central california that hold contracts for cvp water.westlands water district is a member of this joint agency collectively the water contractors.on august,the day following bor issuance of the final ea and fonsi for the flow augmentation release,the water contractors filed suit against bor,doi,and several individuals working within these agencies federal defendants.two days later,the water contractors filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to halt the flow augmentation release,which was scheduled to take place between august and september.the hoopa valley tribe,the yurok tribe,the pacific coast federation of fishermen association,and the institute for fisheries resources promptly moved to intervene,and the district court permitted them to intervene as defendants.on august,the district court temporarily enjoin ed the federal defendants from making releases from lewiston dam to the trinity river in excess of cubic feet per second for fishery purposes through and including august.however,after holding a hearing on the matter,the district court lifted this temporary restraining order and denied the motion for preliminary injunction.
the water contractors filed an amended complaint on october,alleging that federal defendants violated the following four statutes in implementing the and flow augmentation releases the endangered species act esa the national environmental protection act nepa cvpia a and and cvpia b.several months later,the parties filed for summary judgment.
on october,the district court issued a memorandum decision resolving these motions as follows the water contractors lacked standing to bring their esa claim the nepa claim was moot the flow augmentation release did not violate cvpia a or and the flow augmentation release did not violate cvpia b or the rod.san luis water auth.jewell,supp.cal.accordingly,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of federal defendants on all four claims in the first amended complaint.id.however,the district court also concluded that the act did not provide authorization for federal defendants to implement the flow augmentation release to benefit fish in the lower klamath.id.at.
federal defendants and the hoopa valley and yurok tribes filed timely notices of appeal of the district court ruling regarding the act.shortly thereafter,the water contractors filed a timely notice of of all claims except the nepa claim.

section of the act states,in full 
subject to the provisions of this act,the operation of the trinity river division shall be integrated and coordinated,from both a financial and an operational standpoint,with the operation of other features of the central valley project,as presently authorized and as may in the future be authorized by act of congress,in such manner as will effectuate the fullest,most beneficial,and most economic utilization of the water resources hereby made available provided,that the secretary is authorized and directed to adopt appropriate measures to insure the preservation and propagation of fish and wildlife,including,but not limited to,the maintenance of the flow of the trinity river below the diversion point at not less than one hundred and fifty cubic feet per second for the months july through november and the flow of clear creek below the diversion point at not less than fifteen cubic feet per second unless the secretary and the california fish and game commission determine and agree that lesser flows would be adequate for maintenance of fish life and propagation thereof the secretary shall also allocate to the preservation and propagation of fish and wildlife,as provided in the act of august,stat,an appropriate share of the costs of constructing the trinity river development and of operating and maintaining the same,such costs to be provided further,that not less than shall be released annually from the trinity reservoir and made available to humboldt county and downstream water users.
stat.at bold emphasis added.we perceive no ambiguity in the language regarding the preservation and propagation mandate contained in section.this expansive clause,directing the secretary to adopt any appropriate measures,contains no limiting language,geographic or otherwise.the absence of limiting language indicates congress intended to delegate broad authority to the secretary,allowing the secretary substantial discretion to determine what constitutes appropriate measures in the face of unforeseen or changing circumstances.see nw.bell,congress decision not explicitly to limit rico broad terms strongly implies that congress had in mind no such narrow and fixed idea of what constitutes a rico pattern as that suggested by amici here.john united states,cir.en banc tallman,concurring in judgment per curiam diamond chakrabarty,congress employed broad general language in drafting precisely because such inventions are often unforeseeable.
congress wanted to,and thought it could,maintain the rivers and their fish populations below the trd while diverting substantial inflow to the sacramento river,at t here is available for importation from the trinity river water that is surplus to the present and future water requirements of the trinity and klamath river basins,at.congress knew the trinity river was the largest tributary of the klamath and was aware that any effect on the trinity,including water flows and water temperature,could ripple down to the klamath however,congress was not sure what these effects would be.so,to account for unintended consequences,congress used general language,with no geographic limitation,to empower the secretary to take any measures it found necessary to preserve all fish and wildlife at any point downstream of the trinity and lewiston dams,at.t he trd has been planned with a view to maintaining and improving fishery conditions.in fact,the house and senate endorsed the act before final studies to determine the future water requirements in the klamath river basin were completed,because it believed the relatively small diversion would not harm the fishery resources,and the secretary retained the power to take measures to preserve and propagate fish and wildlife if need be.id.at,at.
further,to avoid the ambiguities of establishing causation,congress omitted any requirement that the threat to fish or wildlife be caused directly by the trd.thus,the general language of the preservation and propagation mandate gives the secretary wide discretion in defining appropriate measures and expands the statute beyond the principal evil congress was concerned with when it passed the act.oncale sundowner offshore,holding that title vii,which prohibits discrimination because of sex,covers harassment,even though that was not the principal evil congress was concerned with when it enacted title vii.thus,even if congress,when it enacted the act,did not contemplate a mass fish in the lower klamath or the flow augmentation release bor implemented to prevent it,we still must interpret the general language of the preservation and propagation mandate as authorizing the release.bor unquestionably implemented the flow augmentation release to protect the fish population downstream of the lewiston dam.this measure,and the evil it sought to prevent,fall well within the statute mandate.see id.i t is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.
the including,but not limited to,language also indicates congress intent to provide a broad not ambiguous directive.courts have long recognized that the term including is not one of definition,but connotes simply an illustrative application of the general principle.fed.land bank of paul bismarck lumber,citations omitted.congress identified the maintenance of a minimum flow from the lewiston dam as one exemplary appropriate measure to preserve fish and wildlife downstream from the dam.congress expected the secretary to adopt other measures,including water releases above the minimum flow rate,to preserve fish and wildlife when necessary,using the minimum flow rate as a guiding directive.
our interpretation is further buttressed by the fact that the broad preservation and propagation clause is juxtaposed with other,very precise directives.for example,section specifically states,t hat not less than shall be released annually from the trinity reservoir and made available to humboldt county and downstream water users.act of,stat.at.congress had the ability to clearly define what does and does not constitute appropriate measures,but it did not.for over six decades thereafter,congress has also declined to cabin or clarify this term.we presume that congress decision to paint with a broader brush in the preservation and propagation mandate was deliberate.united states alexander,cir.comparing statutes in which congress has broadly and specifically defined terms.
the water contractors argue that flow augmentation releases are not an appropriate measure,because they did not serve the principal purpose of the act that is,to provide water for the central valley.this position ignores the emphasized provided,with which the preservation and propagation mandate begins.such a proviso is intended to except something from the enacting clause,or to qualify and restrain its generality and prevent misinterpretation.united states morrow,see also pennington united states.cl.cl.explaining that provisos tak e special cases out of the general enactments and provid e specially for them.although section generally requires that the trd be operated such that the water is put to the fullest,most beneficial,and most economic use,the proviso specifically excepts measures to ensure the preservation and propagation of fish and wildlife.thus,the measures to protect and preserve wildlife need not harmonize with the act principal purpose.
the water contractors next argue that cvpia section b,and the rod implementing its directives,finally and permanently resolved how much water should be released from the lewiston dam down the trinity,the water contractors argue that the cvpia repealed or amended the act such that appropriate measures to protect fish and wildlife can no longer include additional releases of water from the lewiston dam.
it is true that,in interpreting the act,we must consider the related legislation that congress subsequently enacted.see fda brown williamson tobacco.but,we conclude that the later legislation and administrative actions identified by the water contractors did not limit or repeal the act.first,we do not hold that a statute has been repealed by a subsequent act unless congress intention is clear and manifest.moyle,office of workers comp.programs,cir.emphasis omitted quoting kee leasing mcgahan in re the glacier bay,cir.there is no indication in the act or cvpia section b of a clear and manifest intention to repeal or amend the act.
second,the general authority granted by the act was not repealed or replaced by the act or cvpia section b,because these later legislative acts implemented specific programs to address particular problems that had been brought to congress attention.the implementation of a specific program does not nullify an agency discretionary authority.thus,the implementation of a fish management or restoration program did not abrogate the need to continually protect fish and wildlife in the face of unforeseen harm.
finally,the water contractors argue that the flow augmentation release would have been permissible if bor had purchased additional water to protect central valley uses,as bor did in and.but this argument is at direct odds with the water contractors position that the rod placed an absolute cap on the water that bor can release down the trinity river from the lewiston dam.in addition,bor need not protect the economic interests of central valley water contractors when it implements measures to preserve the fish and wildlife downstream of the lewiston dam.
the broad language of the act authorized bor to implement the flow augmentation release an appropriate measure to protect fish downstream from the lewiston dam,which includes the lower klamath river.further,subsequent legislation did not clearly alter or limit the expansive scope of the authority granted by the act.thus,bor acted within its statutory authority,c,and we must reverse the district court on this issue.
ii.cvpia b 
we next consider whether the flow augmentation release violated cvpia section b.
section b directed doi to propose and adopt a permanent water release schedule for the lewiston dam.doi went through the necessary procedural steps section b called for and,in the rod,doi established a permanent water release schedule that accounted for changes in the area annual hydrology.the parties agree this schedule sets both a minimum and a maximum amount of water that bor may release under the authority granted by section b and the rod.the water contractors argue that this schedule sets an absolute maximum and that the and flow augmentation release impermissibly exceeded this cap.
again,we start our analysis with the text of the cvpia.gwaltney of smithfield,chesapeake bay.the plain language of the statute indicates that congress intended the permanent water release schedule to serve only the trinity river.section b makes multiple references to the trinity river and does not contain any reference to the klamath river.for example,section b established an interim release of water to the trinity river of not less than three hundred and forty thousand per year,and called for a permanent schedule of trinity river instream fishery releases.id.
in addition,the statute provides that the directives of section b were meant to meet federal trust responsibilities to protect the fishery resources of the hoopa valley tribe,and to meet the fishery restoration goals of the act of october.congress citation to the act is significant.the act,as originally adopted,called for rehabilitation of fish habitat in the trinity river between lewiston dam and weitchpec and in tributaries of such river below lewiston dam and in the south fork of such river.a a b,stat.at.congress amended the act in the reauthorization act,stat,which altered the scope of the act rehabilitation mandate to include the klamath river downstream of the confluence with the trinity river,b,stat.at.thus,the act originally did not intend to cover the klamath river downstream of the confluence with the trinity river.as the district court found,we conclude the reference to the specific goal of the act was a reference to a limited and particular provision of another statute,which does not incorporate subsequent amendments to that statute.pearce,office of workers comp.programs,dep t of labor,cir.quoting,office of workers comp.programs,dep t of labor peabody coal,cir.explaining the difference between a specific reference and a general reference.accordingly,the reference to the act in the cvpia which was enacted in does not include the amendment.section b of the cvpia is thus limited to the trinity river basin and does not cover the lower klamath.
we also find significant section b reference to the hoopa valley tribe and its exclusion of all other tribes.the hoopa valley reservation is within the trinity river basin.the yurok tribe reservation lies outside of the trinity river basin,along the lower klamath.if congress intended the directives contained in section b to also serve the lower klamath,it would have also listed the federal trust responsibilities it owes the yurok tribe.see botosan paul mcnally realty,cir.t
