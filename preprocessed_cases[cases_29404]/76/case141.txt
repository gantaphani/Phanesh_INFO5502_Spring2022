bybee,circuit judge 
the southern california alliance of publicly owned treatment works scap petitions for review of an objection letter sent by the united states environmental protection agency epa regarding draft permits for water reclamation plants in el monte and pomona,california.scap argues that we have original jurisdiction to review the objection letter under b e,which applies to epa action approving or promulgating any effluent limitation,and b f,which applies to epa action issuing or denying any permit.we agree with epa that we lack subject matter jurisdiction to hear scap claims,and we dismiss the petition.
background 
a.the clean water act 
in,congress enacted sweeping amendments to the federal water pollution control act fwpca of to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.a.after another round of substantial amendments in,the statute became known as the clean water act cwa or the act.the cwa prohibits the discharge of any pollutant into navigable waters from any point source without a permit.id.a.permits are issued in accordance with the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes.id.a.these permits authorize certain point source discharges and are typically conditioned on compliance with water quality standards and effluent limitations issued under the act.id.a.
the cwa establishes two pathways for the issuance of npdes permits.first,epa may issue the permits under a.second,the states,with epa approval,may assume responsibility for issuing permits.id.b.the state program must meet specific requirements,including incorporating certain provisions of the npdes regulations,and be approved by epa.a.if npdes permitting authority is transferred,then state officials not the federal epa have the primary responsibility for reviewing and approving npdes discharge permits,albeit with continuing epa oversight.ass of home builders defs.of wildlife.states,including california,currently have authority to issue their own npdes permits.epa,npdes state program information,follow authority hyperlink.
even when a state assumes primary responsibility for issuing npdes permits,epa retains supervisory authority over state permitting programs under d.the state must transmit to epa a copy of each permit application received,as well as proposed permits,and epa has ninety days to notify the state of any objections it has to the draft permit.id.d.the objection must be in writing and state the reasons for such objection and the effluent limitations and conditions which such permit would include if it were issued by epa.id.d.if the disagreement proves intractable,the state or any interested person can request that epa hold a public hearing on the objection.id.d e.following a public hearing,epa may reaffirm,withdraw,or modify the original objection.g.if the state does not request a hearing or epa maintains its objection,the state then has a choice it can either revise the permit to address epa objection or allow permitting authority to pass back to epa.d see also h.
the state decision either to make the changes and retain jurisdiction over the permit or to relinquish permitting authority to epa has practical consequences for further review.if the state chooses to revise and issue a permit,an aggrieved party can seek further administrative review and then judicial review in accordance with state law.see am.paper,epa,cir.by contrast,if jurisdiction returns to epa and epa issues a federal npdes permit,epa decision may be appealed within epa to the environmental appeals board eab.a.a final epa permit approved by the eab is subject to review in an appropriate circuit court of appeals.b f.
california npdes permitting program 
in,epa granted california authority to administer the npdes permits program.approval of california revisions to the state national pollution discharge elimination system program,fed.reg,discharges of pollutants to navigable waters approval of state programs,fed.reg.july.regional boards make the initial permitting decisions.the california state water resources control board state board,the final npdes permitting authority in california,reviews the permits issued by regional boards.a ny aggrieved party may then file a petition for review in california superior court.cal.water code a.
additionally,california and epa have entered into a memorandum of agreement that explains in greater detail the rights the state has under the act and the regulations.under that agreement,for example,if the state disagrees with epa objection,it has the option to pursue informal means of resolving the dispute.see,npdes memorandum of agreement between environmental protection agency and california state water resources control board moa if epa and a regional board are unable to resolve a disagreement over provisions of a prenotice draft permit to which epa has filed a formal objection,the state board may mediate the disagreement to a resolution that is satisfactory to epa and to the regional board.once epa has filed an objection letter,the state may request that epa conduct a public hearing pursuant to or opt to conduct its own public hearing.id.at.the moa,like the regulations,contemplates that,following this process,epa may modify or even withdraw its objections.id.at.
c.the permits at issue 
the whittier narrows water reclamation plant,located in el monte,california,and the pomona water reclamation plant,located in pomona,california collectively,the plants,are treatment water reclamation facilities that receive industrial,commercial,and residential wastewater from the surrounding cities they each produce approximately of recycled water per year,which is used for groundwater recharge and landscape irrigation in southern california.
the los angeles regional office board of the state board prepared the draft npdes permits draft permits for the plants at issue.the board also prepared a fact sheet,which included its determination that effluent limitations were required for whole effluent toxicity because the discharge potentially could cause or contribute to chronic toxicity.the draft permits addressed chronic toxicity by setting chronic toxicity trigger and requirements toxicity triggers.
the board submitted the draft permits to epa for review consistent with d.jane diamond,the region director of epa water division,issued a letter with epa formal objections to the draft permits on september,objection letter.epa principal concern relate d to numeric effluent limitations for whole effluent toxicity.epa criticized the permits because they express a chronic toxicity requirement as a series of steps which include a narrative trigger for further investigation of effluent toxicity,not as an effluent limitation for wet taken together,these toxicity triggers simply require further investigation,and thus do not met meet the definition of effluent limitation under the cwa epa offered other criticism as well and attached to its letter what it characterized as required changes and recommended changes in the permits.epa stated that if the board did not submit revised permits addressing epa concerns,epa would acquire exclusive npdes authority over the discharges pursuant to h.
the board revised the draft permits to meet the terms of epa objection letter.after reviewing the revised permits,epa notified the board,the state board,and the permit applicants that epa objections had been satisfied and that the npdes permits for the plants remained within the board jurisdiction.after complying with procedures required by state law,the board issued the permits for both plants in november.
state administrative proceedings 
on december,scap,along with the permittees and other parties,filed an administrative appeal of the board action with the state board.the petition requested a hearing and a stay of the npdes permits.three weeks later,on december,scap also filed a petition for review before us.
the state board did not immediately act on scap administrative petition.on july,the board amended the npdes permits for the plants.scap amended its administrative petition in light of the amended permits.scap then requested that the state board hold the state administrative appeals in abeyance until.scap stated that its request would allow the opportunity for resolution of these matters and for further discussion and exchanges between the petitioners and the board.the state board granted scap request and placed the matter in abeyance until august.
ii.discussion 
scap seeks review of epa september,objection letter.scap argues the original permits proposed by the board were consistent with the cwa and that epa exceeded its authority in requiring water effluent limitations for whole effluent toxicity,numeric effluent limitations,and daily maximum effluent limitations.in response,epa contends that we lack jurisdiction to review its objection letter and that,so long as permitting authority rests with california state agencies,scap judicial remedy lies in california courts under california administrative procedures.we review challenges to our jurisdiction de novo.bidart cal.apple comm n,cir.
the cwa vests the federal courts of appeals with original jurisdiction over seven categories of epa action.b.
we do not lightly hold that we have jurisdiction under b.we have counseled against its expansive application.the specificity and precision of section,and the sense of it,persuade us that it is designed to exclude epa actions that congress did not specify.indeed,n o sensible person would speak with such detail otherwise.
nw.envtl.advocates epa,cir.second and fourth alterations in original citations omitted internal quotation marks omitted.scap asserts two bases for our jurisdiction.first,it claims that epa promulgated new daily and numeric effluent limitations for chronic toxicity through the objection letter,giving our court jurisdiction under b e.second,scap claims that we have jurisdiction under b f because the objection letter was the functional equivalent of epa denial of the draft permits.
neither provision gives us jurisdiction to review the objection letter.when a state assumes responsibility for administering the npdes program,the state becomes the agency.b.an objection by epa to a draft state permit is merely an interim step in the state permitting process.id.epa may decide to withdraw the objection after discussions with the state and regional board or after holding a public hearing,or the state may revise a draft permit to remedy epa objection and issue the permit.id.in either case,the permitting decision remains the state.the permits issued by the state are subject to administrative and judicial review in accordance with state law.see,cal.water code providing for review in california superior court of state board decisions.alternatively,the state can choose not to remedy the objection and let permitting authority pass back to epa.d.in that case,the state has relinquished jurisdiction over the permitting process,and epa assumes full responsibility for the permit.if epa issues the permit,the permit is subject to review by the eab first and then the appropriate federal court of appeals.city of san diego whitman,cir.here,the board chose to revise the draft permits and retain control of the npdes permitting process for the plants,and the permits were issued through the state of california,not epa.the appropriate avenue for scap to seek redress is through the state review process.we explain our reasons in greater detail below.
jurisdiction under b e 
section b e provides for federal appellate review of epa action in approving or promulgating any effluent limitation or other limitation under section,or of this title.relying on a decision of the eighth circuit,scap contends that epa objection effectively promulgated new effluent limitations and is reviewable under b e.see iowa league of cities epa,cir.epa counters that we have already considered and rejected scap argument.see crown simpson pulp costle,cir.crown simpson i,rev in part,per curiam crown simpson ii.epa is correct.following our circuit decision in crown simpson i,we hold that we lack jurisdiction to review the objection letter under b e 
in crown simpson i,we held that b e does not provide jurisdiction over a claim like scap.similar to this case,crown simpson i involved a challenge to epa veto of npdes permits that the california state board proposed to issue to bleached kraft pulp mills pursuant to b.crown simpson argued that epa veto was the functional equivalent of a newly promulgated,generalized regulation and that if the administrator had formally promulgated such a generalized variance regulation,it would have been directly reviewable by the court of appeals as an effluent or other limitation under subsection e.id.at.we simply rejected the premise that the administrator vetoing of the two permits was tantamount to the promulgation of a new variance regulation.id.at.we characterized epa actions as not the establishment of new regulations through an irregular procedure,but simply two individualized adjudications to determine the proper application of already promulgated effluent limitation regulations covering the entire industry.id.we concluded that s ubsection e provides for direct review of the promulgation of effluent limitations,not for direct review of all of the administrator actions that may in any way be dependent upon the administrator power to promulgate such limitations.id.at.
crown simpson i is controlling in this case.the statutory regime differentiates between the promulgation of effluent limitation regulations,which are standards restricting the quantities of pollutants that enterprises in a given industry may discharge,and individualized adjudications to determine the proper application of already promulgated regulations covering the entire industry.id.at.here,as in crown simpson i,epa did not approve or promulgate anything in objecting to the draft permits.id.at,internal quotation marks omitted.instead,it applied preexisting regulations on an individualized basis to determine that the draft permits were inadequate.see id.at.the two permits and variances at issue here have no far reaching implications beyond their effect on the pla
