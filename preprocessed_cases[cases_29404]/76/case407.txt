appellants save our carmel river,patricia bernardi and the open monterey project appeal from the denial of their petition for a writ of mandate to overturn decisions by the city of monterey city and the monterey peninsula water management district water district to approve a water credit transfer.the city had found the water credit transfer was exempt from the california environmental quality act ceqa under the categorical exemption for replacement or reconstruction of existing facilities contained in section of the ceqa guidelines the water district had also approved the transfer,based in part on the city exemption determination,and further found that the water credit transfer complied with the water district rules and regulations governing such transfers.
appellants contend that the water credit transfer does not fall within the categorical exemption for replacement or reconstruction of existing structures or facilities.guidelines.they further contend that even if the categorical exemption were applicable,there was evidence that two of the exceptions contained in the guidelines applied here to remove the project from exempt status.guidelines,subd.b,subd.c.finally,they contend that the water district violated its own rules in approving the transfer.
we find that section of the guidelines,which provides that the replacement of an existing structure or facility is exempt from ceqa review,does not apply to the water credit transfer here.we further find that the water district approval of the transfer was not supported by substantial evidence in the record,in part because it was based on the city exemption determination as lead agency,but also because the record reflected that the water district did not consider the possible cumulative impacts of the water credit transfer,as expressly required by its rules.we will therefore reverse the trial court denial of the writ of mandate and direct that the court enter an order granting the writ of mandate.
background 
water issues on the monterey historical perspective 
the monterey peninsula water management district was created by the state legislature in,based on findings that integrated water management was necessary because of severe water shortages in the area.the mandate of the water district is to conserve and augment existing water supplies and to prevent waste and unreasonable use of those supplies.west code appendix ed.nearly years later,this court wrote that i t is well documented that water availability is a critical problem throughout monterey county save our peninsula committee monterey county bd.of supervisors th,d.we noted that a monterey county ordinance passed in found that the potential exists that monterey county allocation of water will be exhausted so as to pose an immediate threat to the public health,safety,or welfare.ibid.
the water company is the main water supplier on the monterey peninsula,serving approximately percent of the water users throughout the monterey peninsula water district.draws on two principal sources of water for its customers the carmel river basin and aquifers in the seaside basin.the primary source of water supply is the carmel river,either via surface diversion or from a number of wells situated along the lower carmel river.in,in response to complaints that was illegally taking water from the carmel river,the state water resources control board state water board issued order.order is generally considered to be the controlling factor in water allocation and water resource management on the monterey peninsula.
in order order,the state water board found that was diverting excess water from the carmel river basin without a valid basis of right,causing environmental harm in a related decision,the state water board found that e xisting diversions from the carmel river have adversely affected the public trust resources in the river.was ordered by the state agency to significantly reduce its pumping from the carmel river,to mitigate the adverse environmental effects of its excess usage,and to develop a new plan for obtaining water legally.save our peninsula committee monterey county bd.of supervisors,supra,th at,d.
in addition to the carmel river basin,also extracts water from pumping in the seaside groundwater basin.because state water board order required to limit its diversions from the carmel river basin,this necessitated that it maximize its production from the seaside basin.as a result of the increased reliance on production from these wells,the aquifers in the seaside basin have not been able to fully recharge in recent years and are being depleted.
under the water district water allocation program,the water district allocates shares of total annual water supply among its eight member jurisdictions,including the city of monterey.each jurisdiction manages its water allocation.permits for new or intensified use of water require water district approval.when a jurisdiction assigns all of its allocated water for new projects within the jurisdiction,it is out of water and can not issue any further permits that require new water use.the water district rules provide that each new or expanded water use shall be strictly accounted for.district rule.an environmental impact report eir prepared for the district allocation program mandated that the district institute a percent water conservation program.
a.the water use credit rule 
as part of its oversight of water allocation and distribution,the water district established a program whereby a water customer may obtain and reuse water credits when water use on a particular property is reduced or discontinued.this program is described in water district rule.a reduction of water use,whether by changing to a less intensive use,by retrofitting equipment with water conserving devices,or by abandoning or demolishing a building,results in a water credit that may be used later on the same site.
the property owner applies to the water district for the water credit and the district calculates the amount of the credit based upon the number and types of fixtures that will be discontinued.a percent reduction is figured into the credit,to be reserved by the district pursuant to its mandated conservation program.see district rule.thus the credit received by the water customer is only percent of the reduction in capacity.
under rule,a documented water credit obtained from the district may be applied to,and shall allow future water use on that site at any time within a period of months.the owner may apply for one extension of the period.however,after this time,any remaining unused water use credit shall expire.there are no provisions for further extensions.
b.the water credit transfer rule 
in,the water district began the water credit transfer program as a means to facilitate commercial expansion in the community while also supporting the district conservation goals.under the water credit transfer program,transfers of documented water credits for commercial and industrial property only are allowed from an existing commercial use to an expanding commercial use in the same jurisdiction.in,a provision was added to the rule authorizing a transfer from a commercial use to a jurisdiction water allocation.water credit transfers must be approved by the water district board of directors board,with prior approval of the jurisdiction in which the property is located.
in a water credit transfer,the credit may only be used for water use intensification purposes,as proposed by a current application for a water permit.rule.transferred credits shall not be banked for future use at any new or different site.rule.in a water credit transfer,the future use of the credits shall be at the discretion of the jurisdiction.rule.the effect of any water credit transfer is the irrevocable extinction of any right or entitlement to the actual water use,water use capacity,or water credit which has been transferred from the originating transferring site.rule.
because any water credit is subject to a percent reduction and reservation by the district pursuant to rule,only percent of the water use capacity is actually transferred in a water credit transfer.thus a key assumption of the water credit transfer program is that transfers will result in net reduced water use.
in,in order to test this assumption,the water district ordered a report to determine whether or not water demand had actually been reduced as a result of the water credit programs.the preliminary report indicated that the anticipated water savings from the water credit transfer program were not occurring.there were concerns that commercial water use factors did not accurately reflect actual historic water use at the transferring site.a final study completed in was inconclusive due to the lack of sufficient verifiable data.the data that was collected showed an increase in of water actually used as a result of the water credit transfer program,rather than a decrease.
in,the water district determined that the water transfer program had not resulted in the anticipated savings that had originally motivated the program and,in some cases,may have resulted in an increase in water usage.the water credit transfer program was discontinued,but was then reinstated the following year,in,in response to a lawsuit by some of the district jurisdictions.in reinstating the program,the district clarified that approval of a water credit transfer application is a discretionary act by the board that requires environmental review.this language was added to district rule due to the district ongoing concern about the viability of the available water supply and the possibility that water transfers may result in additional water usage,water transfers shall be approved by the board of directors,subject to the other provisions of this rule,if the transfer will not have an adverse impact on the water supply.in exercising its discretion,the board of directors shall consider the impacts of the application under consideration,as well as the cumulative impacts of other transfers,on the water supply.
in enacting the ordinances that reinstated the water credit transfer program with an additional requirement for individual environmental assessment,the water district board indicated an intent to prepare an eir to address concerns about the program in general,including whether it was accomplishing its water savings goals or whether it was,according to a staff report,exacerbating current environmental damage to local water resources.however,the board later voted not to proceed with an eir 
a staff report in july of reflected ongoing concerns about the water credit transfer program.staff noted that since the program had been initiated in,circumstances had changed regarding water issues on the monterey peninsula.first and foremost,the state water board order had severely limited the water supply within the district and had mandated a comprehensive water conservation plan in the region.in letters from the state water board to the water district clarifying order,the state board had indicated that the water credit transfer program might violate both the letter and spirit of order.although the amount of water usage that had been transferred thus far pursuant to the water credit transfer program was relatively small transfers totaling in relation to total water production supply,district staff wrote that there is the potential for increased utilization of the program,particularly as water supplies are less available in the local jurisdictions and transfers provide one of the only ways to obtain a water permit for expanded uses.
before turning to the water credit transfer in this case,it will be useful to have in mind the applicable requirements of ceqa and the ceqa guidelines.
ii.ceqa overview 
ceqa embodies our state policy that the protection of the environment shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions.architectural heritage county of monterey th,d,subd.d.as this court has observed,the overriding purpose of ceqa is to ensure that agencies regulating activities that may affect the quality of the environment give primary consideration to preventing environmental damage.citation.save our peninsula committee monterey county bd.of supervisors,supra,th at,d.consistent with this strong environmental policy,the ceqa statutes and the guidelines issued by the california resources agency to implement ceqa have established a process to ensure that public agencies inform their decisions with environmental considerations.davidon homes city of san jose th,d.
the first tier is jurisdictional,requiring that an agency conduct a preliminary review in order to determine whether ceqa applies to a proposed activity.guidelines.davidon homes city of san jose,supra,th at,d.ceqa applies if the activity is a project under the statutory definition,unless the project is exempt.if the agency finds the project is exempt from ceqa under any of the exemptions expressly set forth in the statute and in the guidelines,no further environmental review is necessary.if no exemption applies,the agency proceeds to the second tier and conducts an initial study in order to determine if the project may have a significant effect on the environment.guidelines,subd.a.if the initial study shows that there is no substantial evidence that the project or any of its aspects may cause a significant effect on the environment,the agency prepares a negative declaration so stating.guidelines,subd.b san bernardino valley audubon society metropolitan water dist.th,d.if the project does not qualify for a negative declaration,the agency must proceed to the third step in the process,full environmental review in an eir.guidelines,subd.b,davidon homes city of san jose,supra,th at,d.
the case before us concerns only the first step of the process,namely the determination that the project was categorically exempt from ceqa.
categorical exemptions 
the legislature has authorized the secretary of the resources agency to adopt a list of classes of projects determined to be exempt from ceqa because they do not have a significant effect on the environment.such classes of projects are declared to be categorically exempt from the requirement for the preparation of environmental documents.guidelines.the determination whether a project is exempt under one of these classes is made as part of the preliminary review process prior to any formal environmental evaluation of the project.city of pasadena state of california th,d,disapproved on another point in western states petroleum superior court cal th,d.if the agency determines one of the exemptions applies,the agency may prepare and file a notice of exemption,including a description of the project,a finding that the project is exempt under the relevant class or classes,and a brief statement of reasons supporting the finding.guidelines,subd.a.where a project is categorically exempt,it is not subject to ceqa requirements and may be implemented without any ceqa compliance whatsoever.association for protection.values city of ukiah th,d.
the secretary of the resources agency has identified classes of projects as exempt.these appear in the guidelines at sections through.the class at issue in this case is class,described in guidelines section as replacement or reconstruction of existing structures and facilities where the new structure will be located on the same site as the structure replaced and will have substantially the same purpose and capacity as the structure replaced,
exceptions to exempt status 
the categorical exemptions are not absolute.even if a project falls within the description of one of the exempt classes,it may nonetheless have a significant effect on the environment based on factors such as location,cumulative impact,or unusual circumstances.w here there is any reasonable possibility that a project or activity may have a significant effect on the environment,an exemption would be improper.wildlife alive chickering cal d.guidelines section was adopted in recognition of this rule.it sets forth several exceptions to the categorical exemptions.
subdivision b provides that a ll exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place,over time is significant.guidelines,subd.b.subdivision c provides that a categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.guidelines,subd.c.
a determination by the agency that a project is categorically exempt constitutes an implied finding that none of the exceptions applies.association for protection.values city of ukiah,supra,th at,d.
iii.the water credit transfer in this case 
in november of,a commercial building complex located on foam street in monterey,totaling approximately square feet,was demolished.the uses in the building complex included a plumbing shop,barber shop,bakery,massage parlor and antique store.based on the number of fixtures on the property,the district calculated a water credit of.a coordinated commercial development was planned in phases for the entire block of properties where the foam street property is located.in the first phase,the property where the building was demolished was to be used as a parking lot.that has been its continuing use since.
in october of the developer,foursome development company foursome,applied to the water district for a extension of the water credit assigned to the foam street property,pursuant to district rule.the water district approved the extension and advised foursome that the water credit would expire november.
on august,foursome informed the city that it proposed either to create an addition to its office complex at wave street or to design and develop a new structure on a vacant lot owned by it at wave street.these locations were in the vicinity of the demolished building on the foam street property the letter asked the city to permit the transfer of the of water credit allocated to the foam street property to the city for approximately one year,to be held in reserve until the architectural plans were complete,and then to be retransferred for use at the new site.as the letter acknowledged,this procedure would effectively eliminate the expiration date of november,as established by the monterey peninsula water management district.
on august,foursome applied to the water district for a water credit transfer from foam street to the city of monterey,pursuant to district rule.the application noted that the water credit was due to expire on november.the water credit transfer was placed on the agenda of the water district board meeting on october.
on september,the water district water demand manager,stephanie pintar,wrote to the city regarding foursome application for a water credit transfer.pintar emphasized that under water district rule,the water district board in approving a water credit transfer must find that the transfer will not have an adverse impact on the water supply and must also consider the impacts of the transfer,as well as the cumulative impacts of other transfers,on the water supply.pintar asked to review the city environmental analysis,and in particular the city determination as to cumulative impacts relating to the transfer.
the city approved the water credit transfer from foam street to the city of monterey and issued a notice of exemption on september,finding the project to be categorically exempt from ceqa under the class exemption set forth in ceqa guidelines section,for replacement of an existing structure.the notice explained that the project was exempt as a class exemption because it involved a transfer of a water credit from a previously existing building to the city water allocation,which the city stated it would back to the same site with the understanding that the property owner will construct a building to that which previously existed on the site.
on september,the city responded to the inquiry from water demand manager pintar.city planner richard rerig explained that upon review he had determined that the water credit transfer could not have a significant effect on the environment.the letter notified the district that the city had found the water credit transfer to be exempt from ceqa and that the city had filed a notice of exemption.
the administrative record does not contain any further evidence of any environmental evaluation of the water credit transfer by the city.however,in a declaration later provided to the court,city planner rerig stated that it was his opinion that the water credit transfer could not possibly have a significant effect on the environment.he determined there were no cumulative impacts from this water credit transfer because any new building on the site would be required to use percent less water than the buildings that previously occupied the site,due to the mandatory percent reduction of the credit under the water district conservation policy.
at the october,board meeting of the water district,water demand manager pintar recommended that the water credit transfer be approved.pintar noted that the district would retain percent of the credit,resulting in a net transfer of.she concluded that the transfer met the requirements of district rule.the staff report explained that the transfer would not result in cumulative impacts because the city had found it was categorically exempt from ceqa.the report acknowledged that this was the first water credit transfer application that the water district board had considered since the language had been added to rule mandating consideration of adverse impacts on the water supply,and expressly requiring the board to consider the cumulative impacts of other transfers.in response to a question by a board member regarding the cumulative impacts of transfers of other water credits due to expire,pintar conceded she did not look at similar properties with credits that would expire in the near term.
a representative of foursome spoke at the water district board meeting about a planned development on the entire block of properties,including the property entitled to a water credit.he asked the board to allow the water credit transfer to the city so that the credit could be held in abeyance until plans for the development were finalized.
appellants submitted a letter to the board,objecting to the proposed water credit transfer on ceqa grounds,as well as on the basis that it violated the district own rules.they contended that the water credit transfer did not fall within the class categorical exemption because it was not a replacement of an existing structure.furthermore,there was evidence in the record showing environmental impacts from the water credit transfer,in the form of studies commissioned by the district indicating that the net result of water credit transfers was an increase in overall water demand.the letter noted that if the board approved this transfer,it would be the first time the board had ever allowed a credit to be transferred to a jurisdiction to be held for future use in order to avoid the mandatory expiration date.the letter referred to records showing numerous other water credits that could be similarly banked by transferring them for a holding period to the city,in the event that the board established a precedent with the foursome transfer.the letter pointed out that the district rules expressly prohibited banking of water credits for future use.rule.furthermore,the rules provided for no exception to the expiration date in rule.
the board voted to approve the water credit transfer by a vote of to.the dissenters expressed concerns about the ceqa exemption and about compliance with district rule,particularly the lack of any cumulative impact analysis.
appellants filed their petition for a writ of mandate on october,contending that the water district and the city had violated ceqa in approving the water credit transfer based on the class exemption without any environmental review,and that the water district in addition had violated its own rules.appellants asked the court to set aside the approvals of the project.foursome and participated as real parties in interest.
the court denied the writ petition.the court found that substantial evidence supported the determination that the class exemption in guidelines section applied.the court reasoned that because the credit would not be used for any new or additional structure that was not based on historic use,it fell within the class of exemptions for replacement or reconstruction of existing structures.the court found that no exceptions applied.acknowledging that studies done by the district appeared to show that the water credit transfer programs did not generally result in any actual water savings,the court found that this did not constitute substantial evidence showing a possibility of an adverse environmental impact because the current use will be substantially the same as the historical use associated with the site.the court further found that substantial evidence did not support a finding that there would be cumulative impacts from successive projects of this same type.the court relied on evidence that there was a percent reduction figured into the water credit,and that only transfers had been approved by the district since the program had been initiated in.finally,the court found that the requirements of rule were satisfied by the district finding that this was not a complex transfer involving multiple sites and therefore did not result in any cumulative impact.
standards of review 
as always,we start with the standards that will guide our review.
a.the city action 
the city determination that the project was exempt from compliance with ceqa requirements was a action,where no administrative hearing was held or required.a preliminary determination such as this is subject to judicial review under the abuse of discretion standard in public resources code section.association for a cleaner environment yosemite community college dist.th,d association for protection.values city of ukiah,supra,th,d.our inquiry focuses on whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.
where the issue turns only on an interpretation of the language of the guidelines or the scope of a particular ceqa exemption,this presents a question of law,subject to de novo review by this court.fairbank city of mill valley th,d azusa land reclamation main san gabriel basin watermaster th,d.our task is to determine whether,as a matter of law,the project met the definition of a categorically exempt project.santa monica chamber of commerce city of santa monica th,d.thus as to the question whether the activity comes within the categorical class of exemptions,we apply a de novo standard of review,not a substantial evidence standard.see also western states petroleum superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
where the record contains evidence bearing on the question whether the project qualifies for the exemption,such as reports or other information submitted in connection with the project,and the agency makes factual determinations as to whether the project fits within an exemption category,we determine whether the record contains substantial evidence to support the agency decision.apartment of greater los angeles city of los angeles th,d fairbank city of mill valley,supra,th at,d dehne county of santa clara d.there must be substantial evidence that the activity is within the exempt category of projects.citation.magan county of kings th,d.generally speaking,the court may consider only the administrative record in determining whether a decision was supported by substantial evidence within the meaning of public resources code section.western states petroleum superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
an agency determination that the project falls within a categorical exemption includes an implied finding that none of the exceptions identified in the guidelines is applicable.the burden then shifts to the challenging party to produce evidence showing that one of the exceptions applies to take the project out of the exempt category.santa monica chamber of commerce city of santa monica,supra,th at,d city of pasadena state of california,supra,th at,d,disapproved on another point in western states petroleum superior court,supra,cal th,d.the question whether an exception applies is a question of fact,which is subject on appeal to review for substantial evidence.fairbank city of mill valley,supra,th at,d.some courts apply the fair argument test,holding that an exemption can not stand if the challengers present a fair argument that an exception applies.id.at,d.other courts apply an ordinary substantial evidence test.id.at,d.
b.the water district action 
in reviewing the water district approval of the water credit transfer,where a public hearing was held and an adjudicatory decision was made,we apply the test for administrative mandamus.code civ.section clearly contemplates that at minimum,the reviewing court must determine both whether substantial evidence supports the administrative agency findings and whether the findings support the agency decision w hen petitioned for a writ of mandamus,a court inquiry should extend,among other issues,to whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion.subdivision b of section then defines abuse of discretion to include instances in which the administrative order or decision is not supported by the findings,or the findings are not supported by the evidence.italics added.subdivision c declares that in all cases italics added other than those in which the reviewing court is authorized by law to judge the evidence independently,abuse of discretion is established if the court determines that the findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record.citation.topanga for a scenic community county of los angeles cal d,fn.omitted stolman city of los angeles th,d.
ii.does the class exemption apply to this project 
in order to answer this question,we must first address the threshold issue,as to which the parties disagree,namely what is the project in this case 
a.what is the project 
a project under ceqa is a discretionary activity by a public agency that may cause either a direct physical change in the environment,or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment,subd.a.it includes agency approval of a lease,permit,license,certificate,or other entitlement,subd.c.
appellants contend that the project in this case is the transfer of the water use credit from the foam street property to the city of monterey.foursome argues that this is too narrow a definition of the project.foursome points out that under the guidelines definition,a project is the whole of an action.guidelines,subd.a.in foursome view,the whole project in this case is the replacement of the commercial structure that was demolished on the foam street property in.thus the water credit transfer must be evaluated in this context.the city essentially shares this point of view,arguing that the water credit transfer is simply one of the aspects of the replacement of the building on the foam street property,and that the class exemption applies to all aspects of the project.
although the guidelines define a project as the whole of an action guidelines,subd.a,an agency action qualifies as a project if it is necessary to the carrying out of some private project involving a physical change in the environment.simi valley recreation park dist.local agency formation com.d,italics omitted.here it appears that the transfer of water credits was a necessary step in the eventual plan by foursome to develop the block of properties that included foam street.furthermore,the water credit transfer was also an activity unto itself,as it was the approval of an entitlement to future water rights,subd.c.
foursome contends that the water credit transfer by itself could not possibly cause any direct or indirect change to the environment.as appellants point out,however,courts have considered water credit transfers to have environmental impact.see,save our peninsula committee monterey county bd.of supervisors,supra,th at,d.furthermore,the record in this case reflects that the state water board considered water credit transfers to have an effect on the water supply.and the water district has expressly stated its concern about the viability of the available water supply and the possibility that water transfers may result in additional water usage,district rule.thus the water district,which supervises and manages water distribution in the area,views a water credit transfer to be an activity with possible environmental consequences,and its board is required in approving a transfer to consider whether it would have an adverse impact on the water supply.in this case,if the water credit were not transferred to the city,it would expire under rule.thus the transfer of the credit,to be held for future development of the property,results in an increment of water that will be used rather than conserved.thus the city action can be seen as causing a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment,subd.a.
for all of these reasons,and bearing in mind that project is given a broad interpretation in order to maximize protection of the environment mcqueen board of directors d,disapproved on another point in western states petroleum superior court,supra,cal th,d,we conclude that the water credit transfer in this case was a project within the meaning of ceqa.this conclusion is fully supported by the record.foursome applied here only for a transfer of water credits and the only action taken by the city was to approve the water credit transfer.furthermore,the city notice of exemption described the project as a transfer of commercial water credit from foam street to the city of monterey.similarly,the project title on the notice of exemption was water credit transfer from foam street to city of monterey.and the water district staff report identified the project as a water use credit transfer.
was the project categorically exempt under guideline 
the guidelines provide that certain classes of projects have been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment.guidelines.since a determination that a project falls within a categorical exemption excuses any further compliance with ceqa whatsoever,we must construe the exemptions narrowly in order to afford the fullest possible environmental protection.azusa land reclamation main san gabriel basin watermaster,supra,th at,d county of amador el dorado county water agency th,d dehne county of santa clara,supra,d at.e xemption categories are not to be expanded or broadened beyond the reasonable scope of their statutory language.dehne county of santa clara,supra,d at.mountain lion foundation fish game com.cal th,d.these rules ensure that in all but the clearest cases of categorical exemptions,a project will be subject to some level of environmental review.
the class exemption at issue here consists of replacement or reconstruction of existing structures and facilities where the new structure will be located on the same site as the structure replaced and will have substantially the same purpose and capacity as the structure replaced,guidelines.subdivision b of this guideline provides that it applies specifically to r eplacement of a commercial structure with a new structure of substantially the same size,purpose,and capacity.guidelines,subd.b.on its face,this exemption does not apply to a water credit transfer,which is neither a structure nor a facility and therefore does not fit the elements of this exemption.
the city contends that the exemption applies for the reasons stated on its notice of exemption the project will transfer a documented water credit from a building at foam street to the city water allocation.the city will then commit the water credit back to the same site with the understanding that the property owner will construct a building to that which previously existed on the site.
even if we were to consider the water credit transfer at issue here as part of an ongoing project to replace an existing structure,the city determination that the requirements of the class exemption were met must be supported by substantial evidence in the record.magan county of kings,supra,th at,d.in our view,the city understanding that there will be a replacement structure of similar size and purpose on the same site does not amount to substantial evidence within the meaning of ceqa.the guidelines define substantial evidence as enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion,substantial evidence does not include a rgument,speculation,unsubstantiated opinion or narrative guidelines,subd.a.in the record before us,there is no information from which the city could conclude that the contemplated building meets the elements of the class exemption,in that it is a replacement structure located on the same site as the former structure and that it will have substantially the same purpose and capacity as the replaced structure.guidelines.
there were no plans,reports or proposals submitted with the application for a water credit transfer that showed a replacement structure to be built on the foam street property where the commercial complex was demolished in.the only application to the city consisted of foursome letter of august,which stated that foursome proposed to build either an addition to an office complex or a new structure,the purpose of which was not described.both of these were to be located on sites other than the foam street property at issue here.as we have noted,categorical exemptions must be carefully applied and supported by the evidence.dehne county of santa clara,supra,d at.at the very least a class exemption determination must be based on evidence from which the agency can compare the replacement structure and the existing structure.foursome application letter does not provide this evidence.
we have found no cases applying a class exemption that have extended its application beyond the reasonable scope of its plain language.the typical application involves an agency consideration of plans for reconstruction or replacement of an existing structure.for example,in dehne county of santa clara,supra,d,the applicant submitted plans and proposals to modernize its cement plant.the evidence in the record showed that the new plant would be in the same location as the existing facility,that the new facilities would not extend outside the area bounded by the present facility,that the purpose of the new facility would be the same,and that it would have substantially the same production capacity.id.at.on review of the agency determination that the project was exempt,the court was thus able to evaluate whether the elements of the class exemption were met and it found that they were.in the case before us,there is no similar factual predicate for the city determination of a class exemption.there is only the city understanding that a new structure will eventually be built that qualifies for the exemption.
foursome contends that the city was in possession of plans for the replacement structure,and refers us to several documents contained in city files these documents show that in foursome predecessor company wrote a letter to the city,requesting an amendment to a use permit to allow use as a parking lot of property at and foam street and wave street.this was to be a first phase for future development of the property.use permits issued in and extended in refer to a phase one parking lot and a phase two parking structure and a commercial building to be constructed on property at and foam street and wave street.the use permits provide that they expire on march.no site plans are included in the record before us and no further documentation appears until foursome letter to the water district in,requesting a extension of the water credit at issue here.
the building that was demolished in,for which the credit was issued,was square feet.its uses included retail shops,a bakery and a massage parlor.the project referred to in the use permit,which has apparently expired,consists of a parking structure and a commercial building of indeterminate use,to be located on several sites that may include the site where the building was demolished.the application for a water credit transfer refers to two different buildings on entirely different sites.in order to support a class exemption,there must be substantial evidence that the activity meets the requirements of the exempt category.magan county of kings,supra,th at,d.in other words,there must be evidence from which it can be concluded that a new structure will replace an existing structure on the same site with substantially the same purpose and capacity.guidelines.the record before us,even including the prior proposals and permits for the property,does not contain such evidence.
foursome contends that the declaration of city planner rerig,which was submitted to the trial court,provided substantial evidence supporting the city conclusion that the project was exempt under guidelines section in western states petroleum superior court,supra,cal th at page,d,our supreme court made clear that the trial court in a mandamus proceeding generally may consider only the administrative record in determining whether a decision was supported by substantial evidence within the meaning of the public resources code section.id.at,d.our review is likewise limited to the record before the city at the time of its decision.we therefore do not consider the declaration in evaluating whether substantial evidence supported the city exemption determination.
foursome,the city and the water district all emphasize the small amount of the water credit at issue here,when viewed in the context of the water supply in the entire region.they argue that a water credit transfer of such a small amount can not possibly have any significant effect on the environment.this argument does not bear on the class exemption determination.the size of the project in relation to the surrounding area is not an element of a class exemption.to the extent that the project size is relevant to the cumulative impacts analysis,we will address this issue in that portion of the discussion.
foursome argues in its briefing on appeal that there may be other ceqa exemptions that apply to the water credit transfer.since these issues were not raised below,we do not address them here.the city exemption determination was based only on guidelines section.we express no opinion as to whether any other categorical exemption or other ceqa exemption may apply or as to what level of environmental review may be appropriate for this project.
we find as a matter of law that the water credit transfer in this case does not fit the definition of a categorically exempt project under the class exemption defined in guidelines section.we further find that substantial evidence in the record does not support city determination that the project met the requirements of a class replacement structure.an agency abuses its discretion if there is no basis in the record for its determination that the project was exempt from ceqa.davidon homes city of san jose,supra,th at,d.we therefore conclude that the city exemption determination constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion.
iii.the exceptions to exempt status 
since we conclude that the water credit transfer did not come within the class categorical exemption,we need not reach the next step of the analysis,which focuses on the question whether any exceptions to the exemption apply.furthermore,the evidence submitted by appellants to support the exceptions they contend applied here was not before the city when it determined that this project was exempt.such evidence was,however,before the board of the water district,when it held a hearing on foursome request for a water credit transfer.we will therefore discuss appellants evidence in the context of the water district decision.
iv.the water district approval 
under ceqa law,the city acted as the lead agency with the principal responsibility for approving the water credit transfer and preparing any environmental documents.guidelines.the water district was the responsible agency.guidelines.as the responsible agency,the water district is entitled to rely on the lead agency environmental documents in acting on whatever aspect of the project requires its approval.guidelines,subd.c.the responsible agency typically has permitting authority or discretionary approval power over some aspect of the project for which a lead agency is primarily responsible.guidelines,citizens for sensible development of bishop area county of inyo d.and the responsible agency may refuse to approve a project in order to avoid direct or indirect environmental effects of that part of the project which the responsible agency would be called on to carry out or approve.guidelines.
here the water credit transfer program was created by the water district,which was responsible for ensuring that any water credit transfer complied with its rules,namely rule and rule.the water district approval of the project,although it was based in part on the city environmental assessment,was a determination independent from that of the city and must be separately evaluated against the water district rules.as noted,our review of the water district action consists of a determination whether the district findings supported its decision and whether substantial evidence supported the findings.code civ,subd.b.
appellants first contend that in approving the water credit transfer the water district made no findings that the transfer would not have an adverse impact on the water supply,or that it had considered the cumulative impacts of other transfers on the water supply as required by rule.we believe the district made sufficient findings.the findings of an administrative agency can be informal so long as they serve the purposes of enabling the parties to determine whether and on what basis to appeal and enabling a reviewing court to determine the basis for the decision.topanga for a scenic community county of los angeles,supra,cal d at.findings may consist of adopting the recommendations in a staff report.mcmillan american fin.d.that is what happened here at the water district board meeting,where a motion to adopt the staff recommendations and approve the water transfer was passed.
the water district staff report acknowledged that rule required the board to approve the transfer if the transfer will not have an adverse impact on the water supply,and the same rule further called for consideration of the impacts of the application under consideration,as well as the cumulative impact of other transfers,on the water supply.the water demand manager preparing the report found no adverse impact and also identified no cumulative impact that could result from the proposed transfer.while these are sufficient findings to support the board decision,that does not end the inquiry.we must in addition determine whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record.topanga for a scenic community county of los angeles,supra,cal d at.
appellants contend that the evidence does not support the findings contained in the staff report and adopted by the water district board.the record supports this contention.the water district staff report concluded that the water credit transfer would not have an adverse impact on the water supply based solely on the class exemption determination made by the city.the water demand manager referred to the notice of exemption issued by the city and to a letter from the city planner stating that the water credit transfer was exempt from the provisions of ceqa.since we have concluded that the water credit transfer did not meet the requirements for a class categorical exemption,the city class exemption determination does not provide substantial evidence for the finding in the water district staff report,and adopted by the board,that the transfer would not have an adverse environmental impact.
as to the consideration of the possible cumulative impacts of the water credit transfer,the report concluded there were no cumulative impacts for three reasons first,the city had impliedly found that there were no cumulative impacts by determining that the project came within a categorical exemption.second,the city had committed the water credit to be transferred back to the same property for use by a replacement structure of a similar size and capacity as the structure that originally existed on the site.and finally,the transfer in question wa
