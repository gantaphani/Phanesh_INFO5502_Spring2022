this case concerns an agreement for a contingent proposal for the sale and purchase of spring water,between mccloud community services district district and nestle waters north america.nestle.concerned mccloud citizens citizens,an unincorporated association formed for the purpose of protecting natural and cultural resources in the area of the town of mccloud in siskiyou county,filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging the district approval of the agreement with nestle because the district failed to conduct any environmental review pursuant to the california environmental quality act ceqa prior to its approval of the agreement.the trial court concluded the district approval of the agreement without prior ceqa review was a prejudicial abuse of discretion and entered a judgment granting the requested writ of mandate requiring the agreement to be vacated,set aside,and voided.
the district and nestle appeal,primarily contending the district execution of the agreement was not an approval of a project within the meaning of ceqa because the agreement was expressly conditioned on later ceqa compliance.the district and nestle contend the district administrative decision concerning the timing of environmental review should not be disturbed.in any event,the district and nestle argue the trial court should not have set aside the entire agreement,but only those provisions having the potential to result in an adverse change or alteration of the environment.for the first time in their reply brief,the district and nestle question whether citizens has standing under section to challenge the district actions.we conclude citizens is not barred by section from bringing this action.we also conclude the district approval and execution of the agreement with nestle did not constitute approval of a project within the meaning of ceqa.therefore,prior compliance with the ceqa review procedures was not required.we shall reverse the judgment of the trial court and direct entry of a judgment denying citizens petition for writ of mandate.
factual and procedural background 
the town of mccloud is located within siskiyou county on the southeast flank of shasta.historically,the economy of mccloud relied on the timber industry,but timber production declined in the.in the communities in the shasta area began to seek alternate ways to generate economic prosperity,including selling mountain spring water to water bottlers.
the district holds water rights to three springs from which it derives its water supplies intake spring,upper elk spring and lower elk spring.the district has a total supply of approximately acre feet of water per year.the town of mccloud uses approximately acre feet of water per year.like other communities in the area,the district considered developing a bottled water business.in,in,and again in,the district negotiated,unsuccessfully,with various water bottling companies in an attempt to reach an agreement for this type of business.the district considered bottling and marketing the spring water itself,but a spring water bottling feasibility study conducted by the district in suggested it was better for the district to partner with an established water bottling company.the district continued to look for a water bottling company partner.
in,the district completed a renovation of its water delivery system using revenues from the state water bonds approved by voters in the year.before this renovation,the district was losing a large percentage of its water supply from leaks and other damage to its aging redwood pipeline and other facilities.after renovation,it was calculated the district would have an additional available water supply of acre feet a year.
in,the district negotiated a tentative agreement with nestle for the purchase and sale of up to acre feet of water per year.on september,the district held a public meeting to consider the tentative agreement negotiated with nestle.the general manager of the district and a representative of nestle made a presentation to the public attending the meeting regarding the tentative agreement.questions were then fielded from the audience for approximately minutes.the board of directors of the district then approved the proposed agreement that is at issue in this case.the agreement was signed on october.
the agreement 
the initial term for the agreement is years with a guaranteed right of renewal for another years.under the agreement a contingency period of not more than five years starts on the date of the agreement.during this contingency period,nestle will evaluate the feasibility of the development and use of the district springs as a spring water source and the siting,design and construction of a bottling facility.assuming feasibility,nestle will select a site for its bottling facility and will design such facility to be constructed,operated and owned by nestle at its own cost,subject to government approvals and permitting requirements.nestle will try to locate the bottling facility within the district existing service area,but if its business needs require the facility to be located outside the existing service area,the district will do its best to annex the facility location.nestle and the district will together establish a plan and design for spring water testing,monitoring,collection and a distribution system as necessary to meet nestle standards and proposed uses.the district will design a new separate collection system,delivery system and such ancillary facilities as are necessary for providing spring water to nestle to be owned by the district,but with nestle paying the cost of such improvements.the design of such systems and facilities will not be final until approved in writing by both the district and nestle.during the contingency period,the district and nestle will jointly develop a water supply contingency plan to address foreseeable contingencies in the event of fires,drought,earthquake,other natural disasters and other emergencies.during the contingency period,nestle and the district will jointly develop a road use plan to identify primary truck routes to be used by nestle.the road use plan may be addressed as part of the ceqa process.nestle may request the district to design,construct,and install groundwater wells on the bottling facility site for nestle use as a supply for water purposes.the wells will be owned by the district with all costs paid by nestle.the contingency period will be used to apply for and secure all discretionary permits,defined as including ceqa documentation,review and approvals,along with the final adjudication of any legal challenges based on ceqa,and to assess environmental,title,physical,water quality and economic aspects of the project.
after the contingency period closes,nestle contractual right to commence purchasing and taking deliveries of water begins.nestle has a right to interim sales of water for bulk delivery to its other bottling facilities,but the design and location of any necessary pipelines or loading facility for such interim sales must be approved by the district.nestle must begin construction of a bottling facility within five years from the date of the agreement and must complete construction prior to the seventh anniversary.
under the agreement the district agrees it will not enter into any discussions or negotiations with any other person or entity to purchase or use any spring water or to develop the district springs.nestle has the exclusive right to take delivery of and purchase spring water from the district.the agreement requires nestle to make contingency fee payments to the district,exclusivity fee payments after the bottling facility is operational,and sets the price for the water supplied by the district.nestle also agrees to establish and fund a community enhancement program for the community of mccloud.the agreement contains terms governing sewer and domestic water services to be provided to nestle.
at any time during the contingency period,nestle can cancel the agreement with or without cause.nestle can terminate for cause after the bottling facility has been operational for years,but can not terminate because of its development of other spring water sources to replace the district water.the district can terminate for lack of payment by nestle,bankruptcy of nestle or prolonged delay in construction of the bottling facility.
under article general provisions,section of the agreement provides as follows district and nestle acknowledge and agree that the obligations of the parties under this agreement are conditioned on district and nestle completing,during the contingency period,proceedings under ceqa in connection with the project,and the expiration of the applicable period for any challenge to the adequacy of district and nestle compliance with ceqa without any challenge being filed.nestle shall reimburse district for the reasonable costs of complying with ceqa,including administrative costs and the cost of litigation defense nestle shall select a qualified environmental consultant acceptable to district to prepare the underlying documentation for district review and consideration as may be required by ceqa and applicable law.nestle shall direct the qualified environmental consultant and both nestle and the environmental consultant shall coordinate the preparation of the environmental analysis with district to ensure a full,fair and complete consideration of potential environmental impacts.any documentation submitted by nestle shall be sufficient for district to make a fair decision in accordance with applicable law district and nestle acknowledge that any modifications to the load station,the collection system,the new delivery system,the ancillary facilities or the bottling facility resulting from district compliance with ceqa may necessitate amendments to this agreement in a mutually acceptable manner.neither party shall be bound hereby unless and until district compliance with ceqa is completed and there is no possibility of a challenge pursuant to ceqa.italics added.
trial court decision 
the trial court concluded this agreement constitutes an initial and integral stage of a project within the meaning of ceqa.the trial court concluded the approval of the agreement amounted to the creation of an entitlement for nestle and committed the district to a definite course of action.according to the trial court,w hen the agreement creates an option for the purchase of such a vital and environmentally sensitive community resource such as drinking water,with terms potentially extending out to years,and the district is on the verge of divesting itself of any modicum of control over the compliance process,it is an abuse of discretion not to proceed with ceqa compliance prior to approval of the agreement.
discussion 
does not bar this action 
we first dispose of a preliminary issue raised by the district and nestle the district and nestle contend citizens lacks standing to challenge the district action because it failed to comply with the requirements of section,subdivision b.we conclude such section does not bar citizens action in this case.
section,subdivision b provides no person shall maintain an action or proceeding unless that person objected to the approval of the project orally or in writing during the public comment period provided by this division or prior to the close of the public hearing on the project before the issuance of the notice of determination.italics added.
the court in azusa land reclamation main san gabriel basin watermaster th,d,construed subdivision a of section,which contains the same language we have italicized in subdivision b.it concluded such language limited the application of section to the type of situations where ceqa provides a public comment period,or there is a public hearing before a notice of determination is issued.azusa land,supra,at,d.as the lead agency in azusa land had declared the project exempt from ceqa,there was no public comment period provided by ceqa and there was no public hearing before the issuance of the notice of determination.ibid.the court explained that ceqa provides for public comment on a negative declaration and an eir ceqa does not provide for a public comment period before an agency decides a project is exempt.similarly,where an agency approves a project and simultaneously decides that the project is exempt from ceqa,there is no public hearing before the issuance of the notice of determination.ibid.the court rejected the claim that a regularly scheduled meeting of the lead agency was a public hearing on the project at which the petitioners should have objected to the agency action.such meeting was not a public hearing before the issuance of the notice of determination.id.at,d.therefore,petitioners were not precluded by section from challenging the exemption determination.accord,castaic lake water agency city of santa clarita th,d.
for the same reasons we conclude section,subdivision b does not apply to this case.the district meeting held on september,was not a public hearing before the issuance of a notice of determination.it was an informational meeting on the tentative agreement,the approval of which the district did not consider to be an approval of a project within the meaning of ceqa.moreover,at the conclusion of the hearing the district did not issue a notice of determination.there is no public comment period under ceqa before an agency takes an action that it does not consider to be the approval of a project under ceqa.by its language,section,subdivision b,does not apply.since we conclude it does not apply,we need not address citizens arguments of waiver,estoppel,lack of opportunity to object prior to approval,and exhaustion of its available limited administrative remedy since we conclude section does not apply,we also need not consider whether the comments made by members of the public at the district meeting fairly raised an objection to approval of the agreement based on the lack of prior ceqa compliance.see banker hill,hillcrest,park west community preservation group city of san diego th,d.
ceqa standard of review 
judicial review of an agency compliance with ceqa where no administrative evidentiary hearing at the agency level was required is governed by section,which limits judicial inquiry to whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.no oil,city of los angeles cal d,fn,no oil.abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.we apply this same standard on appeal,independently reviewing the administrative record of the agency actions.the trial court decision is not binding on us.lighthouse field beach rescue city of santa cruz th,d city of vernon board of harbor comrs.th,d city of vernon.
compliance with ceqa was not required before the district approval of this agreement 
ceqa is a comprehensive scheme designed to provide protection to the environment.citation.in enacting ceqa,the legislature declared its intention that all public agencies responsible for regulating activities affecting the environment give prime consideration to preventing environmental damage when carrying out their duties.citations.ceqa is to be interpreted to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language.lion found.fish game com.cal th,d,quoting friends of mammoth bd.of supervisors cal d.
ceqa generally applies to discretionary projects proposed to be carried out or approved by public agencies,subd.a.ceqa requires that an agency determine whether a project may have a significant environmental impact,and thus whether an eir environmental impact report is required,before it approves that project.laurel heights i,supra,cal d at,quoting no oil,supra,cal d at,original italics.a fundamental purpose of an eir is to provide decision makers with information they can use in deciding whether to approve a proposed project,not to inform them of the environmental effects of projects that they have already approved.if postapproval environmental review were allowed,eir would likely become nothing more than post hoc rationalizations to support action already taken.we the california supreme court have expressly condemned this use of eir,italics omitted.however,an agency has no duty of compliance with ceqa unless its actions will constitute approval of a project.lexington hills state of california d.
the guidelines define approval for public agency projects as the decision by a public agency which commits the agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project intended to be carried out by any person.guidelines,subd.a stand tall on principles shasta union high sch.dist.d,d stand tall see kostka zischke,practice under the california environmental quality act ceb.with respect to private projects,approval occurs upon the earliest commitment to issue or the issuance by the public agency of a discretionary contract,grant subsidy,loan or other form of financial assistance,lease,permit,license,certificate,or other entitlement for use of the project.guidelines,subd.b see kostka zischke,supra.
project means an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment,or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment,and which is any of the following a an activity directly undertaken by any public agency.b an activity undertaken by a person which is supported,in whole or in part,through contracts,grants,subsidies,loans,or other forms of assistance from one or more public agencies.c an activity that involves the issuance to a person of a lease,permit,license,certificate,or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies.see city of livermore local agency formation com.d.the guidelines provide project means the whole of the action guidelines,subd.a and further that t he term project refers to the activity which is being approved and which may be subject to several discretionary approvals by governmental agencies.the term project does not mean each separate government approval.guidelines,subd.c.
there is no disagreement among the parties,and we agree,the ultimate purchase and sale of spring water to nestle by the district,involving the taking of a significant amount of water from the district springs,trucking piping the water to nestle bottling facilities,constructing a new local bottling facility,potentially digging new groundwater wells,and the other related activities necessary to nestle bottling the district spring water amounts to a project requiring ceqa compliance.the whole of the action may cause either a direct physical change in the environment,or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment.guidelines,subd.a.
we conclude,however,the district approval of the agreement at the conclusion of the public hearing and the execution of the agreement with nestle did not constitute approval of a project within the meaning of ceqa.the agreement at issue,when read as a whole and in light of section expressly providing the parties will not be bound by the agreement until compliance with ceqa is completed and there is no possibility of a ceqa challenge,does not commit the district to a definite course of action in regard to a project guidelines,subd.a nor does it amount to a commitment to issue or the issuance of a contract or other entitlement for use of a project.guidelines,subd.b.the agreement,while admittedly a binding contract,is conditional see,and does not grant nestle a vested right of use of the project.the agreement is predicated on a series of ifs and commits the district to sell water to nestle under the described terms only if the described terms are successfully completed.the ifs or contingencies contained in the agreement include but are not limited to if nestle determines during the contingency period water bottling from the district springs is feasible and desirable,if nestle selects a site for and designs a bottling facility and obtains all applicable government approvals and permits for the site and facility,if the district approves a design for water testing,monitoring,collection and distribution,including written approval of a new collection system,delivery system,and as yet unspecified necessary ancillary facilities,if the district and nestle are able to develop a water supply contingency plan to address foreseeable emergencies,and if the district and nestle are able to jointly develop a road use plan.the biggest if in the agreement however is if all discretionary permits,expressly defined as including ceqa documentation,review and approvals,along with the final adjudication of any legal challenges based on ceqa,are secured and all environmental,title,physical,water quality and economic aspects of the project are assessed 
contrary to the trial court interpretation of this agreement as placing the district on the verge of divesting itself of any modicum of control over the compliance process,the terms of the agreement demonstrate the district retains the right to participate in and approve or disapprove of or modify major aspects of the prospective project moreover,section of the agreement expressly recognizes the ultimate water bottling project is subject to ceqa,will be reviewed pursuant to ceqa,and the agreement may be modified as a result.the district has not limited its discretion in conducting its part of such review.indeed,the agreement nowhere precludes consideration by the district of a no project alternative.see guidelines,subd.e.we view the agreement as temporarily holding in place a set of preagreed financial terms between the parties,while conceptually outlining a proposal for a project to be subjected to and conditioned upon full environmental review.in exchange for the district forbearance from negotiating with any other water bottler while such ceqa review takes place and other governmental permits and approvals are sought,nestle has agreed to make certain contingency fee payments and to shoulder the costs of,among other things,ceqa compliance.clearly the district is favorably disposed to the ultimate success of this project,but the agreement does not preclude it from considering a full range of options depending on subsequent ceqa review.
in city of vernon bd.of harbor,supra,th,d,the port of long beach entered into a statement of intent with a shipping company expressing the parties intent to enter into a lease of a container storage facility to be developed in a former naval shipyard.the agreement contained a description of the expected development and equipment to be installed,the right of the shipping company to approve designs,the term of any lease,compensation,and other terms.id.at,d.although it was clear the port was a proponent of the proposal,the court of appeal rejected the claim that the agreement amounted to an approval of a project under ceqa.if having high esteem for a project before preparing an environmental impact report eir nullifies the process,few public projects would withstand judicial scrutiny,since it is inevitable that the agency proposing a project will be favorably disposed toward it.id.at,d.the ceqa guidelines define approve not as a feeling,but as the decision by a public agency which commits the agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project intended to be carried out by any person.guidelines,subd.a.the agency commits to a definite course of action not simply by being a proponent or advocate of the project,but by agreeing to be legally bound to take that course of action.citations.id.at,d,fn.omitted.concluding the statement of intent did not bind the port,the court of appeal held the agreement did not constitute approval for purposes of ceqa.id.at,d.
