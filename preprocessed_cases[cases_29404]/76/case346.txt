in december,the california regional water quality control board,los angeles region regional board issued a municipal stormwater sewer permit permit to real parties in interest los angeles county and designated cities within the county,including the cities of bellflower,carson,commerce,covina,downey and signal hill collectively county.the permit is governed by a complex state and federal statutory scheme regulating pollutant discharge into waterways under the federal clean water act and the california porter cologne water act.the permit subvention status is subject to initial determination by the commission on state mandates commission.real parties in interest filed a test claim before the commission,seeking to determine whether four requirements of the permit to install trash receptacles at transit stops and to conduct inspections of commercial,industrial,and construction sites constituted unfunded state mandates subject to reimbursement under the california constitution,article xiii b,section because although the permit was governed by both federal law and state law,the county asserted the permit contained additional state requirements not found in the governing federal statutes and regulations.the commission agreed and found that the requirements constituted state mandates,although it concluded subvention was required only for the trash receptacles because the county had the ability to levy fees to pay for the inspections.
the department of finance filed a petition for writ of mandate in the trial court,seeking to overturn the commission ruling,contending that the requirements were solely federal mandates because they implemented the directive of the federal statutes and regulations and thus were not subject to state subvention.the trial court agreed and found that the commission erred in finding the permit requirements were state mandates because it did not apply the applicable federal maximum extent practicable standard,and issued a writ of mandate ordering the commission to vacate its decision.
on appeal,the dispute centers on whether the federal standard requiring the reduction of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable encompassed the specific four requirements of the permit,given that the federal regulations at issue did not expressly spell out such requirements.the amici parties california stormwater quality association et collectively csqa join in the county arguments that the trial court erred in finding the maximum extent practicable standard controlled.the amicus party building association legal defense foundation building association asserts that the issue is one of preemption,and the trial court erred in finding that the federal regulations governed the court mandate analysis.we agree with the trial court conclusion that the commission failed to apply the controlling maximum extent practicable standard,that the permit mandates implement the maximum extent practicable objective,and thus are federal mandates.we affirm the judgment.
factual background and procedural history 
regulatory structure 
the permit was issued as a national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit pursuant to the clean water act,title united states code section.the clean water act requires operators of municipal separate storm sewer systems to obtain npdes permits that contain controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable.p b iii.the commission did not consider this standard in evaluating the permit requirements,instead looking solely to whether the requirements were expressly set forth in the implementing federal regulation at code of federal regulations,part d iv a d a copy of appendix a is attached.

c.the permit 
background 
to obtain the permit,the county of los angeles,on behalf of itself and the cities,submitted on january,a report of waste discharge rowd,which constituted a permit application,and a stormwater quality management program,which constituted the permittees proposal for best management practices that would be required in the permit.the rowd contained a storm water management program as set forth in code of federal regulations,part d,which in turn included a storm water quality management program sqmp.
the regional board issued notices to the permitees and interested agencies and persons of its intent to issue the permit,and provided an opportunity for comment and recommendations.in addition,the regional board conducted public workshops to discuss drafts of the permit,and held a public hearing at which it heard and considered all comments pertaining to the permit requirements.
the permit was issued pursuant to section of the clean water act,and was originally adopted by the regional board on december,as npdes permit no,and amended on september,and august,the permit established waste discharge requirements for municipal storm water and urban runoff discharges within the county of los angeles and the incorporated cities therein,except the city of long beach.
the page permit is divided into six parts.the county,the flood control district,and the cities are designated in the permit as the permittees.the permit incorporated the regional board factual findings regarding the nature of the harms occurring because of storm water discharge,surface water runoff,and pollutants.the permit found t he regulations require that permittees establish priorities and procedures for inspection of industrial facilities and priority commercial establishments.this permit,consistent with epa policy,incorporates a cooperative partnership,including the specification of minimum expectations,between the regional board and the permittees for the inspection of industrial facilities and priority commercial establishments to control pollutants in storm water discharges.further,section of the clean water act p provides that permits must require controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable,including management practices,control techniques and systems,design engineering methods and such other provisions as the epa administrator or the state determines appropriate for the control of such pollutants.the state water resources control board state board office of chief counsel occ has issued a memorandum interpreting the meaning of mep to include technical feasibility,cost,and benefit derived with the burden being on the municipality to demonstrate compliance with mep by showing that a bmp best management practice is not technically feasible in the locality or that bmp costs would exceed any benefit to be derived 
separately,to facilitate compliance with federal regulations,the state board has previously issued two statewide general npdes permits for stormwater discharges for stormwater from industrial sites npdes no,general industrial activity storm water permit giasp and for stormwater from construction sites npdes no,general construction activity storm water permit gcasp,originally issued in and,respectively.facilities discharging stormwater associated with industrial activities and construction sites of five acres or more of disturbed area were required to obtain individualized npdes permits,or to be covered by a statewide general permit.the permit sets forth that t he usepa guidance anticipates coordination of the programs for industrial and construction activities with the local agency program to reduce pollutants in storm water discharges to the.
the gcasp was issued to address effluent limitations promulgated under the clean water act and as specified in the applicable federal regulations.under the gcasp,the state requires inspections of construction sites prior to anticipated storm events to identify areas contributing to the discharge of stormwater,and to ensure that bmps were properly installed and functioned adequately during the storm.in addition,the site must permit the regional board,the state board,the epa,and the operator of the storm sewer into which the site discharges stormwater to inspect the site.the giasp was likewise issued to address effluent limitations promulgated under the clean water act and as specified in the federal regulations applicable to the clean water act.with respect to inspections,the giasp has an extensive monitoring program that is and requires visual inspections and water sampling and analysis.under the giasp,the facility operator may,if it meets certain conditions,certify compliance with the giasp and reduce the number of sampling events.preventative maintenance must also be conducted by the facility operators,and includes inspection of structural storm water controls catch basins,separators,as well as other facility equipment and systems.in addition,there must be an inspection schedule of all potential pollutant sources.the site must also permit regional board,state board,epa and any local storm water agency to enter into the site for inspections.the giasp specifically notes that it does not preempt or supersede the authority of local agencies to prohibit,restrict,or control storm water discharges and authorized water discharges to storm drain systems or other within their jurisdictions as allowed by state and federal law.the regional board has the authority to enforce the giasp and gcasp.
the los angeles county flood control district was designated as the principal permittee and was to,among other things,coordinate permit activities among the permittees and provide technical and administrative support.
permit requirements 
the county challenged before the commission parts inspections of commercial facilities,inspection of industrial facilities,inspection of construction sites and installation of trash receptacles of the permit.
commercial facilities.part 
restaurants,automotive service facilities,retail gasoline stores and automotive dealerships were to be inspected by the permittees twice during the term of the permit,with a minimum of one year between inspections.
with respect to restaurants,the permit required each permittee to inspect all restaurants within its jurisdiction to confirm that stormwater bmp were being effectively implemented,and included verification that the restaurant operator has received educational materials on stormwater pollution prevention practices does not pour oil and grease or oil and grease residue onto a parking lot,street or adjacent catch basin keeps the trash bin area clean and trash bin lids closed,and does not fill trash bins with washout water or any other liquid does not allow illicit discharges,such as discharge of washwater from floormats,floors,porches,parking lots,alleys,sidewalks and street areas in the immediate vicinity of the establishment,filters or containers removes food waste,rubbish or other materials from parking lot areas in a sanitary manner that does not create a nuisance or discharge to the storm drain.
with respect to automotive service facilities,the permit required that each permittee inspect all automotive service facilities within its jurisdiction to confirm that stormwater bmps are effectively implemented.at each automotive service facility,inspectors were to verify that each operator maintains the facility area so that it is clean and dry without evidence of excessive staining implements housekeeping bmps to prevent spills and leaks properly discharges wastewaters to a sanitary sewer contains wastewaters for transfer to a legal point of disposal is aware of the prohibition on discharge of to the storm drain properly manages raw and waste materials including proper disposal of hazardous waste protects outdoor work and storage areas to prevent contact of pollutants with rainfall and runoff labels,inspects,and routinely cleans storm drain inlets that are located on the facility property and trains employees to implement stormwater pollution prevention practices.
with respect to retail gasoline outlets and automotive dealerships,the permit required each permittee to confirm that bmp were being effectively implemented at each retail gasoline outlet and automotive dealership within its jurisdiction.the permittee was to verify that each operator routinely sweeps areas for removal of litter and debris,and keeps rags and absorbents ready for use in case of leaks and spills was aware that washdown of facility area to the storm drain is prohibited was aware of design flaws such as grading that does not prevent,or inadequate roof covers and berms,and that equivalent bmp are implemented inspects and cleans storm drain inlets and catch basins within each facility boundaries no later than october of each year posts signs close to fuel dispensers,which warn vehicle against topping off of vehicle fuel tanks and installation of automatic shutoff fuel dispensing nozzles routinely checks outdoor waste receptacle and supply areas,cleans leaks and drips,and ensures that only watertight waste receptacles are used and that lids are closed and trains employees to properly manage hazardous materials and wastes as well as to implement other stormwater pollution prevention practices.
industrial facilities.part 
generally,the permit required inspections twice during the term of the permit,with more than one year between inspections.each permittee was required to confirm that each operator had a current waste discharge identification wdid number for facilities discharging stormwater associated with industrial activity,and that a storm water pollution prevention plan is available,and the facility was effectively implementing the plan.
construction facilities.part 
the permit required each permittee to implement a program to control runoff from construction activity sediments generated on the construction site were to be retained using adequate treatment control and structural bmp construction related materials,spills,and residues were to be contained at the construction site to avoid runoff to streets nonstormwater runoff from equipment and vehicle washing was to be retained at the site erosion from slopes and channels was to be controlled by implementing bmp,such as limiting grading during the wet season,inspecting graded areas during rain,planting and maintenance of slopes,and covering erosion susceptible slopes.for sites one acre or larger,each was to be inspected a minimum of once during the wet season.
trash receptacles.part 
the trash receptacle requirement at part,special provisions,public agency activities program.storm drain operation and management,c part required trash receptacles to be placed at all transit stops within the permittee jurisdiction.permittees not subject to a trash tmdl shall place trash receptacles at all transit stops within its jurisdiction that have shelters no later than august,and at all transit stops within its jurisdiction no later than february.all trash receptacles shall be maintained as necessary.
proceedings before the commission 
the hearing 
in september,the county of los angeles and several cities within the county filed a test claim the county sought reimbursement for the inspection requirement of commercial facilities,industrial facilities,and commercial facilities,and the trash receptacle requirement at parts,and of the permit.the commission initially refused jurisdiction over the permit based on government code section definition of executive order that excluded permits issued by the state board or a regional board.in county of los angeles commission on state mandates th,division three of this court held that exclusions of these entities from the definition of an executive order was unconstitutional.the court issued a writ directing the commission to hear the claim on the merits.id.at.the county and the cities refiled the test claim in october and november.
the county asserted that it did not have fee authority to collect trash from trash receptacles that must be placed at transit stops.further,the county asserted it had no authority to collect fees to conduct the inspections,and before the state delegated such inspections,the state had performed them.at the hearing on the test claim held july,the county presented evidence consisting of 
several epa permits for showed that many of the permits did not contain a trash receptacle requirement 
the trash receptacle obligation was new and had not been included in prior permits issued by the regional board that were approved by the epa 
letters dated april and july from the epa assertedly stating that the state of california had the obligation to inspect facilities for permits 
evidence that the regional board had previously negotiated with the county to pay the county to perform inspections of industrial facilities on the regional board behalf before the regional board imposed that requirement on the county and cities without payment.
the department of finance asserted that the permit did not impose a reimbursable mandate because the permit conditions imposed on the local agencies were required under the npdes program and were enforceable under the federal clean water act.the department of finance also argued that the claimants had discretion over the activities and conditions included in the permit and thus any resulting costs were downstream of the permittee decision to include the provision and hence not.
the county responded that whether or not an agency places trash receptacles at transit stops was not relevant to the mandate determination because if a local agency has been incurring costs that are later mandated by the state,such costs are reimbursable as a mandate.further,the inspection duties were imposed for industrial and commercial facilities and construction sites,and the state had been responsible for such inspections since under the porter cologne act and the inspections were not required under the clean water act.
the commission conclusions 
a not discretionary 
the commission found that because the permittees were required by state and federal law to obtain the permit,it was not discretionary.
b not a federal mandate 
the commission observed that w hen federal law imposes a mandate on the state,however,and the state freely chooses to impose the costs upon the local agency as a means of implementing a federal program,then the costs are the result of a reimbursable state mandate regardless whether the costs were imposed upon the state by the federal government,citing hayes,supra,th at page and government code section,subdivision c further,the commission found the state could enforce its own water quality laws as long as such laws were as stringent as the clean water act.p b iii.
i trash receptacles 
the commission found the trash receptacle obligation was not a federal mandate because federal law contained no such requirement,nor did federal law require inspections of restaurants,automotive facilities,or retail gasoline outlets.the commission observed that nothing in the clean water act indicated that california was required to have a npdes program or issue stormwater permits the epa would require permits if california had no such program.further,the plain language of the federal regulation at code of federal regulations,part d iv a was generally worded to require a description of practices for operating and maintaining public streets,roads and highways and procedures for reducing the impact on receiving waters of discharges from municipal storm sewer systems,including pollutants discharged as a result of deicing activities and this language did not require the permittees to install and maintain trash receptacles at transit stops.the commission relied on long beach unified sch.dist.state of california d long beach unified for the proposition that npdes permits may contain a state mandate even though they are formulated to comply with federal law.in long beach unified,division five of this court held that although the school district was under a federal constitutional obligation to desegregate schools,the state executive order promulgating regulations providing desegregation guidelines to schools was a state mandate because it required specific actions to be taken that went beyond the federal constitutional obligation as set forth in case law.long beach unified,at.the commission found that as in long beach unified,the permit mandates went beyond federal requirements and thus constituted a state mandate.
ii inspection requirement.
with respect to the inspection obligations of commercial,industrial and construction facilities,the commission analyzed the requirements of code of federal regulations,part d iv b and c.those sections generally required the description of a program,including inspections,to implement and enforce an ordinance,orders or similar means to prevent illicit discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system,d iv b,or a requirement that permittees i dentify priorities and procedures for inspections and establishing and implementing control measures for such discharges.d iv c.however,the federal regulations contained no express requirement to inspect restaurants,automotive service facilities,retail gasoline stations,automobile dealerships,or construction and industrial sites.thus,this requirement was not a federal mandate.
the commission also found that this same language in code of federal regulations,part d iv b and c did not prevent the state,rather than local agencies,from inspecting industrial facilities.the statewide giasp was administered by the state board,and the state board collected fees for the regional boards for performing obligations under the giasp pursuant to water code section,subd.d b ii.the commission found that i nasmuch as the federal regulation c authorizes coverage under a statewide general permit for the inspections of industrial activities,and the federal regulation d iv d does not expressly require those inspections to be performed by the county or cities or the owner or operator of the discharge,the state has freely chosen to impose these activities on the permittees and no federal mandate existed.
c new program or higher level of service 
with respect to whether the permit requirements imposed a new program or a higher level of service,the commission observed that to determine whether the permit is a new program or higher level of service,it needed to compare the permit to the legal requirements in effect immediately before its adoption.in that regard,the commission found that local agencies were not required by state or federal law to place and maintain trash receptacles at transit stops before the permit was adopted,as a result,it was a new program or higher level of service to place trash receptacles at transit stops and maintain them as specified in the permit.
for the same reason,the commission found that the inspections and enforcement duties at industrial and commercial facilities,including restaurants,automotive service facilities,retail gasoline outlets,and automotive dealerships,was a new program or higher level of service because these were not required activities of the permittees prior to the permit adoption.
proceedings before the trial court 
petition and cross petition 
on february,the department of finance,the state board,and the regional board filed a petition for administrative mandamus pursuant to code of civil procedure section against the commission,with the county of los angeles and the cities of artesia,azusa,bellflower,beverly hills,carson,commerce,covina,downey,monterey park,norwalk,rancho palos verdes,signal hill,vernon,and westlake village as real parties in interest.
the department of finance argued that that the permit was a federal mandate and not subject to subvention because california administration of the mandate did not transform the clean water act requirements into a state mandate.under city of sacramento,supra,cal d at pages,certain regulatory standards imposed by the federal government under cooperative federalism schemes are coercive on the states and localities in every practical sense similarly here,the ndpes program was coercive on the state and local governments because regardless of whether the state or the epa issued the permit,it was not voluntary because the county had to comply with the maximum extent practicable standards and thus the permit did not constitute a shifting of state costs to localities.congress established the maximum extent practicable standard because municipal storm water runoff,unlike other pollutant discharges,could not be adequately addressed by blanket effluent limitations.thus,the commission erred in ignoring this standard and by looking solely to federal statutes and regulations to define the scope of federal law.finally,the department of finance argued the regional board findings regarding what was necessary to implement the maximum extent practicable standard had previously been litigated in county of los angeles state water resources control bd.th and previously upheld by division five.
the county argued that it did not have fee authority to pay for the trash receptacles or the inspections,and the state board fee for inspections of industrial and construction facilities preempted any fee the county might charge.the cities of bellflower,carson,commerce,covina,downey and signal hill argued that the commission properly applied the maximum extent practicable standard whether the activities constituted a state mandate was within the commission purview,not the regional board,and the commission decision was supported by substantial evidence.with respect to industrial facilities,the state board already administered such facilities through the giasp,which required the state to enforce its provisions the state board could collect fees to cover inspections of such facilities,the regional board entered into a contract in whereby the regional board paid the county to conduct inspections and the plain language of the governing statutes and regulations do not require inspections.with respect to construction sites,the state board already administered such facilities through the gcasp,which is enforced by the state and authorizes the state board to collect fees for inspections the inspection obligation was not in prior permits,and the plain language of the governing statutes and regulations do not require inspections.
in reply,the department asserted that the maximum extent practicable standard governed whether the mandate was of federal or state origin,and there was no evidence the permit requirements went beyond federal law.the mere fact the standard was flexible did not mean that the permit exceeded those standards,and asserted the epa requirements were not determinative under the clean water act because under federal law,each permit must be tailored to the unique surroundings of the waterways the language of title united states code section p b iii contemplates that,because of the fundamentally different characteristics of many municipalities,municipalities will have permits tailored to meet particular geographical,hydrological,and climactic conditions.further,the fact prior permits did not have the requirements of the most recent permit was not relevant because a new permit must be at least as stringent as the prior one o l,and the epa anticipates that stormwater management will evolve over time.
the county of los angeles and the cities of bellflower,carson,commerce,covina,downey and signal hill filed a for writ of administrative mandamus,challenging the commission finding that although the inspection requirements of parts,and were state mandates,the county had the authority to levy fees pursuant to government code section,subdivision d to pay for such programs and was thus not entitled to subvention.
trial court statement of decision 
on august,the trial court issued its statement of decision in which it found the trash receptacle requirement was a federal mandate.the trial court rejected the commission conclusion that the state freely chose to implement the npdes permit as legally incorrect because the fact that california was not required to issue permits and voluntarily did so did not lead to the conclusion the npdes program was optional and thus mandated by the state.the trial court rejected the argument that there needed to be a federal regulation particularly on point for the activity to be mandated because such an argument ignored and misplaced the flexibility built into the federal maximum extent practicable standard.thus,the trial court found the commission erred in isolating specific requirements to conclude that the permit was a state mandate because one permit provision could not exceed the maximum extent practicable standard where the regional board had concluded the permit as a whole did not.the failure to include these provisions in prior permits did not convert the requirements into state mandates due to the evolving nature of the clean water act requirements.further,the inspection requirements were likewise pursuant to the maximum extent practicable standard of the clean water act and hence federal mandates.a federal mandate does not require explicit mention of every mandated activity.rather,the relevant inquiry is whether these inspection activities fall within the clean water act maximum extent practicable standard.as there is nothing in the record to suggest that they exceed this standard,the commission conclusions to the contrary must fail.the trial court did not address the county,but noted that it would fail for the same reasons as the petition 
the court entered judgment granting the petition,and remanded the matter to the commission to set aside and vacate its decision.

ii.federal mandates and maximum extent practicable 
the county contends that the trial court erred in finding that the permit obligations were federal mandates because the court in county of los angeles commission on state mandates,supra,th,previously determined the mandate issue the trial court erred in finding that the commission failed to consider the maximum extent practicable standard and the commission decision is supported by substantial evidence.
specifically,the county argues that the trial court failed to analyze whether the regional board specifically included certain activities not required by the federal regulations,and erred in failing to do so because the relevant federal regulations do not require inspections.the county asserts that in long beach unified,supra,d,the court held that a state mandate may arise if the state,in implementing a federal requirement,requires specific actions and imposes additional burdens on a local agency beyond the federal requirements.id.at pp.as a result,the county contends,the permit inspection obligations exceeded the scope of the federal regulations,both in number and required content of the inspections as well as the type of facilities to be inspected.see,d iv b,c d.further,in hayes,the court held that even where federal law imposes a mandate,if the state freely chooses to shift responsibility for compliance from itself to a local agency,the resulting costs are a state mandate regardless of whether the costs were imposed upon the state by the federal government.hayes,supra,th at pp.however,the county contends,the trial court failed to apply this analysis,and if it had,it would have found that the regional board had a choice whether to impose the inspection obligations.first,under the porter cologne act,the regional board had the authority to regulate the discharge of pollutants into waterways.see,subds.d,e.in addition,the porter cologne act authorizes the regional board to require any person to furnish technical and monitoring reports describing discharges into waterways.see,subds.b,c.the porter cologne act does not exempt commercial,industrial,or construction facilities from its reach.finally,the regional board had the obligation to enforce the giasp and gcasp pertaining to construction and industrial sites,which contain provisions for inspections.under both giasp and gcasp,the state can impose inspection fees.see,subd.d a.
the department of finance contends that the trial court correctly found that reliance on long beach unified,supra,d was misplaced because in that case,a state mandate was found because there was no federal law specifying how desegregation of schools should take place.id.at.in contrast,applicable to the permit is the clean water act specifying the maximum extent practicable standard,and the commission was required to analyze the federal maximum extent practicable standard,which it did not.in addition,the department of finance argues that the regional board duty to inspect facilities does not substitute for the county obligations under an npdes permit,and the state inspection obligations under giasp and gcasp impose independent duties to perform compliance inspections.

the county contends that in county of los angeles commission on state mandates,supra,th,the first time this court addressed this case,the regional board argued that the trash receptacle and inspection obligations were federal mandates as a matter of law,contending that the federal mandate nature of its npdes permits remains constant although it exercises discretion to control the discharge of pollutants through municipal stormwater programs not appearing in federal regulations.id.at.however,the county contends the court in county of los angeles commission on state mandates rejected these arguments,finding that because an npdes permit could contain both federal and state requirements,whether the requirements constituted state or federal mandates was a fact question which must be addressed by the commission.id.at pp.as a result of this holding,the county contends that this court has already rejected the federal mandate argument as a matter of law.the department of finance argues that the commission should have deferred to both the regional board findings in designing the permit and the prior judicial review of those findings.see county of los angeles state water resources control,supra,th at.the commission,while an expert in mandate,is not an expert in water quality law.
we disagree.first,county of los angeles commission on state mandates,supra,th did not address the issue of state mandates.the county and certain cities filed a test claim challenging the permit.the commission returned the claims unadjudicated because they did not involve an executive order subject to subvention under government code section,subdivision c.commission on state mandates,at pp.on appeal,the court addressed whether section,subdivision c was unconstitutional because it expressly exempted the regional board from the constitutional state mandate subvention requirement.commission on state mandates,at.after concluding that the statute was unconstitutional id.at pp,the court of appeal found the trial court properly issued a writ of mandate directing the commission to review the test claims.id.at.as the court did not address the issue of mandates,or make any findings regarding the permit,county of los angeles commission on state mandates is not binding on this court.see boeken philip morris usa,cal th.
b.the maximum extent practicable standard 
the county argues that trial court erred in finding that the commission failed to consider the maximum extent practicable standard in making its ruling the county asserts the federal regulations are quite specific with respect to others,the regulations are more flexible and leave the design of the permit to the permittees.thus,according to the county,the general language of the regulations permits flexibility in designing programs however,when the regional board demands a specific activity,it removes that flexibility and creates a mandate.similarly,amicus csqa asserts that the federal regulations at issue are flexible and permit the local agencies to identify and propose the components of the program that they believe are appropriate for meeting the maximum extent practicable standard.here,the permit removed such flexibility because it included new specific terms and conditions not found in the prior permits,similar to the situation in long beach unified.amicus building industry asserts that the epa reserved veto power does not transform the regional board exercise of discretion into a federal mandate.
the department of finance counters that the commission analysis ignored the maximum extent practicable standard entirely.instead,the commission looked only to whether federal law specifically required certain individual measures to be in the permit.as a result,the commission analysis erroneously found that where the federal regulations imposed a flexible standard,any state action to implement the federal mandate is automatically converted into a state mandate.
federal mandates 
the subvention requirement of article xiii b,section is triggered if the legislature or any state agency mandates a new program or higher level of service.cal,art.xiii b.subvention is inapplicable where the additional costs on local governments are imposed by a federal mandate,the federal government.article xiii b,section,subdivision b,defines federally mandated appropriations as those required to comply with mandates of the courts or the federal government which,without discretion,require an expenditure for additional services or which unavoidably make the provision of existing services more costly.in,after the adoption of article xiii b,the legislature amended the statutory definition of costs mandated by the federal government to provide that such costs included costs resulting from enactment of a state law or regulation where failure to enact such law or regulation to meet specific federal program or service requirements would result in substantial monetary penalties or loss of funds to public or private persons in the state.city of sacramento,supra,cal d at,italics omitted.
as the case before us demonstrates,there is no precise rule or formula for determining whether a cost imposed on a local government or agency is a federal mandate.given the variety of cooperative programs,we here attempt no final test for mandatory versus optional compliance with federal law.a determination in each case must depend on such factors as the nature and purpose of the federal program whether its design suggests an intent to coerce when state local participation began the penalties,if any,assessed for withdrawal or refusal to participate or comply and any other legal and practical consequences of nonparticipation,noncompliance,or withdrawal.always,the courts and the commission must respect the governing principle of article xiii b,section b neither state nor local agencies may escape their spending limits when their participation in federal programs is truly voluntary.city of sacramento,supra,cal d at.
in hayes,supra,th,two county school superintendents sought reimbursement for costs incurred in connection with state special education programs enacted in and id.at pp.the counties asserted that the state statutes imposed special education requirements in excess of the federal rehabilitation act of and the subsequent education of the handicapped act.hayes,at pp.the board of control precursor to the commission determined that federal statutes were discretionary,and that the state statutes imposed costs in excess of the federal programs.id.at.hayes observed that i n order to gain state and local acceptance of its substantive provisions,the education of the handicapped act employs a cooperative federalism scheme,which has also been referred to as the carrot and stick approach.citations.as an incentive congress made substantial federal financial assistance available to states and local educational agencies that would agree to adhere to the substantive and procedural terms of the act.id.at.
finding that the education of the handicapped act imposed a federal mandate under city of sacramento,hayes recognized that while the education of the handicapped act included certain substantive and procedural requirements which must be included in a state plan for implementation of the act,it left primary responsibility for implementation to the state.in short,even though the state had no real choice in deciding whether to comply with the federal act,the act did not necessarily require the state to impose all of the costs of implementation upon local school districts.to the extent the state implemented the act by freely choosing to impose new programs or higher levels of service upon local school districts,the costs of such programs or higher levels of service are state mandated and subject to subvention.hayes,supra,th at.
in long beach unified,supra,d,the state issued an executive order adopting regulations providing guidelines for school districts to desegregate their schools.id.at.the long beach unified school district claimed the costs associated with the order were state mandates,even though the school district was under a federal constitutional obligation to desegregate.id.at.in spite of this federal constitutional mandate,long beach unified found a state mandate because the requirements of the executive order went beyond constitutional and case law requirements because while courts had suggested that certain steps and approaches may be helpful in complying with federal law,the executive order and guidelines required specific actions.for example,school districts are to conduct mandatory biennial racial and ethnic surveys,develop a reasonably feasible plan every four years to alleviate and prevent segregation,include certain specific elements in each plan,and take mandatory steps to involve the community,including public hearings which have been advertised in a specific manner.while these steps fit within the federal constitutional reasonably feasible standard of united states supreme court cases,the steps were no longer merely being suggested as options which the local school district may wish to consider but are required acts.these requirements constitute a higher level of service.id.at.
the maximum extent practicable standard 
title united states code section p b iii provides that permits for discharges from municipal storm sewers shall require controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable,including management practices,control techniques and system,design and engineering methods,and such other provisions as the administrator or the state determines appropriate for the control of such pollutants.
the evolution of this section,and the concept of maximum extent practicable,were discussed at length in building industry,supra,th,which observed that when congress first enacted the federal water pollution control act in,it relied primarily on state and local enforcement efforts to remedy water pollution problems.citations.however,by the early it became apparent that this reliance on local enforcement was ineffective and had resulted in the acceleration of environmental degradation of rivers,lakes,and streams citations.in response,in congress substantially amended the clean water act by mandating compliance with various minimum technological effluent standards established by the federal government and creating a comprehensive regulatory scheme to implement these laws.citation.the objective of this law was to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.building industry,supra,th at a.
as enacted in,the clean water act mandated that an npdes permit require compliance with state water quality standards and that this goal be met by setting forth a specific effluent limitation,which is a restriction on the amount of pollutants that may be discharged at the point source.shortly after the legislation,the epa promulgated regulations exempting most municipal storm sewers from the npdes permit requirements.however,the district of columbia circuit held a storm sewer is a point source and the epa did not have the authority to exempt categories of point sources from the clean water act npdes permit requirements.natural resources defense council,costle.costle rejected the epa argument that storm sewer regulation was administratively infeasible because of the variable nature of storm water pollution and the number of affected storm sewers throughout the country.although costle acknowledged the practical problems relating to storm sewer regulation,the court found the epa had the flexibility under the clean water act to design regulations that would overcome these problems.costle,at pp.
during the next years,the epa made numerous attempts to reconcile the statutory requirement of point source regulation with the practical problem of regulating possibly millions of diverse point source discharges of storm water.eventually,in,congress amended the clean water act to add provisions that specifically concerned npdes permit requirements for storm sewer discharges.p.in these amendments,enacted as part of the water quality act of,congress distinguished between industrial and municipal storm water discharges.with respect to municipal storm water discharges,congress clarified that the epa had the authority to fashion npdes permit requirements to meet water quality standards without specific numerical effluent limits and instead to impose controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable p b iii building industry,supra,th at.
building industry,supra,th observed that section p b iii statutory language and legislative history showed that congress added the npdes storm sewer requirements to strengthen the clean water act by making its mandate correspond to the practical realities of municipal storm sewer regulation.a lthough congress was reacting to the physical differences between municipal storm water runoff and other pollutant discharges that made the legislation blanket effluent limitations approach impractical and administratively burdensome,the primary point of the legislation was to address these administrative problems while giving the administrative bodies the tools to meet the fundamental goals of the clean water act in the context of stormwater pollution.citations.this legislative history supports that in identifying a maximum extent practicable standard congress did not intend to substantively bar the agency from imposing a more stringent water quality standard if the agency,based on its expertise and technical factual information and after the required administrative hearing procedure,found this standard to be a necessary and workable enforcement mechanism to achieving the goals of the clean water act.building industry,at.
building industry,supra,th concluded,the federal maximum extent practicable standard is not defined in the clean water act or applicable regulations t he maximum extent practicable standard is a highly flexible concept that depends on balancing numerous factors,including the particular control technical feasibility,cost,public acceptance,regulatory compliance,and effectiveness the maximum extent practicable standard is a term of art,and is not a phrase that can be interpreted solely by reference to its everyday or dictionary meaning.id.at.
the maximum extent practicable standard is necessarily flexible given the interplay between state and federal law and the unique issues presented by large municipal storm sewer systems.the clean water act uses two standards by which a discharger of water may be evaluated effluent limitations and water quality standards.arkansas oklahoma,supra,at.an effluent limitation is any restriction established by a state or the epa administrator on quantities,rates,and concentrations of chemical,physical,biological,and other constituents which are discharged from point sources into navigable waters.an effluent limitation guideline is determined in light of the best practicable control technology currently available.our children earth foundation cir,quoting b a.
on the other hand,standards are and are used as a supplementary basis for effluent limitations,so that numerous dischargers,despite their individual compliance with limitations,can be regulated to prevent water quality from falling below acceptable levels.pud of jefferson county,supra,at.standards are developed in a process.first,the epa,or state water authorities establish a waterway b eneficial use,subd.f natural resources defense council cir.once the beneficial use is determined,water quality criteria that will yield the desired water conditions are formulated and implemented.see natural resources defense council,at see also a,c a i.
unlike effluent limitations,which are promulgated by the epa to achieve a certain level of pollution reduction in light of available technology,standards emanate from the state boards charged with managing their domestic water resources.see arkansas oklahoma,supra,at.the epa gives the states guidance in drafting standards and state authorities periodically review water quality standards and secure the epa approval of any revisions in the standards.ibid.
finally,the maximum extent practicable standard is designed to require states to meet their clean water act obligations.in environmental defense center,cir environmental defense center,the ninth circuit considered a challenge to a phase ii epa rule for small municipal storm sewer systems.among other things,the phase ii rule allowed small municipal storm sewer systems to seek permission to discharge pollutants by submitting an individualized set of best management practices designed by each municipal storm sewer system stormwater management plans,either in the form of an individual permit application or in the form of a notice of intent noi to comply with a general permit.id.at.as long as an noi included a stormwater management plan,the epa deemed a municipal storm sewer system to be in compliance with the relevant standards of the clean water act,including the standard that municipal stormwater pollution be reduced to the maximum extent practicable.id.at p b iii.the phase ii rule did not require npdes authorities to review the stormwater management plans themselves.the ninth circuit held,however,that the failure to require permitting authority review of the stormwater management plans violated the clean water act.while the ninth circuit lauded the involvement of regulated parties in the development of individual stormwater pollution control programs,it emphasized that programs that are designed by regulated parties must,in every instance,be subject to meaningful review by an appropriate regulating entity to ensure that each such program reduces the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable,the relevant statutory standard.environmental defense center,at.the phase ii rule,by contrast,failed to require that the relevant permitting authorities review the stormwater management plans to ensure that the measures that any given operator of a small municipal storm sewer system has decided to undertake will in fact reduce discharges to the maximum extent practicable.id.at.accordingly,environmental defense center held the phase ii rule provided no safeguard against a municipal storm sewer system misunderstanding or misrepresenting its own stormwater situation and proposing a set of minimum measures for itself that would reduce discharges by far less than the maximum extent practicable.ibid.the ninth circuit concluded that the epa failure to require review of noi and the epa failure to make noi available to the public or subject to public hearings contravened the express requirements of the clean water act,and vacated those portions of the phase ii rule that addressed procedural issues relating to the issuance of noi under the small municipal storm sewer general permit option,and remanded to the epa to permit the epa to take appropriate action to comply with the clean water act.id.at.
balancing the standards of building industry,supra,th,we conclude the permit requirements for the trash receptacles and inspection of commercial,industrial,and construction sites as a matter of law constitute federal mandates.we do not disagree with the holdings of hayes,supra,th and long beach unified,supra,d that as a general proposition,where a state goes beyond a federal law and imposes additional requirements,a state mandate may exist to the extent federal law is exceeded.however,title united states code section p b iii is a unique statute and imposes a broad standard in recognition of developing clean water technology thus,mandate analysis is of limited utility in the area of clean water law precisely because the clean water act recognizes that the states function,for practical purposes,as arms of the epa in implementing the clean water act.thus,when a state implements the federal maximum extent practicable standard in an npdes permit,we can not say the state is acting in the traditional governmental role of a state rather,although the state provides the infrastructure necessary to meet clean water standards,it acts on behalf of the epa in doing so.
the epa oversight and veto control of the npdes program,and the clean water act goal of permitting each locality to fashion the appropriate measure to address pollution problems by applying evolving clean water technology,convince us that building industry,supra,th guides us in evaluating,for purposes of subvention analysis,what the state may put in its ndpes permit to meet the maximum extent practicable standard and what the federal government requires.the states and local agencies are required by their own unique waterway conditions to adopt requirements to alleviate pollution the federal regulations recognize that the federal government has a limited role in specifying what the specific measures must be.
administrative agency decisions come to court with a strong presumption of correctness based on evidence code section that official duty has been regularly performed.fukuda city of angels,supra,cal th at.obviously,considerable weight should be given to the findings of experienced administrative bodies made after a full and formal hearing,especially in cases involving technical and scientific evidence,quoting drummey state bd.of funeral directors cal d.inherent in a regional board determination is a recognition that the specific action requirements under the permit have been decided to be within the maximum extent practicable standard of the clean water act.however,this is not to say that any action requirement that might advance the objectives of the clean water act is automatically within the maximum extent practicable standard.
in reviewing whether particular mandates fall within the maximum extent practicable standard,with respect to the trash receptacle and inspection provisions at issue,we apply building industry,supra,th and balance numerous factors,including the particular requirement technical feasibility,cost,public acceptance,regulatory compliance,and effectiveness.id.at.trash receptacles are a simple method of keeping stormwater clean because they prevent trash and other debris from entering storm drains and entering the ocean and local rivers and drainage canals.inspections to insure that the commercial,industrial and construction sites likewise maintain careful practices to prevent stormwater from becoming contaminated is a first line of defense indeed,insuring compliance in these areas places some of the burden for maintaining clean water on private parties.as a result,those provisions further the state clean water act goal of reducing pollution to the maximum extent practicable and thus constitute federal mandates.however,given the flexibility and mutability of the maximum extent practicable standard,of necessity our decision is limited to the specific mandates addressed here.
the county argues that the regional board is empowered to enforce the provisions of the giasp and gcasp and to charge fees for inspections under water code section,subdivision d,and shifted this obligation to the county by including the inspection requirements in the permit.we disagree that the permit improperly shifted the inspection requirements of the giasp and gcasp.the county argument assumes without evidentiary or logical support that the inspection obligations in the giasp and gcasp are purely state mandates or a combination of federal and state mandates.we disagree the giasp and gcasp expressly and solely provide that they are issued to comply with the clean water act and epa regulations.thus,shifting the giasp and gcasp inspection obligations via the permit inspections could not constitute the shifting of a state mandate.
substantial evidence 
the county argues that the commission decision that the trash receptacle obligation was not a federal mandate was supported by substantial evidence,as was its finding that the inspection obligations were not federal mandates.we have concluded that the commission erred in the first instance in failing to consider the proper legal framework for analyzing the subvention question,the permit requirements are not state mandates as a matter of law,and thus do not reach the issue of whether substantial evidence supports its conclusions 
iii.preemption 
amicus building association argues that we should apply federal preemption analysis to the question and determine that federal law does not preempt state law therefore,the additional requirements,being creatures of state law and the regional board exercise of its own discretion,constitute state mandates because they exceed the prior permits.further,building association argues that the federal statutes and regulations constitute a federal directive to exercise unfettered state discretion thus,the proper question before the trial court was whether the regional board exceeded its state discretion when it determined the maximum extent practicable relative to the permits.as a result,no permit would exceed the maximum extent practicable because that maximum extent practicable is whatever the regional board divines it to be.the department of finance responds that federal preemption is not relevant where the issue to be decided is whether a federal or a state mandate exists.rather,the inquiry is on the scope of the requirements of federal law.
the supremacy clause of the united states constitution establishes a constitutional rule,makes federal law paramount,and vests congress with the power to preempt state law.viva internat.voice for animals adidas promotional retail operations,cal th.there is a presumption against federal preemption in those areas traditionally regulated by the states.id.at.therefore,w e start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.citations.ibid.there are four species of federal preemption express,conflict,obstacle,and field.id.at.
as our discussion of the federal mandate issue demonstrates,the permit,although issued by a state agency under enabling water code provisions,is a federal permit that implements federal law in the form of the maximum extent practicable standard.as a result,there is no california law that might be preempted,and federal preemption analysis is inapposite.
iv.removal of commission discretion remand 
the county contends the trial court erred in reversing the commission decision but even if the commission erred in its analysis of the test claims,the trial court should have remanded the matter for further proceedings to permit the commission to exercise its discretion properly.code civ,subd.f national auto.cas.ins.downey d.the department of finance contends remand is inappropriate because there is nothing for the commission to exercise its discretion over because its decision was based upon faulty legal conclusions.as we conclude that the trial court correctly applied the maximum extent practicable standard and found the permit requirements did not,as a matter of law,constitute unfunded state mandates because those requirements originated in the federal maximum extent practicable standard,remand to the commission is unnecessary.
