factual background and procedural history 
plaintiff owns the property at banyan street in hayward.in,the former owners started the process of subdividing a lot into three separate residential lots,one of which is plaintiff property.in that year,the county of alameda county accepted and approved tentative parcel map pertaining to the property under resolution.the resolution contains the following condition water services is sic to be provided to each lot and are to be connected to the district water system and installed at the expense of the subdivider in accordance with the requirements of said district and the approval by the director of public works.the resolution also provides,a letter from the district stating that it has agreed to provide water to each lot in the land division shall be submitted to the director of public works.
the former owners requested a letter from the district verifying water service was available for each lot.the district stated it would provide water service contingent upon compliance with its regulations.a water service assessment was prepared by the district on august.the document states this is not a proposal to provide water services.an approved parcel map approved map was thereafter recorded.the approved map provides the district a utility easement on the newly subdivided properties in the form of a water main extension from banyan street to provide water to each lot plaintiff purchased one of the three lots at foreclosure in september.the property did not have water service at the time of purchase.
thereafter,plaintiff applied to the district for water service.the district provided a water service estimate for the installation of the service connection based on a foot water main extension that extends feet onto plaintiff property.the district required a foot long easement beyond plaintiff original lot line to allow the installation and maintenance of the pipeline and blowoff assembly plaintiff deemed the proposal unacceptable,in part because the district sought to impose the easement on his property.the district refused to provide service based on alterations requested by plaintiff because his layout would have made it impossible to reach his meter from the proposed water main at a right angle 
on october,plaintiff filed a second amended petition for writ of mandate and,in the alternative,a second amended complaint sac,which is the operative complaint in this appeal.by his petition for writ of mandate under code of civil procedure section,he sought a directive to compel the district to provide water service to plaintiff consistent with the laws and regulations pertaining to same.the remaining causes of action in the sac state claims for unfair business practice,injunctive relief,declaratory relief,and property damage.
on october,plaintiff filed a motion to bifurcate the writ of mandate cause of action and stay the remainder of the action.
on december,the trial court granted plaintiff motion to bifurcate his complaint,staying all causes of action except the petition for writ of mandate.
on january,the district filed its answer to the petition.
on april,plaintiff filed his opening brief.in it,he asserted the subdivision map act,et sma provided him with vested rights precluding the district from obtaining any easements it had not acquired prior to the county approval of the parcel map for his property the district failed to abide by the county subdivision ordinance requiring the district to review the tentative parcel map and obtain any necessary easements prior to the county approval of the final parcel map adherence to the district principal frontage requirements was unnecessary under the district own regulations and the district requirement of an easement on his property was an abuse of discretion.in support of his opening brief,plaintiff sought to augment the administrative record with numerous new documents attached to his own declaration and a request for judicial notice.
on may,the district filed its opposition.the district also filed supporting declarations,objections to plaintiff declaration and his attached evidentiary documents,and a request for judicial notice of relevant provisions of the county subdivision ordinance.
on august,the trial court issued its order denying the petition for writ of mandate.the court found the district had not abused its discretion under either the sma,the county codes and regulations,or its own regulations with respect to its proposed placement of water service on plaintiff property.the court sustained the bulk of the district evidentiary objections,and overruled all but two of plaintiff objections to district evidence.
on october,the district filed a demurrer to the remaining causes of action.
on november,the trial court filed its order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend.
on december,the trial court entered a judgment of dismissal.this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
in reviewing the trial court ruling on a writ of mandate,the appellate court is ordinarily confined to an inquiry as to whether the findings and judgment of the trial court are supported by substantial,credible and competent evidence.this limitation,however,does not apply to resolution of questions of law where the facts are undisputed.in such cases,as in other instances involving matters of law,the appellate court is not bound by the trial court decision,but may make its own determination.statutory construction is such a question of law for the courts.evans unemployment ins.appeals bd.cal d.
ii.the subdivision map act 
general provisions 
the sma empowers a local agency,a city,county or city and county to regulate and control the design and improvement of subdivisions.citations.a subdivision is broadly defined to include virtually any division of land for the present or future purpose of sale,lease,or financing.citation.golden state homebuilding associates city of modesto th,golden state.
ordinarily,subdivision under the sma may be lawfully accomplished only by obtaining local approval and recordation of a tentative and final map pursuant to section,when five or more parcels are involved,or a parcel map pursuant to section when four or fewer parcels are involved.citation.a local agency will approve a tentative and final map or a parcel map only after extensive review of the proposed subdivision and consideration of such matters as the property suitability for development,the adequacy of roads,sewer,drainage,and other services,the preservation of agricultural lands and sensitive natural resources,and dedication issues.citations.gardner county of sonoma cal th.
the initial operative document in the regulatory process is a tentative map.its contents are largely governed by local ordinance but must set out the design of the proposed subdivision and the existing conditions in and around it.citation.when a tentative map is filed,the local agency is required to act on it within the period specified by the sma by approving,conditionally approving,or denying it.citations.to be approved,the tentative map must,among other things,be consistent with the local general plan or an existing specific plan.citations.golden state,supra,th at.approval of the vesting tentative map entitles the developer,subject to certain limitations,to proceed with the project in substantial compliance with the ordinances,policies,and standards in effect when the map application was deemed complete.citation.kaufman broad central valley,city of modesto th,kaufman.
b.the district is not subject t o t he sma vesting provisions 
plaintiff asserts the district can not acquire an easement or obtain county approval of its proposed service plan because the county is prohibited from reopening an approved final map.the district asserts its sole duty under the sma is limited to a review of the available water supply,a duty that does not apply to subdivisions the size of the lot at issue here.the district also asserts it is not subject to any vesting rights plaintiff may have acquired because the district is not a local agency subject to vesting rights under the sma.the trial court found that neither the sma nor the county subdivision ordinance imposed a duty on the district to have acquired a pipeline easement during the parcel map review process.
on appeal,plaintiff does not contend the district is a local agency.instead he asserts the county,which is a local agency,is prevented from granting the district an additional easement.he further claims the district is at the very least subject to the same constraints as a local agency under the sma,and is not entitled to unlimited,unregulated demands for easements from residential property owners.the authorities he relies on are not persuasive.
the relevant statutes are clearly intended to apply to a local agency only.section provides local agency means a city,county or city and county.local agencies are limited in terms of their ability to require changes after a final map has been approved.section provides,in part a fter a final map or parcel map is filed in the office of the county recorder,the recorded final map may be modified by a certificate of correction or an amending map,if authorized by local ordinance,if the local agency finds that there are changes in circumstances that make any or all of the conditions of the map no longer appropriate or necessary and that the modifications do not impose any additional burden on the fee owners of the real property,and if the modifications do not alter any right,title,or interest in the real property reflected on the recorded map italics added.
additionally,section,subdivision b,provides in relevant part when a local agency approves or conditionally approves a vesting tentative map,that approval shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances,policies,and standards described in section section,subdivision b,provides that the purpose underlying the vesting tentative map statutes is t o ensure that local requirements governing the development of a proposed subdivision are established in accordance with section when a local agency approves or conditionally approves a vesting tentative map.the private sector should be able to rely upon an approved vesting tentative map prior to expending resources and incurring liabilities without the risk of having the project frustrated by subsequent action by the approving local agency,provided the time periods established by this article have not elapsed.italics added.
relying on bright development city of tracy th bright development,plaintiff claims the district must be subject to the dictates and restraints contained in the sma if a property owner is ever to obtain vested rights in the subdivision.in that case,the city of tracy required a developer to place utilities underground based on construction standards that did not exist when the vesting tentative map was approved.the developer challenged that requirement.the appellate court agreed with the developer,noting that when the developer application was complete the city of tracy had an unwritten policy that developers should place utilities underground however,there was no written rule or statute that required them to do so.the court held an ordinance,policy or standard which is written and accessible is reasonably calculated to apprise interested parties of their responsibilities and would suffice to supply constructive notice.bright development,at.
plaintiff also cites to kaufman,supra,th,in which the city of modesto had compelled the plaintiff to pay higher developer fees than those required at the time his predecessor had applied for a vesting tentative subdivision map.the plaintiff paid the fees under protest and brought an action seeking reimbursement of fees paid in excess of the rate in effect when the vesting tentative subdivision map was deemed complete.id.at.the kaufman court concluded we interpret section to apply this general notice requirement to a local agency seeking to pass along a fee increase imposed after a developer rights have vested.that is,the ordinances,policies,and standards in effect when the developer vesting tentative map is deemed complete,must include not only a general fee escalation provision but must also provide reasonable notice of the nature of the fee and the manner of its calculation.a developer about to commit substantial time and resources to a project should be able to predict with at least some degree of assurance what the fee will be when the time comes to pay it.th at,italics added.
after reviewing the ordinances in question,the kaufman court found that although the city fee policy contemplated future fee increases,it did not foretell the comprehensive reevaluation of the fee structure which the city was later to conduct.in fact,the policy suggested the increases would be limited to relatively modest and predictable cost of building adjustments.kaufman,supra,th at.the court concluded the critical point in the process for a developer to have actual or constructive notice of future fee increases is the date on which the map application is complete.id.at.
in the present case,during the approval process for the parcel map the district was not asked to,and did not,create or impose conditions or requirements on the developer.nor did it have any authority over the map approval process.rather,it was the county that acted as the local agency under the sma and approved parcel map through resolution.in other words,neither bright development nor kaufman apply to the situation in this case.because the district is not a local agency subject to the vesting rights restrictions of the sma,the cases plaintiff relies on are inapposite.a case is not authority for issues it does not consider.contra costa water dist.bar c properties th.
we also disagree with plaintiff theory that the district waived its right to seek an easement by not asserting it at the time it issued the water service assessment letter.the only provision in the sma that applies to a public water agency is section.section generally requires a city or county,before approving a subdivision map for a residential development of more than units,to obtain from the applicable public water system a written verification that adequate water supplies will be available for that project as well as other existing and planned future uses for a projected year period.cherry valley pass acres neighbors city of beaumont th.there are no provisions in the sma requiring a water agency to agree to serve water to individual customers like plaintiff here or to acquire an easement from property owners for the purposes of providing water service.rather,the sma expressly states that n othing in this section shall be construed to create a right or entitlement to water service or any specific level of water service,subd.m.the district was under no duty to acquire an easement on the property at the time the parcel map was reviewed and approved 
finally,it is unclear that the sma bars the proposed easement,even from the perspective of the county.as to water service,the county only required the former property owner to obtain a will serve letter from the district.condition of resolution expressly mandated that the developer was to provide water service to each subdivided lot in accordance with the district requirements.the district water service assessment submitted in connection with the former owner development plan clearly indicated the assessment was not a plan for water service.thus,even if the sma applies to the county,it does not appear the original developer obtained a vested right to have water service installed on the subject prop
