water rights tribal rights 
the panel affirmed the district court partial summary judgment in favor of the agua caliente band of cahuilla indians and the united states,which declared that the united states impliedly reserved appurtenant water sources,including groundwater,when it created the tribe reservation in california arid coachella valley.
the tribe filed this action for declaratory and injunctive relief against water agencies,and the parties stipulated to divide the litigation into three phases.phase i,at issue in this interlocutory appeal,addressed whether the tribe has a reserved right to groundwater.
under the doctrine in winters united states,federal reserved water rights are directly applicable to indian reservations.
the panel held that the winters doctrine does not distinguish between surface water and groundwater.the panel held that the united states,in establishing the agua caliente reservation,impliedly reserved water.the panel further held that because the united states intended to reserve water when it established a home for the agua caliente band of cahuilla indians,the district court did not err in determining that the government reserved appurtenant water sources including groundwater when it created the tribe reservation in the coachella valley.the panel also held that the creation of the agua caliente reservation carried with it an implied right to use water from the coachella valley aquifer.
the panel rejected the water agencies arguments concerning the contours of the tribe reserved water rights.the panel held that state water rights are preempted by federal reserved rights.the panel also held that the fact that the tribe did not historically access groundwater did not destroy its right to groundwater now.finally,the panel held that the tribe entitlement to state water did not affect the analysis with respect to the creation of the tribe federally reserved water right.

the coachella valley water district cvwd and the desert water agency dwa collectively,the water agencies bring an interlocutory appeal of the district court grant of partial summary judgment in favor of the agua caliente band of cahuilla indians the tribe and the united states.the judgment declares that the united states impliedly reserved appurtenant water sources,including groundwater,when it created the tribe reservation in california arid coachella valley.we agree.in affirming,we recognize that there is no controlling federal appellate authority addressing whether the reserved rights doctrine applies to groundwater.however,because we conclude that it does,we hold that the tribe has a reserved right to groundwater underlying its reservation as a result of the purpose for which the reservation was established.
the agua caliente band of cahuilla indians has lived in the coachella valley since before california entered statehood in.the bulk of the agua caliente reservation was formally established by two presidential executive orders issued in and,and the united states,pursuant to statute,now holds the remaining lands of the reservation in trust for the tribe.the reservation consists of approximately acres interspersed in a checkerboard pattern amidst several cities within riverside county,including palm springs,cathedral city,and rancho mirage.see agua caliente band of mission indians riverside county,cir.
the executive orders establishing the reservation are short in length,but broad in purpose.in,president ulysses grant ordered certain lands withdrawn from sale and set apart as reservations for the permanent use and occupancy of the mission indians in southern california.exec.order of may.similarly,president rutherford hayes order set aside additional lands for indian purposes.exec.order of.these orders followed on the heels of detailed government reports from indian agents,which identified the urgent need to reserve land for indian use in an attempt to encourage tribal members to build comfortable houses,improve their acres,and surround themselves with home comforts.comm r of indian,ann.in short,the united states sought to protect the tribe and secure the mission indians permanent homes,with land and water enough.comm r of indian,ann.
establishing a sustainable home in the coachella valley is no easy feat,however,as water in this arid southwestern desert is scarce.rainfall totals average three to six inches per year,and the whitewater river system the valley only real source of surface water produces an average annual supply of water that fluctuates between and,most of which occurs in the winter months see cvwd,engineer report on water supply and replenishment assessment at cvwd,urban water management plan at.in other words,surface water is virtually nonexistent in the valley for the majority of the year.therefore,almost all of the water consumed in the region comes from the aquifer underlying the valley the coachella valley groundwater basin 
the coachella valley groundwater basin supports cities,people,and acres of farmland.see,the state of the coachella valley aquifer at.given the demands on the basin supply,it is not surprising that water levels in the aquifer have been declining at a steady rate.since the,the aquifer has been in a state of overdraft which exists despite major efforts to recharge the basin with water delivered from the california water project and the colorado river.in total,groundwater pumping has resulted in an average annual recharge deficit of,with cumulative overdraft estimated at million as of.
the tribe does not currently pump groundwater on its reservation.rather,it purchases groundwater from appellant water agencies.the tribe also receives surface water from the whitewater river system,particularly the andreas and tahquitz creeks that sometimes flow nearby.the surface water received from this system is consistent with a california superior court adjudication the whitewater river decree which attempted to address water rights for users of the river system.because the united states held the lands in trust,it participated in the adjudication via a suggestion on behalf of the tribe and the resulting state court order included a water allotment for the tribe benefit the amount of water reserved for the tribe from this adjudication,however,is minimal,providing enough water to irrigate approximately acres.further,most of this allotment is filled outside of the growing season because the river system flow peaks between december and march.thus,groundwater supplied by the water agencies remains the main source of water for all types of consumption on the reservation throughout the year.
given an concern over diminishing groundwater resources,the agua caliente tribe filed this action for declaratory and injunctive relief against the water agencies in may.the tribe complaint requested a declaration that it has a federally reserved right and an aboriginal right to the groundwater underlying the reservation.in june,the district court granted the united states motion to intervene as a plaintiff.the united states also alleges that the tribe has a reserved right to groundwater.
the parties stipulated to divide the litigation into three phases.phase i,at issue here,seeks to address whether the tribe has a reserved right and an aboriginal right to groundwater.according to the parties stipulation,phase ii will address whether the tribe beneficially owns the pore space of the groundwater basin underlying the agua caliente reservation and whether a tribal right to groundwater includes the right to receive water of a certain quality.finally,phase iii will attempt to quantify any identified groundwater rights.
in march,the district court granted in part and denied in part plaintiffs and defendants cross motions for partial summary judgment with respect to phase i of the litigation.in its order,the district court held that the reserved rights doctrine applies to groundwater and that the united states reserved appurtenant groundwater when it established the tribe reservation the district court then certified its order for interlocutory appeal pursuant to b,and we granted the water agencies petition for permission to prosecute this appeal.
the district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.tohono nation city of glendale,cir.lopez smith,cir.en banc.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.a anderson liberty lobby.a court shall grant summary judgment when,under the governing law,there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict.anderson,at.
due to the unusual trifurcation of this litigation,we are concerned on appeal only with phase i whether the tribe has a federal reserved right to the groundwater underlying its reservation.this question,however,is best analyzed in three steps whether the united states intended to reserve water when it created the tribe reservation whether the reserved rights doctrine encompasses groundwater and,finally,whether the tribe correlative rights under state law or the historic lack of drilling for groundwater on the reservation,or the water the tribe receives pursuant to the whitewater river decree,impacts our answers to these questions.we address each in turn.
for over one hundred years,the supreme court has made clear that when the united states withdraws its land from the public domain and reserves it for a federal purpose,the government,by implication,reserves appurtenant water then unappropriated to the extent needed to accomplish the purpose of the reservation.cappaert united states,citing const.art.i,const.art.iv,see also winters united states,colville confederated tribes walton,cir.
in what has become known as the winters doctrine,federal reserved water rights are directly applicable to indian reservations and other federal enclaves,encompassing water rights in navigable and nonnavigable streams.see cappaert,at.the creation of these rights stems from the belief that the united states,when establishing reservations,intended to deal fairly with the indians by reserving for them the waters without which their lands would have been useless.arizona california,see also id.at it is impossible to believe that when congress created the great colorado river indian reservation and when the executive department of this nation created the other reservations they were unaware that most of the lands were of the desert kind hot,scorching sands and that water from the river would be essential to the life of the indian people and to the animals they hunted and the crops they raised.
despite the longstanding recognition that indian reservations,as well as other reserved lands,require access to water,the winters doctrine only applies in certain situations it only reserves water to the extent it is necessary to accomplish the purpose of the reservation,and it only reserves water if it is appurtenant to the withdrawn land.winters,at cappaert,at.once established,however,winters rights vest on the date of the reservation and are superior to the rights of future appropriators.cappaert,at.
given the limitations in the winters doctrine,we must first decide whether the united states,in establishing the agua caliente reservation,impliedly reserved water.see united states new mexico.we conclude that it did.and although the parties and the district court focused on the application of the winters doctrine to groundwater specifically,their argument over the creation of a federal reserved right and,in particular,the relevance of new mexico to that question depends on whether the agua caliente reservation carried with it a reserved right to water generally.whether the tribe reserved right extends to the groundwater underlying its reservation is a separate question from whether the establishment of the reservation contained an implicit right to use water.
in new mexico,the supreme court emphasized that,under the reserved rights doctrine,the government reserves only that amount of water necessary to fulfill the purpose of the reservation,no more.id.quoting cappaert,at.where water is only valuable for a secondary use of the reservation,the united states must acquire water in the same manner as any other public or private appropriator.id.at.in other words,new mexico established a use distinction.water is impliedly reserved for primary purposes.it is not,however,reserved for secondary purposes 
the water agencies argue that new mexico requires us when deciding if a reserved right exists at all to determine whether water is necessary to fulfill the primary purpose of the agua caliente reservation.if it is not,they argue,then we are to conclude that congress did not intend any water to be impliedly reserved under a federal water right.put differently,the water agencies argue that new mexico stands for the proposition that water is impliedly reserved only if other sources of water then available can not meet the reservation water demands.according to the water agencies,if other sources of water exist and the lack of a federal right would not entirely defeat the purpose of the reservation then congress intended to defer to state water law and require the united states to obtain water rights like any other private user.
new mexico,however,is not so narrow.congress does not defer to state water law with respect to reserved rights.id.at.instead,congress retains its authority to reserve unappropriated water for use on appurtenant lands withdrawn from the public domain for specific federal purposes.id.at.
the federal purpose for which land was reserved is the driving force behind the reserved rights doctrine.each time the court has applied the,it has carefully examined both the asserted water right and the specific purposes for which the land was reserved,and concluded that without the water the purposes of the reservation would be entirely defeated.id.at.but the question is not whether water stemming from a federal right is necessary at some selected point in time to maintain the reservation the question is whether the purpose underlying the reservation envisions water use.
winters itself established that the purpose of the reservation is controlling.in winters,the supreme court addressed whether the federal government reserved water for tribal usage at the fort belknap indian reservation,which had been reserved by the united states as and for a permanent home for several tribes.at.the winters court observed that the arid tribal reservation would be practically valueless,and that a civilized community could not be established thereon,without irrigation.id.at.thus,the court held that,in creating the reservation,the united states simultaneously reserved water for a use which would be necessarily continued through years.id.at.the reserved right turned on the purpose underlying the formation of the fort belknap reservation.
though it was decided seventy years after winters,new mexico remains faithful to this construction.in analyzing the reserved rights doctrine,the court first sought to determine congress intent in creating the gila national forest.new mexico,at.after reviewing the congressional act that established the forest,the court determined that congress intended only two purposes to conserve the water flows,and to furnish a continuous supply of timber for the people.id.at citation omitted.it did not,however,reserve the forest lands for aesthetic,environmental,recreational,or purposes.id.at.thus,the court deemed the latter uses secondary,for which the reserved right did not attach,and held that only to fulfill the very purposes for which a federal reservation was created did the united states intend to reserve the necessary water.id.at.
as such,new mexico use distinction did not alter the test envisioned by winters.rather,it added an important inquiry related to the question of how much water is reserved.it also answered that question by holding that water is reserved only for primary purposes,those directly associated with the reservation of land.it did not,however,eliminate the threshold issue that a reserved right exists if the purposes underlying a reservation envision access to water.
because new mexico holds that water is rese
