the united states court of federal claims determined that the army corps of engineers corps took the property of helen cooley,william cooley,and the company collectively,cooley by denying a fill permit application under of the clean water act.cooley united states,fed.cl.because the corps denial of the permit application was a final decision rendering cooley taking claim ripe,and because this record does not show whether the government later issuance of a provisional permit rendered the taking temporary,this court,and remands.
in,cooley purchased a acre parcel of land at the highway and hansen boulevard interchange in coon rapids,minnesota,intending to eventually develop a commercial project including hotels,a car wash,restaurants,and other commercial buildings.in,cooley began developing the property and securing permits for the development.in february,the corps asserted that most of the site comprised wetlands and,thus,required a permit under the clean water act before any development could occur.cooley spent the next three years prosecuting an application for a wetlands fill permit under.
to acquire a fill permit under,federal regulations require an applicant to rebut a presumption that commercially feasible,less environmentally damaging alternative sites are available,or that commercially feasible minimization of the development scope will prevent damage to the wetlands.thus,during prosecution of its permit application,cooley submitted four alternative sites and explained that each of the four sites was an inadequate alternative as either developed or undevelopable already developed for commercial use zoned for residential use almost entirely wetland or too far north of the area mall to meet the project purpose.the corps found this information insufficient,and required cooley to submit information for more alternative sites within an expanded geographic area.the corps did not specify the limits of the expanded geographic area,but referred generally to the highway corridor.cooley responded to this request for additional alternative sites by referring to its previous submission discussing the four inadequate sites.
on february,the corps denied cooley application for a fill permit to develop the property.the official denial letter,signed by richard craig,district engineer of the corps paul district office,stated i must deny your request i would suggest that if you still desire to develop the property,you may wish to substantiate more thoroughly your contentions that feasible,less alternative sites are not available and that minimization is not practicable.several weeks before issuing the denial letter,however,tim fell of the regulatory functions branch for the corps paul district office recommended that the corps proceed with the decision based on the available information and not hold a meeting to permit cooley to submit additional information.later,on february,fell wrote in an internal memorandum i think cooley has provided enough information so we ca deny based on failure to provide adequate info by denying the permit,the corps prohibited any commercial development on cooley property,resulting in a loss of at least of the land value.
upon denial of its fill permit application,in july,cooley filed in the court of federal claims an action for just compensation for the government taking of its property.in response,the corps counsel suggested to the corps that some type of permit could be issued as a way to avoid the takings issue.after litigation had commenced,on december,ben wopat,regulatory functions branch chief for the corps paul district office,sent cooley a letter suggesting that the corps might be willing to issue a permit for a narrower scope project.cooley counsel responded that the corps had already denied the permit,but that cooley would consider settlement of the case if the corps granted the previously denied permit.the corps did not respond to this offer.
nonetheless,in,during the litigation,the corps,sua sponte,performed its own alternatives analysis concerning cooley site.in april,the corps issued a reduced scope permit that it believed would allow cooley reasonable use of the land.cooley rejected this partial permit.although wopat doubted he could lawfully issue a permit of broader scope,both corps headquarters and the department of justice urged issuance of a permit,apparently to avoid a trial.thus,on july,ten days before the commencement of trial and on the same day the government filed its brief,the corps issued a permit that ostensibly allowed cooley to develop the entire property.the corps issued this permit subject to cooley developing and submitting a mitigation plan capable of receiving corps approval.the permit stated provisional permit not valid do not begin work.the permit contained three additional conditions cooley must obtain a water quality certification from the minnesota pollution control agency cooley must sign and return the provisional permit with a fee and the corps would need to sign the permit and return it to cooley.before issuance of this provisional permit,the corps assistant chief counsel,lance wood,had opined that the property consisted of degraded wetlands.
cooley rejected the july provisional permit and continued litigation.cooley doubted the validity of the provisional permit.furthermore,many hotel and restaurant merchants had already begun to develop other projects in the same region between and.cooley was,therefore,concerned that the window of economic success for the proposed commercial development had closed.moreover,cooley had already invested several hundred thousand dollars in litigation costs.
in a thorough and careful opinion dated april,the court of federal claims held that the corps denial of the permit was a final decision,rendering cooley taking claim ripe.further,the court found that the denial was a permanent categorical taking of cooley property,and,thus,awarded cooley approximately million in damages.the corps timely appealed to this court,which has exclusive appellate jurisdiction.a.

the corps asserts that cooley taking claim is not ripe because its permit denial was not a final decision.to the contrary,the record shows an unconditional denial issued in february.at that point,the corps representative wrote i must deny the request.the denial effectively prohibited any commercial development on cooley site,resulting in a loss of at least of the land value.cooley thus essentially lost all economically beneficial use of the land,despite having secured all other necessary permits.
just before the corps issued that denial,fell had determined that the corps had received adequate information from cooley to deny the permit on the merits.see supra part i.fell felt that a meeting to allow cooley to provide additional information was unnecessary.the corps denial letter also stated that a permit would be contrary to the public interest and would result in unacceptable degradation of a valuable wetland resource.a thorough,fifteen page,evaluation and decision document accompanied the denial letter and explained the merits of the decision.the evaluation and decision document rejected,among other things,cooley contention that the wetlands were degraded.cooley did not appeal the action because the corps had no administrative appeal mechanism under its regulations at that time.because the corps denied cooley application for a permit based on what it considered adequate information,and because no corps regulation permitted an administrative appeal,the denial was a final decision.thus,the taking claim was ripe.
even if,arguendo,the denial did not constitute a final decision,it would have been futile for cooley to pursue further prosecution of the permit application.a landowner need not resort to futile piecemeal litigation or submit to repetitive application requirements to make a taking claim ripe.macdonald,sommer frates,at.after a final decision,an applicant need not submit further applications.rather,the applicant may choose to file a taking claim before the court of federal claims.see bayou,at.submitting a new application is futile when unchanging facts and applicable law preclude a permit.id.at.
in the present case,the corps denied the permit in the public interest to avoid damage to valuable wetland resources.in forming its litigation strategy,members of the corps doubted whether the corps could issue legally valid permits after the denial.nevertheless,the corps ignored its previous findings and analysis and issued the permits based on lance wood opinion that the property consisted of degraded wetlands.
wood was the corps assistant chief counsel for regulation.unlike the corps engineers involved in the original evaluation of whether the land was wetland in,wood never visited the site in forming his opinion.wood opinion was inconsistent with the corps denial letter,initial evaluation,and the evaluation and decision document.wood opinion did not change the facts explained in the corps thorough evaluation and decision document that the site was almost entirely a valuable wetland resource and that development on the site would be contrary to public interest.
from february until a couple of years into litigation,the corps did nothing to promote the issuance of cooley permit.as the trial date approached,however,the corps sought to alter its analysis and issue new permits.despite a federal regulation denying the corps a role as either a proponent or opponent of any permit proposal,a,the corps contacted and convinced the minnesota pollution control agency to waive cooley application for a water quality certification.
the court of federal claims held the corps was not authorized by its own regulations from issuing a permit after a denial on the merits.cooley.at.as discussed above,corps regulations at the time did not permit reconsideration of a denial.the court of federal claims found that a rendered the denial a final decision on the merits that could not be appealed to the corps when the signature of the issuing official is placed on the denial letter.id.at.
this court,as did its predecessor,acknowledges an agency prerogative to reconsider its own decisions.united states sioux tribe.in this case,however,as this opinion shall discuss more fully later,the corps did not offer to rescind the taking and unconditionally grant a valid,actionable permit.instead,the corps offered a provisional permit.because the corps regulations offered no process to change a final decision,and because the factual inconsistencies surrounding the permit denial could not be changed with additional documentation,the court of federal claims correctly held that further pursuit of a process already years old was futile.
the corps draws this court attention to the few lines in the denial letter that extended an invitation to cooley to submit more information if it wished to continue to pursue a permit.that courteous,but ineffectual,invitation did not alter the finality of the denial or the ripeness of cooley taking claim in the court of federal claims.without any specific indication of the nature and extent of additional information necessary to acquire a permit,this passing polite remark could not alter the finality of the denial.indeed,this general invitation to begin again a process that had yielded a final denial complete with extensive reasoning supporting the negative decision underscored the futility of continuing indefinitely to prosecute the application process.macdonald,sommer frates,at.bayou,at.
because unchangeable facts and existing regulations indicated the corps was precluded from granting approval after the denial,it would have been futile for cooley to continue prosecution of its application.in sum,the court of federal claims correctly held that cooley taking claim was ripe for adjudication.

in the present case,the court of federal claims determined that the permit denial destroyed at least of cooley property value.cooley.at.as a result of that denial,cooley could no longer develop its property.id.hence,the court concluded that the corps denied cooley essentially all economically viable use of its land,and that under lucas,a permanent categorical taking occurred.id.
the corps argues that its subsequent issuance of partial and full permits in made the taking,if a taking at all,only temporary.although the corps had no procedure giving an applicant an avenue to seek reconsideration of a final denial,the corps contends that it,nonetheless,possessed the authority on its own to revisit a denial.in the corps view,nothing in the statute or regulations forbade it from reconsidering its denial in on the cusp of litigation.
the court of federal claims disagreed,noting the regulations have not changed,and the agency interpretation of its regulations is not tenable as well as tied to its litigating position in only this case.cooley.at.indeed,the corps concedes that its regulations contained no provision to rescind its taking.the trial court stated that the corps only revisited its denial by issuing an invalid provisional permit as a litigation strategy,not as an effort to immediately rescind the taking.the provisional permit was conditioned on the performance of compensatory mitigation,but the corps never negotiated a mitigation plan with cooley.the corps acknowledged that no specific mitigation site or plan is directed by the permit.thus,the nature and extent of the requisite compensatory mitigation could not be ascertained from the provisional permit.as aforementioned,the permit carried the express label not valid do not begin work.the trial court found that these various conditions and legal uncertainties that accompanied the expressly provisional permit gave cooley ample reason to refuse to rely on this provisional permit,as issued,to undertake development.this record,however,does not support the trial court finding of a categorical taking,and therefore,this aspect of the trial court decree is vacated for reasons articulated below.
contrary to the trial court holding,the record shows that the denial apparently destroyed less t
