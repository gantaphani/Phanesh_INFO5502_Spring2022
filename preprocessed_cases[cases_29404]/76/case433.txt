friends of the santa clara river and the sierra club appeal from the denial of their petition for writ of mandate alleging an urban water management plan for parts of the santa clarita valley was adopted in violation of the urban water management planning act uwmp act,water code section et among the many grounds for reversal asserted is the failure of the urban water management plan to assess the reliability of the water supply obtained from two layers of an aquifer contaminated with perchlorate.
certain aspects of the urban water management plan concerning the effects of perchlorate contamination on the groundwater supply can be summarized as follows.if there is a dry stretch,the districts plan to take more water from the saugus formation.if the perchlorate contamination impairs the supply of water taken from the saugus formation in dry years,the districts plan to restore full production capacity by treating the contaminated water.while the treatment facilities are being built,the districts have no plan to cover the reduction in water available from the saugus formation.
thus,the plan description of the perchlorate contamination and the method for addressing that contamination is flawed because it fails to address the time needed to implement the available method for treating the contaminated water and describe the reliability of the groundwater supply during that implementation period.as this gap in the reliability analysis is sufficient for reversal,we do not address the other challenges to the adoption of the plan

defendants jointly caused the preparation of the urban water management plan uwmp under the uwmp act to cover the service area of clwa.
ii.sources of water for the santa clarita valley 
historically,the santa clarita valley obtained its water supply from an underground water basin,or aquifer,that is about square miles and is divided into an upper and lower level.the shallow level,called the alluvial aquifer,underlies the santa clara river and its tributaries.water from this layer is obtained from wells up to feet deep.beneath the alluvial aquifer is a deeper layer of groundwater called the saugus formation.water from the saugus formation is pumped from wells extending to approximately feet in depth.
based on historical production,the uwmp estimates the alluvial aquifer will supply to per year in normal weather years and to per year in dry years,and the saugus formation will supply to per year in normal weather years and to per year in dry years.at the time the uwmp was adopted,groundwater from the aquifer accounted for approximately percent of the water supplied in the clwa service area.
since,imported water from the swp has supplemented local supplies to meet community water requirements.clwa owns three entitlements to water from the swp that total per year in,clwa entered into a contract with the swp for of water per year.in the,clwa purchased an entitlement to per year of swp water from a kern county water district.in,clwa acquired an entitlement to per year of swp water from the kern county water agency and its member district,wheeler water storage district 
iii.proposal and adoption of the uwmp 
on wednesday,november,defendants released a draft of the uwmp to the public for review and comment.clwa indicated that public comments would be accepted only if received by it by,december.
the general manager of the united water conservation district sent a comment letter that expressed concerns about the way the uwmp draft presented existing and future water supplies,reliance on groundwater banking projects that were unavailable to clwa or years away from operation,and the uncertainty of how the saugus formation will react to the higher levels of pumping proposed.in particular,the letter states 
in the legislation concerning urban water management plans,agencies are asked to consider existing and future sources of water.this is particularly useful to those using the plan,since supply shortfalls can be recognized and future projects can be identified to supplement the existing sources of water.our largest concern is that the draft of the plan tends to combine existing sources with future potential sources so that it is difficult to establish where you are now and where you need to go.thus,it is difficult to determine the present state of the supply and the timing of need for specific future projects.an example,which we will explain in more detail below,is the listing of various storage projects as part of the year water supply,figure.this approach implies that these projects are needed now they are not and that they could supply water to clwa now they can not.
on december,defendants conducted a joint public hearing concerning the uwmp.on december,the boards of the defendant water agencies held a joint meeting and approved the uwmp.clwa submitted the uwmp to the california department of water resources,and the submission was completed on february.
iv.lawsuit 
on april,plaintiffs filed a verified petition for writ of mandate challenging defendants approval of the uwmp based on alleged violations of the uwmp act and the public trust doctrine.the county of ventura also filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging defendants approval of the uwmp.the two petitions were consolidated into a single case and transferred to the kern superior court.
plaintiffs cause of action based on the public trust doctrine was dismissed without leave to amend as a result of demurrers filed by defendants.plaintiffs cause of action based on violations of the uwmp act was heard on the merits by the superior court on january,and february.
on april,the superior court filed an order and findings statement of decision in which it denied the petitions for writ of mandate defendants filed memoranda of costs.defendants clwa and scwc jointly requested costs in the amount of.defendant vwc claimed in costs.plaintiffs filed a motion to tax costs that challenged the recovery of certain costs related to the preparation of the administrative record such as the cost of copies,including bates stamping,offsite duplication and,binders,and,and vwc administrative record charges.the superior court heard the motion to tax costs on july,and awarded clwa and scwc costs in the amount of and awarded vwc costs in the amount of.
subsequently,judgment was entered in favor of defendants and plaintiffs appealed.
discussion 
in,the legislature adopted the uwmp act to promote the active management of urban water demands and efficient water usage in order to protect the people of the state and their water resources.stats,ch.to achieve the goal of water conservation and efficient use,urban water suppliers are required to develop water management plans that include planning to ensure adequate water supplies to serve existing customers and future demands for water,subds.d e.the plans must consider a time horizon,subd.a and must be updated at least once every five years on or before december,in years ending in five and zero,subd.a.the uwmp act requires plans to address specific issues.it also sets forth the procedural steps that urban water suppliers must follow when preparing,reviewing,and amending their plans.see generally waterman,addressing california uncertain water future by coordinating land use and water planning is a water element in the general plan the next step ecology,overview of the uwmp act.
standard of review 
in a mandate proceeding to review the decision of a public agency to adopt an urban water management plan,the standard of our review is set forth in section,which provides 
in any action or proceeding to attack,review,set aside,void,or annul a plan,or an action taken pursuant to the plan by an urban water supplier on the grounds of noncompliance with this part,the inquiry shall extend only to whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.abuse of discretion is established if the supplier has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the action by the water supplier is not supported by substantial evidence.
although no published decision has applied section,the statutory language is similar to public resources code section,which applies to some of the mandamus proceedings brought under the california environmental quality act ceqa,public resources code section et.
the role of an appellate court in reviewing an administrative record for a prejudicial abuse of discretion under section is precisely the same as the role of the superior court and,therefore,the lower court findings of fact and conclusions of law are not binding on the appellate court.see san joaquin rescue center county of stanislaus th,d review conducted under pub.resources code.
plaintiffs contend that the defendants ha ve not proceeded in a manner required by law as that phrase is used in section and thus have prejudicially abused their discretion in adopting the uwmp.in particular,plaintiffs claim the uwmp does not comply with section because it erroneously conflates existing sources with planned sources,improperly characterizes supplies that are merely potential as planned sources of water available to the supplier,subd.b,and fails to evaluate adequately the reliability of existing sources of water,such as groundwater from the aquifers and imported water from the swp.plaintiffs also contend that many of the findings of fact made in the uwmp are not supported by substantial evidence.
defendants argue that all of the deficiencies alleged by plaintiffs are merely claims that the weight of the evidence does not support the conclusions of the agencies.as it is not our function to reweigh the evidence,but to determine if there is substantial evidence to support the findings of the uwmp,the plaintiffs must fail if there is such substantial evidence.defendants claim that such substantial evidence exists in the record.defendants also seem to imply that since the uwmp is subject to modification at any time and must be reviewed every five years,subd.a,any deficiency is not prejudicial.
ii.reliability of groundwater sources and perchlorate contamination 
plaintiffs have raised a number of issues concerning the discussion in the uwmp regarding the quantity and quality of available groundwater.some of the issues relate to the perchlorate contamination of the groundwater.
testimony regarding perchlorate contamination 
to support their claims concerning the inadequacy of the uwmp discussion of perchlorate contamination,plaintiffs cite the following testimony given before the public utilities commission by steven bachman,a geologist employed by the primary water wholesaler in the county of ventura who also does consulting work for the county of ventura.
there is a significant area of perchlorate contamination to the east of the wells that pump from the saugus aquifer.the perchlorate has seeped into the saugus aquifer and has flowed westward towards the wells,shutting down percent of the total saugus aquifer wells.
the extent of the perchlorate contamination in the saugus aquifer is not yet known,largely because there is a lack of wells to monitor west of well vwc perchlorate that is still in the soils at the contamination site will be a source of contamination that will continue to reach the aquifers as rains and runoff push the contaminants in the soil into the groundwater system 
the concentration of perchlorate in the production wells probably represents the leading edge of a much larger plume of higher concentrations of perchlorate.the total area of the saugus aquifer contaminated by the perchlorate has yet to be fully defined.we do know that the contaminant has migrated a minimum of miles through the subsurface and over land to contaminate the vital pumping areas.exhibit.since the groundwater gradients in the contaminated area in the saugus are towards the west,the contaminant is likely to continue to migrate further west and northwest.time of travel from the soil contamination sites to the deep saugus wells implies that the contaminant has been moving between to feet per day within the saugus aquifer.this implies that the perchlorate could impact vwc well as early as next year.further down gradient is vwc well.
also,richard mcjunkin,a senior hydrogeologist with the california department of toxic substances control,testified that increased pumping of water from wells near the contamination site will accelerate the flow of the perchlorate contamination.
contents of uwmp 
perchlorate contamination is discussed in chapters,and of the uwmp.chapter of the uwmp is titled introduction and summary.section of the uwmp describes the water supply,including groundwater taken from both layers of the underground water basin.section of the uwmp contains the following summary of the quality of the groundwater 
groundwater quality can be compromised by the presence of contaminants.perchlorate was recently discovered in saugus formation groundwater at a site formerly occupied by an industry located in the area.wells found exceeding the legal limit of this contaminant were shut down,and a groundwater cleanup plan is being developed using proven treatment methods which can restore full production capability.
chapter of the uwmp is titled water supply resources.the introductory paragraphs in that chapter contain the following statements about groundwater and perchlorate contamination 
there is a range of opinion about issues such as the annual yield capability from groundwater basins.accordingly,the uwmp recognizes that active management of resources may be necessary to achieve the projected supply.a number of management activities are thus described in this chapter,such as a water treatment program to remove perchlorates from the saugus formation.many similar programs have been successfully implemented,including the water recharge and water quality management programs of groundwater in orange county,which in recent years have enhanced the annual yield from this important source of local supply.although there are water supply and water quality issues to be addressed in relation to groundwater supplies,the availability of active management options to address these issues creates a high probability that the annual yields discussed in
