does the forest practice act establish an exclusive regulatory framework that precludes other agencies from enforcing the laws they are charged with administering when logging activities implicate those laws we conclude that it does not and that it was error to issue a writ of mandate preventing the california state water resources control board from enforcing water quality protection measures against a timber company.
the pacific lumber company pacific lumber owns property in the headwaters forest.it obtained approval from the california department of forestry and fire protection for an amended timber harvest plan authorizing it to harvest timber along the south fork of the elk river.before it could begin,however,the california state water resources control board state water board issued an order requiring pacific lumber to monitor water quality in the elk river.pacific lumber sought a writ of mandate,and the trial court issued the writ,holding that the state water board lacked jurisdiction to enforce water quality laws against pacific lumber.we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
in the,the elk river timber company predecessor in interest to pacific lumber planned to log approximately acres of redwood forest along the south fork of the elk river,in the headwaters forest in humboldt county.in california,all timber harvesting is regulated by the nejedly forest practice act of forest practice act.pub.resources code.under the forest practice act,no timber harvesting can occur until a timber harvest plan thp has been submitted and approved by the california department of forestry and fire protection department of forestry.pub.resources code.
on december,the elk river timber company submitted a proposed thp to the department of forestry.because of previous logging along the north fork of the elk river,the elk river had been classified as an impaired water body by the responsible regional water board,the regional water quality board,north coast region regional water board.see,subd.d.consequently,when the elk river timber company submitted a proposed thp for the south fork of the elk river,the regional water board submitted comments to the department of forestry recommending a water quality monitoring program.public,subd.a.the elk river timber company registered professional forester agreed generally with this recommendation.on august,the department of forestry approved the proposed thp thp.no formal water quality monitoring program was incorporated,but elk river timber company agreed to carry out voluntary monitoring.
the next month,the legislature passed which authorized public acquisition of the land that is now the headwaters forest preserve.provided funding to carry out the headwaters agreement,an agreement between the state and federal governments and pacific lumber that would allow acquisition from pacific lumber of acres of forest and formation of the headwaters forest preserve.see coho salmon pacific lumber d.the land covered by thp was not included in the headwaters forest preserve instead,as part of the headwaters agreement,pacific lumber acquired it from the elk river timber company.thp remained in effect and authorized timber harvesting on the acres known as the hole in the headwaters.
because of limits on its access to the hole in the headwaters,pacific lumber submitted an amendment to thp that would allow it to use helicopters to remove trees.the department of forestry initially approved the amendment as a minor amendment without public review,but a private lawsuit resulted in a preliminary injunction that required the proposed amendment to be resubmitted as a major amendment subject to a public review process.
the regional water board participated in the public review process and submitted comments.it recommended that thp be further amended to provide for an evaluation of harvest water conditions and ongoing water quality monitoring.the department of forestry declined to adopt the regional water board recommendations,and on march,it approved the amendment to thp without a water quality monitoring requirement or survey of initial conditions.
the forest practice act authorizes the state water board to appeal department of forestry thp approvals to the state board of forestry.pub.resources code.the regional water board asked the state water board to take an appeal,but the state water board chose not to do so.
the regional water board then issued its own order requiring water quality control monitoring.the regional water board order required pacific lumber to establish five monitoring stations along the south fork of the elk river,and required trend monitoring,timber harvest plan compliance monitoring,and stream crossing monitoring.pacific lumber appealed to the state water board,which held a series of hearings,vacated the regional water board order,and issued its own order imposing water monitoring requirements.the state water board order reduced the number of monitoring stations required to two,one above and one below the area where timber harvesting would occur.it also required monthly visual inspections of watercourse crossings during winter 
pacific lumber filed a petition for writ of mandamus,seeking to prevent the state water board order from taking effect.it argued that the state water board order was unlawful because it was precluded both by the department of forestry exclusive jurisdiction over timber harvesting issues and by the state water board failure to take an appeal from the approval of the amendment to thp.the state water board argued that its jurisdiction over water quality issues was concurrent,and that when timber harvesting operations affected water quality,it was authorized to issue its own orders regulating those impacts.after a hearing,the trial court held that the department of forestry jurisdiction was exclusive,and it granted pacific lumber petition.
discussion 
public resources code section permits the state water board to regulate timber harvest impacts 
on appeal following the trial court decision on a petition for a writ of mandamus,we review questions of law and issues of statutory interpretation de novo.alliance for a better downtown millbrae wade th,d see international federation of professional technical engineers city and county of san francisco th,d.
the starting point for our analysis is public resources code section which provides no provision of this chapter or any ruling,requirement,or policy of the forestry board is a limitation on any of the following a on the power of any city or county or city and county to declare,prohibit,and abate nuisances.b on the power of the attorney general,at the request of the board,or upon his own motion,to bring an action in the name of the people of the state of california to enjoin any pollution or nuisance.c on the power of any state agency in the enforcement or administration of any provision of law which it is specifically authorized or required to enforce or administer.d on the right of any person to maintain at any time any appropriate action for relief against any private nuisance as defined in part commencing with section of division of the civil code or for any other private relief.emphasis added.
on its face,public resources code section,subdivision c directly addresses the issue.it provides that notwithstanding orders of the department of forestry such as the approval of a thp or thp amendment,other state agencies may continue to enforce those laws entrusted to them.the other subdivisions of section reinforce the notion that the forest practice act is not the sole means of regulating the impacts of timber harvesting activities.subdivisions a,b,and d authorize public prosecutors and individual citizens to bring actions if and when warranted.under section,timber companies must comply with department of forestry directives and all other applicable laws.
public resources code section mirrors water code section,a provision that underlines the legislature intent to provide for concurrent,overlapping jurisdiction.water code section provides,no provision of this division or any ruling of the state board or a regional board is a limitation a on the power of a city or county or city and county to adopt and enforce additional regulations,not in conflict therewith,imposing further conditions,restrictions,or limitations with respect to the disposal of waste or any other activity which might degrade the quality of the waters of the state.b on the power of any city or county or city and county to declare,prohibit,and abate nuisances.c on the power of the attorney general,at the request of a regional board,the state board,or upon his own motion,to bring an action in the name of the people of the state of california to enjoin any pollution or nuisance.d on the power of a state agency in the enforcement or administration of any provision of law which it is specifically permitted or required to enforce or administer.e on the right of any person to maintain at any time any appropriate action for relief against any private nuisance as defined in the civil code or for relief against any contamination or pollution.thus,the department of forestry jurisdiction does not foreclose the state water board from regulating water quality,and the state water board jurisdiction does not foreclose the department of forestry from regulating timber harvesting.the state water board can not,for example,prevent the department of forestry from approving a thp based on water quality impacts.public resources code section and water code section demonstrate an intent to grant the state water board concurrent jurisdiction with other entities.people city of los angeles d.
public resources code section,subdivision c authorizes the order challenged here.the state water board and regional water boards are expressly entrusted with administering and enforcing california water quality control act water quality act,et under the water quality act,both the regional water board and state water board may require water quality monitoring reports.id,subd.b.in this case,these two boards issued their water quality monitoring orders pursuant to that authority.water code section had been in place for three years when the legislature passed public resources code section.we assume that when the legislature enacts new laws,it is aware of existing related laws and intend s to maintain a consistent body of rules.people superior court zamudio cal th,d.we will not assume lightly that the legislature intended to repeal or limit the state water board power,particularly when an express contrary intent appears on the face of public resources code section,subdivision c.because the state water board is expressly authorized to issue a monitoring order,section,subdivision c obligated pacific lumber to comply with that order in addition to the terms and conditions of thp.
this situation in which activities are subject to the overlapping and concurrent jurisdiction of multiple agencies is not unique.in orange county air pollution control dist.public util.com.cal d,our supreme court addressed a dispute over regulation of the construction of two electric generating units.southern california edison company sought construction approval from the orange county pollution control district pollution control district and the public utilities commission puc.the pollution control district denied approval,concluding that the plants emissions would exceed allowable limits.id.at.the puc granted approval and ordered immediate construction,asserting paramount jurisdiction.id.at.the supreme court reversed.it held,we conclude that the legislature has established one statutory scheme for the general regulation of public utilities,another for the general regulation of air pollution t he puc must share its jurisdiction over utilities regulation where that jurisdiction is made concurrent by another especially a later legislative enactment.id.at.
so it is here.the legislature has established one statutory scheme for the regulation of timber harvesting and another for the maintenance of water quality.where logging activities implicate water quality issues,a timber company must comply with requirements imposed by the state water board in addition to the department of forestry.the exclusivity of puc jurisdiction is even more and clear cut than that of the department of forestry see san diego gas electric superior court cal th,d,if utilities matters can be subjected to concurrent regulation in the absence of a statute expressly providing for concurrent jurisdiction,then forestry matters can certainly be subjected to concurrent regulation in the presence of two statutes expressly providing for concurrent jurisdiction.
pacific lumber relies on a ninth circuit case,resource,army corps of eng rs.cir resource investments,to argue that the state water board should not be permitted to regulate the impacts of logging on water quality.in resource investments,a private entity sought approval from county authorities and from the federal army corps of engineers army corps for construction of a landfill that would affect wetlands.although county officials issued permits,the army corps denied approval.id.at.the ninth circuit reversed the army corps decision based on its reading of the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act.these laws contained no provisions resolving whose authority should control in matters implicating both epa and by delegation state and county official authority over waste management and army corps authority over navigable waters.the ninth circuit concluded that these statutes did not create concurrent,overlapping jurisdiction and were not intended to require landfill construction projects to obtain permit approval from both county officials and the army corps.id.at.instead,it concluded that exclusive jurisdiction for garbage disposal regulation should rest with the epa and its authorized state and local delegates.ibid.
resource investments demonstrates that a legislative body may choose to allocate exclusive jurisdiction to one agency rather than another in matters that might otherwise implicate two agencies jurisdiction.however,the statutory schemes at issue there bear no resemblance to the statutory schemes at issue here.as noted,they contain no provisions parallel to public resources code section and water code section,which each explicitly provide for concurrent jurisdiction.in addition,the agency conducting additional review in resource investments,the army corps,had very limited expertise in the subject it was being asked to regulate,garbage disposal.resource investments,supra,at.in contrast,the state water board has superior expertise in evaluating the need for water quality monitoring.consequently,resource investments is not persuasive here.
pacific lumber summarily argues that public resources code section did not authorize the state water board to regulate water quality issues arising from pacific lumber logging activities because the state water board was not specifically authorized to override an approved timber harvest plan that it had not appealed.see pub.resources code,subd.c.this reading misconstrues the statute.the phrase specifically authorized in section requires only express authorization for the enforcement or administration of any provision of law entrusted to the state water board,such as the water quality act.under section,an agency need only be specifically authorized to enforce a particular law.once it is,section itself provides authority for the agency to do so notwithstanding any act or order of the department of forestry.
under pacific lumber reading,public resources code section,which provides,no provision of this chapter or any ruling,requirement,or policy of the board is a limitation on any of the following,including the power of state agencies to enforce laws,is a limitation on the power of state agencies to enforce laws,absent some separate statutory provision specifying that the agency authority extends to overruling department of forestry actions.in other words,according to pacific lumber,unless the legislature amends the water code to expressly authorize the state water board to overrule department of forestry orders,section limits the state water board and prevents it from enforcing the water quality act.this interpretation turns section on its head.we decline to interpret a section that provides that department of forestry rulings do not limit other agencies granted powers as doing precisely the opposite and limiting their granted powers.
pacific lumber interpretation is also inconsistent with public resources code section.that section provides,timber operations conducted pursuant to this chapter are exempt from the waste discharge requirements of article commencing with section of chapter of division of the water code as long as both the federal environmental protection agency and the state water resources control board certify after january,that the provisions of this chapter constitute best management practices for silviculture pursuant to section of the federal water pollution control act.pub.resources code,subd.a,emphasis added.section demonstrates that the legislature knows how to specify that timber operations are exempt from other laws when it so intends of greater significance,it establishes conditions for exempting timber operations from article of chapter of division of the water code,which includes water code section,the provision at issue here.given that public resources code section exempts timber operations from water code section once certain conditions are met,it would be anomalous to interpret a more general provision as silently creating a blanket exemption even before those conditions have been met in light of public resources code section,we do not interpret public resources code section as exempting pacific lumber from investigation of water quality by the state water board under water code section.
pacific lumber further argues that we should disregard public resources code section because the forest practice act was intended to be a comprehensive system of regulation for the use of all timberlands.pub.resources code.pacific lumber points to regulations adopted by the state board of forestry that address water quality control issues,tit,see pub.resources code,and provisions that allow the regional water board to consult on thps pub.resources code,while reserving final authority to the department of forestry to determine whether a timber harvesting plan is in conformance with the rules and regulations of the state board of forestry and with the forest practice act pub.resources code,subd.e.pacific lumber also points to the appeal process pub.resources code,and suggests that allowing regulation pursuant to section would render that process irrelevant.
the forest practice act comprehensively regulates timber harvesting matters.understandably,it and its accompanying regulations incorporate provisions that address water quality and species habitat issues,and encourage consultation among the department of forestry,state and regional water boards,and the department of fish and game.pub.resources code.interagency lobbying,as happened here,allows one agency to educate another regarding matters within its jurisdiction that have outside impacts.that input might lead to a different decision or accommodations for impacts not otherwise accounted for by a single agency.such provisions recognize the fundamental reality that the environment is not a set of discrete resources but an interdependent biosystem.the extraction of one resource may have an impact on other resources,and another agency may be able to contribute its greater expertise at an early stage.provisions allowing for input do not compel the conclusion that the department of forestry jurisdiction was intended to be exclusive.
nor does our reading of public resources code section render provisions allowing for such input,including the appeal process,irrelevant.even though an agency may retain the power to regulate separately,it has no power to deny approval to any given thp.the appeal process allows the state water board and department of fish and game to argue for outright denial of thps,or modifications on matters within the exclusive jurisdiction of the department of forestry and state board of forestry.this process is permissive,not mandatory.nothing in public resources code sections or suggests that the state water board must exhaust the appeal process before enacting its own orders.
with respect to pacific lumber argument that the forest practice act is comprehensive and therefore supersedes state water board jurisdiction,we find it notable that this argument was raised and dismissed in the weeks immediately preceding passage of,the forest practice act before passage,the state water board and department of fish and game each contacted bill author edwin and expressed concern that could be interpreted to supersede their regulatory authority.in august,wrote the legislative counsel for an opinion.he noted that the language of proposed public resources code section,subdivision c would seem to allow the state water board and the regional water quality control boards to continue regulation of waste discharges from logging activities,including soil,bark,and other debris,whenever they affect water quality.assemblyman edwin,sponsor of,letter to legislative counsel.however,he expressed concern that the detailed regulation of the use of streams and waterways authorized by proposed public resources code section might be considered by the courts to be such a clear expression of the legislature as to the scope of regulations to be applied to logging that the state board of forestry rules would be considered paramount.id.at.he sought confirmation as to whether his bill would in any way limit jurisdiction or restrict the enforcement activities of the state water board,the regional water quality control boards or the department of fish and game.ibid.
the legislative counsel allayed these concerns.it concluded that proposed public resources code section would not be construed to supersede state water board,regional water board,and department of fish and game orders on matters within the scope of those agencies authority.ops.cal.legis.counsel,august,forestry.it based that conclusion,as we do,on the express language of public resources code section.id.at.the next month,the forest practice act passed without further amendment to section.
thus,neither the permissibility of input nor the extent of state board of forestry regulation alters the bottom line each agency is responsible for final decisions regarding the use or preservation of the natural resources within its bailiwick.the legislature grant of final authority to the department of forestry and state board of forestry to decide on thps pub.resources code,subd.e does not alter its equally clear grant of final authority to the state water board to decide on water quality monitoring.while the forest practice act establishes a comprehensive statewide program for timberlands,the water quality control act,et establishes a comprehensive statewide program for water quality control united states state water resources control bd.d.the department of forestry may permit trees to be cut,but the state water board may require that when trees are cut,water quality be preserved 
in sum,we read public resources code section as a legislative determination that the department of forestry exclusive jurisdiction over timber harvesting does not give it exclusive jurisdiction over the effects of that timber harvesting.instead,other agencies may regulate the impacts of logging to the extent those impacts implicate the substantive statutes they are charged with enforcing.under public resources code section,agencies with expertise concerning a particular resource are granted final say concerning the use or preservation of that resource.the state water board can not reach out to forbid logging that might have negative water impacts conversely,the department of forestry can not reach out to forbid water quality monitoring.ultimately,the state water board judgment about what is needed to protect the elk river must be dispositive,not the judgment of the department of forestry.in the legislature view,the department of forestry regulation of timber harvesting does not excuse pacific lumber from other agency requirements that it take steps to ensure the preservatio
