facts and procedural history 
this appeal comes to us after the trial court sustained respondent demurrer and appellant declined to amend its complaint.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.blank kirwan cal d.
appellant is a nonprofit corporation its members are involved in various aspects of water well drilling,as well as installation and maintenance of related equipment for production of water from wells.respondent is a water storage district formed pursuant to the california water storage district law,water code section et.see generally johnson water storage dist.th,d.prior to,respondent hired licensed contractors to drill its water wells through a competitive bidding process.such contractors held the necessary license issued by the contractors state license board pursuant to the contractors state license law,business and professions code section et.beginning in,respondent began using its employees to perform these well services none of these employees held a license.
appellant sued respondent for declaratory and injunctive relief.after the court denied appellant application for a preliminary injunction,respondent filed its demurrer to the complaint.after hearing,the court determined as a matter of law that appellant did not and could not state a cause of action.appellant did not request leave to amend its complaint.the court entered judgment of dismissal,and appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.
statutory language.
division of the water code is known as the water quality control act hereafter the water quality act.the water quality act was adopted in to address conservation,control,and utilization of water resources in the state and to protect the quality of such water.id.at see generally stats,ch.the water quality act required any person drilling or performing a wide range of other activities in conjunction with,inter alia,water wells to file with the california department of water resources a notice of intent to perform those activities,former,repealed by stats,ch.the water quality act also requires every such person to file a report with the department within days after the activities.id.at.these requirements are applicable to every person who performs the activities.a person is defined to include any city,county,district,the state and the united states,to the extent authorized by federal law.id.at,subd.c.respondent concedes it is a person required to file notices of intent to drill and completion reports under the water quality act.
in,the legislature added water code section to the water quality act.see stats,ch.section provides that no person shall undertake the specified activities unless the person responsible for that construction,alteration,destruction,or abandonment possesses a water well contractor license.
on its face,then,and read in the context of the water quality act,section plainly requires respondent to engage in the specified activities only when the individual responsible for the activities is a licensed water well contractor.
licenses are issued by the contractors state licensing board pursuant to the contractors state license law,business and professions code section et hereafter the licensing law the licensing law,in general,applies to contractors who engage in a wide variety of construction activities,as set forth in detail at section defining contractor.again speaking generally,the licensing law is intended to protect the public from incompetent and unreliable contractors.rushing powell d.
the licensing law contains a number of exceptions to the requirement that contracting work be performed only by licensed contractors.see.the exceptions involved in the present appeal are set forth in sections,and,which are set forth in full in the accompanying footnote all three exceptions begin with the phrase,this chapter does not apply 
respondent contends it is exempted from the licensing law by each of the three exceptions,and the parties devote much of 
their briefing to parsing the exemptions.we think,however,this exercise is misguided.whether an exception is or is not applicable to respondent,that exemption would,at most,excuse respondent from the requirements of this chapter,that is,the licensing law.the requirement that activity be conducted or supervised by a licensed well driller,set forth in section water code section,is not imposed by the licensing law it is,instead,imposed by the water code.water code section contains no exceptions from its requirements,and it does not reference the exceptions set forth in the licensing law.accordingly,we hold that the exceptions set forth in the licensing law,whatever might be their effect on respondent for work that is subject to the licensing law,do not provide an exception to the unequivocal mandate of the water code.
b.the communications relay case 
communications relay county of los angeles th,d involved a property owner who sought to force the county to issue a well drilling permit even though the work was not to be performed by a licensed well driller.the plaintiff contended the wells would be built on its own property and that it was,therefore,exempt from water code section licensing requirement pursuant to the exemption of section.th at,d.the court rejected this contention.id.at,d.
the communications relay court noted that permitting unlicensed and presumably inexperienced or unqualified property owners to build wells would undermine the express legislative purpose in enacting the water quality act,namely,to protect the public health and welfare by preventing underground water from being contaminated due to improperly constructed or abandoned wells.th at,d.this,the court stated,was a different legislative purpose from the consumer protection rationale of the licensing law.it was this consumer protection rationale that supported the property owners exemption of section property owners who perform the construction work themselves on their own property do not need this protection th at,d.the same rationale did not support application of the exemption to water code section because groundwater contamination can directly affect public health far beyond the boundaries of an individual property.
the court also concluded various other rules of statutory construction supported its determination that section did not create an exemption from the requirements of water code section.in particular,water code section was enacted far later than section and generally the latest statutory expression prevails.communications relay county of los angeles,supra,th at,d.further,a specific statute such as water code section,which applies specifically to the construction of water wells prevails over a general statute such as section,which applies generally to all kinds of construction.ibid.
respondent contends communications relay county of los angeles,supra,th,d is not relevant to the present case.respondent argues relay actually decided the narrow,unrelated question of the applicability of the landowner exemption under the license law section a with regard to private landowners.importantly,relay did not decide the current issue of whether a water storage district owning property for public purposes is required to possess a license,when constructing wells in its offi
