the california department of water resources dwr petitions for review of a federal energy regulatory commission ferc order permitting intervenor pacific gas and electric company pg e to include in its tariff for use of pg e power transmission lines charges for million worth of various facilities previously classified as generation tie lines and generation transformers gsus pg e,a utility which owns the electricity transmission lines in california,is required to allow anyone to transmit power over these lines.pg e may recover costs associated with transmission by charging users a tariff,subject to ferc approval.ferc determined that,because all of the facilities at issue perform some transmission function,pg e could include their cost in its tariff and roll in the facilities costs equally to all transmission users.we have jurisdiction pursuant to b over this petition for review of an order issued by ferc.we deny dwr petition for review because its various claims of error are unfounded.ferc decision to categorize the facilities as transmission based on an exclusive use test and to roll in their costs does not conflict with ferc precedent and is a reasonable approach to allocate the cost of facilities whose operation benefits all grid users.we also hold that ferc decision was supported by substantial evidence and that dwr was not deprived of any due process rights by the allowance of a particular witness testimony.
background 
statutory and regulatory background 
the federal power act fpa,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of,provides that a utility may not charge rates that make or grant any undue preference or advantage to any person or subject any person to any undue prejudice or disadvantage.b.similarly,under a of the fpa,a utility may charge only rates that are just and reasonable,stat,codified as amended in a.utilities must submit their rate schedules to ferc for review and approval.c e.
historically,electric utilities operated as vertically integrated monopolies.new york ferc,d.one utility offered a bundled service,whereby customers paid a single price for generation,transmission,and distribution of electricity.id.competition among utilities was not prevalent.id.although the number of power suppliers has increased dramatically since the advent of federal regulation in the,until recently,public utilities continued to retain control of the transmission lines that must be used for electricity delivery.id.at.
after determining that utilities were discriminatorily denying competitor power suppliers access to utilities electricity transmission lines,ferc,in,issued order.order,promoting wholesale competition through open access transmission services by public utilities recovery of stranded costs by public utilities and transmitting utilities,stats.regs,may,codified as revised at pts,the order required public utilities that own,control,or operate transmission facilities to file open access tariffs under which they agree to provide access to their transmission networks in addition to the service the utilities had been offering.see also new york,at.the order also required utilities to functionally unbundle their rates by separately stating rates for generation,transmission,and ancillary services.order.at see also new york,at.
procedural history 
on november,ferc authorized the formation of the california independent system operator corporation california iso or iso to operationalize order in the state.see pac.gas,as amended.the order also conditionally granted joint applications by pg e,san diego gas electric company,and southern california edison company collectively the companies to categorize certain assets as transmission,and to convey operational control of any transmission facilities to the iso id.at,see pac.gas,conditionally authorizing transfer of certain of the companies transmission facilities to the iso,aff.
the order further required pg e and the other companies to submit tariffs,known as transmission owner tariffs or transmission revenue requirements,designed to recoup the revenue that they,as the owners of the facilities,turned over to iso control,at.
in march,pg e filed a transmission owner tariff,which purported to establish charges for transmission service provided under the california iso open access tariff.pac.gas.in may,ferc accepted the proposed tariffs for filing.id.at.it suspended and set for a hearing proposed revisions to the rates,terms,and conditions for transmission service under pg e tariff.id.the purpose of the hearing was to determine whether the proposed rates were unjust and unreasonable.see id.ferc initiated an investigation under of the federal power act,stat,codified as amended at,and established a refund effective date.id.at.the parties subsequently filed partial settlements,approved by ferc,resolving all but two issues related to the filing.pac.gas,pac.gas,
after the hearing,the presiding judge issued an initial decision which rejected in large part pg e request to include the facilities in its transmission revenue requirement.pac.gas.the judge excluded from the transmission revenue requirement all facilities that performed both network transmission and generation tie functions.he found that million worth of facilities were dedicated entirely to network transmission,and could be recovered by pg id.at.
in opinion,ferc reversed the initial decision.pac.gas.ferc held that the proper test to determine which facilities were to be included in pg e transmission revenue requirement was whether the facilities had been transferred to the control of the iso.id.at.if they had,then the facilities would be included in the rate base otherwise they would be excluded id.
in opinion,ferc granted rehearing.pac.gas.it found that iso control,although necessary,was not the only consideration in determining whether the facilities could be included in the transmission revenue requirement.id.at.opinion nevertheless affirmed that the facilities should be included,because all of the facilities performed a transmission function and because ferc policy favored rolling in the costs of transmission facilities.id.at.
ferc denied rehearing in opinion,pac.gas,and dwr petitioned this court for review.
facilities 
the facilities at issue were separated by the presiding judge into three groups.the characterization of the facilities was largely based on the testimony of pg e witness robert jenkins.
loop facilities.
three kv transmission lines comprise the diablo canyon loop the lines connect the diablo canyon nuclear power plant to the grid and also provide parallel transmission paths between two substations gates and midway.power flows from the diablo canyon nuclear power plant onto the grid through the diablo loop.in addition,the diablo canyon loop forms part of the system which runs through california on a separate corridor a parallel path to path according to jenkins,if the parallel path were not there,transfers along path would have to be reduced by as much as percent.
the morro bay loop consists of six kv lines that run through the los padres area of the pg e electric transmission system.the loop connects the morro bay power plant to the grid.the loop also provides parallel paths to the diablo canyon loop and to path.finally,according to jenkins,the loop serves to deliver load,the electrical power required at a specific point,to the local area.during periods of high local generation,excess power is delivered via the loop into the rest of the system.during periods of low or no generation,the loop imports power into the area to serve the local load.
the moss landing loop consists of kv transmission lines,connecting the moss landing power plant and a moss landing transformer to the grid.the loop connects to the metcalf substation,and is one of two kv transmission lines feeding that substation.the metcalf substation serves load to the local area.according to jenkins,if not for the support of the moss landing loop,the load in the central coast area would need to be curtailed and large portions of southern silicon valley would experience an endangered power supply,as the subsequent loss of the other kv transmission line that feeds the metcalf substation would result in the interruption of hundreds to thousands of megawatts of load.
dual function facilities.
several transformer banks,collectively worth approximately million,were classified as dual function by pg e.these transformers are located at pg e plants.the transformers step up the voltage of power generated at the plant to make it compatible with the grid voltage.the transformers are considered dual function because they also serve the grid,transforming power that passes through between various voltages.
facilities.
finally,million worth of facilities were classified as or.these facilities consist of transformer banks and lines connecting network stations.the transformer banks are located at generating stations that have been decommissioned.the transformers operate only as interchange banks,transforming power passing through between various voltages.two kv lines were previously connected to generators but have been reconfigured so that they now connect network stations.
methods of pricing transmission services 
the two types of pricing structures at issue in this case are pricing and subfunctionalized pricing.when a utility uses the allocation method for transmission costs,all customers share proportionately in the ownership,operation,and maintenance costs of all transmission facilities.sierra pac.power ferc,cir.pricing of transmission facilities is the method traditionally used in the industry.see pac.gas,at opinion.
in,pg e developed a subfunctional pricing method for its wholesale transmission rates.id.at.subfunctional allocation was implemented in response to the complaint of a customer that it should not have to pay pg e fully allocated transmission rates because those rates included the cost of pg e generation tie lines,which the customer did not use.according to the pg e employee who developed the rate methodology,pg e develop ed the subfunctionalized transmission rate method in order to more accurately track the costs of customers.
pg e studied its transmission facilities and assigned each facility a subcategory based on the facility function within the transmission category.transmission referred to line and substation facilities with nominal operating voltages of at least kv.the five subcategories or subfunctions are backbone generation tie system interconnection exclusive use and area transmission.see id.at describing the subfunctions.customers were charged postage stamp rates for each subfunction utilized,meaning the rate was set without regard to the distance the power traveled.see id.at giving examples of transmission rates broken out by subfunction.
generation ties were defined as transmission facilities with the primary purpose of providing electrical paths between generating facilities and the integrated transmission network.id.at.under the subfunctionalized method,the loops and transformers in this case were classified as generation tie.

adoption of pricing was proper 
in this case,ferc was obliged to determine whether pg e proposed method of pricing was just and reasonable.ferc order upholding the proposal was neither arbitrary nor capricious.ferc classified the facilities as transmission and rolled in their costs after considering the facilities functions and the methodology utilized in previous adjudications involving transmission tariffs.
ferc permissibly classified the facilities as transmission because they performed some transmission function.
ferc classified all of the facilities at issue as transmission despite the fact that the bulk of the facilities serve generation functions in addition to transmission functions.specifically,the loops connect plants to the grid,and many of the transformer banks step up the voltage of generated power to make the voltage compatible with grid levels.according to opinion,any degree of integration is sufficient to establish that the costs of the facilities should be treated as transmission,at.the presiding judge called this benchmark the exclusive use test because it classified facilities as generation for costing purposes,excluded from pricing only if the facilities were used exclusively to generate power,step up power,or transmit power from the generator to the grid.he initially rejected this benchmark when it was proposed by pg e because he believed that the exclusive use test unfairly conflated the transmission and generation functions.
we hold that the exclusive use test comports with ferc treatment of other facilities serving dual purposes.for example,in american electric power service,rev in part on other grounds,opinion,a utility sought to include in its transmission tariff the costs associated with two kv lines which supported both generation and transmission functions.id.at.the voltage lines connected an isolated generation facility with the rest of the grid,but their configuration also provided an kv link across the state of indiana,providing and reliability functions to the grid.id.the presiding judge found that the lines were properly included in the tariff.see opinion,am.power serv,at noting in earlier proceeding that the same lines serve a transmission function northeast,at,opinion classifying as transmission facilities that primarily served to connect and protect points of delivery,where the facilities also maintained reliability of service over the network transmission lines otter tail power,opinion.thus,although ferc has never explicitly referred to an exclusive use test,it appears that it does apply such a test to determine whether facilities should be classified as transmission.
like the lines in american electric power service,pg e loop facilities and dual function facilities serve a network transmission function in addition to benefiting pg e generation.for example,the diablo canyon and morro bay loops both function as parallel paths to path.in addition,the morro bay loop carries over mw of local area load.the moss landing loop carries approximately mw of local area load and is one of two kv lines feeding a substation that serves silicon valley.further,the transformer banks within the group of dual function facilities both transform power at the generating station supporting pg e generation and transform power that passes through the banks between various levels of voltage a transmission function finally,the facilities serve no generation function,only a transmission function,because the generators they previously supported have been decommissioned.
the facilities were all shown to perform some transmission function.consequently,ferc sub silentio application of an exclusive use test in order to classify the facilities as transmission affords consistent treatment to regulated utilities across rate proceedings,and was not arbitrary or capricious.
ferc policy consistently favors transmission pricing.
ferc precedent clearly demonstrates a consistent policy favoring the method of transmission pricing where the system operates as an integrated whole otter tail power,opinion,is an example of this policy.in otter tail,ferc found that a utility properly attributed six lines to a transmission function and that the utility should therefore allocate the costs of the lines on a basis.id.at.the owner of the lines,otter tail,was subject to an antitrust decree requiring otter tail to wheel power from any supplier to any municipality within otter tail service area.id.at.during a proceeding to determine the rate otter tail could charge for wheeling power,otter tail introduced evidence that the six lines were used for network transmission.id.at.
other parties to the proceeding contended that the lines should not be included in otter tail transmission rate because the lines were of more use to otter tail in its production power generation function than in a transmission function.one group noted that some lines were built to intertie otter tail plants with power sources.id.at.it argued that on these lines,the use for transmitting power was de minimis,such that the lines should be excluded from the rate base.id.at.another group introduced evidence that the lines performed functions percent of the time,and argued that a corresponding percentage of the lines costs should be excluded from the rate base.id.at.
ferc rejected these arguments,holding that any facility found to serve a transmission function was properly includable in the rate base.id.at.as such,ferc found that the six lines costs formed part of the transmission rate base,to be to all customers.ferc noted that commission precedent strongly favors use of the method of transmission allocation.id.at citing.power,opinion public serv.of,opinion,aff in part,rev in part,public serv.of ferc,cir.power light,opinion detroit edison,opinion.ferc explained 
the principal reason behind adoption of this methodology is that an integrated system is designed to achieve maximum efficiency and reliability at a minimum cost on a systemwide basis.implicit in this theory is the assumption that all customers,whether they be wholesale,retail or wheeling customers,receive the benefits that are inherent in such an integrated system.
at internal citations omitted.because otter tail system was integrated,a allocation method was appropriate.id.
under otter tail rationale,it is irrelevant whether the loops and transformer banks directly serve the power requirements of a generator such as dwr.as long as the system is integrated,and the facilities are integrated with the system,dwr is assumed to benefit from the transmission these facilities provide accord me.pub.serv.ferc,me.public serv,at opinion determining that the cost of three lines could not be included in transmission rates where the lines were not looped and could form no parallel paths with transmission facilities.because dwr benefits from the integrated grid,ferc reasonably required it to pay its share of the cost.
ferc has not changed its policy toward the pricing of transmission facilities.
dwr argues that ferc policy regarding rolling in transmission costs has been modified significantly over the past decade,particularly in light of order.in support,dwr highlights various statements by ferc between and acknowledging alternative methods of transmission pricing,contained in the transmission pricing policy statement order,order the standard market design rulemaking proceedings smd nopr,and orders and.the presiding judge also believed order endorsement of unbundling forbade attribution of any generation costs to the transmission tariffs.we have reviewed the cited orders and policy statements,and we find no such change in policy.
as discussed above,order,issued in,required each public utility to file tariffs for open access transmission services,with the goal of remedying undue discrimination in access to the utilities transmission wires.at.ferc decisions issued subsequent to order demonstrate that order did not affect ferc preference of rolling in transmission rates.see,rolling in the cost of grid upgrades without mention of order,aff sub nom.ferc,see also am.power serv,affirming earlier decision to roll in costs associated with transmission facilities,without discussing order,and noting that historically,the method of transmission cost allocation has been favored 
ferc has sanctioned no special pricing policy with respect to pg e transmission facilities.
finally,dwr argues that,regardless of ferc standard pricing policies,ferc has consistently endorsed a policy of pricing pg e facilities based on subfunction,and changed course without presenting any reasons for doing so or establishing that the new pricing method was just and reasonable.
despite dwr contrary representations in its briefs and during oral argument,ferc has never stated that it favors pg e subfunctional method.as respondent highlights,on one occasion ferc adjudicated a rate dispute involving subfunctionalized pricing,but explicitly declined to pass on the merits of the methodology.see pac.gas,opinion noting that none of the parties had challenged the subfunctional methodology.opinion noted that the method itself had never been litigated,and stated that pg e is free to continue the use of its subfunctional methodology or to propose a rate in future proceedings.w e will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of this or any other pricing methodology on a basis.id.at.
it appears pg e sought to change from subfunctionalized rates to transmission rates beginning in.see turlock irrigation dist.pac.gas,at pac.gas,at,proceeding dismissed.pg e requests were challenged before ferc in two cases,but both were resolved without an adjudication of the subfunctionalized method.see,at noting that the parties had reached agreement on the rate level and declining to issue a requested declaratory order forbidding the use of a rate in the future,at finding that the contract language prohibited change to rate.
an administrative law judge did reject a third attempt by pg e to utilize pricing in a transmission rate schedule.pac.gas,aff in part,vacated in part.noting that the proposed rate under the new agreement was a steep increase over the subfunctionalized rate being charged under the parties current interconnection agreements,the judge found the proposal to be an unjust and unreasonable attempt to charge more for the same service.id.at.ferc affirmed the judge rejection of the agreement,noting that no party had excepted to that ruling.pac.gas,opinion,on reh g,opinion.
however,ferc later clarified that opinion did not make any findings regarding the merits of a rate.pac.gas,at,reh g granted.in a proceeding conditionally accepting pg e proposed rate filing,ferc considered a request by the intervenors to prohibit pg e from utilizing its proposed rate.id.at.ferc set a hearing for the intervenors to pursue their concerns about the rate,but declined requests to direct pg e to continue to use the subfunctionalized rate.id.ferc stated that grandfathering in a particular rate simply because it was used in the past would stifle innovation and pricing flexibility.id.at.the parties later settled their dispute.see pac.gas.
in sum,when ferc has considered the subfunctionalized method,it has not expressed the sort of favorable opinions that would render its decision to permit pricing in this case arbitrary and capricious.dwr claim that ferc decision is a dramatic reversal of earlier policy is simply erroneous 
due process and substantial evidence 
dwr argues that the testimony of pg e witness robert jenkins,upon which ferc relied heavily,violated dwr right to due process and that the order is not supported by substantial evidence.jenkins was properly heard as a rebuttal witness.moreover,jenkins written testimony was available one month before he testified.dwr therefore had notice of his testimony and was free to object to it or seek to present additional responsive testimony.dwr did neither.thus,dwr objections to this testimony are meritless.pub.serv.comm ferc,concluding that the commission violated petitioners due process right
