the missouri industrial energy consumers miec,an association of businesses formed to address its members concerns about utility services,moved to intervene in an enforcement action filed against the metropolitan louis sewer district district by the united states and the state of missouri under the clean water act,et.the district court denied the motion for lack of standing.miec appeals,and we affirm.
the district manages a sewer and wastewater system for approximately million residents and other users in the louis area.the complaint filed by the united states and the state of missouri alleges that from to,the district discharged raw sewage into local waterways and otherwise violated its state issued permits.it alleges that the discharges have resulted from inadequate flow capacity in the collection system and at the wastewater treatment plants aged and corroded pipes and force mains illegal and improper between sanitary and stormwater sewers and poor maintenance,among other causes.the plaintiffs seek civil penalties for each violation and an injunction directing the district to come into permanent and consistent compliance with the clean water act act and to minimize the imminent and substantial risks to human health posed by the discharge of raw sewage.
based on these alleged violations,the missouri coalition for the environment foundation coalition,a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving and enhancing the state environment,served the district with notice of its intent to file a citizen suit under the act.b a.after the united states and missouri filed this action,the coalition sought to intervene under b b,which grants citizens a right to intervene if the government is already prosecuting an enforcement action.see.a.the district court granted the coalition unopposed motion to intervene.
miec is a general business trade association with seven members who discharge into the district wastewater system,and pay user rates and fees amounting to of the district revenues.these members are,the boeing company,chrysler corporation,hussmann corporation,monsanto,pfizer,and procter gamble.miec members hold seven of the industrial wastewater discharge permits issued by the district.such permits authorize the holder to discharge a specific volume of wastewater at a specified rate and require monitoring of the volume and pollutant levels in the wastewater discharged.
miec filed a motion to intervene in this case as a neutral party for the limited purpose of participating in discussions,negotiations,mediations,hearings,trials settlements relating to the remedy.more specifically,miec wants to be a party to proceedings and discovery regarding the scope of the remedial work contemplated,the time frame when the proposed remedial work needs to be completed,the environmental impacts,and the financing options regarding the proposed remedial work.it expressed concern that any injunction or consent decree imposed on the district might result in increased user rates and fees for its members.it also prayed that the court enter an order ensuring that the remedy is protective of the environment,compliant with the clean water act,and will not unreasonably burden the district ratepayers.miec argued that it had a statutory right to intervene under federal rule of civil procedure a and b b,as the coalition had.it also sought to intervene as a matter of right under rule a and permissively under rule b.while the district supports miec intervention,the united states and the coalition oppose it.the state of missouri takes no position on the issue.
the district court denied the motion after determining that miec lacked the article iii standing necessary for intervention because its alleged injuries were too speculative and not particularized.the denial of a motion to intervene of right is immediately appealable as a final judgment,south dakota dep t of interior,cir,and our review is de novo.med.liab.mut.ins.alan curtis llc,cir.
in our circuit,a party seeking to intervene must establish article iii standing in addition to the requirements of rule mausolf babbitt,cir.to demonstrate standing,a plaintiff must clearly allege facts showing an injury in fact,which is an injury to a legally protected interest that is concrete,particularized,and either actual or imminent.curry regents of the of,cir.the purpose of the imminence requirement is to ensure that the alleged injury is not too speculative and that the injury is certainly impending.lujan defenders of wildlife,d quotation omitted.the plaintiff must also show that the alleged injury is fairly traceable to the defendant conduct and that a favorable decision will likely redress the injury.id.at.
when a party seeks to dismiss a suit for lack of standing,we must accept as true all material allegations of the complaint,and must construe the complaint in favor of the complaining party.warth seldin,d.the same standards apply when a party opposes a motion to intervene.rule c requires an intervening party to submit a pleading that sets out the claim or defense for which intervention is sought.miec did not submit a pleading asserting either a claim or defense,but it did submit a statement of interest explaining why it seeks intervention and requesting the right to participate in settlement discussions.
appellees argue that miec failure to submit a pleading is sufficient to deny its motion to intervene,but we conclude that the statement of interest satisfies rule c because it provides sufficient notice to the court and the parties of miec interests.accord beckman indus.int l ins,cir spring constr,harris,cir.miec also submitted affidavits from representatives of four member companies explaining their concerns about the impact of this lawsuit on their operations.
in the district court miec expressed concern that the district would increase sewer rates in order to pay civil penalties and to fund the improvements necessary to bring its system into compliance.miec also asserted interests in a reliable and viable sewer system and in the quality of the local environment.the district court determined that because miec sought to intervene as a neutral party it could not assert harm to its members environmental interests and that it was a matter of pure conjecture whether the lawsuit would affect the reliability of the sewer system.it also concluded that sewer rates would increase only if the district were found liable,the court were to impose civil penalties or an injunction requiring significant infrastructure improvements,and the district were to decide to pass on the costs of compliance to ratepayers rather than raising capital in some other way.the district court conceded that this sequence of events would not be impossible,but concluded that it was too speculative to create standing.
at the outset we note that miec can not assert environmental injury on behalf of its members.an association has standing to assert the claims of its members if the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization purpose.hunt.apple adver.comm n,d.miec nowhere states that environmental protection or aesthetic and recreational interests are relevant to its members purpose in joining together.its brief indicates that miec purpose is to represent its industrial members unique commercial interests in utility matters.additionally,as the district court noted,miec asserted neutrality as to whether the district violated the clean water act is inconsistent with an assertion that the harm to regional rivers and streams injures its members.
miec next asserts an interest in the reliability and viability of the district system,but it does not explain how any remedy that might be imposed in this case will threaten the reliability of the system.the complaint seeks to improve reliability in that it seeks to remedy the poor maintenance and insufficient capacity causing the permit violations which have occurred.in addition,miec shares its interest in the reliability of the system with all of the million users,so it is not the kind of concrete,particularized interest that establishes standing.see nolles state comm.for the reorg.of sch,cir generalized grievance shared in common by all voters is not a personalized injury.
miec is properly situated to assert the utility related economic interests of its members,but we agree with the district court that the possibility of increased sewer rates is not an imminent injury.miec argues that each step in the sequence of events found unlikely by the district court is instead highly probable.first,it asserts that most enforcement cases of this type result in settlement and a consent decree rather than a finding of liability after trial.it also contends that any remedy imposed would almost certainly require infrastructure upgrades because plaintiffs complaint focuses on infrastructure deficiencies as the cause of the clean water act violations.see south dakota ubbelohde,cir looking at relief sought by plaintiff to determine whether its prevailing would cause imminent injury to a potential intervenor.miec argues there is nothing remote or speculative about whether the district will pass on the costs of compliance to its customers,for it has stated that it does not have sufficient funds to prevent the alleged in plaintiffs complaint or to satisfy any judgment that may be entered against it in this lawsuit,without raising its wastewater user charges or user fees.
the context of the district statement shows,however,that it is not an admission that it will raise its rates.the statement was part of a counterclaim it filed against the state of missouri,alleging that because state law limits its ability to raise rates and because these user fees are its only revenue stream,the state is liable for the entire cost of any judgment against the district as provided in e.the district was not expressing an intent to raise rates,but declaring that it considers itself constrained from doing so.thus,it is questionable that any consent decree would be able to determine the means by which the district would pay for system improvements.
the district is also constrained by its own charter from committing to raise fees as part of any enforceable consent decree,even if it were inclined to do so.first,the district staff must propose a rate increase to the board of trustees and the rate commission.after public hearings,the rate commission may issue a rate recommendation report to the board,which can reject the recommendation if its finds that it imposes an unfair or excessive burden on one or more classes of ratepayers.
the constraints on the district ability to raise rates,combined with the district pursuit of indemnification from the state for the cost of complying with any judgment or consent decree,show that a rate increase is no more than a conjectural or hypothetical outcome of this lawsuit.see defenders of wildlife,at.moreover,any judgment or consent decree will likely establish what the district must do to comply,rather than specify how the district will pay for the needed measures.it would be up to the district to determine whether rate increases are necessary and legally permissible through the process described in its charter.
miec argues that the circumstances creating its economic injury are no more speculative than those in south dakota ubbelohde.when the army corps of engineers corps planned to release water from a south dakota reservoir in order to maintain flows in the missouri river for downstream recreational and navigational purposes,south dakota filed for an injunction based on its interest in protecting the fisheries in the reservoir.id.at.several downstream entities moved to intervene,claiming that they would be harmed if the court ruling lead to decreased water flow.the district court concluded that a preliminary injunction preventing the corps from releasing water from the south dakota reservoir would not cause actual or imminent injury downstream because the corps could release water from other reservoirs on the river.we reversed,noting that south dakota requested permanent relief would require the corps to prevent irreparable harm to fisheries when making future decisions about management of the missouri river when the harm is inflicted to benefit downstream navigation.id.at.because such relief might force the corps to reduce downstream flows in drought conditions to maintain water levels at all of the reservoirs,we concluded that the intervenors had presented sufficient evidence of a threatened injury to give them standing.id.at.
the link between plaintiffs requested relief and the possibility of harm to miec is less direct and more contingent in this case than in ubbelohde.ubbelohde concerned a single,nonfungible water were retained in the reservoir,it could not be available for downstream use.in contrast,if plaintiffs were to prevail in this case miec would not unavoidably be harmed economically because the district may use alternate means to pay for its compliance.in ubbelohde,south dakota requested a remedy that would specifically elevate its interest in protecting fisheries above the downstream interests in navigation.the plaintiffs requested remedy here,in contrast,does not seek to compel the district to fund its compliance in any particular way and makes no reference to miec asserted economic concerns.
in its reply brief miec argues that the eventual remedy here might affect the terms of its members industrial wastewater discharge permits by restricting the volume of discharge allowed or requiring pretreatment of the wastewater.in the district court,however,miec did not identify changes to industrial wastewater discharge permits as one of its injuries.instead,miec focused almost exclusively on its interest in making sure that the district rates are maintained at reasonable levels.although miec mentioned in its district court brief that its members are required to have industrial discharge permits,it did not place any of these permits in the record.while miec did provide a hyperlink to an example permit in its reply brief,we must consider the record and allegations as they existed in the district court.see.fed of teachers randall,cir.
even if miec had raised this discharge permit problem in the district court,nothing in the record suggests that the remedy sought by plaintiffs would affect these permits.the complaint does not refer to industrial wastewater discharges as a contributor to the overflow problem instead it focuses on the deficient infrastructure.miec contends that because infrastructure upgrades will take time to complete,the only way that the district could readily comply with an injunction from further illegal discharges is by restricting the wastewater volume released into its system by permit holders.this argument assumes without basis that the court will impose injunctive relief insensitive to the longer term nature of the needed upgrades,rather than imposing a compliance schedule.it is even more unlikely that an enforcement action which focuses on insufficient system capacity would require wastewater dischargers to pretreat their wastewater,because pretreatment would address water quality,not quantity.miec notes that consent decrees in other enforcement cases have included terms affecting industrial wastewater discharge permit holders,but whether an order or consent decree in this case would affect these permits is a matter of speculation and therefore insufficient to support standing.
we conclude that miec has not adequately alleged that it will suffer a concrete and particularized injury.in addition,miec does not even attempt to establish that its injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action and that its injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable other elements of article iii standing that a party invoking federal jurisdiction must show.defenders of wildlife,at.miec neglect of these elements,together with its failure to demonstrate injury in fact,confirms our conclusion that it lacks standing to intervene.
aside from the question of standing,there is the question whether miec has a right to intervene under either rule a or a.rule a allows intervention as a matter of right when a federal statute confers an unconditional right to intervene on the moving party.miec contends that it has such a right under b b,which state
