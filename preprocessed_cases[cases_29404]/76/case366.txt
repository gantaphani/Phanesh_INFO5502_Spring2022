a jury convicted appellant roger isaac guzman of violating harbors and navigation code sections,subdivision a,and guzman and thomas christopher kirby were the occupants of a motorboat driven by guzman that struck and severely injured an year old boy on shaver lake in.they did not stop to render assistance but instead continued on to the marina,where they later told deputies they had not been involved in the accident and claimed they had been on the pontoon boat that stopped and rendered assistance.both guzman and kirby had been drinking alcoholic beverages the day of the accident.
guzman contends his constitutional right against was violated prejudicially by the trial court instruction to the jury on the section offense,which stated he was required to identify himself to law enforcement officers as the operator of the motorboat that had struck the boy.guzman argues the error requires reversal of his conviction.
guzman also claims his constitutional rights were violated when the prosecutor misstated the law in closing argument in the trial by stating that guzman voluntary intoxication could not be considered in determining whether guzman knew or should have known he had hit the child.guzman contends the prosecutor misstatement requires reversal.
we conclude section is analogous to vehicle code section.harbors and navigation code section does not make it a crime for an operator of a boat to be involved in a boating accident the gravamen of the criminal offense arises when the operator fails to stop and render assistance or fails to identify himself as such to the victim and peace officers.we publish our discussion of this conclusion as there is no published decision concerning the issue.
we further conclude the prosecutor did not commit prejudicial misconduct.the trial court instructed the jury to consider voluntary intoxication in deciding whether guzman had knowledge that he had been involved in a collision.
guzman also appealed from the restitution order,but failed to brief this issue,so we will disregard any attack on the order.
we will affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural summary 
as the contentions made by guzman are legal issues,we will leave out many facts,but nothing significant.
on september,lynn and jeff mcentire went to shaver lake with their two children and some family friends.the group traveled across the lake to a cove,arriving about jeff and the others took personal watercraft out onto the lake several times throughout the day.
guzman,kirby,and several friends,including the peffer family,also were at shaver lake that day at a cove near the mcentires.about guzman and kirby headed out from the cove in guzman white and yellow motorboat.guzman was driving,or operating,the boat he was wearing a red shirt.kirby was not wearing a shirt,thus revealing a tattoo on his upper shoulder.there were no other yellow and white boats in the area when guzman and kirby headed out.
about,the victim was on a kneeboard and being pulled by a personal watercraft piloted by his father,jeff.jeff passenger was acting as a spotter or flagman.the victim was tiring and jeff began heading back into the cove.as he was heading back,jeff saw a motorboat accelerating as it came out of the cove.the boat was travelling between and miles per hour.the boat then made a sharp turn and headed directly toward jeff and the victim.
jeff stood up,shouted,and waved his arms in an attempt to get the attention of the people on the motorboat.the motorboat continued on its path towards him and the victim,never decreasing speed.the motorboat hit the victim he was not moving.jeff jumped into the water to help his son and yelled for assistance.jeff friend,ross kelly,came over to assist.
three women,rocio pena,rocio alvarez,and kathy arroyo,helped get the victim out of the water and into their small aluminum fishing boat.kenneth and may peffer,who were on a large pontoon boat,saw pena and the women yelling and waving for help and went to the scene.the victim was transferred from the fishing boat to the pontoon boat.
kenneth and may estimated the victim was to feet from shore when he was hit.everyone assisting the victim was yelling to the people on shore to call.kenneth noted it would have been nearly impossible for someone to be in the area and not notice the commotion at the site of the collision.
the victim was taken to sierra marina on the pontoon boat,with jeff and another man rendering first aid.from there,the victim was transferred to an ambulance for transportation to valley children hospital.
deputy sheriffs william heuer and christopher tullus were at the marina when the pontoon boat arrived.jeff described for the deputies the motorboat that had hit his son.the motorboat was white on the bottom,with a yellow stripe on both sides,and had a wakeboard tower with yellow speakers attached to the tower.jeff saw two people on the motorboat.the operator had long dark hair and was wearing a red shirt,and the passenger had a circular tattoo on his right shoulder.both jeff and kelly identified guzman boat in a later photographic lineup as the boat that hit the victim.
according to alvarez,who had been on the aluminum fishing boat,the collision when the victim was hit produced an audible sound that could be heard clearly.the collision caused the motorboat to fishtail.the motorboat continued on for a short way,then stopped.the passenger went to the back of the motorboat and lifted the motor.the operator of the motorboat also came back to look.the passenger and operator talked to each other while pena,alvarez,and jeff were screaming at them to help the child.pena watched as the two men looked at where the child was in the water and then went to the front of the boat and headed for sierra marina.
heuer and tullus went out in their marked patrol boat to look for the motorboat that had hit the victim.as the deputies were leaving the marina,heuer saw a boat in a slip matching the description.as heuer was checking the cf number vessel registration number of the motorboat,guzman and kirby approached him and spontaneously stated that the boat looked like the one that hit the boy,but that their boat had not hit the boy.they told the deputies they had been part of the group on the pontoon boat that had helped the child after the collision.the two men provided heuer with their names,dates of birth,and telephone numbers.
when the victim arrived at the hospital,he was bleeding and had brain matter coming out of his forehead in the area between his eyes.he sustained fractures to the back of his head,from his forehead to the bridge of his nose,across his nose,and internal fractures to his skull.as a result of being hit by the motorboat,the victim suffered a brain injury and lost vision in one eye.peter witt opined that the injuries were consistent with being struck by a propeller.
on september,guzman boat was seized.the propeller was examined by harold kindsvater,who had extensive experience manufacturing and repairing propellers.the propeller attached to the motorboat had a bend in one blade it would have taken a tremendous amount of force to cause the bend.the damage could not have come from hitting a rock or wood because there was no damage to the paint surface.kindsvater stated the shaft of the propeller also had a bend in it.based on the bend in the propeller blade and the bend in the shaft,kindsvater opined that a person inside the boat would have felt a jolt when the damage occurred.
guzman was interviewed by sheriff detectives on september.guzman stated he was the only person who had driven his yellow and white boat that weekend.he admitted owning a red shirt and keeping it in the boat,but claimed he did not wear the shirt on september.he acknowledged drinking about six beers that day.guzman claimed the pontoon boat left the cove before he did.guzman stated that even when the bow of the boat is up,he can see in front of the boat.he stated it would not be possible for him to have hit someone and not know it.he denied hitting anyone with the boat that day.
guzman was charged with violating sections,subdivision a,using a boat in a reckless or negligent manner so as to endanger the life,limb,or property of another person,and,excessive speed by a boat in specified restricted areas.he also was charged with violating section,which requires the operator of a boat to stop and render assistance and provide identifying information when there has been an accident causing injury.a jury found guzman guilty of violating sections,subdivision a and,but was unable to reach a verdict on the section violation.
a second jury trial on the section charge commenced february,and on march the jury found guzman guilty.on april,the trial court sentenced guzman to a term of two years in state prison for violating section.guzman received a concurrent term of days for the section,subdivision a and section convictions.at the october,restitution hearing,guzman was ordered to pay in restitution to the victim and his parents.
guzman filed an appeal challenging his culpability for the accident in case no.he filed a separate appeal challenging the restitution order in case no.on guzman motion,this court ordered the appeals consolidated under case no.and directed briefs be filed in the consolidated appeal.
discussion 
guzman makes two contentions concerning the section conviction.first,he claims the jury instruction defining the section offense violated his constitutional rights because the written instruction stated the operator of a vessel is required to identify himself as the operator of the vessel involved in the collision.second,guzman argues the prosecutor misstated the law in closing argument and the misstatement violated his constitutional rights.
guzman did not challenge the restitution order in his briefs.
section instruction 
there is no pattern instruction for the section offense.the trial court instructed the jury with a modified version of calcrim,which is designed to instruct on vehicular accidents.guzman contends the modified instruction violated his constitutional right against.we disagree.
factual summary 
the modified calcrim written instruction read as follows 
the defendant is charged in count one with failing to perform a legal duty following a collision involving a vessel that caused injury to another person in violation of harbors and navigation code section.
to prove that the defendant is guilty of this crime,the people must prove that 
the defendant,while operating a vessel,was involved in a collision 
the collision caused injury to someone else 
the defendant knew that he had been involved in a collision 
the defendant knew another person was injured in the collision,or knew from the nature of the collision that it was probable that another person had been injured 
the defendant willfully failed to perform one or more of the following duties 
a to stop immediately at the scene of the collision 
b to provide reasonable assistance to any person injured in the collision 
c to give to the person injured or the occupants of any vessel involved in the collision or any peace officer at the scene of the collision all of the following information his name and current residence address 
the registration number of the vessel he was operating.
someone commits an act willfully when he does it willingly or on purpose.it is not required that he intend to break the law,hurt someone else,or gain any advantage.
the duty to stop immediately means that the operator must stop his vessel as soon as reasonably possible under the circumstances.
to provide reasonable assistance means the operator must determine what assistance,if any,the injured person needs and make a reasonable effort to see that such assistance is provided,either by the operator or someone else.reasonable assistance includes transporting anyone who has been injured for medical treatment,or arranging the transportation for such treatment,if it is apparent that treatment is necessary or if an injured person requests transportation.an operator is not required to provide assistance that is unnecessary or that is already being provided by someone else.however,the requirement that an operator provide assistance is not excused merely because bystanders are on the scene or could provide assistance.
the operator of a vessel must perform the duties listed regardless of who was injured and regardless of how or why the collision happened.it does not matter if someone else caused the collision or if the collision was unavoidable.
when providing his name and address,the operator is required to identify himself as the operator of a vessel involved in the collision.
you may not find the defendant guilty unless all of you agree that the people have proved that the defendant failed to perform at least one of the required duties.you must all agree on which duty the defendant failed to perform.italics added.
prior to instructing the jury,the trial court inquired if defense counsel had any objection to the proposed instructions in that final wording,to which defense counsel responded,no.the trial court and defense counsel discussed the modified calcrim instruction,including specifically discussing the provision requiring the operator of the vessel to identify himself as the operator.the trial court noted that defense counsel had submitted a proposed version that included this provision twice the trial court listed the provision once.
later,when the trial court verbally instructed the jury,the italicized portion of the instruction was omitted.the trial court informed the jury it would receive a written copy of all instructions given.the written version of the modified calcrim instruction included the language stating section required the operator of the vessel to identify himself as the operator of a vessel involved in a collision.
in determining whether disclosure of information threatens,several factors are considered,including whether the disclosure targets a highly selected group inherently suspect of criminal activities,rather than the public at large,and whether the requirement involves an area permeated with criminal statutes rather than an essentially regulatory area of inquiry.california byers,byers.
in byers,the united states supreme court upheld vehicle code section,which requires drivers of motor vehicles involved in accidents to stop at the scene of the accident and provide their names and addresses.the united states supreme court determined that the statute in question was essentially regulatory,not criminal.byers,supra,at.the byers court stressed that california law did not make it a criminal offense to be involved in a vehicle accident.id.at.although identity may lead to inquiry that in turn leads to arrest and charge,those developments depend on different factors and independent evidence.id.at.
because there is no pattern instruction for section offenses,the trial court gave a modified version of calcrim,which addresses various vehicle code violations,including sections,and.the bench notes to calcrim state that the paragraph requiring the driver to identify himself or herself as such should be given if there is evidence that the defendant stopped and identified himself or herself but not in a way that made it apparent to the other parties that the defendant was the driver.judicial council of,crim.jury instns.bench notes to calcrim.
this bench note to calcrim cites the case of people kroncke th kroncke as authority for this language in the instruction.in kroncke,the defendant was driving his vehicle on the freeway when his passenger suddenly jumped out of the moving vehicle,causing fatal injuries.the defendant continued driving and got off at the next freeway exit.id.at.the defendant returned to the scene of the accident at about the time the police arrived.id.at.the defendant told officers he was driving when he saw the victim body lying on the side of the road and that he did know how the victim had been injured.he gave law enforcement his name and address.id.at.several weeks after the accident,the defendant contacted the officer in charge of the case and explained that he had been driving his vehicle when the victim jumped out of the car.id.at.the defendant was charged with violating vehicle code sections and,the statutes.kroncke,at.
