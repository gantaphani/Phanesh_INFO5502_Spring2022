the snoqualmie tribe petitions for review of a decision of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc granting puget sound energy,pse a license to operate for another forty years the snoqualmie falls hydroelectric project.the tribe argues that ferc relicensing decision violates the religious freedom restoration act rfra because ferc employed the wrong legal standard for reviewing claims under rfra and because substantial evidence does not support ferc conclusion that the relicensing decision does not substantially burden the tribe free exercise of religion.the tribe also asserts that ferc failed to consult with the tribe on a basis in violation of the national historic preservation act nhpa.pse for review of ferc decision to impose water flow requirements that exceed those established in the washington state department of ecology ecology water quality certification wqc.
we have jurisdiction under b.after hearing argument in this appeal,we vacated submission pending publication of navajo nation forest,cir.en banc.in reliance on that opinion,we now issue our decision in this case.we deny the petitions for review.
first,substantial evidence supports ferc finding that the relicensing decision does not substantially burden the tribe free exercise of religion.second,we conclude that,although ferc employed the wrong standard for analyzing rfra claims,this error was harmless because ferc standard was more generous to plaintiffs than the standard we have now articulated in navajo nation and the tribe has failed to demonstrate a substantial burden that would meet the navajo nation standard.third,because the record for purposes of nhpa consultation closed in the tribe gained federal recognition in was not obligated to consult with the tribe on a basis.finally,ferc amendment of the license order minimum instream flow provisions did not conflict with the conditions in ecology wqc and was supported by substantial evidence.
snoqualmie falls is a waterfall about thirty miles east of seattle on the snoqualmie river as it flows down from the cascade mountains.if the snoqualmie river flowed freely over the falls,water flows in years of normal rainfall would exceed cubic feet per second cfs eighty percent of the time.
puget sound power and light,predecessor to pse,constructed a hydroelectric power plant at the falls in.the federal power commission issued a license for the project in.puget sound power light.the project consists of a diversion dam located upstream from the falls,an underground power plant,and an power plant downstream of the falls,with a total generating capacity of megawatts.electricity produced by the project annually averages about megawatt hours,depending upon rainfall.the license mandated that pse maintain an instream flow of cfs over the falls during daylight hours.
the falls is considered a sacred site by the few hundred enrolled members who today comprise the snoqualmie tribe.the falls plays a central role in the tribe creation story and is an important location for its religious practices.the tribe believes that the mist generated by the falls connects the earth to the heavens and that a powerful water spirit lives in the plunge pool below the falls.a article by anthropologist kenneth tollefson and sociologist martin abbott found that t he falls provides a place for contemporary snoqualmie to gather to pray,to meditate,to worship,and to renew their contact with their ancestors and their spiritual powers.the tribe performs religious ceremonies at the falls,including vision quests,often events in which individual tribal members seek spiritual contact through meditation,fasting,and bathing in the water below the falls.the falls has been designated as eligible for listing on the national register of historic places as a traditional cultural property.
on november,pse filed an application with ferc for the relicensing of its hydroelectric project pursuant to the federal power act.as required by the clean water act,cwa,pse also requested a wqc from the department of ecology.ecology issued a wqc for the project on september.the wqc specified minimum water flows over the falls,ramping rates,and water quality monitoring.
in evaluating pse license application,ferc considered several alternatives,including the proposed action pse proposal to increase water diversion by an additional cfs and to make major structural modifications,a minor upgrade refurbishment of the existing project and a substantial increase in flows,and the tribe preferred alternative decommissioning the entire project.ferc took the middle ground and ultimately recommended and licensed the minor upgrade.
as part of the nhpa process,pse prepared and submitted a cultural resources mitigation and management plan cultural plan and a historical resources mitigation and management plan historical plan on february.on december,ferc filed a letter requesting the advisory council on historic preservation to sign the programmatic agreement,which implemented these plans,and indicated that the requirements of had been satisfied.on january,the advisory council signed the programmatic agreement,thus closing the record for purposes of nhpa.the snoqualmie tribe did not achieve federal recognition until october.see final determination to acknowledge the snoqualmie tribal organization.
on june,ferc issued an order relicensing the project the license order.as required by of the cwa,d,ferc made compliance with the wqc a condition of the license.in the license order,ferc adopted the minimum water flows established in the wqc except for requiring greater water flows during labor day weekend.the resulting mandated minimum flows,as set forth in article and appendix a,were as follows may cfs at all times june cfs at all times july cfs during daytime and cfs during except weekends and holidays,which require cfs at all times september cfs during daytime and cfs during nighttime except labor day weekend,which requires cfs during daytime.
on july,the tribe filed a request for rehearing and stay of the license order.on august,ferc temporarily granted rehearing for further consideration.on march,ferc issued an order partially granting and partially denying the tribe request and denying a stay the first rehearing order.ferc revised article of the license to require cfs at all times during may and june,thus conforming the license to the higher minimum daytime flows recommended by ferc staff in the final environmental impact statement eis.on april,the tribe petitioned us to review the first rehearing order.
on march,pse requested that ferc rehear the first rehearing order pursuant to a.on june,ferc issued an order denying pse request for rehearing the second rehearing order.on july,pse petitioned for review of the second rehearing order.
we granted pse and the tribe motions to intervene in the petition for review proceedings.the washington department of ecology was also granted intervention.we granted the parties joint motion to consolidate the proceedings.this consolidated appeal challenges the licensing order,first rehearing order,and second rehearing order collectively,the relicensing decision.

rfra provides that the government shall not substantially burden a person exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability unless the government demonstrates that application of the burden to the person is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.a b.this statute was congress response to a first amendment decision of the supreme court that,in congress view,virtually eliminated the requirement that the government justify burdens on religious exercise imposed by laws neutral toward religion.id.a.rfra restores the compelling interest test set forth in sherbert verner,d,and wisconsin yoder,d,and guarantee s its application in all cases where free exercise of religion is substantially burdened.b see also navajo nation,at.
the tribe contends that ferc violated rfra by employing the wrong definition of substantial burden when issuing the first rehearing order and license order the tribe also argues that ferc ultimate conclusion that the hydroelectric project does not substantially burden the tribe religious exercise is not supported by substantial evidence because the continued operation of the hydroelectric project prevents the tribe from having necessary religious experiences in three ways its operation deprives the tribe of access to the falls for vision quests and other religious experiences,eliminates the mist necessary for the tribe religious experiences,and alters the ancient sacred cycle of water flowing over the falls.
in our recent en banc decision in navajo nation,we reconsidered what constitutes a substantial burden under rfra,adopting a narrower definition of that term than we had in prior decisions.there,the plaintiff tribe challenged the federal government approval of the use for skiing of artificial snow containing recycled wastewater of which was comprised of human waste.the tribe asserted that use of the artificial snow on a mountain it considered sacred desecrates the entire mountain,deprecates its religious ceremonies,and injures its religious sensibilities.at.
we disagreed.central to resolution of that case was whether use of the recycled wastewater imposed a substantial burden on the plaintiff tribe exercise of its religion.we reiterated congressional intent to restore the compelling interest test as set forth in sherbert verner,d,and wisconsin yoder,d,and to guarantee its application in all cases where free exercise of religion is substantially burdened.navajo nation,at,quoting b.plainly,congress intended that for rfra to apply,a government enactment first burden the exercise of religion and then do so substantially.we emphasized that the government is not required to prove a compelling interest for its action or that its action involves the least restrictive means to achieve its purpose,unless the plaintiff first proves the government action substantially burdens his exercise of religion.id.emphasis added.
the term substantial burden,as used in rfra,expressly adopted and restored sherbert,yoder,and federal court rulings,id.at,as a workable test for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and competing governmental interests.id.at,quoting a.these cases led us to conclude 
under rfra,a substantial burden is imposed only when individuals are forced to choose between following the tenets of their religion and receiving a governmental benefit sherbert or are coerced to act contrary to their religious beliefs by the threat of civil or criminal sanctions yoder.
thus,when a pplying sherbert and yoder,we concluded there is no substantial burden on the plaintiff tribe exercise of religion in this case.id.
the use of recycled wastewater on a ski area that covers one percent of the peaks does not force the plaintiffs to choose between following the tenets of their religion and receiving a governmental benefit,as in sherbert.the use of recycled wastewater to make artificial snow also does not coerce the plaintiffs to act contrary to their religion under the threat of civil or criminal sanctions,as in yoder.the plaintiffs are not fined or penalized in any way for practicing their religion on the peaks or on the snowbowl.quite the contrary the forest service has guaranteed that religious practitioners would still have access to the snowbowl and the rest of the peaks for religious purposes.
the only effect of the proposed upgrades is on the plaintiffs subjective,emotional religious experience.that is,the presence of recycled wastewater on the peaks is offensive to the plaintiffs religious sensibilities.to plaintiffs,it will spiritually desecrate a sacred mountain and will decrease the spiritual fulfillment they get from practicing their religion on the mountain.nevertheless,under supreme court precedent,the diminishment of spiritual though it may not a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion.

navajo nation is dispositive here.the tribe arguments that the dam interferes with the ability of tribal members to practice religion are irrelevant to whether the hydroelectric project either forces them to choose between practicing their religion and receiving a government benefit or coerces them into a situation exercise of their religion under fear of civil or criminal sanction.after reviewing the voluminous record in this case,we have not found any evidence demonstrating that snoqualmie tribe members will lose a government benefit or face criminal or civil sanctions for practicing their religion.we therefore hold that substantial evidence supports ferc decision relicensing the project and that it does not impose a substantial burden under rfra on the tribal members ability to exercise their religion,as we have defined substantial burden in navajo nation.
in light of navajo nation,the tribe argument that ferc violated rfra fails because,although it did not have the benefit of our recent en banc decision to guide it,the standard ferc applied,though erroneous in hindsight,was more favorable to the tribe,and thus any error was harmless.in the license order ferc stated 
rfra appears to apply to situations in which the government has either prohibited an individual religious practice or required an individual to take some action contrary to his or her religion fn.not to situations in which the government took some action which incidentally affected the quality of an individual religious experience.fn.the issuance of a new license will not require the snoqualmie to violate their religious beliefs.nor does it prohibit or prevent the snoqualmies access to snoqualmie falls,their possession and use of religious objects,or the performance of religious ceremonies.
footnote of the order notes that rfra states that federal activities which inhibit the free exercise of any religion must satisfy a compelling government interest and must be the least restrictive means to accomplish the purpose.footnote cites to sherbert,d,and yoder,d,whose compelling interest test rfra was intended to restore.
even if ferc definition of substantial burden in its license order comported with our elucidation of what a religious adherent must prove to establish a rfra violation at the time ferc issued the license order,its articulation of the substantial burden test is inconsistent with
