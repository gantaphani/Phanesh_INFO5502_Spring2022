this appeal requires us to construe certain provisions in the taxpayer initiative proposition cal,arts.xiii c,xiii d distinguishing between what may properly be classified as a water or sewer fee,exempt from a requirement for ballot approval by a majority of affected property owners,and an assessment for which such a vote is mandated.we conclude that a minimum charge imposed on parcels with connections to a water district utility systems for the basic cost of providing water or sewer service,regardless of actual use,is a charge for an immediately available water or sewer service as defined in article xiii d,section,subdivision b,and consequently does not require ballot approval by affected owners.we therefore affirm the trial court judgment for the water district.
background 
the brooktrails township community services district district was formed to provide water and sewer service to about real property parcels in or near willits,california,et about of the parcels are currently connected to the district water system,and about are connected to its sewer system.the rest of the parcels are undeveloped and not yet connected to the district utility systems.parcels not connected to the water and sewer systems are charged annual water availability and sewer standby fees.parcels connected to the water and sewer systems are charged connection fees at the time of hookup to the systems,and thereafter fixed monthly water and sewer base rates,as well as inclining rates for water service.the sewer connection is not a metered service,and is therefore not subject to a usage charge beyond the monthly base rate.
appellant david paland,a property owner in the district,connected his parcel to the water and sewer systems in and paid in connection fees.in the decades that followed,he periodically discontinued his water service when he was away from his home for extended periods of time or when he asserts he could not afford the service.on such occasions,he was historically charged a prorated amount of the water and sewer base rates for the month in which his service was discontinued and was not charged again until he requested reactivation of his water service.until,it was district policy not to charge base rates to parcels with existing connections that were inactive because the parcels were either undeveloped or unoccupied,or because the owners had temporarily discontinued their service.
the district changed its policy in.at the time,the state department of health services had imposed a moratorium on new connections pending an increase in the district water storage capacity.the department of health services mandates increased the district capital investment costs and eliminated its income from new connections on march,the district board of directors board decided to begin charging established monthly base rates to parcels with existing utility connections,regardless of whether the owner was actually using the district services on april,district general manager michael chapman wrote to paland and other property owners with currently or periodically inactive water meters informing them of the change of policy.
paland protested the new policy.he questioned board statutory authority to impose monthly base rates on inactive connections,arguing that the practice was in the nature of a standby fee and that the board had not complied with proposition or due process.although the board did not rescind its policy,paland took no immediate legal action because he did not become aware that the thing had actually gone through as any kind of ordinance he did not discontinue his water service between and.
in late,paland fell behind on his monthly bills.in october,the district notified him that his service would be shut off if he did not pay the arrears.in a letter to the district general manager dated december,paland wrote that his water had been turned off,that he would pay the arrears as soon as he could,that he could not afford to pay ongoing base rates because he was unemployed,and,for that reason,i have no plans to ask you to turn the water back on until i can afford the huge base rate.by the end of january,paland apparently had paid his arrears through november.paland subsequent monthly bills reflect no actual water usage.the district,however,continued to charge paland the monthly base rates for both water and sewer services.
on may,paland sued the board for declaratory and injunctive relief.he alleged that in,pursuant to the policy,the district began charging him monthly base rates as adopted in res.on june,for time periods when he had requested that his water service be turned off.he again argued the monthly base rates,when charged to customers whose water service had been turned off,were standby charges subject to the owner voting requirements of article xiii d,section,and that the district had failed to comply with those requirements.he sought a declaration that resolution was invalid on its face and as applied to him and also sought an injunction barring the resolution enforcement prior to complying with applicable voting laws.the district filed a demurrer on the ground that the complaint was filed outside the limitations period of section,which provides that any judicial action to challenge a local agency resolution adopting a new fee or service charge must be commenced within days of the effective date of the resolution,subd.a.the court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.
paland filed an amended complaint alleging that the district adopted new water and sewer base rates on june,in resolution,that the resolution was subject to the requirements of article xiii d,section,and that the district had not complied with those requirements.the board answered the amended complaint and filed a motion to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds.the trial court ruled that paland renewed challenge to the policy was,but his challenge to the action of the board was not.
trial took place on july.at the conclusion of the trial,the court made the following oral ruling as to the request for declaratory relief as to resolution,the court finds that the defendant or respondent resolution is constitutionally valid and in compliance with all applicable law.it appears that the appropriate procedures under prop for changing a rate and having it be in proportion,giving due notice to those affected,if they applied at all,were followed in this case.on the other hand,i think that what is driving this litigation is a fundamental confusion about whether the type of fees that petitioner,paland,is challenging are in fact standby fees or assessments.the court finds that they are not.the water and sewer fees in question are in fact user fees which can be increased to reflect capital improvements,changes in costs for providing the service,and that a base rate is a proper and important component of such a change in fee.for these reasons the court denies the request for injunctive relief and finds that petitioner or plaintiff shall take nothing by his complaint.the court entered judgment for the board.
discussion 
the core issue in this appeal is whether the imposition of minimum monthly water and sewer base rates on parcels connected to the district utility systems,regardless of actual usage,is a property assessment subject to owner ballot approval requirements adopted in proposition art.xiii d,or is instead a fee or charge for a service exempted from those requirements art.xiii d,subd.c paland argues only that the district failed to comply with proposition procedural and voting requirements for assessments,and does not contend that the district failed to comply with requirements for imposition of water or sewer fees.we conclude the disputed charges are fees and not assessments as defined in the initiative.
in,california voters passed proposition,which added articles xiii c and xiii d to the california constitution.the initiative was intended to close perceived loopholes in the restrictions on property taxes imposed by proposition apartment of los angeles county,city of los angeles cal th,d,howard jarvis taxpayers city of riverside th,d riverside.articles xiii c and xiii d allow only four types of local property taxes an ad valorem property tax a special tax an assessment and a fee or charge.riverside,supra,at,d.article xiii c imposes restrictions on general and special property taxes in addition to those imposed under article xiii a,and requires voter approval for any general or special tax imposed by a local governmental entity.the second component of proposition,article xiii d,is addressed to assessment and fee reform,and it undertakes to constrain the imposition by local governments of assessments,fees and charges.art.xiii d.pajaro valley water management agency amrhein th,d.article xiii d sets forth procedures,requirements and voter approval mechanisms for local government assessments,fees and charges.howard jarvis taxpayers city of roseville th,d roseville.
for new or increased property assessments,article xiii d requires agencies to obtain an engineer report on the assessment and mail detailed notice to affected property owners,explaining the reason for and the method of calculating the assessment and identifying the amount chargeable to the owner particular parcel.art.xiii d,subds.b,c.the notice must provide the date,time,and place of a public hearing on the assessment,include a ballot whereby the owner may indicate his or her name,reasonable identification of the parcel,and his or her support or opposition to the proposed assessment,and conspicuously describe the procedures for tabulation of those ballots.art.xiii d,subds.c,d.when tabulated at the public hearing,the ballots are weighted according to the proportional financial obligation of each affected parcel.art.xiii d,subd.e.if a majority of the weighted ballots oppose the assessment,it may not be imposed.ibid.
for new or increased fees,the initiative also requires detailed mailed notice to affected property owners,explaining the proposed fee and announcing a public hearing.art.xiii d,subd.a.however,no formal balloting is required at this stage of the process.ibid.instead,a t the public hearing,the agency shall consider all protests against the proposed fee or charge.if written protests against the proposed fee or charge are presented by a majority of owners of the identified parcels,the agency shall not impose the fee or charge.art.xiii d,subd.a.if a majority protest does not occur,then,e xcept for fees or charges for sewer,water,and refuse collection services,the fee still may not be imposed or increased unless and until that fee or charge is submitted and approved by a majority vote of the property owners of the property subject to the fee or charge or,at the option of the agency,by a vote of the electorate residing in the affected area.art.xiii d,subd.c,italics added.
in short,if the monthly water and sewer base rates charged to paland were assessments,ballot approval of the base rates was required under article xiii d,section.if,however,the base rates are fees,only a majority protest hearing was required because water and sewer and refuse collection fees are exempt from the ballot approval requirement for fees set forth in article xiii d,section,subdivision c.
the narrow focus of this dispute is the proper interpretation and application of article xiii d,section,subdivision b,which distinguishes between fees and assessments a fee or charge shall not be extended,imposed,or increased by any agency unless it meets all of the following requirements no fee or charge may be imposed for a service unless that service is actually used by,or immediately available to,the owner of the property in question.fees or charges based on potential or future use of a service are not permitted.standby charges,whether characterized as charges or assessments,shall be classified as assessments and shall not be imposed without compliance with section.art.xiii d,subd.b,italics added.
paland argues that,despite the existence of a metered connection for water service at his parcel,that service is still not immediately available to him,and to those similarly situated with inactive connections,and therefore the imposition of minimum base rates on such parcels is a standby charge that must be classified as an assessment under article xiii d,section,subdivision b he asserts that water service is not immediately available to him when his connection is inactive because the district would have to unlock his water meter before he could use the service.also,he argues the service is not immediately available because the district will not unlock his meter unless he pays his bills.in his view,the service is not immediately available unless he can twist his tap and turn on the water.if,as paland contends,the minimum monthly base rate charged by the district is indeed a standby charge,it would unquestionably be subject to article xiii d,section assessment approval procedures.art.xiii d,subd.a keller chowchilla water dist.th,d keller.
our supreme court has also indicated,however,that domestic water delivery through a pipeline is a service within the meaning of article xiii d.richmond,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,once a property owner has paid the connection charges and has become a customer of a public water agency,all charges for water delivery incurred thereafter are charges for a service,whether the charge is calculated on the basis of consumption or is imposed as a fixed monthly fee.bighorn,supra,cal th at,d,italics added,fn.omitted.at least as to fees and charges that are property related,section of california constitution article xiii d would appear to embody the electorate intent as to when should be required,or not required,before existing fees may be increased or new fees imposed,and the electorate chose not to impose a requirement for increases in water service charges.id.at,d.as a consequence,so long as the water service is immediately available to paland,it is exempt from the requirement for property owner approval.
as far as we are aware,no published decision has yet directly addressed the precise question before us how to distinguish between charges for services that are immediately available to property owners though not actually used,which are fees under the initiative,and standby charges for potential or future use of a service,which are defined as assessments.in keller,the court was not presented with the issue because the parties agreed that the charges in dispute were standby charges that are classified as assessments under proposition.keller,supra,th at,d.keller states the charges were levied on all property capable of receiving water from the district,even if the property owners did not use the district water,but the opinion does not clarify whether capable of receiving water meant that the affected parcels were all already connected to the water system,could be connected to the water system immediately at the owner will,or could be connected once construction of the district water system was completed at some future date.see also id.at,d.in bighorn,the supreme court,considering the validity of a voter initiative to reduce domestic water rates and to require voter approval for future increases,held that water delivery rates charged to parcels with connections were fees within the meaning of article xiii d,section regardless of whether they were based on usage or were flat monthly fees used to pay the system fixed costs.bighorn,supra,cal th at,d,rejecting argument that rates based on usage were not subject to proposition see also richmond,supra,cal th at,d,a public water agency charges for ongoing water delivery are fees and charges within the meaning of article xiii d.similarly,in roseville,the third district held that charges imposed on parcels with connections to the agency water and sewer systems irrespective of use were fees within the meaning of article xiii d,section.roseville,supra,th at,d rejecting an argument that the fees were not subject to proposition.none of these cases considered inactive connections,or what constituted an immediately available service.
when interpreting a provision of our state constitution,our aim is to determine and effectuate the intent of those who enacted the constitutional provision at issue.citation.when,as here,the voters enacted the p
