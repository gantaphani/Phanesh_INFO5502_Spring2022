this case arises out of a dispute over a pipeline used by plaintiffs rodney and jan barnes to divert water from south deep creek in modoc county for use on their nearby ranch,which consists of two noncontiguous parcels known as the street property and the tyeryar property.on its way from the creek to the street property,the pipeline crosses property owned by defendants john and linda hussa known as the vawter property 
after the barneses extended the pipeline to serve the tyeryar property as well as the street property,the hussas attempted to revoke their permission for the pipeline to cross the vawter property and tried to dig up the pipeline.the barneses commenced this action to stop them.in response,the hussas against the barneses,contending the barneses were violating a court decree regarding the rights to the water from deep creek by using the pipeline to supply water to the tyeryar property.
the trial court decided the barneses have an irrevocable license to continue using the pipeline,the barneses are not violating the decree by using the pipeline to convey water to the tyeryar property,and the hussas did not prove the barneses predecessors forfeited the right to any water that will not fit through the pipeline.
on appeal,the hussas challenge these conclusions.finding no error,we will affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
deep creek is a natural stream of water in modoc county that arises on the eastern slope of the warner range and flows eastward into surprise valley.two forks of the deep creek and south deep near the base of the mountains,south of cedarville,and from there the creek flows approximately two miles east into middle alkali lake.
this case involves water diverted from south deep creek under a court decree from.because the terms of that decree are central to the issues before us,we pause to describe the decree in some detail.
the decree identified various parcels of land of various acreage that were irrigated from deep creek.of particular interest here are three parcels known as the hussa property,the street property,and the tyeryar property.the tyeryar property lies downhill of but is not contiguous to the street property.
the decree allotted between the owners of the various properties around deep creek the right to use the natural flow of the creek for domestic,stock watering,and irrigation purposes in various quantities and subject to various priorities,to be diverted at specific diversion points through specific ditches.the quantities allotted the various parties were expressed in cubic feet per second cfs and totaled.
the decree recognized five different priority classes first through fifth and generally provided as follows in paragraph all allotments hereinabove provided,which are within the same priority class,are equal in priority and correlative in right and at all times when the water supply available for rights within a priority class is inadequate to supply all rights and allotments within said class,then during the continuance of such shortage,the owners of such allotments shall prorate the available supply,if any,in excess of the quantity required for prior rights,in accordance with their respective allotments for that class,except as otherwise hereinbefore provided.
the dispute in this case involves first priority water diverted from south deep creek into the sharp and messier ditch diversion and the dodson ditch diversion.under the decree,three,hussa,and given the right to divert first priority water at these locations for use on their properties.more specifically,the decree allotted bush cfs,hussa cfs,and street cfs a total of cfs the decree further provided,however,that at all times when the flow in south deep creek is less than cubic feet per second,measured at the head of the sharp and messier ditch then all of such water,or as much thereof as is directly applied to beneficial use,may be diverted by street,bush,and hussa through either the sharp and messier ditch or the dodson ditch,said water to be prorated among said street,bush,and hussa in accordance with their respective allotments of first priority class for said sharp and messier and dodson ditches.in essence,this provision gave bush percent of the flow,hussa percent of the flow,and street percent of the flow in what we will call low flow conditions,when the flow of south deep creek at the head of the sharp and messier ditch was less than cfs 
the tyeryar property has no first priority rights to water from deep creek under the decree,but it does have second and third priority rights at various diversion points downstream of diversions and.
the decree further provided that all allotments were to be measured at their respective points of diversion paragraph the division of water resources or its successor in the administration of the water commission act was to supervise diversions from deep creek through a watermaster to insure strict adherence to the provisions of this decree paragraph and all parties and their successors were perpetually enjoined and restrained from doing anything in violation of the terms or provisions of this decree,or diverting any water from said deep creek and its tributaries at any time in violation of the terms hereof,or from doing anything that will obstruct or interfere with any other right in this decree adjudged and decreed paragraph.
we now jump forward years,to approximately.by that time,the hussas had acquired a parcel known as the vawter property,which lies between diversion and the street property.the owner of the street property at that time obtained permission from the hussas to install a pipeline pipeline from diversion,under the vawter property,to the street property,to convey water from south deep creek that otherwise would be conveyed through the sharp and messier ditch.this pipeline has a carrying capacity of approximately.to enough to carry the entire amount of first priority water allotted to the street property under the decree.
the barneses acquired the tyeryar property in and then acquired the street property in.in the early,the barneses extended pipeline by installing another pipeline pipeline from the street property to the tyeryar property.this allowed the barneses to convey a portion of their first priority water from the street property to the tyeryar property.
in,the hussas complained to the department of water resources about this practice.eventually,in june and then again in april,the hussas notified the barneses that the permission to maintain pipeline across the vawter property was revoked.in the latter letter,the hussas told the barneses they had until may to make other arrangements for the transfer of their water.
on may,the barneses commenced this action against the hussas,seeking an injunction preventing the hussas from interfering with pipeline and a declaration that the barneses have an irrevocable right to continue using that pipeline.that same day,the barneses obtained an ex parte temporary restraining order against the hussas which was apparently served on john hussa later that day as he was attempting to dig up the pipeline with a backhoe.
in june,the court issued a preliminary injunction precluding the hussas from interfering with pipeline during the pendency of the proceeding.
in september,the hussas filed a for declaratory and injunctive relief and contempt.among other things,the hussas claimed the barneses use of pipeline to convey water from the street property to the tyeryar property violated the decree.
the case came to trial in june.in a closing brief,the hussas argued for the first time that the right to take more water for the street property than would fit in the pipeline had been forfeited before the barneses bought the property because for a period longer than five years the prior owners did not use any of this excess water 
in december,the trial court issued its final decision.as relevant here,the court found the barneses had an irrevocable license to use pipeline to convey water from south deep creek to the street property the hussas are not substantially harmed by the extension of the pipeline to the tyeryar property in that they may still receive on the hussa property all of the water adjudicated to it in accordance with the decree and there were no facts or evidence to support the hussas claim of forfeiture.
the hussas filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment against them.
discussion 
iinjuryaburden of proof 
the hussas first contend the trial court erred in determining they were not injured in the court words,substantially harmed by the extension of the pipeline from the street property to the tyeryar property.we find no error.
because this case involves appropriative water rights originally acquired before the water commission act took effect in,see hutchins,the california law of water rights it is governed by water code section,which provides that t he person entitled to the use of water by virtue of an appropriation other than under the water commission act or this code may change the point of diversion,place of use,or purpose of use if others are not injured by such change,and may extend the ditch,flume,pipe,or aqueduct by which the diversion is made to places beyond that where the first use was made.
under this provision,a person can change the place where appropriated water is used as long as that change does not adversely affect the rights of others to the water involved.see,kidd laird cal,wl hill smith cal,state water resources control board cases th,d.
citing water code sections and and peabody city of vallejo cal d,the hussas contend that as the persons seeking to change the place of use,the barneses bore the burden of demonstrating that the change would not harm or injure other legal users of the water.the hussas are mistaken.
the hussas reliance on water code section is misplaced because that statute does not specify who bears the burden of proof.the same is true of water code section peabody is of assistance,but it does not support the hussas position.in peabody,our supreme court noted the then prevailing general rule in this state as to the burden of proof,which was that t he party holding the affirmative of the issue must produce the evidence to prove it.peabody city of vallejo,supra,cal d at,quoting former code civ.the court then stated,however,that when one enters a field of water supply and seeks by appropriation to take water from such supply on the claim that there is more than sufficient for all reasonable beneficial uses by those who have the prior and preferential right,it would seem to comport with the principles of fairness and justice that the appropriator,in whatever way the issue may arise,should have the burden of proving that such excess exists.peabody,at.
obviously,the latter passage from peabody is of no assistance here,since the barneses were not seeking to establish the existence of excess water available for a new appropriation notwithstanding preexisting rights.peabody reference to the general rule as to the burden of proof is helpful,however.that rule,now found in evidence code section,is that a party has the burden of proof as to each fact the existence or nonexistence of which is essential to the claim for relief or defense that he is asserting.
here,it is the hussas who seek to enjoin the barneses conveyance of first priority water through a pipeline to the tyeryar property,and thus it is the hussas who must establish that the change of place of use from the street property to the tyeryar property injures their right to water from south deep creek.thus,the hussas bore the burden of proving such injury.see brown smith cal,wl in a similar case,it was incumbent on the plaintiff to prove that defendant had diverted more water from rabbit creek than he was entitled to,and that he plaintiff had been injured thereby.
the right to first priority water 
since the trial court essentially found the hussas were not injured by the barneses conveyance of first priority water to the tyeryar property,the question before us is whether the hussas made a showing in the trial court which required that court to find they were injured.the hussas contend this showing was made because the use of first priority water on the tyeryar property has deprived them of first priority water they are entitled to use on the hussa property.they assert that,under the decree,if the barneses do not use their entire allotment of first priority water on the street property in low flow conditions,the unused portion of the allotment goes back into the available supply to be prorated between the other two properties in accordance with their respective allotments.in summary,the decree provides that first priority water that is not reasonably and beneficially used on specifically designated parcels is to remain in a common pool to be prorated between the other first priority parcels to the extent such water is reasonably and beneficially used on the specified acreage.thus,the hussas contend they along with bush successor are entitled to any first priority water the barneses do not put to beneficial use on the street property in low flow conditions,and they are injured by the barneses conveyance of that water to the tyeryar property.
we are not persuaded.the hussas do not point to anything in the decree to support their assertion that under the decree any unused first priority water in low flow conditions belongs to the other first priority users,thus enlarging their rights.the hussas claim t he undisputed testimony of the watermaster witnesses and barnes comport with this interpretation,but we do not agree.in any event,even if the witnesses did express this understanding of the decree,it would not assist the hussas unless the witnesses interpretation of the decree were a reasonable one.just because a witness interprets a document a particular way does not mean the document is reasonably susceptible to that interpretation.
here,the decree is silent on what happens to first priority water that is not put to use by one of the first priority users.in fact,one of the witnesses from the department of water resources which is responsible for providing the watermasters who supervise diversions under the decree admitted this fact and essentially testified that the water master has to make decisions what to do when a water user does not use the water to which he is entitled.it thus appears to be a practice of the watermasters,not compelled by the decree itself,to allocate unused first priority water among other first priority users who are already using their own first priority water,rather than making that water available to lower priority users.
change of place of use 
in any event,even if we were to assume the hussas have a right under the decree to first priority water not used by the barneses,that fact alone would not establish injury because the barneses are using their first priority are just using it on the tyeryar property,rather than the street property.thus,to establish injury,the hussas had to show they have a right under the decree to first priority water not used by the barneses on the street property.they did not make that showing.
the decree did provide that the allotments of water from deep creek and its tributaries as hereinafter set forth are for use upon the acreages described in schedule hereunto annexed and made a part hereof and that the parties are entitled to rights in and to the use of the natural flow of deep creek and its tributaries upon their respective lands as described in schedule hereof.thus,the decree contemplated that the first priority water to which street was entitled would be used on the acres of irrigated land on the property she,the street property.in,however,it had long been the law of california as it still is today that the person entitled to the use of water may change the place of diversion,or the place where it is used,or the use to which it was first applied,if others are not injured by such change.ramelli irish cal,see generally hutchins,the california law of water rights,supra,change in place of use.accordingly,although the decree contemplated the water to which street was entitled would be used on the street property,the law allowed street her successors to use that water elsewhere,if they could do so without injuring the righ
