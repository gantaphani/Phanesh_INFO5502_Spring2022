factual background and procedural history 
factual background 
the lakes water system lws was created in the late through the early to provide the city with potable water.the city first constructed a diversion dam coupled with a inch transmission pipeline,which brought water from solano county green valley to the city the green line.after completing the dam,the city created two reservoirs,lake frey completed in and lake madigan completed in.the lws was one of the first municipal water projects in california.
lake frey and lake madigan were soon insufficient to meet the demands of the city rapidly growing population.the city then applied for a permit to store of water in the hills above napa county gordon valley.subsequently,the city constructed a dam and reservoir in napa county known as lake curry completed in,along with a inch transmission line to transport water from lake curry to the city the gordon line.upon completion,the lws consisted of three large reservoirs,two dams,thousands of acres of land and watershed,and dozens of miles of pipes,which conveyed needed water to the city.
in order to transport the water from the three reservoirs,the city acquired easements from some of the property owners along the green line,the gordon line,and elsewhere within the lws service area.in exchange for these easements,the city agreed in writing to provide a certain quantity of free water to the owners of the servient estates in addition,the city agreed in writing to provide certain quantities of free water to other nonresident customers in exchange for riparian water rights.over the decades,the city agreed to provide potable water to other nonresident customers.these connections were made without a master plan.
from through the,the city municipal water needs were met exclusively by the lws.in the,the city obtained water rights from the sacramento river delta and contracted for water from the solano project.
in,water quality from lake curry ceased to meet water treatment standards adopted by the california department of health services.the city elected to stop using lake curry as a water source,closing a valve on the gordon line and stopping the flow of lws water to the city.the city then passed an ordinance the ordinance shifting percent of the cost of operating the lws to its approximately nonresident customers.prior to,these nonresidents had shared the cost of the lws with approximately metered connections within the city.as a result of the ordinance,water rates for the nonresident customers increased by over percent.
the city passed additional water rate increases by ordinances enacted in the ordinance and the ordinance.in addition to increasing water consumption charges,the ordinances increased the fixed service charges to the nonresident customers of the lws.plaintiff alleges in its complaint that current water rates within the lws are among the highest in the state 
on june,plaintiff,on behalf of the purported class of nonresident lws customers the class,entered into a tolling agreement with the city tolling agreement.the tolling agreement tolls any applicable statutes of limitations regarding a potential challenge to the rate increase which occurred in.the tolling agreement has been extended times,and expired on december.
according to plaintiff,the city has grossly mismanaged and neglected the lws,placing the burden on the class to fund a deteriorating,inefficient,and costly water system that is spread over an incoherent service area.in addition to water treatment plant improvements made between and that cost almost million,replacement cost for a mile section of the gordon line and a section of the green line are expected to be over million.all of these costs have been,or will be,passed on to the lws nonresident customers.plaintiff did not become aware of these unfunded liabilities until june.previously,the city had represented that the lws was free of liabilities and debt,even though it performed virtually no capital improvements to or replacements of the infrastructure between and.
plaintiff also alleges that the city had engaged in negotiations with a private utility to purchase the lws.reportedly,the city will only consider selling the lws to plaintiff or to a water district or service district created by plaintiff for a sum that is almost million over its already flawed appraised value of the lws.the extra sum reportedly represents a loan or subsidy that the city claims it extended to lws customers prior to.additionally,plaintiff complains that certain fees paid by class members have not been earmarked for lws improvements as required by city ordinances,but instead have been improperly used by the city for other unrelated purposes.

ii.the demurrer was properly sustained a s t o t he implied contract claims 
causes of action 
plaintiff represents that its implied contract claims,which it identifies as the first breach of implied contract,second breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and specific performance causes of action,are based on its theory that the city is contractually obligated to share in the cost of the lws pursuant to what plaintiff refers to as the historic al cost sharing ratio.the gist of these claims is that the city made an implied promise that it would indefinitely share in the cost of operating,maintaining and improving the lws and that the costs would be shared according to the historic al cost sharing ratio,a promise that it allegedly breached when it passed the,and ordinances.
as the city notes,plaintiff third cause of action is also based on an implied contract theory the city also correctly observes that the complaint claim,which is for specific performance of the alleged implied agreement,actually constitutes a remedy and is not itself a cause of action 
implied contracts 
the terms of an express contract are stated in words.citation.the existence and terms of an implied contract are manifested by conduct.citation.the distinction reflects no difference in legal effect but merely in the mode of manifesting assent.retired employees of orange county,county of orange cal th.the essential elements of a claim of breach of contract,whether express or implied,are the contract,the plaintiff performance or excuse for nonperformance,the defendant breach,and the resulting damages to the plaintiff.reichert general ins.cal d,habitat trust for wildlife,city of rancho cucamonga th.the prerequisite for any action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is the existence of a contractual relationship between the parties,since the covenant is an implied term in the contract.see foley interactive data cal d,gruenberg aetna ins.cal d,since noninsurer defendants in bad faith case were not parties to the insurance contracts,they were not subject to an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.
the trial court found the city could not be subjected to liability under an implied contract theory,first noting the city charter does not contain any provisions specifically addressing contract formation.as the charter is silent,the court concluded the city contracting procedures are governed by the general law provision found in section.that section applies to the manner of contract formation and provides,in part,t he mayor shall sign a ll written contracts and conveyances made or entered into by the city.italics added.
the trial court also cited to mezzetta,city of american canyon th mezzetta.in mezzetta,the appellate court concluded that certain municipal code provisions together with section precluded the general law city of american canyon from entering into an oral agreement.the agreement had allegedly obligated the city to provide the plaintiff with wastewater discharge services.the court reasoned i mplicit in the relevant statutes,when read together,is the requirement that contracts with the city be in writing,approved by the city council,approved as to form by the city attorney,and signed by either the mayor or the city manager.citations.mezzetta,at,italics added.the court held that the alleged oral agreement was void because it failed to comply with this requirement b ecause the statutes in question specifically set forth the ways in which the city may enter into contracts,any other methods of contract formation even though not explicitly prohibited by the statutes are invalid.citations.to conclude otherwise would undermine the city clear intent to ensure that expensive decisions are not hastily made.id.at pp,fn.omitted.
plaintiff does not dispute that the city charter is silent with respect to the manner of contracting.it also concedes the implied agreement to share in the cost of the lws was never memorialized in writing.it contends section does not apply because charter cities are independent of the general laws of the state on all matters of municipal affairs.this is true,according to plaintiff,even as to matters on which the charter is silent.in so arguing,plaintiff construes cases that favor charter city ordinances over conflicting general law provisions as standing for the proposition that general laws have no application to charter cities in the absence of ordinances or charter provisions that expressly invoke those general laws.this construction is not supported by case law.
c.general law and charter cities 
the government code classifies cities as either general law cities cities organized under the general law of california or chartered cities cities organized under a charter.city of orange san diego county employees retirement th.it is well settled that the method by which a city has power to enter into a contract may be controlled by its charter.loop lumber van loben sels cal,first street plaza partners city of los angeles th,first street.further,unless the city charter authorizes such,no implied contract rights can arise.reams cooley cal,first street,at.
section of the city charter states the city shall have the power to act pursuant to procedure established by any law of the state unless a different procedure is required by this charter.the court below correctly noted that the manner in which a city may form a contract is a municipal affair,and that the city charter,which could have validly included contract formation provisions,does not specifically prescribe how its contracts must be executed.the court concluded the city could thus rely on section for guidance.plaintiff contends charter cities are never subject to general laws,including section,even if their charters are silent on the subject matter.we are not persuaded.
charter cities are specifically authorized by our state constitution to govern themselves,free of state legislative intrusion,as to those matters deemed municipal affairs.article xi,section,subdivision a of the california constitution provides it shall be competent in any city charter to provide that the city governed thereunder may make and enforce all ordinances and regulations in respect to municipal affairs,subject only to restrictions and limitations provided in their several charters and in respect to other matters they shall be subject to general laws.city charters adopted pursuant to this constitution shall supersede any existing charter,and with respect to municipal affairs shall supersede all laws inconsistent therewith.italics added.as the italicized provisions indicate,chartered cities are permitted,but not required,to make and enforce laws governing municipal affairs.if a city charter is silent as to a particular matter,even one concerning a municipal affair,courts have opined that the matter will be subject to the general laws of this state.see,mcleod board of pension commissioners d,mcleod a city,such as los angeles,which operates under a freeholders charter is exempt from the operation of general laws with respect to all municipal affairs covered by the charter.citation.however,where the charter contains no special procedure concerning a municipal subject,the general laws govern.italics added,fn.omitted.
as noted in section of the vallejo charter,the city is permitted to follow the laws of california regarding contract formation,section,unless a different procedure is required by this charter.and section of the vallejo charter expressly permits the city to exercise any and all rights and powers established,granted or prescribed by the general laws of the state.thus,as the trial court below concluded,the vallejo charter has effectively adopted the procedures set forth in section over any other approach to government contracts.simply stated,the city has not opted to create a different contracting procedure under its charter 
we concur with the holding of mcleod,supra,d.that decision follows established principles in addressing charter cities and the effect of state statutes on such municipalities when their charter does not provide specific guidance on a matter of municipal concern.we disagree with plaintiff characterization of mcleod as an isolated decision.see civic center railroad comm.cal,with respect to matters not municipal,or municipal affairs upon which the charter is silent,the provisions of any general law state statute pertaining thereto would control the subject.armas city of oakland d,although oakland is a charter city,plaintiffs concede that its charter and ordinances prescribe no procedure for street closing and that thus the procedural provisions of state law must be followed,even if the function be municipal in character hyde wilde,where no particular provisions are made covering a matter falling within the classification of a municipal affair,the state law controls.
in arguing otherwise,plaintiff relies on butterworth boyd cal d butterworth for the proposition that charter cities are not bound by the general laws of this state with respect to municipal affairs,even as to matters that the charter does not address.in butterworth,a proposed charter amendment to the charter of the city and county of san francisco was approved by the electorate,and became effective by concurrent resolution of the legislature.the amendment called for a health care system for municipal employees.id.at.
in deciding whether the establishment of a health care system qualified as a municipal affair,the supreme court observed,in the early stages of municipal home rule in california,the charter prevailed only where it expressly covered the particular power exercised.under the liberalizing constitutional amendment of,the charter is not a grant of power but a restriction only,and the municipality is supreme in the field of municipal affairs even as to matters on which the charter is silent.butterworth,supra,cal d at,italics added.as is apparent,the language plaintiff relies on from butterworth simply states the principle that chartered cities may act independent of general law with respect to matters deemed municipal affairs,regardless of whether their charters address the specific municipal affair that is at issue.it does not stand for the proposition that general laws never apply to chartered cities,particularly in the absence of conflicting municipal ordinances or regulations.
as the butterworth court stated the purpose of the constitutional provisions was to make municipalities and free from legislative interference with respect to matters of local or internal concern.it was to enable municipalities to conduct their own business and control their own affairs,to the fullest possible extent in their own way.it was enacted upon the principle that the municipality itself knew better what it wanted and needed than the state at large,and to give that municipality the exclusive privilege and right to enact direct legislation which would carry out and satisfy its wants and needs.butterworth,supra,cal d at,italics added.thus,butterworth merely stands for the proposition that a chartered city has the power to enact regulations regarding contract formation that differ from those contained in section,something the city has evidently chosen not to do.simply stated,in butterworth,the court held the general law state law could not preempt a charter amendment passed by the voters of san francisco specifically addressing the topic of city employee health insurance practices.
d.cities can not be sued under an implied contract theory 
even if plaintiff is correct that section does not apply to this case,as explained by the court of appeal in katsura city of san buenaventura th katsura,i t is settled that a private party can not sue a public entity on an or theory,because such a theory is based on quantum meruit or restitution considerations which are outweighed by the need to protect and limit a public entity contractual obligations.citations.the reason is simple the law never implies an agreement against its own restrictions and prohibitions,or expressed differently,the law never implies an obligation to do that which it forbids the party to agree to do.citation.in other words,contracts that disregard applicable code provisions are beyond the power of the city to make.id.at pp.
the principle set forth in katsura,supra,th,is well established see,janis california state lottery com.th,see also seymour state of california d.limitations on a municipality power to contract should be strictly construed because such restrictions are designed to protect the public,not those who contract with the municipality.mcquillin,municipal corporations ed.plaintiff seeks to distinguish katsura,supra,th,because the operative charter in that case expressly required all city contracts to be in writing.plaintiff asserts that if the city had wanted the benefit of the katsura rule,it could have adopted similar charter language.however,the holding in katsura was that all implied contracts against public entities are barred because,by definition,they have not formally been approved by the entity.the court in that case did not limit its holding to cities with charters that expressly require all contracts to be in writing.
in sum,we agree with the city that the demurrer as to the first,second,third and causes of action was properly sustained.
iii.proposition 
the trial court sustained the city demurrer to the fourth,fifth,and causes of action,finding them barred under proposition.adopted by california voters in november,proposition added articles xiii c and xiii d to the california constitution.proposition generally prohibits local governments from imposing taxes without voter approval.owens county of los angeles th.article xiii c concerns voter approval for local government general taxes and special taxes.article xiii d sets forth procedures,requirements and voter approval mechanisms for local government assessments,fees and charges.city of palmdale palmdale water dist.th.
plaintiff fourth cause of action is for breach of duty to charge a reasonable water rate.in its claim,it asserts the city breached its obligation to provide water at a reasonable rate when it passed the,and ordinances in contravention of the historical cost sharing ratio,causing class members to pay rates almost five times higher than rates paid by city residents.it claims the class has suffered damages in excess of million,equal to the difference between what the class paid under the ordinance and what it would have paid had the city honored the contractual historic al cost sharing ratio.similarly,the fifth cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty claims that the city owes the class a duty to treat residents and nonresidents equally with respect to the lws.the cause of action for declaratory relief alleges that the city presently intends to sell the lws to a private utility and claims the july rates will continue to violate the historical cost sharing ratio by forcing the customers of the lws to pay of the cost of operating,maintaining and improving the lws.
the trial court found what it referred to as the structure proposed by plaintiff in these claims to be prohibited by article xiii d,section,subdivision b of the california constitution,which provides that a fee or charge shall not be extended,imposed,or increased by any agency unless it meets all of the following requirements revenues derived from the fee or charge shall not exceed the funds required to provide the service.revenues derived from the fee or charge shall not be used for any purpose other than that for which the fee or charge was imposed.the amount of a fee or charge imposed upon any parcel or person as an incident of property ownership shall not exceed the proportional cost of the service attributable to the parcel.italics added.the court cited to griffith pajaro valley water management agency th griffith in support of its ruling,concluding that proposition prohibits a rate structure as alleged in plaintiff complaint that requires one group of customers to essentially subsidize another 
in griffith,the objectors appealed from judgment
