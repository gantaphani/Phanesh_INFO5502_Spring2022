in november,california voters adopted proposition,which added articles xiii c and xiii d to the california constitution.in richmond shasta community services dist.cal th,d,richmond,we construed article xiii d as it applies to fees that a local public water district charged for making new service connections to its domestic water delivery system.we concluded that those connection charges were not assessments or fees or charges within the meaning of article xiii richmond,supra,at,d.
here,we consider a related issue,one that involves section of article xiii c,which provides that the initiative power shall not be prohibited or otherwise limited in matters of reducing or repealing any local tax,assessment,fee or charge.does this provision grant local voters authority to adopt an initiative measure that would reduce a local public water district charges for delivering domestic water to existing customers and that also would require voter preapproval for any future increase in those charges or for the imposition of any new charge 
as explained below,we conclude that section of article xiii c grants local voters a right to use the initiative power to reduce the rate that a public water district charges for domestic water.we also conclude,however,that this new constitutional provision does not grant local voters a right to impose a requirement on all future adjustments of water delivery charges,and that the proposed initiative at issue here was properly withheld from the ballot because it included a provision to impose such a requirement.
in,the california legislature formed the view water agency agency as a special district under the bighorn mountains water agency law stats,ch,et the agency provides domestic water service to residents in a roughly area north of yucca valley in san bernardino county.
kelley is a resident of san bernardino county and the proponent of a local initiative measure to reduce the agency water rate and other charges.kelley initiative proposed to reduce the agency water rate from to per billing unit to reduce the recovery charge from to per month,and to reduce the mwa pipeline charge from to per month.the initiative also would have required the agency to obtain voter approval before increasing any existing water rate,fee,or charge,or imposing any new water rate,fee,or charge.
kelley succeeded in qualifying the initiative for the ballot.on october,sharon beringson,as the interim registrar of voters for san bernardino county,certified the initiative,and the next day by letter she informed the agency of its duty under elections code section to either adopt the initiative or submit it to the voters at a special election.the agency did neither,however.instead,on november,it filed a complaint for declaratory relief in the superior court,naming beringson as the defendant and kelley as the real party in interest.
in the complaint,the agency asked the court to declare the initiative impermissible under california law,and beyond the power of the agency electorate to enact,because it would interfere with the statutory responsibility of the agency board of directors to set the water rate high enough to cover its costs.see stats,ch,west ann,supra,ch,the board of directors,so far as practicable,shall fix such rate or rates for water in the agency as will result in revenues which will pay the operating expenses of the agency,provide for repairs and depreciation of works,provide a reasonable surplus for improvements,extensions,and enlargements,pay the interest on any bonded debt,and provide a sinking or other fund for the payment of the principal of such debt as it may become due.
kelley answered the complaint and filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings and a for writ of mandate seeking to compel the agency to either adopt the initiative as an ordinance or submit it to the voters at a special election.asserting that the agency was challenging the legality of the proposed initiative both on its face insofar as it asserted that its board of directors had the exclusive power to set the agency water rates and charges and as applied insofar as it asserted that the particular rates and charges that the initiative would set would leave the agency with insufficient net revenues,kelly argued that the challenge could not be raised before the election and that the facial challenge failed because the initiative was authorized and protected by section of article xiii c of the california constitution.in its opposition to kelley motion for judgment on the pleadings,the agency argued,essentially,that it was raising only a facial challenge to the proposed initiative.
at the hearing on the motion for judgment on the pleadings,the parties agreed that the only issue was the validity of the initiative on its face,that the facts relevant to that issue were undisputed,and that the issue could be decided as a matter of law.the trial court,declaring that voters in the area served by the agency lacked power to affect its water rates and fees and charges,denied kelley motion and and entered a judgment of declaratory relief for the agency.
kelley appealed the judgment to the court of appeal,arguing that his initiative was authorized by article xiii c,section of the california constitution.the court of appeal affirmed the superior court ruling,and kelley petitioned this court for review.we granted review and then transferred the case back to the court of appeal with directions to vacate its decision and to reconsider the issues in light of richmond,supra,cal th,d.
the court of appeal again found in favor of the agency,holding that article xiii c did not authorize kelley initiative because the initiative did not deal with special or general taxes,which the court of appeal held to be the only subject matter article xiii c covers.the court held that the agency rate,fees,and charges were not subject to proposition,and thus could not be reduced by voter initiative.kelley again petitioned this court for review,which we again granted.
article xiii c of the california constitution is entitled voter approval for local tax levies.section of article xiii c defines the terms g eneral tax,s pecial tax,l ocal government,and s pecial district.section of article xiii c provides,in subdivision b,that n o local government may impose,extend,or increase any general tax unless and until that tax is submitted to the electorate and approved by a majority vote,and it provides,in subdivision d,that n o local government may impose,extend,or increase any special tax unless and until that tax is submitted to the electorate and approved by a vote.section,the provision at issue here,states initiative power for local taxes,assessments,fees and charges.notwithstanding any other provision of this constitution,including,but not limited to,sections and of article ii,the initiative power shall not be prohibited or otherwise limited in matters of reducing or repealing any local tax,assessment,fee or charge.the power of initiative to affect local taxes,assessments,fees and charges shall be applicable to all local governments and neither the legislature nor any local government charter shall impose a signature requirement higher than that applicable to statewide statutory initiatives.italics added.
with a single sentence,the court of appeal rejected kelley reliance on article xiii c as authority for the proposed initiative.the court of appeal stated article xiii c governs special and general taxes,which are not at issue here.kelley argues that this statement is erroneous because section of article xiii c is not limited to special and general taxes,but applies by it terms to any local tax,assessment,fee or charge.
when interpreting a provision of our state constitution,our aim is to determine and effectuate the intent of those who enacted the constitutional provision at issue.richmond,supra,cal th at,d.when,as here,the voters enacted the provision,their intent governs.delaney superior court cal d.to determine the voters intent,we begin by examining the constitutional text,giving the words their ordinary meanings.richmond,supra,at,d.
article xiii c,section of the california constitution expressly states that the initiative power can not be limited or prohibited when an initiative proposes to reduce or repeal any local tax,assessment,fee or charge.in construing a constitutional or statutory provision,i f possible,significance should be given to every word,phrase,sentence and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.dubois workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d.if possible,therefore,we must give significance to the words assessment,fee or charge in article xiii c,section,as meaning something other than local tax.accordingly,it would appear that article xiii c,section,is not limited to local special and general taxes but applies also to assessments,fees,and charges.
in the ballot pamphlet for the election at which proposition which included both article xiii c and article xiii d was adopted,the legislative analyst gave this description of how proposition would affect initiative powers the measure states that californians have the power to repeal or reduce any local tax,assessment,or fee through the initiative process.ballot,analysis of by legis.analyst.thus,the legislative analyst appears to have also read section of article xiii c as applying to fees as well as to special and general taxes and so described it to the voters who enacted it.see people birkett cal th,d,argument and analyses in official ballot pamphlet may be consulted to determine voters understanding and intent.
because the agency offers no argument in support of the court of appeal assertion that article xiii c applies only to special and general taxes,and not to fees,we will not belabor the point.we conclude that article xiii,section,applies to assessments,fees,and charges and not just to special and general taxes.
are the amounts that the agency bills its customers for the delivery of domestic water properly characterized as fees or charges within the meaning of those words in article xiii c,section although article xiii c contains definitions of the terms general tax and special tax cal,art.xiii c,subds.a,d,it does not define the terms fee or charge.article xiii d,which was enacted together with article xiii c as part of proposition,does contain a definition of those terms.according to that definition,f ee or charge means any levy other than an ad valorem tax,a special tax,or an assessment,imposed by an agency upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership,including a user fee or charge for a property related service.cal,art.xiii d,subd.e.it is unclear,however,whether that definition governs the meaning of the terms fee and charge in article xiii c,section.
section of article xiii d of the state constitution,which contains definitions for various terms,including fee and charge,begins with the words,as used in this article.italics added.therefore,although the definitions in section of article xiii d govern the meaning of the defined terms in article xiii d see people canty cal th,d,richmond,supra,cal th at,d,those definitions do not necessarily apply outside of article xiii d and,in particular,in article xiii on the other hand,when a word has been used in different parts of a single enactment,courts normally infer that the word was intended to have the same meaning throughout.people roberge cal th,d.because article xiii c and article xiii d were enacted together by proposition,it seems unlikely that the terms fee and charge were meant to carry entirely different meanings in those two articles,although some variation in meaning is possible 
we considered a related question in richmond,supra,cal th,d.at issue there was whether a water service connection fee was a fee or charge within the meaning of article xiii d definition of the terms fee and charge as any levy other than an ad valorem tax,a special tax,or an assessment,imposed by an agency upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership,including a user fee or charge for a property related service.cal,art.xiii d,subd.e,italics added see richmond,supra,at,d.of relevance here,we stated 
in the ballot pamphlet for the election at which article xiii d was adopted,the legislative analyst stated that f ees for water,sewer,and refuse collection service probably meet the measure definition of fee.ballot,analysis of by legis.analyst.the legislative analyst apparently concluded that water service has a direct relationship to property ownership,and thus is a service within the meaning of article xiii d because water is indispensable to most uses of real property because water is provided through pipes that are physically connected to the property and because a water provider may,by recording a certificate,obtain a lien on the property for the amount of any delinquent service charges see,
several provisions of article xiii d tend to confirm the legislative analyst conclusion that charges for utility services such as electricity and water should be understood as charges imposed as an incident of property ownership.for example,subdivision b of section provides that fees for the provision of electrical or gas service shall not be deemed charges or fees imposed as an incident of property ownership under article xiii under the rule of construction that the expression of some things in a statute implies the exclusion of other things not expressed in re bryce cal th,d,the expression that electrical and gas service charges are not within the category of fees implies that similar charges for other utility services,such as water and sewer,are fees subject to the restrictions of article xiii 
this implication is reinforced by subdivision c of article xiii d,section,which expressly excludes fees or charges for sewer,water,and refuse collection services from the voter approval requirements that article xiii d imposes on fees and charges.because article xiii d does not include similar express exemptions from the other requirements that it imposes on fee s and charges,the implication is strong that fees for water,sewer,and refuse collection services are subject to those other requirements.see howard jarvis taxpayers city of roseville th,d reaching the same conclusion.
thus,we agree that water service fees,being fees for services,may be fees or charges within the meaning of article xiii d.but we do not agree that all water service charges are necessarily subject to the restrictions that article xiii d imposes on fees and charges.rather,we conclude that a water service fee is a fee or charge under article xiii d if,but only if,it is imposed upon a person as an incident of property ownership.art.xiii d,subd.e.richmond,supra,cal th at,d.
for purposes of identifying fees and charges under california constitution article xiii d,we drew a distinction between water service connection charges and charges for ongoing water delivery.we explained a fee for ongoing water service through an existing connection is imposed as an incident of property ownership because it requires nothing other than normal ownership and use of property.but a fee for making a new connection to the system is not imposed as an incident of property ownership because it results from the owner voluntary decision to apply for the connection.richmond,supra,cal th at,d.
comparing the provisions of article xiii c and article xiii d,it appears to us that the words fee and charge,which appear in both articles,may well have been intended to have a narrower,more restrictive meaning in article xiii d.the title of article xiii d is assessment and fee reform italics added and section of article xiii d,which imposes restrictions on fees,is titled property related fees and charges italics added.consistent with these references to fees,article xiii d definition of fee requires that it be imposed upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership.cal,art.xiii d,subd.e.by comparison,the words property related do not appear anywhere in article xiii c,nor does anything in the text of article xiii c suggest that it is limited to levies imposed on real property or on persons as an incident of property ownership.thus,the terms fee and charge in section of article xiii c may not be subject to the qualification that was at issue in richmond,supra,cal th,d.at the same time,any levy that qualifies as a fee or charge under article xiii d must also qualify as a fee or charge under article xiii c,section.nothing in the text of article xiii c,or in the ballot pamphlet for the november general election at which it was adopted,suggests an intent to exclude fees and charges from the reach of section of article xiii c,or to impose any separate or additional restriction on the meaning of fee or charge as used in article xiii 
thus,it is possible that california constitution article xiii c grant of initiative power extends to some fees that,because they are not property related,are not fees within the meaning of article xiii d.but we perceive no basis for excluding from article xiii c authorization any of the fees subject to article xiii d.the absence of a restrictive definition of fee or charge in article xiii c suggests that those terms include all levies that are ordinarily understood to be fees or charges,including all of the fees and charges subject to article xiii 
for present purposes,it is unnecessary to arrive at an exact definition of the terms fee and charge as used in article xiii c.it is sufficient to conclude that a public water agency charges for ongoing water delivery,which are fees and charges within the meaning of article xiii d richmond,supra,cal th at,d,are also fees within the meaning of section of article xiii therefore,section of article xiii c establishes that the initiative power shall not be prohibited or otherwise limited in matters of reducing or repealing a public agency water delivery charges.in other words,this constitutional provision expressly authorizes initiative measures like kelley insofar as they seek to reduce or repeal a public agency water rates and other water delivery charges.
the agency urges us to draw a distinction between water delivery charges that are consumption based calculated according to the quantity of water delivered and charges that are imposed regardless of water usage.under this proposed distinction,the agency water rate,which is a charge per cubic feet of water,is a charge,while its recovery charge and mwa pipeline charge both of which the agency imposes in a fixed amount per month per customer are not.the agency argues that water charges are not fees or charges within the meaning of article xiii d because they are not imposed as an incident of property ownership cal,art.xiii d,subd.e,but instead as a result of the voluntary decisions of each water customer as to how much water to use.we are not persuaded.
article xiii d defines fee or charge as including a user fee or charge for a property related service.cal,art.xiii d,subd.e,italics added.the word including is ordinarily a term of enlargement.hassan mercy american river hospital cal th,d.as we explained in richmond,supra,cal th,d,domestic water delivery through a pipeline is a service within the meaning of this definition.id.at,d.accordingly,once a property owner or resident has paid the connection charges and has become a customer of a public water agency,all charges for water delivery incurred thereafter are charges for a service,whether the charge is calculated on the basis of consumption or is imposed as a fixed monthly fee water delivery charges also fall within the definition of user fees,which are amounts charged to a person using a service where the amount of the charge is generally related to the value of the services provided.utility audit,city of los angeles th,d.because it is imposed for the service of water delivery,the agency water rate,as well as its fixed monthly charges,are fees or charges within the meaning of article xiii d,and thus,for the reasons we have explained,they are also fees or charges within the meaning of section of article xiii under the constitutional grant of power in section of article xiii c,the initiative may be used to reduce each of those water delivery charges.
the agency also argues that even if its water rate and other water delivery charges are fees or charges within the meaning of section of article xiii c of the california constitution,kelley initiative is nonetheless invalid because the legislature has granted the agency governing board exclusive authority to set the agency rate and other charges.see devita county of napa cal th,d,discussing exclusive delegation committee of seven thousand superior court cal d,same.the legislature is bound by the state constitution,however,and the evident purpose of article xiii c is to extend the local initiative power to fees and charges imposed by local public agencies.we need not determine whether the legislature intended to preclude the use of the initiative to reduce the agency fees because even if it did so intend,the legislature authority in enacting the statutes under which the agency operates must in this instance yield to constitutional command.
to this point we have considered only the portions of kelley initiative that would reduce the agency water delivery charges.kelley initiative measure would do more than roll back the agency water rate and other charges,however.it would also require the agency board of directors to obtain voter approval before increasing any existing rate or charge or imposing any new rate or charge.nothing in section of california constitution article xiii c authorizes initiative measures that impose requirements for future increases in fees or charges.
arguing to the contrary,kelley points to the reference in section of article xiii c to t he power of initiative to affect local taxes,assessments,fees and charges.italics added.he asserts that by imposing a requirement on future increases in water delivery charges,his initiative would affect those charges and therefore is within the constitutional grant of initiative power.we disagree.the entire sentence reads the power of initiative to affect local taxes,assessments,fees and charges shall be applicable to all local governments and neither the legislature nor any local government charter shall impose a signature requirement higher than that applicable to statewide statutory initiatives.cal,art.xiii c.the evident purpose of this sentence is not to define how the initiative may be used to impact fees and charges,but instead to specify that the initiative power extends to charges imposed by all local public agencies and that the signature requirement applied to statewide initiatives may not be exceeded.the scope of the initiative power is set by the previous sentence,stating that the initiative power shall not be prohibited or otherwise limited in matters of reducing or repealing any local tax,assessment,fee or charge,italics added.thus,analysis of the text of section of article xiii c supports the conclusion that the initiative power granted by that section extends only to reducing or repealing taxes,assessments,fees,and charges.
that the voters who enacted proposition did not intend to authorize initiative measures imposing requirements on future water delivery charge increases is confirmed by an examination of section of california constitution article xiii related provisions should be read together and construed in a manner that gives effect to each,yet does not lead to disharmony with the others.city of huntington beach board of administration cal th,d,see also cooley superior court cal th,d,garcia mccutchen cal th,d,devita county of napa,supra,cal th at,d,pacific southwest realty county of los angeles cal th,d.article xiii d,section,subdivision c,says that e xcept for fees or charges for sewer,water,and refuse collection services,no property related fee or charge shall be imposed or increased unless and until that fee or charge is submitted and approved by a majority vote of the property owners of the property subject to the fee or charge or,at the option of the agency,by a vote of the electorate residing in the affected area.italics added.thus,article xiii d expressly exempts water service charges from the requirement that it imposes on all other fees and charges.
at least as to fees and charges that are property related,section of california constitution article xiii d would appear to embody the electora
