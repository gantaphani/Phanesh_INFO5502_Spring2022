in these consolidated appeals,various parties challenge the operation of the missouri river main stem reservoir system by the united states army corps of engineers the corps and associated wildlife assessments produced by the united states fish and wildlife service fws.the district court granted summary judgment to the corps and fws and their named individual officers collectively the federal defendants on all claims.for the reasons stated below,we dismiss three claims as moot and affirm the judgment of the district court on all remaining claims.
background 
the missouri river originates in montana and runs through north dakota,south dakota,nebraska,iowa,kansas and missouri before emptying into the mississippi river.in its natural state,the river subjected the surrounding basin to extensive flooding every spring.with the flood control act of fca,congress authorized the construction of a dam and reservoir system on the upper river to control the flooding.in addition to flood control,the fca envisioned that the reservoirs would provide water for local irrigation projects,steady release into the river during the summer months to support downstream navigation,hydroelectric power generation and lake recreation.the fca delegated construction and management of the main stem reservoir system to the corps 
the current challenges to the corps operation of the system arise from two directions.first,a persistent drought in the missouri river basin has led to a recurring conflict between upstream and downstream interests.in,the corps planned to release water from lake oahe into the river to maintain downstream navigation throughout the summer.south dakota,fearing a negative impact on the seasonal fish spawn in lake oahe and concordantly on the reservoir sport fishing industry,obtained an injunction in federal district court preventing the corps from lowering any reservoir in south dakota until after spawning season.when the corps decided to lower lake sakakawea instead,north dakota obtained a similar injunction.not to be outdone,montana obtained an injunction to prevent releases from fort peck lake.in response,nebraska obtained an injunction ordering the corps to make the required releases to support navigation as called for by the corps missouri river main stem reservoir system master water control manual master manual.
in a consolidated appeal of these injunctions,we ruled that the fca vested the corps with discretion to balance the competing interests.south dakota ubbelohde,cir.because the fca legislative history and its interpretation by the supreme court indicate that the corps primary concerns should be flood control and navigation,we upheld the corps decision to follow the master manual and draw down the reservoirs to support downstream navigation.id.at.
the second point of conflict has been that flood prevention and steady summer flows for downstream navigation disrupt the natural habitat of protected bird and fish species in the missouri river ecosystem.in litigation initially separate from the ubbelohde cases,environmental groups have attempted to force the corps to operate the system to produce more natural river flows to benefit the protected species.to understand the current stances of the parties in this litigation,it is necessary to review in some detail the corps previous attempts to accommodate competing interests while developing its operating procedures.
the corps sets forth its general operational guidelines for the missouri river reservoir system in a master manual and the operational details for each year in an annual operating plan.the first master manual was published in and revised in,and.the year brought the onset of the first persistent drought in the region since the reservoir system had become fully operational.because it found that the operational procedures in the master manual were not to handle a persistent drought,the corps began the revision process for what would become the master manual.
the operation of the reservoir system also brings the corps within the provisions of the endangered species act esa.under the esa,if a government agency concludes that a proposed action may jeopardize the continued existence of any protected species or adversely affect its critical habitat,the agency must prepare a biological assessment and consult with the fws.esa.the fws then issues a biological opinion biop describing how the action will affect the species,based on the best scientific and commercial data available.id.at a.if the fws concludes that the proposed action would cause jeopardy to an endangered or threatened species,the biop must include a reasonable and prudent alternative which would allow the agency to implement the desired action while avoiding jeopardy to the species.id.at b a.finally,if it appears incidental take will occur even if the reasonable and prudent alternative is implemented,the biop must include an incidental take statement setting conditions under which the agency may proceed while avoiding liability for the incidental harm to the protected species.id.at b.
the corps followed the above process with three protected species in the missouri river basin the pallid sturgeon,a fish listed as endangered since the least tern,a migratory bird listed as endangered since and the piping plover,a migratory bird listed as threatened since.the pallid sturgeon spends its entire life cycle in the missouri and mississippi rivers and their tributaries,while the tern and plover both nest in the summer on sparsely vegetated sandbars along the rivers.in,the fws issued a biological opinion biop finding that the corps proposed operation of the reservoir system was likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the three species.
the fws found that the harm to the species resulted from the alteration of the river natural hydrograph before the construction of the dams,the hydrograph had two prominent components the spring rise and summer low flow.the spring rise refers to extremely high flows in late spring resulting from the spring thaw.according to the biop,the spring rise provided a biological spawning cue for the pallid sturgeon and enabled the river to capture nutrients from the floodplain and from wetland habitat not connected to the river channel during other seasons.in concert with the summer low flow,the spring rise also provided seasonal connectivity to the wetland habitat,making calm,shallow pools available to the pallid sturgeon for spawning,nursery and feeding areas.lower elements of the food chain also were forced to congregate in the remaining pools,providing easy summer feeding for the protected species.in addition,the spring rise scoured and flushed sandbars.when the sandbars were exposed by the summer low flow,the resulting lack of cover for concealed predators allowed terns and plovers to nest there safely.
the corps operation of the reservoir system,generally capturing water in the upstream reservoirs to eliminate spring flooding and releasing water throughout the summer and fall as necessary to enable downstream navigation and restore reservoir capacity for the following spring,eliminated the spring rise and summer low flow from the hydrograph.the reasonable and prudent alternative included with the biop biop rpa stated that higher spring and lower or declining summer flows than now exist were an integral component of the measures to avoid jeopardy to the three protected species.the biop rpa also mandated habitat restoration,a comprehensive species and habitat monitoring program,and an adaptive management framework to implement,evaluate,and modify the components of the rpa in response to variable river conditions,species responses,and increasing knowledge base.
in an attempt to support downstream interests despite the continuing drought in the basin,the corps released a draft annual operating plan for that did not incorporate the flow changes from the biop rpa.environmental interest groups filed suit under the esa in the united states district court for the district of columbia to enjoin operations under that plan.at the corps request,the fws then issued a supplemental biological opinion the supplemental biop that ratified the corps plan to avoid the biop rpa flows for the period of may through august,with the understanding that operations after would be consistent with the biop.before the district court,however,the corps revealed that it had no intention of ensuring that its future operations would so comply.am.rivers united states army corps of eng rs,d.in addition,the district court held that it was improper for the fws to focus on the effects that the proposed action would have on the protected species during only,rather than on all future effects of the proposed action,and that the supplemental biop failed to articulate a reasonable explanation for its departure from the analysis in the biop.id.at.therefore,the district court granted the injunction and ordered the corps to comply with the summer low flow provisions of the biop.id.at.citing a conflict with this court ubbelohde holding that required operation consistent with the master manual,the corps initially failed to comply with the injunction and was held in conditional contempt.see am.rivers united states army corps of eng rs,d.two days later,the federal judicial panel on litigation consolidated all litigation regarding the operation of the missouri river main stem reservoir system,including new suits by the parties involved in ubbelohde,in the district of minnesota mdl court.on the order of that court,the corps complied with the summer low flow provisions of the biop rpa for the brief remainder of the summer period.
at that point,the corps prepared a new biological assessment with the goal of finding a way to avoid jeopardy to the protected species without following the biop rpa flow requirements.in the fall of,the corps presented the new biological assessment to the fws and requested a new biological opinion.in response,the fws issued an amendment to the biop the amended biop.the amended biop rpa permitted the corps to avoid the summer low flow requirement on the condition that it construct additional acres of shallow water habitat for the pallid sturgeon.in addition,it gave the corps two more years to experiment with alternatives to a spring rise.if the corps could not produce an acceptable alternative plan,the rpa imposed a default spring rise of reduced magnitude beginning in the spring of.
the corps continued to develop the master manual by complying with the provisions of the national environmental policy act nepa.see et.nepa requires the preparation of a detailed environmental impact statement eis for every major federal action that will significantly affect the quality of the environment.c.the eis must also evaluate alternatives to the proposed action.id.in this case,the corps compared five potential water control plans in its eis before adopting the preferred alternative,a plan consistent with the amended biop,as the basis for the master manual.the mdl court truncated the nepa period and ordered all plaintiffs in this litigation to amend their complaints to address the master manual and annual operating plan.
after the issuance of the master manual and annual operating plan,various parties filed motions for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment to the federal defendants on all claims on the bases that the fca does not create a duty in the corps to maintain minimum navigation flows or a minimum length for the navigation season,and the discretionary decisions made by the federal defendants in balancing interests under the fca and in avoiding jeopardy to the protected species were not arbitrary and capricious.
the parties now make various arguments on appeal.the states of missouri and nebraska and the nebraska public power district nppd argue that the master manual violates a duty of the corps under the fca to maintain river flow sufficient to support uninterrupted downstream navigation throughout the navigation season.nebraska and nppd also argue that the amended biop is in conflict with the purported fca requirement,while missouri argues that the amended biop violates the esa because it will eliminate some pallid sturgeon habitat in the lower missouri river.american rivers,the national wildlife federation,several state wildlife federations and the izaak walton league of america collectively american rivers argue that the amended biop is arbitrary and capricious because it does not insure against jeopardy to the three protected species.in addition,american rivers contends that the eis was faulty because the corps failed to explain why the preferred alternative was superior to another evaluated alternative.blaske marine,conocophillips company,ergon asphalt emulsions,magnolia marine transport company,midwest terminal warehouse company,association and missouri river keepers collectively blaske marine argue that a supplemental eis is required for a contingent summer low flow that the corps still has the discretion to implement.finally,the mandan,hidasta and arikara nation the nation contends that the corps must operate lake sakakawea garrison dam for the economic benefit of the nation members.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo a grant of summary judgment,applying the same legal standards used by the district court.voyageurs park ass norton,cir.we review the actions of the corps and fws under the administrative procedure act to determine whether they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.ubbelohde,at quoting a.an arbitrary and capricious action is one in which 
the agency has relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.

a.the corps fca duty to support downstream navigation 
missouri,nebraska and nppd collectively the downstream parties argue that the master manual is not in accordance with law because,under certain drought conditions,it calls for canceling the navigation season in order to hold water in the reservoirs for the benefit of recreation.the mdl court concluded that the fca imposes no duty to maintain a minimum level of downstream navigation independent of consideration of other interests.we agree.
this court has already addressed thoroughly the balance of interests under the fca.in ubbelohde,we relied on the supreme court decision in etsi pipeline project missouri,d,and the legislative history of the fca to determine that t he dominant functions of the flood control act were to avoid flooding and to maintain downstream navigation,while the act recognizes secondary uses of the river including irrigation,recreation,fish,and wildlife.ubbelohde,at.however,the fca does not set forth what level of river flow or length of navigation season is required to make navigation dominant over a secondary interest such as recreation.instead,the courts can review the corps decisions to ensure that it considered each of these interests before making a decision,but the act does not provide a method of deciding whether the balance actually struck by the corps in a given case is correct or not.id.at.
the downstream parties challenge the provisions of the master manual referred to as navigation precludes.the amount of water stored in the entire reservoir system is checked on march and july of each year.if total system storage falls below the volumes that allow the system to function to meet authorized purposes during significant drought periods,navigation support is reduced or eliminated for that year.master manual.the eis estimates,based on the modeling of historical data from to,that the selected volumes will lead to the elimination of the entire navigation season only in the four worst drought years out of every one hundred years,and to a navigation season shortened from months to less than seven months only in the eight worst drought years out of every one hundred.under these circumstances,we can not say that the corps failed to consider downstream navigation before making its decision 
appellees north dakota and south dakota argue that because damage to the recreation industry would have a more dramatic negative economic impact than would damage to the navigation industry,recreation should receive special priority.nothing in the text or legislative history of the fca suggests that congress intended the priority of interests under the fca to shift according to their relative economic value.arguments based on the wisdom of the priorities established by the fca must be addressed to congress 
the corps balancing of interests in the master manual is in accordance with the fca.because the master manual does not evidence a failure to consider the support of downstream navigation,it is not arbitrary and capricious.therefore,we affirm the grant of summary judgment to the corps on this claim.
b.the corps duty to consult with the fws under esa 
nebraska and nppd argue that it was not in accordance with law for the corps to engage in the esa consultation process with the fws regarding the operation of the reservoir system.they contend that the esa does not apply to the operation of the reservoir system because esa compliance would interfere with downstream navigation,a project purpose that is mandated by statute such that the corps has no discretion in meeting it.see section of the esa and the requirements of this part apply to all actions in which there is discretionary federal involvement or control.emphasis added.
case law supports the contention that environmental and statutes do not apply where they would render an agency unable to fulfill a statutory purpose or require it to exceed its statutory authority.for example,in national wildlife federation united states army corps of engineers,cir,the ninth circuit held that the corps operation of four dams on the snake river did not violate the clean water act.the challenged noncompliance with water standards was caused by the existence of the dams and not any discretionary method of operating the dams,and the clean water act could not be construed to supersede the corps operation of the dams consistent with the purposes stated by congress.id.at.
similarly,in platte river whooping crane critical habitat maintenance trust ferc,the federal energy regulatory commission ferc was authorized by statute to issue annual licenses to hydropower providers on the platte river.the enabling statute forbade alteration of the terms of an annual license without agreement from the licensee.environmental groups sued ferc,arguing that the esa required the imposition of terms in the licenses.the court held that the esa did not apply to the licenses because the esa did not authorize ferc to override the statutory prohibition on altering the licenses.id.at.in effect,platte river whooping crane affirmed that the esa does not apply where an agency has no statutory authority to act with discretion.
cases such as national wildlife federation and platte river whooping crane are inapposite to the instant case,however,because compliance with the esa does not prevent the corps from meeting its statutory duty under the fca to support downstream navigation.as we stated above,the fca does not mandate a particular level of river flow or length of navigation season,but rather allows the corps to decide how best to support the primary interest of navigation in balance with other interests.the master manual demonstrates that the corps can comply with the elements of the amended biop rpa while continuing to operate the dams consistent with the purposes stated by congress in the fca wildlife fed n,at.
because the corps is able to exercise its discretion in determining how best to fulfill the purposes of the reservoir system enabling statute,the operation of the reservoir system is subject to the requirements of the esa.it was therefore in accordance with law for the corps to consult with the fws to produce the amended biop.we affirm the grant of summary judgment to the federal defendants on this claim.
mootness of claims based on summer low flow 
several of the claims against the federal defendants challenge the conditional summer low flow element of the amended biop rpa.the federal defendants argue that these claims are now moot because the corps has successfully completed the mechanical construction of acres of shallow water habitat,which permits the corps to avoid the summer low flow requirement the corps has announced that it has no plans to implement summer low flows in the foreseeable future.missouri,nppd and blaske marine counter that because the corps retains the discretion to implement the summer low flow in any given year under its adaptive management framework,these claims fall within the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception to mootness.ubbelohde,at quoting weinstein bradford,d.
we conclude that the claims based on summer low flow are moot.the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception applies when two conditions are met the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration,and there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.id.quoting spencer kemna,d.
in this case,it appears that the duration of a summer low flow period,particularly if it is implemented with little prior warning,is too short to be fully litigated prior to expiration.however,there is no reasonable expectation that the corps will implement the amended biop summer low flow in the future.although a party need not show with certainty that the situation will recur,a speculative possibility is not a basis for retaining jurisdiction over a moot case.mccarthy ozark sch,cir quoting van bergen minnesota,cir.we are aware that the amended biop requires the corps to be ready to implement summer low flows as low as kcfs in the future if monitoring reveals that the alternate measures are not benefitting the protected species as expected.nevertheless,as we discuss later in this opinion,at this point there is no reason to doubt the utility of those alternate measures.therefore,we find nothing to suggest a likelihood that the corps will decide to implement a summer low flow in future years.mccarthy,at.
because there is no reasonable expectation at this point in time that the corps will implement the amended biop summer low flow in the future,we conclude that the following claims are moot nppd claim that the fws failed to consider the economic feasibility of the summer low flow requirement in developing the amended biop missouri claim that the loss of shallow water habitat for larval and juvenile pallid sturgeon in central missouri state resulting from summer low flow constitutes an impermissible take of the sturgeon under esa and blaske marine nepa claim that a supplemental eis is required for the amended biop summer requirement.we vacate the mdl court grant of summary judgment to the federal defendants on these claims and instruct the mdl court to dismiss these claims without prejudice.
d.the validity of the amended biop 
nppd argues that the amended biop is invalid because the fws violated regulations applicable to biological opinions.american rivers challenges the amended biop on the grounds that the amended biop rpa contradicts its own factual findings and the administrative record and does not insure against jeopardy to the protected species.
the environmental baseline for the amended biop 
nppd contends that the fws used an improper environmental baseline in producing the amended biop.the environmental baseline includes the past and present impacts of all federal,state,or private actions and other human activities in the action area.jeopardy to the protected species resulting from the proposed action is measured relative to the species status under the baseline.id.the fws used a baseline in which the dams and physical channel modifications are assumed to be in place,but all floodgates are assumed to be wide open,with no flow control.nppd argues that normal operation under the master manual was the proper baseline because it is a past impact of a separate federal action and would continue to control operations absent the proposed action.because continued operation under the master manual would cause the protected species chances of recovery to deteriorate,its inclusion in the baseline would tend to eliminate a finding of jeopardy for any proposed action.
according due deference to the fws interpretation of its own regulations,friends of the boundary waters wilderness,at,we agree with the fws that hypothetical continued operation under the previous version of the master manual in future years,as the alternative to the proposed action of updating the master manual,does not in any sense constitute a past impact of federal action.as the district court recognized,this argument is essentially a different twist on the argument that the corps has no discretion in operating the reservoir system.if the fca mandated that the corps must manage the system to enable,for example,a barge of specific size riding a specific depth below the waterline to navigate the river between sioux city and the mississippi river at all times between april and december,there would be some merit to including that condition in the environmental baseline along with the permanent physical presence of the dams and channel modifications.however,given that the fca clearly gives a good deal of discretion to the corps in the management of the river,ubbelohde,at,we can not say that it was arbitrary and capricious for the fws not to include a specific operational profile in the environmental baseline.therefore,we affirm the grant of summary judgment to the federal defendants on this claim.
use of the best scientific and commercial data available 
nppd argues that the fws did not rely on the best scientific data available in its efforts to create a normalized hydrograph in the amended biop rpa.in formulating its biological opinion,and any reasonable and prudent alternatives the fws will use the best scientific and commercial data available.g see a.
to create a normalized version of the summer low flow portion of the natural hydrograph,the amended biop calls for low flows beginning in july.nppd directs our attention to a united states geological survey report in the administrative record showing that,before construction of the dams,the lowest summer flows usually occurred between august and early october.nppd contends that this incongruity evidences a failure to use the best scientific data available to formulate the amended biop.
the administrative record as a whole shows that the fws did not ignore the best scientific data on the summer low flow in formulating the amended biop.for example,in a document by the fws to new members of the amended biop development team in november,the fws recognized that t he historic hydrograph began to fall at gavins point in and reached it sic lowest levels in the fall months,but indicated that the fws proposal would end the low flow period in august because higher releases in the fall were necessary to evacuate any excess water from the reservoirs prior to the next water year.the fws then stated that,w hile this approach is not a perfect fit to the historic hydrograph,we believe that it sufficiently mimics the natural hydrograph to have the necessary beneficial effect on the protected species.
the fws has never found that an exact replication of the natural hydrograph was necessary to avoid jeopardy to the protected species,and the record shows a rational connection between the facts found and the decision made about the timing of the low flow period.gifford pinchot task force united states fish wildlife,cir.therefore,we affirm the grant of summary judgment to the federal defendants on this claim.
the consistency of the amended biop factual findings and the rpa for the pallid sturgeon 
american rivers argues,on the basis of the factual findings in the amended biop and the administrative record underlying it,that the conditional replacement of the biop rpa summer low flow requirement with the mechanical construction of additional acres of artificial shallow water habitat for the pallid sturgeon is arbitrary and capricious.
the amended biop incorporated findings from the biop and stated that u ntil a semblance of the normalized hydrograph is restored and habitat is generated and maintained through of these ecological processes,listed species will continue to decline.in addition,the executive summary of the amended biop summarizes,with regard to the pallid sturgeon 
the proposed accelerated habitat restoration program in the lower missouri river will have little benefit to the pallid sturgeon without a concurrent or subsequent change in operations to provide a more normalized hydrograph to provide the spawning cues that are critical for pallid sturgeon reproduction and allow larvae and juveniles to move into shallow water habitat.
american rivers contends that the above statements,and others like them in the administrative record,show that the fws was irrational in abandoning any semblance of half of the natural hydrograph,the summer low flow,in exchange solely for habitat construction.however,evidence in the record adequately explains the decision made by the fws.first,appendix a of the corps biological assessment,entitled new information since the biop,includes the results of extensive modeling of the river showing that the proposed biop summer low flow would be expected to increase suitable shallow water habitat by,acres over that existing during regular summer service flows.the creation of acres of habitat,therefore,provides the same total acreage of accessible calm,shallow pools during regular summer service flows as the biop summer low flow would have produced.second,the amended biop rpa retains a spring rise requirement,and the corps must tailor the spring rise to provide the necessary biological spawning cues and floodplain connectivity with the shallow water habitat.third,the amended biop rpa requires the corps to monitor the pallid sturgeon population and collaborate with the fws to adjust these measures if necessary.finally,the avoidance of summer low flow preserves the existing lisbon chute shallow water habitat,the only site in the river where larval pallid sturgeon occur naturally,from potential damage.
american rivers argues that the amended biop did not state that the mechanical construction of acres was designed to replace the additional acreage that would have resulted from summer low flow.american rivers contends that this rationale is therefore an impermissible post hoc rationalization by counsel.c ourts may not accept appellate counsel post hoc rationalizations for agency action.motor vehicle,at.however,there is no requirement that every detail of the agency decision be stated expressly in the amended biop.the rationale is present in the administrative record underlying the document,and this is all that is required.coalition for the env t corps of eng rs of the united states army,cir,overruled on other grounds,goos icc,cir.therefore,the federal defendants rationale is not an impermissible post hoc rationalization.
we conclude that the federal defendants have demonstrated a rational connection between the facts in the record and the decision to substitute mechanically constructed acres of shallow water habitat for the acres that would have been created by the biop summer low flow.therefore,we affirm the grant of summary judgment to the federal defendants on this claim.
the consistency of the amended biop factual findings and the rpa for the least tern and piping plover 
american rivers argues that the elimination of the biop rpa spring rise and summer low flow requirements for the benefit of the least tern and piping plover is arbitrary and c
