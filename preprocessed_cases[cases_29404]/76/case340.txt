contra costa county the county owns and operates a drainage system on lettia road in the montalvin manor residential subdivision montalvin manor.this drainage system connects to a drainage channel on adjacent property owned by pinole point properties,llc pinole point.when the drainage channel is functioning,its water flows into the san pablo bay the bay.
after experiencing flooding,homeowners on lettia road sued the county the county against pinole point for,among other things,nuisance and negligence.the county alleged that pinole point was responsible for the flooding by permitting the drainage channel to be blocked with debris and vegetation.pinole point filed a against the county which included claims for negligence and inverse condemnation.
the county and pinole point settled with the homeowners and their claims against each other proceeded to a bench trial.the court,applying the reasonableness test set forth in keys romley cal d keys and locklin city of lafayette cal th locklin,found in favor of the county and against pinole point.the court determined that the drainage channel is a natural watercourse,that the county conduct with respect to its property had been reasonable,and that pinole point failure to maintain the drainage channel had been entirely unreasonable in light of its actual or constructive knowledge when purchasing the property of the existence of the drainage channel and the need to keep it clear of debris to prevent flooding to the adjacent homeowners.the court awarded damages to the county and ordered pinole point to clear and maintain the obstructed drainage channel.
on appeal,pinole point contends that it has no legal duty as the downstream property owner to maintain the drainage channel,especially since it did not create any diversion or obstruction to the flow of the water.even if it had a duty,the county conduct,according to pinole point,was unreasonable and therefore the county should be liable for all costs related to maintaining the drainage system.
as we explain,the trial court properly applied the reasonableness test and substantial evidence supported its findings.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
the homeowners lawsuit and the parties pleadings 
the superior court consolidated two lawsuits by homeowners seeking damages against the county for flooding of their homes on lettia road in montalvin manor that occurred on february.cardenas contra costa county super.contra costa county,no.puckett contra costa county,super.contra costa county,no.the county answered and filed against pinole point,bnsf,and union pacific railroad company union pacific for indemnity and contribution,negligence,nuisance and trespass,and injunctive relief.subsequently,the county dismissed union pacific and bnsf from its.the county sought monetary damages from pinole point for its costs related to pumping storm waters on lettia road during the period of march,to june.it also sought injunctive relief requiring pinole point to clear and maintain the obstructed drainage channel on its downstream property and to perform temporary pumping until the project could be completed.
pinole point answered county and filed its own against the county,bnsf,and union pacific for indemnity,contribution,inverse condemnation,declaratory relief,and tortious diversion of surface waters.subsequently,union pacific obtained a summary judgment against pinole point.
the homeowners settled their lawsuit for.under the settlement terms,the county and pinole point agreed to contribute both agreed each could seek recovery from the other at trial.on the first day of trial,the county stipulated that sediment it had not removed from the storm drain proximately caused the flooding of the homes on february.the county conceded liability for the pinole point paid to the homeowners.the matter proceeded to trial on the two.
the trial,judgment,and notice of appeal 
the property that is the subject of this litigation is a acre undeveloped parcel,including wetlands,in richmond,california.a copy of the map is attached as appendix a,post.in,pinole point acquired the parcel near the bay from bethlehem steel company bethlehem steel as part of a acre block of land.pinole point sold off some of the larger parcels it still owns a portion of this land,which the parties refer to as the remainder parcel.
prior to the,the remainder parcel existed in a natural state.the property received tidal flow intrusions from the bay to the north.it also received storm water runoff from upland areas to the south.
in the,bnsf and union pacific,or their predecessors,constructed high berms and railroad tracks across the property up berm.the up berm extends from west to east and lies adjacent to the northern limit of the remainder parcel.before construction of the up berm,storm waters reaching the remainder parcel flowed freely out to the bay.the up berm contains a single outlet that measures approximately feet by feet up culvert.the up culvert extends through the up berm near the eastern side of the remainder parcel.
additionally,in the late,immediately upslope and adjacent to the southern limit of the remainder parcel,a second elevated earthen railroad berm bnsf berm was built.the bnsf berm extended from west to east across the full width of the southern limit of the remainder parcel,lying between the remainder parcel and what would later become montalvin manor.at least one inch cast iron drainage pipe was installed through the bnsf berm upstream the inch pipe on the eastern edge of the remainder parcel.
the up and bnsf berms prevented the natural flow of drainage waters into the bay.the bnsf berm trapped water to the south of the bnsf tracks on what would later become the lettia road area in montalvin manor.the up berm trapped water between the tracks on the remainder parcel.
aerial photographs of the remainder parcel taken in the late,prior to the construction of montalvin manor,revealed that the drainage pipes constructed by the railroads were not working very well.the aerial photograph confirmed that water was being trapped in the lowlands south of the bnsf tracks in the area that would become lettia road.additionally,the remainder parcel between the two tracks had become a water detention basin that held water drained through the bnsf berm until it eventually drained into the bay through the drainage pipe in the up berm.the aerial photographs also indicated that there were no defined drainage channels at the easterly side of the remainder parcel between the inch pipe upstream and the up culvert downstream.
in the,montalvin manor was constructed.pinole point civil engineering expert,michael milani,testified that the housing development built in the early significantly increased the volume of water,flow rate of water,and velocity of water discharged into the remainder parcel.
the trial court found that the original drainage scheme of montalvin manor tied into the preexisting inch pipe installed on the eastern edge of the low portion of the remainder parcel.the court also found that by a drainage channel the drainage channel was constructed on the remainder parcel and it directly conveyed water from the inch pipe in the bnsf berm to the culvert in the up berm.in the and,the drainage channel was to feet wide and to feet deep.storm waters from montalvin manor also discharged through a inch concrete storm drain inch pipe located west of the inch pipe.water from the inch pipe did not empty into the drainage channel,but collected in a large marshy area to the west of the inch pipe.
the drainage channel was kept clear of vegetation and debris from the time of its construction until pinole point took title to the remainder parcel.although no conclusive evidence showed who maintained the drainage channel,there was evidence that bethlehem steel,the prior owner of the remainder parcel,had cleaned out the drainage channel on at least one occasion in.the trial court concluded that bethlehem steel had probably kept the drainage channel clear while it owned the remainder parcel.
at the time pinole point purchased the large piece of property from bethlehem steel in,the drainage channel running across the remainder parcel was functional,open,and obvious.the trial court found that pinole point knew or should have known about the drainage channel and the intermittent maintenance it required to remain functional.
the county owned or controlled lettia road.in,it approved a project to address flooding along lettia road in montalvin manor.the county installed a inch diameter storm drain pipe inch pipe on lettia road that extended northward a distance of approximately feet from lettia road through the bnsf berm near the inch pipe to replace the existing inch pipe and inch pipe.the inch pipe was located at approximately the same location as the inch pipe,and discharged water into the drainage chanel.this project was approved over pinole point objections,and construction was completed in.the trial court determined that this construction did not increase the amount of water discharged onto the remainder parcel from montalvin manor but simply redirected some of the water already discharging onto the remainder parcel from the inch pipe.the trial court found that the inch pipe might have increased the rate of silt deposits in the drainage channel due to the increase in runoff flow at that location,but the same amount of silt would have been deposited through the drainage facilities that were in place prior to.
pinole point did not maintain the drainage channel and over time it became obstructed with large trees,bushes,debris,and sediment.in,gregory marshal connaughton,a supervising civil engineer with the county,sent a letter notifying pinole point that the drainage channel was obstructed with silt and vegetation and as a result,water ponds in montalvin manor.he requested that it the channel and warned that,without the appropriate action,lettia road would flood.he also wrote to pinole point on november,warning about the accumulation of sediment and vegetation.he again warned pinole point about the problems on january,january,and october.
following the flooding on february,the county sent its maintenance crews to lettia road to prevent flooding whenever it anticipated a significant rainstorm.during rainstorms,the crews operated portable pumps to pump water from the inch pipe junction box to the drainage inlet of the inch pipe farther west.the county submitted evidence that from march,through june,the county spent on emergency flood protection efforts to prevent flooding on lettia road and the surrounding neighborhood.
with the consent of all counsel,judge steven austin independently inspected the site,which included his walking the entire length of the drainage channel,the area of the inch pipe,and lettia road.
at the end of the trial,the court found the drainage channel to be a natural watercourse.it concluded that the county acted reasonably by attempting to persuade pinole point to maintain the drainage channel and in implementing temporary pumping programs during storms to prevent additional flood damage.in contrast,it concluded that pinole point had acted entirely unreasonable,elaborating pinole point purchased property with a,functioning drainage channel.at the time,it knew or should have known that the drainage channel existed and that it had been maintained by the prior owner.it allowed the drainage channel to become clogged with debris,vegetation and sediment to the point that the drainage channel was no longer functional.it has steadfastly refused to take any action to maintain the drainage channel in any way.it has done so with the knowledge that its inaction has resulted in substantial damage to the county and to the homeowners along lettia road,and with the knowledge that its inaction will result in continued damage in the future.it ruled that pinole point was negligent in failing to maintain the drainage channel and liable in nuisance as its conduct damaged the county as the owner of lettia road and interfered with the free use and enjoyment of that property.it found that the flood damage was not the result of any type of physical invasion of surface waters from the remainder parcel and rejected the county claim of trespass.
the trial court awarded the county in damages for emergency flood protection efforts.the court also granted the county request for an injunction.it determined that the blockages within the drainage channel caused the inch pipe not to function and made flooding on lettia road likely.the court ordered pinole point to clear its drainage channel of the obstructions and to provide temporary pumping services until it completed the required work.the court denied all of pinole point causes of action on the except for its claim for indemnity 
judgment was entered on april.pinole point filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
pinole point contends that it has no legal duty to maintain the drainage channel,and objects to the trial court reasonableness rulings and determination that the drainage channel is a natural watercourse.pinole point contends it has no liability for negligence and nuisance and the court should have found the county liable for tort and inverse condemnation.it also maintains that the remedy of an injunction was improper.as explained below,we conclude that these contentions lack merit.

ii.the reasonableness test 
historically,under the natural watercourse rule,upstream property owners had immunity for any damage to downstream riparian property caused by discharge of surface water runoff into a natural watercourse.locklin,supra,cal th at.this immunity extended to public entities.archer city of los angeles cal d,overruled on another issue as stated in locklin,at.
the court in keys,supra,cal d held that upper property owners could be liable if they failed to exercise reasonable care in the use of their property so as to avoid injury to the adjacent property through the flow of surface waters.id.at.the court in keys concluded that an uphill landowner,who altered the natural drainage of surface waters,could be liable for damages caused by the discharge of those waters onto adjacent property,under a reasonableness of conduct test.id.at.the court explained that it is incumbent upon every person to take reasonable care in using his or her property to avoid injury to adjacent property through the flow of surface waters.failure to exercise reasonable care may result in liability by an upper to a lower landowner.it is equally the duty of any person threatened with injury to his or her property by the flow of surface waters to take reasonable precautions to avoid or reduce any actual or potential injury.id.at.although not identical to a traditional negligence analysis,the central question to be determined under keys is one of reasonableness of conduct.ibid.
the keys court set forth the rules for determining liability under the reasonableness test if the weight is on the side of the person who alters the natural watercourse,then that person has acted reasonably and without liability if the harm to the lower landowner is unreasonably severe,then the economic costs incident to the expulsion of surface waters must be borne by the upper owner whose development caused the damage.if the facts should indicate both parties conducted themselves reasonably,then courts are bound by our civil law rule keys,supra,cal d at and the lower owner wins burrows state of california d.
in locklin,the supreme court extended the rule of reasonableness to apply when a public entity contributes to an increase in volume and velocity in a natural watercourse resulting in downstream property damage.locklin,supra,cal th at.as a result of upstream development,the watercourse in locklin began carrying larger volumes of water,which caused significant erosion of the plaintiffs properties.the defendant governmental entities were aware of the problem and could have acted to prevent the erosion.the owners of property along the watercourse sued on the basis that the upstream improvements,including the storm drain system,as well as the failure to maintain the watercourse,increased the volume and velocity of the water in the natural watercourse,causing the plaintiffs damages.id.at.the locklin court held that the trial court erred in exempting the public entities from liability,but still concluded that the public entities were not liable because the plaintiffs failed to prove that any unreasonable public entity conduct caused their property damage.id.at.
in the context of inverse condemnation,locklin holds that a public entity may be liable for downstream damage caused by an increased volume or velocity of surface waters discharged into a natural watercourse from public works or improvements on publicly owned land.it will be liable if it fails to use reasonably available,less injurious alternatives,or if it has incorporated the watercourse into a public drainage system or otherwise converted the watercourse itself into a public work.locklin,supra,cal th at.such liability exists only if the agency acts unreasonably,with reasonableness determined by balancing the public benefit and private damage in each case.id.at.the reasonableness of the public agency conduct must be determined on the facts of each case,taking into consideration the public benefit and the private damages in each instance.id.at.the departure from a strict liability standard was based on public policy b ecause strict liability would discourage construction of needed public improvements which affect surface water drainage,liability exists only if the agency acts unreasonably,with reasonableness determined by balancing the public benefit and private damage in each case.id.at,see also bunch coachella valley water dist.cal th.
the reasonableness test requires consideration of the purpose for which the improvements were undertaken,the amount of surface water runoff added to the streamflow by the defendant improvements in relation to that from development of other parts of the watershed,and the cost of mitigating measures available to both upper and downstream owners.those costs must be balanced against the magnitude of the potential for downstream damage.if both plaintiff and defendant have acted reasonably,the natural watercourse rule imposes the burden of damage on the downstream property.locklin,supra,cal th at.
iii.the drainage channel is a natural watercourse 
the trial court found that the drainage channel is a natural watercourse.see san gabriel valley country club los angeles cal,san gabriel chowchilla farms,martin cal.water diffused over the surface of land,or contained in depressions therein,and resulting from rain,snow,or which rises to the surface in springs,is known as surface water.it is thus distinguishable from water flowing in a fixed channel,so as to constitute a watercourse,or water collected in an identifiable body,such as a river or lake.the extraordinary overflow of rivers and streams is known as flood water.keys,supra,cal d at.
pinole point contends that the county is liable,even if the county acted reasonably,because the drainage channel is not a watercourse.pinole point argument is not entirely clear but,after locklin,there is no valid reason for distinguishing between surface waters and those that flow through a natural watercourse when determining the obligations of landowners.see locklin,supra,cal th at.the court in locklin held that the rule of reasonableness applies to cases involving the discharge of surface waters whether the water is discharged onto the land of an adjoining owner or into a natural watercourse.id.at see also,biron city of redding,supra,th at.
moreover,pinole point contention lacks merit as the record supports the trial court finding that the drainage channel is a natural watercourse.as explained in locklin a natural watercourse is a channel with defined bed and banks made and habitually used by water passing down as a collected body or stream in those seasons of the year and at those times when the streams in the region are accustomed to flow.locklin,supra,cal th at.alterations to a natural watercourse,such as the construction of conduits or other improvements in the bed of the stream,do not affect its status as a natural watercourse.ibid.a natural watercourse includes all channels through which,in the existing condition of the country,the water naturally flows,and may include new channels created in the course of urban development through which waters presently flow.ibid.where a channel has existed for a period of time and has all the attributes of a watercourse,it is immaterial that it was originally constructed artificially.chowchilla farms,martin,supra,cal.at.
pinole point stresses the trial court finding that aerial photographs showed the absence of any defined drainage channel prior to the construction of montalvin manor in the.pinole point argues that the drainage channel was built in as a mitigation effort to handle the increased drainage flow created by the montalvin manor development.since there was no preexisting watercourse on the remainder property,pinole point is apparently contending that the drainage channel could not be transformed into a natural watercourse 
the fact that the drainage channel did not exist in is not significant.in san gabriel,for example,the court explained that the channel at issue did not exist as a definite watercourse,at least as far as the plaintiff land,before the region was settled up,but was created as the result of settlement.nevertheless it is natural in the sense that it was originally made by the waters themselves,and not by man,although it is possible that except for the acts of man the waters would not have been kept together so as to make a channel.in any event,it has now existed for such a length of time as the channel for the natural drainage of the watershed tributary to it,that the manner of its creation is not material,and it has all the attributes of a water channel wholly natural in origin.san gabriel,supra,cal.at see also larrabee cloverdale cal.
the trial court assessed the evidence using the correct definition of watercourse.it found that people constructed the drainage channel no later than and it has been in its present form for more than years.witnesses testified that from until the drainage channel featured a bed and banks.the court stated that the only reason that the lower portions of the remainder parcel are not underwater in the winter months due to runoff from the hills above and frequently subject to tidal surges throughout the year from the bay is the presence of the railroad berms,which effectively create a levee system protecting the remainder parcel.without the berms,surface waters from upper landowners would naturally flow to the bay across the remainder parcel and tidal flows from the bay would flow in the opposite direction across the property.the drainage channel simply serves to facilitate that same flow given the unnatural berms that prevent that natural flow from occurring.this evidence supports the finding that the drainage channel is a natural watercourse.
iv.pinole point legal duty 
pinole point asserts that it,as the downstream property owner,has no legal duty to take affirmative action to remove the sediment or to maintain the drainage channel,especially since the sediment buildup that is causing the blockage comes from montalvin manor and the sediment is of no consequence to the remainder parcel.see gdowski louie th,gdowski.it asserts that cases following the holdings in keys and locklin clearly allocate the duty to perform this type of d rainage w ork to the county rather than to it,even if the county acted reasonably in making the original water diversions.since it had no legal duty to perform or pay for work needed to benefit the upstream landowner drainage system,pinole point insists the trial court never had to reach the question of the reasonableness of the parties conduct.
the county responds that pinole point ignores the longstanding rule under civil code section,subdivision a,that a person is liable for injuries caused by his or her want of ordinary care or skill in the management of his or her property see,sprecher adamson companies cal d,possessor of land not immune from liability for harm caused by a natural condition of the land and liability based on duty of reasonable care enunciated in civil code section ektelon city of san diego d,upstream landowner has no absolute right to protect land from floodwaters by constructing structures that increase downstream flow of water into natural watercourse,and court applied ordinary principles of negligence linvill perello d,property owner must act reasonably in building barriers to protect his or her property from floodwater damage.
pinole point answers that civil code section,subdivision a,and the cases applying traditional notions of negligence to landowners are not applicable to water law cases.
we need not settle the question whether civil code section,subdivision a,and the cases on the general rights and liabilities of landowners are applicable to this water law case because we conclude under the water law cases keys,locklin,and their progeny pinole point argument is incorrect.
both keys,supra,cal d and locklin,supra,cal th made clear that every property owner has a legal duty to act reasonably in the maintenance of his or her property to prevent damage to adjacent properties.no party,whether an upper or a lower landowner,may act arbitrarily and unreasonably in his or her relations with other landowners and still be immunized from all liability.locklin,at,quoting keys,at.indeed,the locklin court cited with approval court of appeal decisions see,martinson hughey d martinson that held the rule of reasonableness is applicable to discharges into natural watercourses or flood control improvements in a watercourse.locklin,at.
martinson,supra,d,like this case,involved the failure to keep a natural watercourse free of debris.the lower owner in martinson blocked a natural watercourse with debris,which backed water up onto the upper land.the court applied the rule of reasonableness and concluded t he upper owner has the right to discharge reasonable and noninjurious amounts of irrigation water through natural areas of flow onto the lower owner property.the lower owner has a burden to receive reasonable and noninjurious amounts of irrigation water through natural flowage channels.id.at see also weaver bishop d,rejected claim that strict liability applied and affirmed both the trial court application of the reasonableness rule and its findings that defendants conduct of altering the flow of the creek by placing boulders on the creek banks was reasonable as this action was necessary to prevent the washing away of defendants property.
pinole point argues that it is relieved of any duty to protect adjoining landowners from flooding because it did not create any barrier or take any other affirmative act to alter the natural flow of water onto the land of another gdowski,supra,th at.it points out that the cases cited by the county involved the defendants taking some action to divert or obstruct the drainage,martinson,supra,d defendant constructed a berm.pinole point maintains that it had no duty to volunteer to maintain the drainage channel simply because its predecessor had done that and it had no obligation to accommodate the drainage needs of montalvin manor.it claims that the good samaritan rule can not create a duty to act.see,paz state of california cal th,a person who has not created a peril is not liable in tort for failing to take affirmative action to protect another unless they have some relationship that gives rise to a duty to act.
a review of the water law cases confirms that most of them involve the creation of a diversion or obstruction,and the facts of this case are somewhat unique in that they involve inaction or an omission.although this latter situation is less common,liability can be based on an omission or inaction when the failure to act is an unreasonable use of the property.in belair riverside county flood control dist.cal d,the court held that the plaintiffs could not prevail on an inverse condemnation claim because they did not present substantial evidence that the flooding from the levee failure was the result of any unreasonable act or omission attributable to defendants.belair,at,italics added.similarly,the court in locklin,supra,cal th held that the property owner conduct in using or altering the property in a manner which affects the discharge of surface waters onto adjacent property is subject to a test of reasonableness.id.at,italics added.whether pinole point omission or failure to act was unreasonable is an issue of fact and depends upon the context of the situation,including whether it knew at the time it purchased the property that its failure to maintain the drainage channel would likely result in flooding on lettia road.see keys,supra,cal d at reasonableness is a factual question to be determined in each case upon a consideration of all the relevant circumstances,including such factors as the amount of harm caused,the foreseeability of the harm which results,the purpose or motive with which the possessor acted,and all other relevant matter.
pinole point relies on gdowski,supra,th pagliotti acquistapace cal d pagliotti,a companion case of keys sheffet county of los angeles,supra,d sheffet and a new jersey case cited in keys,armstrong francis armstrong.pinole point incorrectly maintains that these cases demonstrate that the upstream party always has to pay for maintenance caused by improvements it makes.it denies that it has any obligation to act in a particular manner to minimize the damage or injury caused by the county action.
none of the cases cited by pinole point imposed liability solely on the basis of the flooding or injury being caused by the party status as the upper landowner.in sheffet,supra,d,the question before the court was whether substantial evidence supported the lower court finding that the lower landowner had acted reasonably while the upper landowner had acted unreasonably.indeed,the appellate court observed that it was bound by the trial court decision unless substantial evidence did not support the trial court finding on reasonableness.id.at.in both sheffet and armstrong,the court imposed liability on the upper landowner because that party had engaged in some affirmative conduct creating the flooding problems and the adjacent property owner actions had been reasonable.sheffet,at,county liable in inverse condemnation for damages from overflow of surface waters from public streets onto plaintiff property where county approved subdivision and drainage system,plaintiffs acted reasonably in relation to his property,and damage to adjacent property resulted from improvements armstrong,supra defendant,in the course of developing large housing project,substantially augmented flow of surface water through natural channel on plaintiff land,causing considerable damage.in the other cases cited by pinole point,the appellate court reversed and remanded because the trial court failed to make the requisite reasonableness findings.pagliotti,supra,cal d at reversed lower court ruling granting upper landowners request to enjoin lower owner from maintaining dam across property and remanded for trial court to make finding on the reasonableness of defendant conduct in accordance with the rule set forth in keys,supra,cal d gdowski,supra,th at trial court committed prejudicial error when it refused to instruct on keys test of reasonableness and instead instructed the jury using general principles of negligence and contributory negligence.
pinole point also maintains that it had no duty to maintain the drainage channel because the holder of a prescriptive easement has the duty to maintain the easement.see,reinsch city of los angeles d conklin goodson d whalen ruiz cal d.it concludes that any acquisition of prescriptive rights by the county to continue using the drainage channel after could not shift the duty to maintain the drainage channel to pinole point.all of these cases predate locklin and both conklin and whalen predate keys.reinsch was filed two months after keys was decided,and did not consider the reasonableness test set forth in keys.after keys,t he modern rule governing landowner liability for surface water runoff and drainage is no longer simply a rule of property law dependent upon the existence of rights,servitudes,or easements today a landowner conduct in using or altering the property in a manner which affects the discharge of surface waters onto adjacent property is subject to a test of reasonableness.locklin,supra,cal th at,fn.moreover,neither pinole point nor the county pled or proved in the trial court that the county has a prescriptive easement and therefore cases on prescriptive easements are inapplicable.
the trial court did not create any new legal duty.it correctly applied the modern rule of reasonableness as f ailure to exercise reasonable care may result in liability by an upper to a lower landowner.locklin,supra,cal th at p.here,pinole point did not create a new structure or divert the flow of water instead,it blocked the flow of the natural waterway on its property by failing to keep it free of debris.the question whether this conduct was reasonable and whether the county as the owner of lettia road was reasonable in attempting to avoid or prevent injury is a factual inquiry that depends on all of the circumstances of the case.id.at.
liability in tort 
the trial court found pinole point liable to the county in negligence and nuisance and determined that the county was not liable to pinole point for the tortious diversion of surface waters.when negligent conduct interferes with another free use and enjoyment of his or her property,nuisance liability arises.see lussier san lorenzo valley water dist.d,see also melton boustred th.
as already noted,the civil law rule of reasonable conduct rather than traditional principles of nuisance or negligence law applies.gdowski,supra,th at.in reaffirming the test of reasonableness in the tort context,the locklin court stated the test is whether,under all the circumstances,the upper landowner conduct was reasonable.this rule of reasonableness applies to both private and public landowners,but it requires reasonable conduct on the part of downstream owners as well.this test requires consideration of the purpose for which the improvements were undertaken,the amount of surface water runoff added to the streamflow by the defendant improvements in relation to that from development of other parts of the watershed,and the cost of mitigating measures available to both upper and downstream owners.those costs must be balanced against the magnitude of the potential for downstream damage.if both plaintiff and defendant have acted reasonably,the natural watercourse rule imposes the burden of damage on the downstream property.locklin,supra,cal th at.
when considering the reasonableness of adjoining landowners with respect to the flow of surface waters,the court considers all the relevant circumstances,including such factors as the amount of harm caused,the foreseeability of the harm which results,the purpose or motive with which the possessor acted,and all other relevant matter.keys,supra,cal d at.another factor to be considered is whether the utility of the possessor use of his land outweighs the gravity of the harm which results from his or her alteration of the flow of surface waters.ibid.
we have two grounds for affirming the trial court findings on reasonableness.first,pinole point appellate briefs do not fairly summarize all of the facts in the light most favorable to the judgment.see,myers trendwest resorts,th,in every appeal,the appellant has the duty to fairly summarize all of the facts in the light most favorable to the judgment.failure to provide all material evidence amounts to waiver of the alleged error and we may presume that the record contains evidence to sustain every finding of fact.foreman clark fallon cal d.second,for the reasons explained below,the record contains substantial evidence supporting the findings that pinole point conduct was unreasonable and the county conduct was reasonable.
the two county projects involving drainage were the approval of montalvin manor in the early,which resulted in connecting the inch pipe to the drainage channel,and the improvement project,resulting in the installation of the inch pipe.with regard to the montalvin manor development,pinole point maintains that the diversion of the water into the drainage channel in the was improper and that the county had safer alternatives.additionally,milani testified that the housing development built in the early significantly increased the volume of water,flow rate of water,and velocity of water discharged from the up culvert into the remainder parcel.
the evidence in the record does not establish that the county conduct with regard to the development of montalvin manor created the drainage problems.the drainage channel had been constructed by this channel was maintained and kept clear of vegetation and debris until,when pinole point purchased the remainder parcel.there is no evidence of any damage to the residents on lettia road from flooding in the,or.thus,even if alternative drainage methods were available to the county when it developed montalvin manor in the,the absence of any evidence of flooding problems prior to the supports a finding that the county conduct in connecting the inch pipe to the drainage channel was reasonable.
the project involved the county installation of additional street catch basins to capture runoff more quickly the runoff was directed into the subdivision underground storm drain system.the county installed a inch pipe that extended approximately feet from lettia road through the bnsf berm near the inch pipe.the inch pipe essentially replaced the inch pipe and the inch pipe.pinole point argues that its evidence showed that the county did not satisfy the applicable standards of care for a storm drain design.pinole point expert testified that this flawed design caused the drainage channel to overflow he asserted that the county had other feasible alternatives.pinole point maintains that the evidence showed that this drainage system caused the sediment dam deposited in the drainage channel.
while the evidence established that the flow capacity of the inch pipe was greater,the trial court found that pinole point presented no evidence that discharge from either the inch pipe or the inch pipe had caused any loss or damage to pinole point.the court concluded the evidence at trial was clear that because of the blockage on the remainder parcel,the inch pipe is not able to convey the anticipated rainfall from even a year storm event.it can no longer handle even slight storm events,such as the of an inch storm of march,without flooding lettia road and thr
