fall river rural electric cooperative,fall river petitions for review of two federal energy regulatory commission ferc orders.fall river applied for a license to construct,operate,and maintain a new hydroelectric power generating facility at hebgen dam on the madison river in gallatin county,montana.in its orders ferc dismissed fall river license application and denied fall river request to hold the proceeding in abeyance,fall river rural,ferc,and it denied fall river request for rehearing,fall river rural,ferc.fall river timely petitioned for review of both orders.we have jurisdiction pursuant to b,and we deny fall river petition for review.
facts and proceedings below 
the hydroelectric project develops hydropower on a stretch of the madison and missouri rivers in southwestern montana.the project is licensed to pennsylvania power and light montana,llc ppl under ferc project.pp l montana,llc,ferc.the project consists of nine hydroelectric developments,eight of which have power generating facilities.id.at.the hebgen development is the one development without a power generating facility and is instead used as a water storage and release facility.releases from hebgen reservoir provide head and flow to the hydroelectric project eight other downstream developments.id.
hebgen dam is an structure with a concrete core wall and is feet long and feet high.discharges from hebgen reservoir are controlled by outlet works consisting of an intake tower,a conduit through the dam,and a conduit outlet.the intake tower includes four openings,two of which are presently closed with timber stoplogs,while the other two are used for reservoir discharges.water passes from the intake tower through the dam structure in a woodstavelined conduit,which has an unreinforced concrete encasement and is approximately feet long and twelve feet in diameter.the conduit outlet is an concrete box structure at the toe of the dam that directs discharges into the madison river.the hebgen development also includes a spillway,which is located on the right abutment of the dam.
in,ferc granted fall river a preliminary permit to conduct investigations and to secure data necessary to determine the feasibility of a hydroelectric development project at hebgen dam.symbiotics,llc,ferc,ppl did not oppose fall river preliminary permit application and in fact cooperated with fall river feasibility studies and engaged in negotiations with fall river regarding a possible site use and operations agreement.
in may,fall river filed its final license application for the proposed hebgen dam hydroelectric project.in its application,fall river proposed several modifications and additions to the existing hebgen development.first,fall river proposed constructing a powerhouse with a single turbine generator unit eighty feet downstream from the toe of the dam and immediately north of the present conduit outlet.discharges would be made through a submerged draft tube below the surface of the tailwater.second,fall river proposed and the conduit because it was not designed to withstand the full reservoir pressure required for power generation.third,fall river proposed bifurcating the conduit approximately to feet upstream of the current conduit outlet.fall river proposed installing a steel penstock ten feet in diameter to direct the flow from the existing conduit to the proposed powerhouse.the bifurcation and isolation valves would be located in a new concrete valve house upstream of the proposed powerhouse.fifth,a new power transmission line would be installed to connect the plant electrical output to fall river existing hebgen substation near grayling,montana.sixth,and finally,fall river proposed using all four of the existing intake tower openings by removing the timber stoplogs from the two currently unused openings and installing intake gates in their place.
while fall river license application did not propose modifying the existing spillway,ppl would have to use the spillway for all discharges during approximately three months of the construction period.once completed,the powerhouse would operate in mode,and would utilize flow releases from hebgen dam as determined under ppl license.fall river would not have access to reservoir storage for additional power generation.
in july,ferc informed fall river by letter that its license application potentially conflicted with section of the federal power act fpa,specifically,ferc stated that it can not,without ppl concurrence,approve a development proposal that would materially affect or modify the licensed project.without ppl consent to fall river proposed modifications to project,fall river application would be precluded by the requirements of fpa section and therefore would be subject to rejection under e.however,because fall river was in the process of negotiating a site use and operations agreement with ppl,ferc stated that it would continue to process fall river application,conditioned on fall river filing additional information showing that ppl has not ruled out an agreement to the modifications to its project.ferc required fall river to provide this information within thirty days and by the end of each subsequent period.fall river did so,filing five status reports between august and may.
just before fall river filed its last status report,however,ppl sent a letter to fall river terminating negotiations.the letter stated that the negotiations with fall river over an extended period have not been successful and that ppl was not interested in proceeding any further with negotiations.ppl also filed a copy of the letter with ferc.
in its final status report,after noting ppl letter and recognizing that it appear ed that negotiations ha d come to a stalemate,fall river declared its intent to continue it sic efforts to resolve there sic difference sic with ppl in the hopes of coming to an acceptable financial arrangement.fall river further noted that prior to ppl letter of january,there ha d been no objection by ppl for the licensing and development of additional generation at the hebgen dam,and therefore requested that ferc continue to move forward with the licensing of the hebgen dam project.alternatively,if ferc fe lt it was unable to proceed with the licensing in the absence of ppl consent,fall river requested that ferc hold the licensing process in abeyance until such time that fall river and ppl have resolved there sic differences.
ppl then sent a letter to ferc to supplement and clarify certain issues in fall river status report.ppl stated o n april,ppl montana notified falls river sic that it was terminating negotiations for a site agreement.as ppl montana has already communicated to falls river sic and npsi,we do not intend to resume these negotiations for the installation of additional generation at the hebgen development by falls river sic or npsi.
shortly thereafter,the director of ferc division of hydropower licensing dismissed fall river license application and denied its request to hold the application in abeyance.fall river rural,ferc the dismissal order.the director concluded that fall river proposed project is barred under fpa section because it would substantially alter ppl montana licensed project works without ppl consent.id.at.the director specifically noted fall river proposals to modify the existing intake structure by inserting new gates and screens in two intake openings,to bifurcate the outlet conduit,to install a penstock extending to a new powerhouse,and that installation of its valve house to bifurcate the hebgen outlet conduit will require extensive excavation of the earth fill covering the conduit.id.the director concluded,t hese are the types of modifications to a licensed project that the commission has found require the licensee consent under section of the fpa.id.therefore,w ithout ppl montana consent for these alterations,the application must be dismissed without prejudice to fall river its application,in the event it is able to obtain ppl montana consent for use of the hebgen development.id.the director further concluded that because of ppl intention not to resume negotiations,n o public purpose would be served by continuing to process the application or to hold the application in abeyance.id.
fall river then filed a request for rehearing,which a panel of three commissioners denied.fall river,ferc the rehearing order.the panel concluded that t he proposed project requires alterations of the existing project facilities that are much greater than the kind of physical alterations the commission has previously found to be insubstantial.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the panel specifically noted the installation of new gates and screens on the intake tower,excavation of a large area of the dam in order to reconfigure and reline the outlet conduit,and installation of a valve house and new penstock at the dam,and the fact that c onstruction of the proposed project would also require ppl to enter into an agreement with fall river regarding coordination of activities,and responsibility for operation and maintenance of joint use facilities.id.therefore,the panel concluded,the physical changes to the existing structures are not minor and that such coordination obligations are not insubstantial.id.
after explaining that a substantial alteration may result from significant alterations to project works alone,id.at,the panel also concluded that the potential for operational problems would be a substantial alteration of the existing license,id.at,thereby requiring ppl consent.the panel specifically noted that ppl ability to meet its flow requirements could be compromised during the three months of construction when all flows would be released via the spillway after construction,ppl ability to maintain appropriate dissolved oxygen levels could be compromised because under fall river proposal,water would be released below the tailwater surface rather than dropping into the tailwater as it currently does and it might be necessary to require finer screening at the intakes to guard against turbine entrainment mortality of salmonid,thereby potentially compromis ing ppl ability to satisfy the flow release requirements of its license.id.at.
the panel also concluded that ferc prior issuance of a preliminary permit was not inconsistent with its dismissal of fall river license application,in light of the limited purpose of the preliminary permit and the intervening breakdown in negotiations between ppl and fall river.id.at.finally,the panel rejected fall river arguments that ppl either expressly consented to future modifications of its license by accepting standard articles and in its license,or had impliedly consented by expressing no opposition to fall river preliminary permit application or its final license application,or by cooperating with fall river for years before abruptly terminating negotiations.id.at.
fall river timely petitioned for review of both the dismissal order and the rehearing order.
ii.standards of review 
under the administrative procedure act,this court reviews decisions by ferc to determine whether the agency action was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.cal.dep t of water res.ferc,cir.under the fpa,ferc factual findings are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.b bear lake watch,ferc,cir.here,as elsewhere,s ubstantial evidence constitutes more than a mere scintilla.it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.if the evidence is susceptible of more than one rational interpretation,we must uphold ferc findings.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted alterations in original.ferc interpretation of the fpa is entitled to chevron deference.am.rivers ferc,cir.
iii.discussion 
substantial evidence of an alteration under section of the fpa 
fall river first argues that because its proposal would not substantially or materially alter ppl project configuration,mode of operations,or power generation,ferc orders are not supported by substantial evidence.we disagree.
section of the fpa states that licenses may be altered only upon mutual agreement between the licensee and the commission.the term altered is not statutorily defined however,both parties agree that in order to violate section,a proposed project must substantially alter an existing license.as neither party disputes the relevant standard,for purposes of this appeal we assume without deciding that in order for section of the fpa to apply,a proposed project must substantially alter an existing license.pac.gas ferc,we do not,however,adopt ferc view that only substantial alterations in a license engage section protections.under this standard,ferc may authorize de minimis interferences with the operation of an existing plant,s mall encroachments on a license,comparable in their adverse impact to variations in conditions that investors might expect from other causes such as,for example,annual fluctuations in water supply.id.at.ferc may not,however,issue a license which will significantly interfere with operations already licensed,whether the interference will adversely affect the prior licensee physical plant,its project works,or its supplies of water.id.at.
under ferc precedent,w hat constitutes an alteration for section purposes is primarily a factual issue to be determined in each case.universal power,ferc.therefore,ferc conclusion that fall river proposed project would substantially alter ppl license is conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.b.
in this case,ferc concluded that both fall river proposed physical modifications to the hebgen development and the possible operational impacts to the project constitute substantial alterations of ppl license.ferc,at see gas dep t of holyoke,ferc,t here are essentially two types of interference with the licensed project that we must consider physical alterations to existing project works and impacts on the operation of the project.
ferc first explained in its rehearing order that the proposed project requires alterations of the existing project facilities that are much greater than the kind of physical alterations the commission has previously found to be insubstantial.ferc,at.in reaching this conclusion ferc specifically relied on the installation of new gates and screens on the intake tower,excavation of a large area of the dam in order to reconfigure and reline the outlet conduit,and installation of a valve house and a new penstock at the dam.id.
fall river first objects to ferc finding that its proposal includes installing screens on the intake tower.though screens were mentioned on multiple occasions in the documents supporting fall river license application,fall river is correct that screens were not part of its final license application.nevertheless,fall river does not dispute that it proposes making physical alterations to the intake tower,namely removing the timber stoplogs from the two intake openings and installing two new intake gates in their place.
fall river next notes that excavation would be limited to a relatively small area on the downstream toe of the dam,and would not amount to the excavation of a large area of the dam described by ferc.fall river asserts that the excavation would be limited to the hillside over the downstream sixty feet of the conduit.there is no dispute,however,that the proposed excavation requires removing approximately square feet of soil for construction of the new powerhouse and valve house.fall river simply prefers to characterize this as excavating a relatively small area rather than a large area.
next,while conceding that it proposes relining the conduit,fall river objects to ferc finding that the outlet conduit will be reconfigured.however,the license application explicitly proposes bifurcating the outlet conduit,installing a new penstock,and constructing a new concrete valve house,in addition to and the conduit.
after discussing the aforementioned physical alterations,ferc also concluded that in this case the potential for operational problems would be a substantial alteration of the existing license.ferc,at.specifically,ferc identified use of the spillway for all discharges during approximately three months of the construction period as potentially impacting ppl ability to meet its flow
