solano county super.no.
solano county and the san francisco bay conservation and development commission approved permits to allow real party in interest waste connections,to expand the potrero hills landfill,which is situated within the secondary management area of the suisun marsh.the permits were issued after years of environmental review and litigation under the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resource code,et.
in the instant writ proceeding,petitioners contend the permit approvals violate the sonoma county local protection plan and,specifically,a county ordinance,because the expansion will entail some rechanneling of an ephemeral watercourse called spring branch.under that ordinance,modification of a marsh watercourse is allowed only if no reasonable alternative exists.petitioners claim the commission could have,and should have,approved a smaller expansion that would not impinge on the intermittent watercourse.the trial court agreed,ruling no substantial evidence supports the commission determination that a smaller alternative is not economically reasonable.the commission and real party have appealed.we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
the potrero hills landfill is located in the upland,grassland area or secondary management area of the suisun marsh.the landfill site is currently acres in size.the expansion,as proposed in,would allow an increase in fill height and also add acres of adjoining property to the site extending the life of the landfill another years.the proposed expansion would also have a number of environmental impacts,including impinging on and requiring the alteration of a portion of an intermittent watercourse,spring branch.decades ago,relocation of another portion of spring branch was deemed consistent with applicable laws,and permitted in connection with the landfill.
county approval of permits 
in early,the county gave notice it would prepare an environmental impact report eir for the proposed landfill expansion.the draft eir,published later that year,concluded relocating a portion of the spring branch watercourse would not have a significant environmental impact if certain mitigation measures were adopted in part,this conclusion was based on a finding the watercourse was then devoid of riparian vegetation.the draft eir also concluded the project was consistent with the suisun marsh preservation act of pub,et and the solano county local protection plan.
the draft eir evaluated one alternative to the proposed expansion project increasing the height of the landfill,without increasing the footprint.this alternative was rejected because it would still require excavation of the adjacent land,would not appreciably reduce environmental impacts,and would,with a significantly reduced fill capacity,undermine the project goals.offsite alternatives were not considered in detail,since any new site was likely to raise issues similar to those facing the proposed expansion.
two years later,in september,after receiving and responding to comments,the county certified a final eir and issued a use permit and marsh development permit for the proposed expansion nos.u and md.
under the suisun marsh preservation act,a decision by a local government to issue a marsh development permit can be challenged in two ways.one provides for tiered agency,and then court review.the challenger first appeals to the san francisco bay conservation and development commission,the body with ultimate responsibility for implementing the act,subd.a.if the challenger remains aggrieved after the commission decision on appeal,the challenger may seek judicial review by filing a petition for a writ of mandate in accordance with the provisions of section of the code of civil procedure within days after such decision or action has become final.the other avenue allows for direct review by the courts.the challenger may seek judicial review of any decision made or any action taken pursuant to this division by a local government that is implementing the certified local protection program,or any component thereof,whether or not such decision or action has been appealed to the commission,by filing a petition for writ of mandate in accordance with the provisions of section of the code of civil procedure within days after the decision or action has become final.
petitioner david tam took both paths.
the prior protect the marsh writ proceeding 
in october,tam and others filed a writ proceeding in solano county superior court,protect the marsh county of solano case no.the first amended petition not only challenged the adequacy of the county eir first cause of action it,in separate causes of action,sought to invalidate the marsh development permit as noncompliant with the county general plan second cause of action and zoning regulations third cause of action,and the suisun marsh preservation act,suisun marsh protection plan,and solano county local protection plan fourth cause of action.among other things,the amended petition specifically alleged the alteration of spring branch was inconsistent with the local protection plan.as required by section authorizing direct judicial review of a marsh permitting decision,tam and the other petitioners in protect the marsh gave the commission notice of the writ proceeding.the commission could have sought to intervene,but apparently did not.
the trial court issued its decision in the prior protect the marsh writ proceeding on february.it ruled two findings in the eir,unrelated to spring branch,were not supported by substantial evidence.it also faulted the eir for not considering alternative landfill sites outside of the marsh.the court rejected the remainder of the petitioners claims,also ruling that the modification of the spring branch watercourse was not inconsistent with any governing plan or regulatory requirement.this writ decision was not appealed.
during and,the county revised,and the eir.the revised eir included a page discussion of,and reasons for rejecting,locations for a new landfill in lieu of expanding the existing landfill.the trial court determined the discussion and rejection of one of the locations was inadequate and therefore refused to approve the county return to the writ.
the county spent another year making additional revisions,and on november,the trial court approved its return to the writ.sprawldef,which had not been a party to the writ proceeding,purported to appeal this order,but its appeal no.was dismissed for lack of standing.
the appeal to the commission 
the same month tam and others filed the protect the marsh writ proceeding,he and others also filed administrative appeals of the marsh development permit with the commission.although tam did not contend the relocation of the spring branch watercourse was inconsistent with applicable state and local laws,other appellants did.
in december,the commission concluded the appeals raised substantial issues,triggering de novo review of the county approval of the marsh development permit.see.accordingly,in addition to considering the existing administrative permit record and a wide range of documents related to other agencies analysis and approval of the project the commission undertook its own investigation of the project and retained a panel of scientists to prepare a report on ecological impacts to the marsh.the nearly page report was completed in.
assessing spring branch,the scientists report found the intermittent watercourse had a bed and banks.it also found wetland vegetation within the watercourse,differing from the hydrology report prepared in connection with the county eir and other reports submitted to the commission by real party.the scientists report,which the commission ultimately credited,recommended modified mitigation measures,including having the rechanneled watercourse more closely mimic the native one,employing better monitoring of water quality,and seeking preservation of similar areas within the spring branch watershed.in light of the new information and proposals in connection with spring branch,the commission asked real party to explore reducing the size of the expansion.
the size of the landfill was addressed in a report on alternatives real party prepared and submitted to the army corps of engineers,whose approval was also required for the proposed expansion.the report was eventually filed with the commission and part of the universe of materials referenced by staff during the administrative proceeding.
the report analyzed alternatives and four alternatives and compared them to the proposed expansion which would increase the capacity of the landfill by about million tons million cubic yards,at a unit cost of per ton million,and extend the life of the landfill by years.the first alternative increased only the height of the landfill.this would increase the capacity by only million tons million cubic yards,at a unit cost of per ton million,and add only seven years to the life of the landfill.as had been noted in the eir,this alternative would likely require excavation of soil surrounding the spring branch watercourse,creating some environmental impacts in the area.the second alternative called for a acre rather than acre expansion of the landfill footprint,without additional height.this would increase the landfill capacity by million tons million cubic yards,at a cost of per ton million,and add about years of life.it would avoid acres of the spring branch watercourse,in addition to preserving other wetlands.a third alternative was similar,adding acres to the landfill footprint.this would increase capacity by million tons million cubic yards,at a cost of per ton million,and extend the life of the landfill by approximately years.it would not impact the spring branch watercourse.a fourth alternative moved the expansion some feet from the existing landfill,resulting in two fill mounds,rather than one expanded mound.this would increase the landfill capacity by million tons million cubic yards,at a cost of per ton million and extend the life of the landfill by years.this alternative would not impact spring branch,but would impact other wetlands.the report rejected each of these alternatives as too costly on a per unit basis,concluding any alternative costing percent more per ton than the proposed expansion was not economically practicable.
the commission,itself,engaged in direct dialogue,through numerous exchanges,with real party about another alternative that would not encroach on spring branch.this alternative would add rather than acres to the landfill site,all north of spring branch it would reduce expansion capacity by about percent,shorten the lifespan of the landfill by years,and reduce overall gross revenues by percent.there would not,however,be a commensurate reduction in investment costs.because such costs are largely fixed,there would only be a percent reduction in costs.nor was there a direct correlation between the percentage reduction in the acreage and reduction in capacity due to the nature of landfill engineering and,specifically,that the land around spring branch is capable of supporting a greater volume of landfill than other areas.real party therefore advised the commission the economic consequences of the acre alternative will be of such a magnitude that the business decision to expand can not be justified.
in answer to further commission inquiries,real party explained its profit margins were typically around percent,giving it only a small margin of error for operating new or expanded sites.accordingly,without capacity for to million cubic yards of fill in the expansion area,the project would not be financially viable.real party declined to provide further financial detail,viewing the information as confidential.
the commission concluded the acre alternative was not economically realistic.its rejection of this alternative,however,was not based solely on economics.the commission also pointed out even with a smaller expansion plan,spring branch would need a number of modifications to protect it from natural erosion and landfill impacts and rechanneling the watercourse would actually improve water quality at the marsh.the commission concluded based upon the information available to the commission,the information and statements made by real party in response to staff requests to evaluate the feasibility of a smaller landfill expansion project,and the information provided in the draft eir that with mitigation measures,diverting spring branch would not have a significant environmental impact on surface water quality,the commission finds that restricting the project to avoid spring branch is not a reasonable alternative 
the commission did,however,on the basis of community input and for aesthetic reasons,reject the increased landfill height the county had allowed.accordingly,the height,in both the new and old portions of the landfill,would remain capped at feet above sea level,unless real party could demonstrate the fill will not be visible from preset vantage points.this modification reduced the capacity of the planned expansion by approximately percent.
on october,the commission voted to reject the administrative appeals,and determined that the landfill expansion,as modified by the commission,was consistent with the suisun marsh preservation act and the solano county local protection plan.pertinent here,the modified marsh development permit allowed for replacement of portions of the spring branch watercourse with a foot underground pipeline and a deep,foot wide surface channel.
this writ proceeding 
two months later,on december,tam and sprawldef filed the instant writ proceeding separate from the,by then,already resolved protect the marsh proceeding in san francisco superior court pursuant to section,challenging the commission approval of the marsh development permit and,specifically,its decision to allow alteration of the spring branch watercourse.petitioners claim no substantial evidence supports the commission determination there are no reasonable alternatives that would preserve spring branch and the commission thereby violated solano county ordinance section,which prohibited filling natural channels in the marsh unless there are no reasonable alternatives.four months later,the san francisco superior court transferred the case to solano county.
on november,the same court that decided the protect the marsh writ proceeding and ultimately approved the eir and rejected claims about the modification of spring branch issued a writ of mandate on the sole ground the commission determination that the acre,alternative was not economically reasonable was not supported by substantial evidence.the court did not address any other issue,including whether there was evidence in the record the alternative was unreasonable for other reasons.
discussion 
the suisun marsh act and standard of review 
the legislature created the san francisco bay conservation and development commission in and gave it planning and permitting authority over projects affecting the san francisco bay.people ex rel.san francisco bay conservation development commission town of emeryville cal d,mein san francisco bay conservation.com.d.the commission jurisdiction over the bay includes all sloughs marshlands extending from a seaward line of mean high tide of the bay to a landward line five feet above mean sea level tidelands lying between mean high tide and mean low tide and submerged lands lying below mean low tide.littoral development san francisco bay conservation.com.th.
the suisun marsh preservation act is intended to protect valuable natural resources within the marsh and invests the commission with ultimate authority over its implementation.see,subd.a.under the act,the marsh consists of primary areas and lowland grasslands,and upland secondary areas.for developments in secondary areas such as the landfill expansion at issue here a marsh development permit must be obtained from the local government having jurisdiction over the land in which the proposed development is to occur,subd.a.
a local government may issue a marsh development permit only if it finds that the proposed development is consistent with or in conformity with the adopted local protection program,subd.a.the local protection program is defined as those provisions of general or specific plans ordinances zoning district maps land use regulations,procedures,or controls or any other programs,procedures,standards,or controls that are adopted,undertaken,or carried out by local governments,districts,or the solano county local agency formation commission in and adjacent to the marsh,are submitted by the county to the commission,and meet the requirements of,and implement,this division and the suisun marsh protection plan at the local level.
as we have discussed,the act permits challenges to permitting decisions to be brought by way of a a petition for a writ of mandate in accordance with the provisions of section of the code of civil procedure.under subdivision b of code of civil procedure section,an abuse of discretion is established and a writ of mandate should issue if an agency either failed to proceed in the manner required by law,did not support its decision with adequate findings,or if its findings are not supported by the record.save san francisco bay san francisco bay conservation.com.th,save san francisco bay.the scope of our review of a challenged permitting decision is the same as that of the trial court.see ross california coastal com.th,ross advanced choices,state of health services th.

substantial evidence supports the commission action 
while petitioners have cited to a variety of provisions of the suisun marsh preservation act and the county local protection program,at the end of the day,their challenge to the commission approval of a marsh development permit is grounded on one solano county ordinance,section under section,a grading ordinance,every effort must be made to preserve natural channels and drainage ways,subd.n and,more concretely,that filling,grading,or excavating watercourses shall be allowed only where no reasonable alternative is available,and where allowed,shall be limited to the minimum amount necessary,subd.o.petitioners claim no substantial evidence supports the commission finding that the acre alternative is not economically reasonable.
in arguing whether,from an economic perspective,there was no reasonable alternative under section,petitioners and respondents alike invoke ceqa and its concept of whether an alternative is or is not feasible feasible is defined in ceqa as capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time,taking into account economic,environmental,social,and technological factors.see.under ceqa,governments are to choose feasible alternatives and feasible mitigation measures to lessen the significant environmental impacts of projects.while the marsh preservation act defines feasible identically to ceqa,it does not,itself,appear to employ the term in any substantive way.
we conclude employing ceqa definition of feasible,and the ceqa case law concerning economic infeasibility,is an appropriate approach since the term embraces the concept of reasonableness.see citizens of goleta valley board of supervisors cal d,under ceqa,t he statutory requirements for consideration of alternatives must be judged against a rule of reason california native plant society city of santa cruz th,feasibility under ceqa encompasses desirability to the extent that desirability is based on a reasonable balancing of the relevant economic,environmental,social,and technological factors.
the feasibility of alternatives must be evaluated within the context of the proposed project.the fact that an alternative may be more expensive or less profitable is not sufficient to show that the alternative is financially infeasible.what is required is evidence that the additional costs or lost profitability are sufficiently severe as to render it impractical to proceed with the project.citations.thus,when the cost of an alternative exceeds the cost of the proposed project,it is the magnitude of the difference that will determine the feasibility of this alternative.center for biological diversity county of san bernardino th.ultimately,the question is whether the marginal costs of the alternative as compared to the cost of the proposed project are so great that a reasonably prudent person would not proceed with the altered project.uphold our heritage town of woodside th,woodside.
for example,in woodside the proposed project was replacing an old,historic residence with a new one.woodside,supra,th at.the town rejected two rehabilitation alternatives as infeasible based on their cost between million and million without obtaining any evidence about the cost of constructing the proposed new home.without any comparative numbers,it was not possible to determine the feasibility of the rehabilitation alternatives.id.at.however,the conclusion was different for two other alternatives calling for relocation and renovation of the old residence in addition to building a new home.the appellate court held a million price tag for relocation and renovation,apart from the cost of the new home,supports a reasonable inference that these alternatives are not economically feasible.id.at,fn.
woodside does not require any particular economic analysis or any particular kind of economic data,but requires generally some context that allows for economic comparison.woodside,supra,th at pp.the appellate court suggested that to reject the alternative,for example,it might have been sufficient to show that the cost of rehabilitating the existing house would be significantly more than the cost of building a new home of a quality appropriate to the area,or that the cost of the proposed alternative is so great that the property owner could never expect to recover the investment on resale.id.at pp.the court declined
