city of healdsburg healdsburg appeals the district court judgment in favor of plaintiff appellee northern california river watch river watch,an environmental group,in this litigation under the clean water act cwa.plaintiff alleges that healdsburg,without first obtaining a national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit,violated the cwa by discharging sewage from its waste treatment plant into waters covered by the act.healdsburg discharged the sewage into a body of water known as basalt pond,a rock quarry pit that had filled with water from the surrounding aquifer,located next to the russian river.
the issue is whether basalt pond is subject to the cwa because the pond,containing wetlands,borders additional wetlands that are adjacent to a navigable river of the united states.the district court held that discharges into the pond are discharges into the russian river,a navigable water of the united states protected by the cwa.the court followed the united states supreme court decision in united states riverside bayview homes,d.
the supreme court,however,has now narrowed the scope of that decision.see rapanos united states,d.in a decision,the controlling opinion is that of justice kennedy who said that to qualify as a regulable water under the cwa the body of water itself need not be continuously flowing,but that there must be a significant nexus to a waterway that is in fact navigable.
in light of rapanos,we conclude that basalt pond possesses such a significant nexus to waters that are navigable in fact,not only because the pond waters seep into the navigable russian river,but also because they significantly affect the physical,biological,and chemical integrity of the river.we affirm the district court holding that basalt pond is subject to the cwa.we also affirm the district court ruling that neither the waste treatment system nor the excavation operation exceptions in the act apply to healdsburg discharges.
background 
the clean water act of provides the foundation for this case.see.the primary objective of the cwa is to restore and maintain the chemical,physical and biological integrity of the nation waters.a.to effectuate this objective,one of the cwa principal sections strictly prohibits discharges of pollutants into the navigable waters of the united states without an npdes permit from the environmental protection agency epa.a.the cwa defines the term navigable waters to mean waters of the united states,including the territorial seas.
basalt pond was created in approximately when the basalt rock company began excavating gravel and sand from land near the russian river.after the top soil was ripped away,large machines tore out rock and sand.the result was a pit.the pit filled with water up to the line of the water table of the surrounding aquifer.today,basalt pond,measuring one half mile in length and a quarter mile in breadth,contains acres of surface water.the pond lies along the west side of the russian river,separated from the river by wetlands and a levee.
it is undisputed that the russian river is a navigable water of the united states.its headwaters originate in mendocino county,california.its main course runs about miles,flowing into the pacific ocean west of santa rosa.
the horizontal distance between the edge of the river and the edge of the pond varies between and several hundred feet,depending on the exact location and the height of the river water.usually,there is no surface connection,because the levee blocks it and prevents the pond from being inundated by high river waters in the rainy season.
in,healdsburg built a secondary plant on a site located on the north side of basalt pond about feet from and west of the russian river.prior to,healdsburg discharged the plant wastewater into another pit located to the north.in,healdsburg began discharging into basalt pond.although healdsburg did not obtain an npdes permit,it received a state water emission permit as well as permission from syar industries,the current owner and manager of land and operations at basalt pond.
the wastewater was discharged into basalt pond from the plant at about to million gallons per year between and.the volume of the pond itself is somewhat to million gallons.the annual outflow from the sewage plant,therefore,is sufficient to fill the entire pond every one to two years.basalt pond would,of course,soon overflow in these circumstances were it not for the fact that the pond drains into the surrounding aquifer.
pond water in the aquifer finds its way to the river over a period of a few months and seeps into the river along as much as feet of its banks.the district court made specific findings as to the impact of the wastewater ultimately draining into the russian river.first,the district court noted that not all the sewage in the wastewater reached the river.the wastewater is partially cleansed as it passes through the bottom and sides of the basalt pond.healdsburg refers to this process as polishing or percolation.the wetlands around basalt pond also help cleanse the outflow by passing the effluent through the wetlands sediment.the filtration is effective in reducing biochemical oxygen demand and removing some pollutants,but the filtration is not perfect.
the district court found that the concentrations of chloride in the groundwater between the pond and the russian river are substantially higher than in the surrounding area.chloride,which already exists in the pond due to naturally occurring salts,reaches the river in higher concentrations as a direct result of healdsburg discharge of sewage into the pond.john lambie,a water expert for healdsburg,testified at trial that the average concentration of chloride appearing upstream in the river is only parts per million.in contrast,the average concentration of chloride seeping from basalt pond into the river is parts per million.at a monitoring well between the pond and the river,the underground concentration is diluted to some parts per million.ultimately,a chloride concentration of parts per million appears on the west side of the river.the district court thus found that chloride from the pond over time makes its way to the river in higher concentrations than naturally occurring in the river.this finding was further supported by larry russell,one of river watch trial experts.
plaintiffs filed this suit on december,alleging that healdsburg is violating the cwa by discharging wastewater into basalt pond.after a four day trial,the district court made findings of fact to support its holding that healdsburg discharged sewage into a protected water of the united states in violation of the cwa.the court holding was premised on the legal conclusion that basalt pond is a water of the united states within the meaning of the cwa.see wl.this appeal followed.
discussion 
wetlands constituting waters of the united states 
congress passed the clean water act in.the act stated objective is to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.a.to that end,the statute,among other things,prohibits the discharge of any pollutant by any person except as provided in the act.a.
after the cwa was passed,an issue arose concerning the extent to which wetlands adjacent to navigable waters constitute waters of the united states.in,the army corps of engineers acoe issued regulations defining waters of the united states to include adjacent wetlands.a.the regulations specifically provide that t he term waters of the united states means,among other things,w etlands adjacent to waters.id.the regulations further specify that w etlands separated from other waters of the united states by dikes or barriers,natural river berms,beach dunes and the like are adjacent wetlands.c.
the supreme court has since confirmed that regulable waters of the united states include tributaries of traditionally navigable waters and wetlands adjacent to navigable waters and their tributaries.riverside bayview homes.a.the only question reserved in riverside bayview homes was the issue of cwa jurisdiction over truly isolated waters.see rapanos.at.
thus,the first issue before us is whether basalt pond and the wetlands in it are isolated waters,or whether they constitute covered wetlands within the meaning of the regulations and within the scope of riverside bayview homes and rapanos.
the applicable regulations define wetlands as those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater.see b.the record here reflects that the russian river and surrounding area,including the pond itself,rest on top of a vast gravel bed extending as much as sixty feet into the earth.the gravel bed is a porous medium,saturated with water.through it flows an equally vast underground aquifer.this aquifer supplies the principal pathway for a continuous passage of water between basalt pond and the russian river.beneath the surface,water soaks in and out of the pond via the underground aquifer.this action is continuous,hours a day,seven days a week,days a year.indeed,the parties have stipulated that the pond and the river overlie the same unconfined aquifer and that the land separating the two is saturated below the water table.
the basalt pond and its surrounding area are therefore regulable under the clean water act,because they qualify as wetlands under the regulatory definition.the district court explicitly found that the pond is not only surrounded by extensive wetlands,which connect to the russian river,but also that the pond shoreline has receded so substantially that much of the area that was originally basalt pond has turned into wetland.this case is thus different than our recent decision in san francisco baykeeper cargill salt,cir,because here,the pond is not isolated it contains and is surrounded by wetlands,rendering it regulable under the cwa.
the remaining question is whether,under rapanos and its antecedents,basalt pond is a water of the united states because it is sufficiently adjacent to the navigable russian river to confer jurisdiction or alternatively because it has a substantial nexus to the river.
the supreme court has not yet agreed upon a satisfactory explanation of when wetlands are sufficiently adjacent to navigable waters to confer cwa jurisdiction.the leading case addressing the issue is riverside bayview homes,which was decided in.the supreme court there upheld cwa jurisdiction over wetlands that directly abutted a navigable creek.the court held that the relationship between waters and their adjacent wetlands provides an adequate basis for a legal judgment that adjacent wetlands may be defined as waters under the act.id.at.
in solid waste agency of northern cook county united states army corps of engineers,d swancc,the supreme court again interpreted the cwa term navigable waters and held that isolated ponds and mudflats,unconnected to other waters covered by the act,were not waters of the united states,because they were either not sufficiently adjacent to navigable waterways or did not have a substantial nexus to such waters.the case involved ponds that had been formed as a result of an abandoned sand and gravel pit mining operation,but were not adjacent wetlands.the acoe regulations defined the ponds nevertheless to be waters of the united states,id.at.quoting a,because they were used as habitat by other migratory birds which cross state lines,id.at.quoting fed.reg.under this migratory bird rule,ponds that are isolated from navigable waters may constitute waters of the united states if they are used as habitat by migratory birds.the supreme court rejected that theory and held that the cwa does not protect isolated ponds without a significant nexus to navigable water.the court explained that,i t was the significant nexus between wetlands and navigable waters that informed our reading of the act in riverside bayview homes.id.at.
the supreme court in swancc,therefore,invalidated the migratory bird rule but did not purport to reconsider its prior holding regarding adjacent wetlands in riverside bayview homes.in baccarat fremont developers,llc army corps of engineers,cir,we expressly recognized that swancc invalidated the acoe migratory bird rule,but did not overrule riverside bayview homes.our conclusion in baccarat is consistent with other circuits that have also held that swancc did not overrule riverside bayview homes.see united states hubenka,cir united states johnson,cir.
in the last term the supreme court also discussed the intersection between riverside bayview homes and swancc.rapanos,d.the rapanos decision involved two consolidated cases,united states rapanos,cir rapanos i,and carabell army corps of engineers,cir.
the first consolidated case,rapanos i,involved three land parcels near midland,michigan.the first parcel,known as the salzburg site,consisted of roughly acres.the salzburg site included acres of wetlands.the district court found,on the basis of expert testimony,that water from the site spilled into the hoppler drain,which carried water into the hoppler creek and ultimately into the kawkawlin river,which is navigable.the second parcel,known as the hines road site,consisted of acres,which included acres of wetlands.these wetlands had a connection to the rose drain,which carried water into the tittabawassee river,a navigable waterway.the final parcel,called the pine river site,consisted of some acres.this site included acres of wetlands,and a surface water connection linked the wetlands to the nearby pine river,which flowed into lake huron.the wetlands at issue in all three parcels were neither directly adjacent to nor entirely isolated from a navigable water of the united states.
the united states brought an action against the rapanos petitioners for civil violations of the cwa.specifically,the government claimed that petitioners discharged fill into protected wetlands,failed to respond to requests for information,and ignored administrative compliance orders.after a bench trial,the district court made factual findings upholding the corps jurisdiction over wetlands on the three parcels.on the merits the court ruled in the government favor,finding that violations occurred at all three sites.the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit affirmed.the other consolidated case,carabell,similarly involved discharges into wetlands that connected through a series of waterways to a navigable water of the united states,and the sixth circuit similarly held that the wetlands were covered by the act.cir.
in rapanos,a plurality opinion,the supreme court addressed how the term navigable waters should be construed under the act.the plurality,written by justice scalia for four justices,would have reversed on the grounds that only those wetlands with a continuous surface connection to bodies that are waters of the united states are protected under the cwa.justice stevens,writing the dissent for four justices,would have affirmed on the grounds that even wetlands not directly adjacent to navigable waters,but adjacent to tributaries of navigable waters,are protected under the cwa.justice stevens also argued that riverside bayview homes is still the controlling precedent and does not require a significant nexus test.
justice kennedy,constituting the fifth vote for reversal,concurred only in the judgment.his concurrence is the narrowest ground to which a majority of the justices would assent if forced to choose in almost all cases.see united states gerke,cir see also rapanos.at stevens dissenting.thus,as the seventh circuit extensively explained in gerke,at,justice kennedy concurrence provides the controlling rule of law for our case.see also marks united states,d.
justice kennedy said that when wetlands are isolated,or adjacent only to a tributary of a navigable waterway,those wetlands are regulable under the cwa only if there is a significant nexus between the wetlands at issue and the navigable waterway.rapanos.at.he explained that a significant nexus exists if the wetlands,either alone or in combination with similarly situated lands in the region,significantly affect the chemical,physical,a
