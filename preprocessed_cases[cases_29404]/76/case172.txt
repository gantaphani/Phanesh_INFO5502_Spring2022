defendants appellees petition for rehearing en banc is denied.see fed.
paul watson petition for rehearing en banc of our april,order denying him leave to file a late supplemental petition for rehearing en banc is also denied.see id.we are unpersuaded by watson belated claim that he and sea shepherd developed divergent interests.watson had months to consider whether his interests diverge from sea shepherd,yet claims to have discovered only recently that they do.he does not explain how or why.his bald assurance that serious grounds exist is too little,too late.
no further petitions for panel rehearing or rehearing en banc may be filed.
you do need a peg leg or an eye patch.when you ram ships hurl glass containers of acid drag ropes in the water to damage propellers and rudders launch smoke bombs and flares with hooks and point lasers at other ships,you are,without a doubt,a pirate,no matter how you believe your purpose to be.
plaintiffs appellants collectively,cetacean are japanese researchers who hunt whales in the southern ocean.the united states,japan and many other nations are signatories to the international convention for the regulation of whaling art.viii,stat,which authorizes whale hunting when conducted in compliance with a research permit issued by a signatory.cetacean has such a permit from japan.nonetheless,it has been hounded on the high seas for years by a group calling itself sea shepherd conservation society and its eccentric founder,paul watson collectively sea shepherd.sea shepherd tactics include all of those listed in the previous paragraph.
cetacean sued under the alien tort statute,for injunctive and declaratory relief.the statute provides a cause of action for a tort committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the united states.cetacean argues that sea shepherd acts amount to piracy and violate international agreements regulating conduct on the high seas.the district court denied cetacean request for a preliminary injunction and dismissed its piracy claims.we have jurisdiction over the order denying the injunction pursuant to a.we also have jurisdiction to review the dismissal of the piracy claims because the district court reasoning for dismissing them is inextricably intertwined with its reasons for denying the preliminary injunction.smith arthur andersen llp,f d,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
dismissal of the piracy claims 
we review the district court dismissal of cetacean piracy claims de novo.manzarek paul fire marine ins,cir.t he definition of piracy under the law of nations is spelled out in the unclos,as well as the high seas convention,which provide almost identical definitions.united states dire,cir see united nations convention on the law of the sea unclos,convention on the high seas.the unclos defines piracy as illegal acts of violence or detention,or any act of depredation,committed for private ends by the crew or the passengers of a private ship and directed on the high seas,against another ship or against persons or property on board such ship.unclos emphasis added see also convention on the high seas.
the district court analysis turns on an erroneous interpretation of private ends and violence.the district court construed private ends as limited to those pursued for financial enrichment.but the common understanding of private is far broader.the term is normally used as an antonym to public,private attorney general and often refers to matters of a personal nature that are not necessarily connected to finance,private property,private entrance,private understanding and invasion of privacy.see webster new int l dictionary.ed defining private to mean b elonging to,or concerning,an individual person,company,or interest.
we give words their ordinary meaning unless the context requires otherwise.see leocal ashcroft,antonin scalia bryan garner,reading law the interpretation of legal texts.the context here is provided by the rich history of piracy law,which defines acts taken for private ends as those not taken on behalf of a state.see douglas guilfoyle,piracy off somalia un security council resolution and imo regional counter piracy efforts,int l comp,discussing the high seas convention michael bahar,attaining optimal deterrence at sea a legal and strategic theory for naval anti piracy operations,vand.transnat l,see also harmony united states,how,the law looks to piracy as an act of hostility being committed by a vessel not commissioned and engaged in lawful warfare.belgian courts,perhaps the only ones to have previously considered the issue,have held that environmental activism qualifies as a private end.see cour de cassation cass.court of cassation castle john nv mabeco,belg.this interpretation is entitled to considerable weight.abbott abbott,internal quotation marks omitted.we conclude that private ends include those pursued on personal,moral or philosophical grounds,such as sea shepherd professed environmental goals.that the perpetrators believe themselves to be serving the public good does not render their ends public.
the district court interpretation of violence was equally.citing no precedent,it held that sea shepherd conduct is not violent because it targets ships and equipment rather than people.this runs afoul of the unclos itself,which prohibits violence against another ship and violence against persons or property.unclos.reading violence as extending to malicious acts against inanimate objects also comports with the commonsense understanding of the term,see webster new int l dictionary,as when a man violently pounds a table with his fist.ramming ships,fouling propellers and hurling fiery and projectiles easily qualify as violent activities,even if they could somehow be directed only at inanimate objects.
regardless,sea shepherd acts fit even the district court constricted definition.the projectiles directly endanger cetacean crew,as the district court itself recognized.and damaging cetacean ships could cause them to sink or become stranded in,antarctic waters,jeopardizing the safety of the crew.
the activities that cetacean alleges sea shepherd has engaged in are clear instances of violent acts for private ends,the very embodiment of piracy.the district court erred in dismissing cetacean piracy claims.
ii.preliminary injunction 
a plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits,that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,that the balance of equities tips in his favor,and that an injunction is in the public interest.winter natural res.def.council.we review the district court denial of the preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.harris bd.of supervisors,cir.a district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.cooter gell hartmarx.
likelihood of success 
cetacean sought its injunction pursuant to three international agreements the convention for the suppression of unlawful acts against the safety of maritime navigation sua convention,treaty doc,the unclos and the convention on the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs.
the sua convention 
the sua convention prohibits acts that endanger,or attempt to endanger,the safe navigation of a ship.sua convention.cetacean presented uncontradicted evidence that sea shepherd tactics could seriously impair its ability to navigate.the district court nonetheless concluded that,since sea shepherd has not yet disabled any of cetacean ships,it unlikely it would succeed in the future.this was clear error.the district court overlooked the actual language of the convention,which prohibits endager ing safe navigation.id.this requires only that sea shepherd create dangerous conditions,regardless of whether the harmful consequences ever come about.see webster new int l dictionary.as to whether sea shepherd tactics actually are dangerous,the record discloses that it has rammed and sunk several other whaling vessels in the past.
