in this case arising from a texas natural resource conservation commission enforcement action,we must decide whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support the trial court determination that a utility company knowingly violated the water code by charging its customers unauthorized fees,and whether the water code authorizes the attorney general,at the commission request,to seek customer refunds in district court to compel compliance with the water code statutory provisions.answering both questions in the affirmative,we affirm in part and reverse in part the court of appeals judgment.
lakeshore utility company,is a water and sewer public utility providing service to customers in two residential subdivisions,point la vista and esquire estates ii,adjacent to cedar creek lake in henderson county,texas.because lakeshore customers reside on property just above the lake,a typical gravity or sewer system can not be used in the subdivisions.instead,a more complex and expensive system is used.
as a public utility,lakeshore is subject to the jurisdiction of the commission,which is charged with exercising regulatory authority over public utilities and fixing and regulating utility rates.see.water code a providing that the commission may regulate and supervise the business of every water and sewer utility,b authorizing the commission to fix and regulate utility rates,a mandating that utilities can not charge,demand,collect,or receive a rate for service that is not authorized.lakeshore monthly utility rates and tap fees charged to install water and sewer utility be listed on its approved tariff schedule,or schedule of rates,that is filed with the commission.id.
in,the commission accepted a tariff application from lakeshore and approved monthly rates for both subdivisions as well as tap fees at a flat rate of for water tap and meter installation and for sewer tap installation at locations requiring pump ing or excessive lift ing.
between and,lakeshore submitted numerous tariff applications to the commission requesting various changes to the commission approved rates and tap fees.relevant to this case are the tariff applications lakeshore made in and to increase the amounts approved by the commission in its original tariff.these applications requested that the commission approve monthly rate and increases at each subdivision.in each instance,while awaiting the commission decision,lakeshore charged its customers the increased amounts that it was requesting the commission approve.in response to each application,the commission signed an order dismissing lakeshore request and directing lakeshore to refund the increased fees collected from its customers while the application was pending.because of the importance of the and tariff the resulting commission orders that required lakeshore to refund its detail the events surrounding each application below.
a.the tariff application and resulting orders 
in,lakeshore sought the commission authorization to increase its monthly utility rates and to increase its tap fees to for water and for sewer services.lakeshore request noted parenthetically that the new sewer rate would include pump s,tanks,valves,fittings,controls.lakeshore charged its customers the increased amounts pending the commission decision.in january,the commission issued an order denying the requested rate and fee increase and directing lakeshore to charge tap fees no higher than actual cost,not to exceed for water and actual cost,not to exceed for sewer installation services.accordingly,lakeshore was not to charge amounts exceeding those formerly approved on its tariff.the commission also ordered lakeshore to refund to its customers all monies collected in excess of the rates set forth in its tariff,and to provide the commission with the name of each customer refunded and the amount within the next two months.lakeshore was told its failure to comply would result in referral to the attorney general office for prosecution.as will be seen,however,lakeshore continued to charge customers the disapproved amounts.
just two months after the commission january order denying lakeshore requested increase,lakeshore was involved in a dispute concerning the commission certification of another public utility called the paul industrial training school.as part of the certification process,the commission undertook an examination and inquiry into lakeshore tap fee charges and issued an order in march called the paul order.in the paul examiner report,which was adopted by the commission in its order,the examiner found that lakeshore had been charging its customers sewer tap fees of when the commission had refused to approve this amount.the examiner noted that lakeshore overcharges constituted a violation of the statutory provision providing that n o public utility may,directly or indirectly by any device whatsoever or in any manner sic charge,demand,collect,or receive from any person any amount other than that prescribed in the schedule of rates of the public utility.see.water code a.the examiner concluded that the commission should monitor lakeshore tap fee charges and request the attorney general to bring an action in district court,in the commission behalf to require lakeshore compliance with the provision if the commission monitoring revealed that rates other than tariffed rates were charged.it is unclear,though,whether the commission took any further action to ensure lakeshore compliance with either the commission january order or the paul order.
b.the rate application and resulting order 
in january,lakeshore filed another request for authorization from the commission to increase its monthly rates and to increase tap fees for both residential subdivisions to for water and for sewer services.while the request was pending,lakeshore again charged its customers the proposed fees.on december,the commission denied lakeshore application and ordered lakeshore to refund approximately in overcharges collected during the pendency of lakeshore request by crediting customers future bills.the refund was ordered pursuant to texas water code section,which provides a utility shall refund or credit against future bills all sums collected during the pendency of a rate proceeding in excess of the rate finally ordered plus interest as determined by the regulatory authority.id.c.the commission additionally ordered lakeshore to provide an accounting to the commission of all tap fees that lakeshore customers paid from december,through december.because the commission denied lakeshore requested increase,lakeshore approved tap fee amounts remained the same as those approved in.
c.the lawsuit 
both lakeshore and the commission brought suit in district court concerning the order.believing the commission continued refusal to increase rates and tap fee amounts was unfair,lakeshore sought judicial review of the commission decision denying its application.the commission,concerned that lakeshore was refusing to comply with the order,sought to enforce the order under sections and of the water code.the commission specifically alleged that lakeshore was actively violating the order by failing to refund customers for overcharges and by continuing to charge fees in excess of those approved by the commission.the commission sought civil penalties for each day lakeshore has been in violation of the water code and the commission order since december,and to enjoin lakeshore from future violations.the court consolidated the cases and,in a single judgment,found in favor of lakeshore,reversed the commission order,and dismissed the commission enforcement action.
first appeal and remand 
the court of appeals reversed the district court judgment and reinstated the commission order,which required lakeshore to charge no more then for sewer and for water installation services,and to refund its customers approximately in overcharges made during the pendency of lakeshore tariff application.the commission reinstated enforcement action was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.water comm lakeshore util,writ denied.
on remand,the commission amended its original pleadings in the district court to seek customer refunds for overcharges dating back to,when lakeshore began to charge its customers amounts the commission had not approved.the commission claims it amended the original pleadings because it had learned through discovery that lakeshore had been overcharging its customers for water and sewer services for that period of time.
after a bench trial,the district court found that between and lakeshore had knowingly violated the texas water code by overcharging its customers and assessed civil penalties in the amount of,which related to tap fee overcharges that occurred both before and after the commission proceedings.the court also ordered lakeshore to refund to its customers for equipment,tap fee,and monthly rate overcharges between and,and to pay its customers in interest on overcharged amounts,plus attorneys fees and court costs.
e.the second appeal 
lakeshore appealed only the parts of the trial court judgment that ordered it to pay civil penalties for knowing water code violations that occurred prior to the order,and refund unauthorized charges to customers beyond those lakeshore was obligated to refund by the order.the court of appeals affirmed the portion of the judgment,concluding there was legally sufficient evidence in the record to support the trial court finding that lakeshore knowingly violated the water code before the proceedings.but the court of appeals reversed that part of the judgment requiring lakeshore to refund customer overcharges that occurred before the proceedings,holding that,absent a commission order directing a utility to refund or credit unauthorized charges,the water code does not authorize a district court action to recover those charges.id.at.
both the commission and lakeshore petitioned this court to reverse portions of the court of appeals judgment.lakeshore contends the court of appeals erred in holding there was legally sufficient evidence that lakeshore knowingly violated the water code before.the commission argues the court of appeals erred in reversing the trial court refund order.we granted both petitions for review to consider the issues presented.
ii.water code violations 
we first consider whether there is legally sufficient evidence to support the trial court finding that lakeshore knowingly violated sections and of the texas water code before by charging customers fees higher than those the commission approved section provides that a utility may not charge,collect,or receive any rate for utility service other than as provided in this chapter.water code.section provides that a water and sewer utility may not directly or indirectly charge,demand,collect,or receive from any person a greater or lesser compensation for any service rendered or to be rendered by the utility than that prescribed in the schedule of rates of the utility applicable to that service when filed in the manner provided in this chapter.id.at the relevant time,section a of the water code provided that any utility or affiliated interest that knowingly violates chapter of the water code is subject to a civil penalty of up to a day.act of may,ch.laws,emphasis added 
the water code does not define knowingly,and we have never interpreted the term as it is used in section a however,unless the text of a statute dictates a different result,the term knowingly merely requires proof of knowledge of the facts,and not knowledge of the law.united states ho,cir quoting bryan united states,d see also osterberg peca,holding as a general proposition that ignorance of the law is not a defense to a statute violation the term knowingly in the election code refers only to a person knowledge of the act of making or accepting a contribution,and not to whether the contribution violated the election code.our penal code recognizes this principle in providing that a person acts knowingly,or with knowledge,with respect to the nature of his conduct or to circumstances surrounding his conduct when he is aware of the nature of his conduct or that the circumstances exist.b.federal courts construing knowledge requirements in environmental regulatory provide for criminal sanctions very similar to the water code civil penalty concluded that the proof necessary to establish a knowing violation of a regulation is merely proof that the violator had knowledge of the facts comprising the violation,ho,at citations omitted.we see no reason to depart from this principle when interpreting the proof required to show a knowing violation under section a of the water code.if we held otherwise,enforcement of the water code would be problematic because the focus would be on whether the person violating the code knew about the specific code provisions and was operating under a correct legal interpretation.see osterberg,at.thus,to prove a knowing water code violation,the commission needed to establish only that lakeshore knew the facts that comprised a violation of the water code,that lakeshore knew it was charging fees that were not approved on lakeshore tariff schedule by the commission.
lakeshore admits it routinely charged customers amounts that exceeded the tap fees filed with and approved by the commission.but relying on general electric united states environmental protection agency,lakeshore contends it did not knowingly violate the water code in charging these amounts because it was not given fair notice that the tanks,pumps,and equipment necessary to effectively transfer wastewater from each home within its system were included within its designated tap fee,nor did it know that the water code prohibited charging separately for these items.specifically,lakeshore claims it lacked fair notice because prior to,the commission rules failed to define the term tap fee and lakeshore could not knowingly violate commission rules that did not exist during the relevant time period.lakeshore further argues that the definition of tap fee,once adopted,was unclear because it provided that a utility company could charge customers for extraordinary expenses in addition to their approved tap fee amounts,but the definition failed to explicitly define what expenses qualified as extraordinary.as a result,lakeshore argues it mistakenly believed that the pumps and equipment necessary to operate its system qualified as extraordinary expenses therefore,lakeshore did not knowingly violate the water code in charging for these items in addition to its approved tap fee.
lakeshore makes a similar argument about an emergency regulation the commission adopted in that allowed utility companies to charge residential customers for unique and costs in addition to their approved tap fees under certain exceptional circumstances.reg.emerg.rule.admin.code adopted march,expired july,lakeshore claims that,because the regulation did not define the terms unique and,lakeshore reasonably believed that the costs associated with its system qualified as unique and and could therefore be charged to customers in addition to its approved tap fees.
we find lakeshore argument unpersuasive.lakeshore admits knowing that it was charging rates and fees that the commission had not approved,and as we have stated,its subjective interpretation of the water code provisions is immaterial.see ho,at.to prove a knowing violation of the water code,the commission needed to prove only that lakeshore knew that it was charging more than its approved tariff.we hold that the evidence is legally sufficient to support the trial court finding that lakeshore knew it was charging unapproved amounts.to begin,since the inception of lakeshore system in,every lakeshore customer within the system has been required to install the same or similar pumps and equipment.lakeshore approved tariff listed its tap and meter installation fee at for water and tap installation fee at a maximum of for sewer locations requiring pump or excessive lift.because lakeshore approved amounts were for tap installation and tap and meter installation and specifically included a maximum amount to be charged in areas requiring pump ing or excessive lift ing,lakeshore must have understood that the and amounts were meant to include all installation those for the specialized pum
