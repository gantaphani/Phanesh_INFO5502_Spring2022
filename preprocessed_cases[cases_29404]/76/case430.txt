this case comes to us on a petition for extraordinary relief after the trial court granted summary adjudication to defendants,manufacturers and suppliers of dry cleaning solvents and equipment.we are called on to decide whether the polanco redevelopment act health,et the polanco act allows a local agency to recover the costs of cleaning up hazardous substances from parties that did not directly discharge wastes,control the site of the discharge,or have authority to prevent the discharge of those substances.we grant the petition and direct the trial court to reconsider the motions for summary adjudication in light of the views expressed herein.
background 
the city of modesto redevelopment agency brought an action against numerous defendants,alleging causes of action for strict liability,negligence,negligence per se,continuing trespass,private and public nuisance,private and public nuisance per se,response costs and declaratory relief under the hazardous substance account act health,et,ultrahazardous activity,and cost recovery under the polanco act case.the city of modesto,along with the city of modesto sewer district,brought another action against a nearly identical group of defendants seeking damages for solvent contamination under many of the same legal theories this action did not include a polanco act cause of action case the defendants included chlorinated solvent manufacturers,distributors of solvents and dry cleaning equipment,chlorinated solvent equipment manufacturers,and dry cleaning retailers.before us on this petition are the trial court rulings on the polanco act and negligence per se causes of action.
the complaints alleged that two cleaning solvents,perchloroethylene perc or pce and trichloroethylene,cause risks to health and the environment,that dry cleaners customarily dumped solvent wastewater into the public sewer systems,and that dry cleaners experienced a habitual problem of chlorinated solvents leaking into the environment.according to the complaints,the defendants who manufactured and supplied solvents and equipment instructed dry cleaners that chlorinated solvents could be discharged into sewers,failed to issue recalls or warnings regarding the equipment and solvents.
the manufacturer and distributor defendants filed motions for summary adjudication of the polanco act and negligence per se causes of action the court granted summary adjudication on the polanco act cause of action to all but two of the moving defendants,concluding,among other things,that they neither discharged waste nor cause d or permit ted any waste to be discharged,subd.a.on the negligence per se causes of action,the trial court granted summary adjudication to all but one of the moving defendants,concluding they did not dispose of products or wastes and did not exercise authority or control over the disposal of such products or wastes by any modesto dry cleaner.pursuant to code of civil procedure section,the trial court expressed its belief that the motions involved a controlling question of law as to which there were substantial grounds for difference of opinion,and that appellate resolution of the issue of law might materially advance the conclusion of the litigation.
the city petitioned this court for a writ of mandate.on december,we issued an alternative writ of mandate,commanding the superior court to set aside its orders granting the motions for summary adjudication on the polanco act and negligence per se causes of action and enter a new order denying those motions,or show cause why it should not be compelled to do so.the superior court declined to set aside the orders in order to receive additional guidance from the court of appeal on the relevant issues,and ordered the real parties in interest to show cause why the trial court should not be compelled to set aside the orders granting summary adjudication 
ii.discussion 
a.the polanco act 
the polanco act,enacted in,authorizes redevelopment agencies to remediate contaminated properties within a project area.redevelopment agency of san diego san diego gas electric th,d.it provides in part that if a redevelopment agency undertakes action to remedy or remove,or to require others to remedy or remove,a release of hazardous substance,any responsible party or parties shall be liable to the redevelopment agency for the costs incurred in the action.health,subd.a see also redevelopment agency salvation army th,d salvation army.
the polanco act defines a r esponsible party as any person described in subdivision a of section of the health and safety code or subdivision a of section of the water code.health,subd.h.health and safety code section defines responsible parties as those described as covered persons in the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of cercla a the city does not contend that the prevailing defendants would be responsible under cercla.instead,the issue here is whether the prevailing defendants are responsible parties under subdivision a of water code section 
the water quality control act,et act provides in pertinent part any person who has caused or permitted,causes or permits,or threatens to cause or permit any waste to be discharged or deposited where it is,or probably will be,discharged into the waters of the state and creates,or threatens to create,a condition of pollution or nuisance,shall upon order of the regional board,clean up the waste or abate the effects of the waste,or,in the case of threatened pollution or nuisance,take other necessary remedial action,including,but not limited to,overseeing cleanup and abatement efforts,subd.a.the question before us is whether the trial court was correct in ruling that,as a matter of law,the prevailing defendants did not cause wastes to be discharged or deposited.
the trial court concluded the prevailing solvent manufacturers and equipment defendants were not responsible parties under water code section because the evidence showed they neither disposed of products or wastes nor exercised authority or control over the disposal of such products or wastes by any modesto dry cleaner,and that the prevailing distributor defendants neither disposed of pce waste in modesto nor instructed,directed,or recommended that any dry cleaner dispose of chlorinated solvents on the ground or in the sewer.in explaining its ruling at the hearing on the motion,the trial court stated that in order for a party to cause a discharge for purposes of water code section,y ou have to have some sort of physical control or the ability to stop it from happening.
the city argues the trial court erred in concluding that only those who directly participated in or exercised authority or control over activities or disposal activities could be considered responsible parties under water code section.according to the city,we should apply the traditional tort substantial factor test in determining who has caused a discharge for purposes of water code section.the prevailing defendants,not surprisingly,defend the trial court conclusion that a party must have the ability to control the discharge of waste to be liable under the polanco act.
rules of statutory construction require us to ascertain the intent of the enacting legislative body so that we may adopt the construction that best effectuates the purpose of the law.citation.we first examine the words themselves because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citation.the words of the statute should be given their ordinary and usual meaning and should be construed in their statutory context.citations.these canons generally preclude judicial construction that renders part of the statute meaningless or inoperative.citation.in addition,words should be given the same meaning throughout a code unless the legislature has indicated otherwise.citations.hassan mercy american river hospital cal th,d.where the words of a statute do not have a plain meaning,statutory construction is necessary.jacobs,malcolm burtt voss th,d.in interpreting a statute,c ourts generally give great weight and respect to an administrative agency interpretation of a statute governing its powers and responsibilities.ibid.courts may also look to the legislative history in discerning the intent of the legislature.see fireman fund ins.companies cal d.
thus,we first ask,does the plain language of water code section,subdivision a tell us who is a responsible party the statute imposes liability on anyone who causes or permits a discharge or deposit of wastes however,it does not indicate whether cause refers to a party who was directly involved with a discharge,to anyone whose actions were a substantial factor in causing the discharge,or even,as city argued below,to anyone who places a hazardous substance into the chain of commerce.
in considering this issue,we are guided by leslie salt san francisco bay conservation.com.d.leslie salt.there,division two of the first appellate district considered whether a landowner on whose land fill had been placed,without the landowner knowledge,could be required to remove the fill and be subjected to penalties under the act,et,as one who has undertaken,or is threatening to undertake unauthorized fill activity,subd.a.the court stated it needs to be emphasized at this point that the act is the sort of environmental legislation that represents the exercise by government of the traditional power to regulate public nuisances.ceeed california coastal zone conservation com.d.such legislation constitutes but a sensitizing of and refinement of nuisance law,at.where,as here,such legislation does not expressly purport to depart from or alter the common law,it will be construed in light of common law principles bearing upon the same subject.citations.leslie salt,at.noting that under the common law,a landowner liability for a public nuisance could result from the failure to act as well as from affirmative conduct,the court concluded that a landowner could be liable under the act even if it was not actively involved in the condition that caused harm,and even if it did not know of or intend to cause such harm.leslie salt,at.this liability could include both responsibility to obey a cease and desist order,and civil fines on a basis for violating the order.id.at.
the act similarly appears to be harmonious with the common law of nuisance.water code section,subdivision a authorizes cleanup or abatement orders against a person who has caused or permitted,causes or permits,or threatens to cause or permit any waste to be discharged or deposited where it is,or probably will be,discharged into the waters of the state and creates,or threatens to create,a condition of pollution or nuisance italics added.the act defines n uisance to mean anything which meets all of the following requirements is injurious to health,or is indecent or offensive to the senses,or an obstruction of the free use of property,so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property.affects at the same time an entire community or neighborhood,or any considerable number of persons,although the extent of the annoyance or damage inflicted upon individuals may be unequal.occurs during,or as a result of,the treatment or disposal of wastes,subd.m.the first two paragraphs of this definition track relevant portions of the language of civil code sections and,which define nuisance and public nuisance.the third paragraph establishes that the act regulates only nuisances that are connected with the treatment or disposal of wastes.thus,it appears that the legislature not only did not intend to depart from the law of nuisance,but also explicitly relied on it in the act.
having concluded that the statute must be construed in light of the common law principles bearing upon the same subject leslie salt,supra,d at.here the subject of public turn next to identify those principles.it has long been the law in california that n ot only is the party who maintains the nuisance liable but also the party or parties who create or assist in its creation are responsible for the ensuing damages.mangini d.thus,courts have upheld as against a demurrer a nuisance claim founded upon allegations that defendants disposed of hazardous substances on property during their lease,but at the time of the action did not have a possessory interest in the property id.at.and on allegations that defendant soils engineer prepared a plan for slope repair on a neighboring property which,when constructed,caused water,mud,and debris to flow onto the plaintiff property shurpin elmhirst d.similarly,a nonsuit on plaintiff cause of action for nuisance was reversed where the evidence showed defendant contractor dumped fill on a street,interfering with drainage and causing the plaintiff property to be flooded.portman clementina d.and the supreme court has held that a defendant who obstructs a private road can be liable for nuisance,irrespective of whether he claims any interest in the land over which the plaintiff claimed a right of way.hardin sin claire cal.in sum,liability for nuisance does not hinge on whether the defendant owns,possesses or controls the property,nor on whether he is in a position to abate the nuisance the critical question is whether the defendant created or assisted in the creation of the nuisance.newhall land farming superior court th,d.
while liability for nuisance is broad however,it is not unlimited.city of san diego established one important limitation.there,the city brought an action on various theories,including nuisance,against defendants who manufactured,distributed or supplied building materials,alleging asbestos had contaminated city buildings and seeking recovery for,among other things,money the city spent to identify and abate the asbestos danger.city of san diego,supra,th at,d.the court of appeal concluded the city could not maintain an action based on nuisance,stating,city cites no california decision that allows recovery for a defective product under a nuisance cause of action.indeed,under city theory,nuisance would become a monster that would devour in one gulp the entire law of tort tioga public school dist.gypsum cir.id.at,d.the court also noted that other jurisdictions considering the issue had not allowed plaintiffs to recover on a nuisance theory for defective building materials,citing tioga public school dist.gypsum,supra,at,detroit bd.of educ.celotex,town of hooksett school dist.grace,johnson county,gypsum,stating that allowing such a nuisance action would convert almost every products liability action into a nuisance claim.the court concluded this was a products liability action in the guise of a nuisance action city of san diego,supra,th at,d,and affirmed summary judgment in favor of the defendants id.at,d.
we agree with city of san diego that the law of nuisance is not intended to serve as a surrogate for ordinary products liability in light of that conclusion,the question we face here is whether the polanco act claims fall within the realm of nuisance or of products liability stated another way,has city presented evidence that the defendants assisted in the creation of a nuisance,or only that they produced or supplied defective products 
we look first to selma pressure treating osmose wood preserving d.selma,which applied the law of nuisance to a similar case.there,the state of california and the regional water quality control board collectively,the state sued the defendants,operators of a wood treatment facility,alleging they improperly disposed of hazardous waste and seeking,among other things,damages flowing from a nuisance.id.at.the defendants,seeking equitable indemnity from several.one was a company that designed the wood treatment technique,installed equipment,provided training and made recommendations on operating policies that resulted in chemicals being deposited into soil overlying an aquifer.other included chemical suppliers that provided assistance and advice and knew or should have known of the potential health threats posed by improper use or disposal of the chemicals,but failed to warn of those risks.id.at.
the court of appeal concluded the had pled,or could plead,facts showing the might be liable for the,that the installer of the equipment recommended creation of an unlined dirt pond for disposing of the waste products that it knew or should have known that such disposal could threaten the safety of the water supply that the did not know of the danger and that the installer failed to warn of that danger.the court reasoned that this kind of direct involvement in the design and installation of the disposal system,coupled with the installer knowledge and the user lack of knowledge of the dangers,could support a finding that the created or assisted in the creation of a nuisance.selma,supra,d at.
the involvement of the chemical companies was less direct,but the court concluded they,too,could be held liable.the alleged as direct purchasers of the chemicals,the owners were foreseeable users disposal of the chemical residue was a foreseeable use of the product the chemical companies knew or should have known of the dangers of improper disposal of the chemicals the owners did not know of those dangers the companies failed to warn of the dangers and that failure to warn was a substantial factor in causing the damage.selma,supra,d at.
we agree with the first stated conclusion in those who create or assist in creating a system that causes hazardous wastes to bedisposed of improperly,or who instruct users to dispose of wastes improperly,can be liable under the law of nuisance.here,for example,the city claims that,with knowledge of the hazards involved,some of the defendants instructed the dry cleaners to set up their equipment to discharge wastewater into the drains and sewers,and that others gave dry cleaners instructions to dispose of spilled perc on or in the ground.we conclude that these kinds of affirmative acts or instructions could support a finding that those defendants assisted in creating a nuisance,and therefore would defeat a summary adjudication motion on the polanco act cause of action.
defendants argue the circle of liability should be drawn more tightly,pointing out that the only parties the state water resources control board state board has held liable for penalties or cleanup costs were those that controlled either the discharge activity or the premises where the discharge occurred.see,in re exxon company,order no.wq,wl at pp.oil company and gasoline distributor not properly named where there was no reasonable evidence they owned gasoline tanks that leaked in re spitzer order no.wq,may,wl at pp.landowners who know of discharge on their property and have sufficient control of the property to correct it are subject to a cleanup order in re stuart order no.wq,wl at pp.lessee of property did not cause discharge under water code section,but he permitted it because he had legal power to stop the contamination.while in re exxon does suggest that a party who merely supplies a hazardous substance is not responsible under water code section,the authorities defendants rely on are of limited value in assessing the responsibility of a party that instructs users to dispose of hazardous wastes in an unsafe manner or a party that creates a system that would result in improper disposal of hazardous wastes.furthermore,the state board has concluded that even a relatively minor contribution to a discharge may support a finding of responsibility.for instance,in in re county of san diego order no.wq,wl at,the state board ruled that the regional water quality control board had properly treated a city as a discharger,solely because the city had an easement over and authority to control a street that overlay part of a landfill,and subsidence of landfill material beneath the roadway was contributing to runoff coming from the street to the landfill surface,which in turn was adversely affecting water quality beneath the site.
thus,we disagree with defendants contention that only those who are physically engaged in a discharge or have the ability to control waste disposal activities are liable under section.in harmony with selma,we think a reasonable fact finder might conclude that defendants who manufactured equipment designed to discharge waste in a manner that will create a nuisance,or who specifically instructed a user to dispose of wastes in such a manner,could be found to have caused or permitted a discharge.
with respect to selma second stated potential liability of defendants who fail to warn of the dangers of improper disposal of hazardous materials but give no guidance or instructions pertaining to that face a more difficult question.in this case the involvement of certain defendants was limited to manufacturing or selling solvents to dry cleaners,with knowledge of the hazards of those substances,without alerting the dry cleaners to proper methods of disposal.the city theory that these suppliers should be held liable is similar to that proffered by the plaintiff in city of san diego city claims the manufacturer of an allegedly defective product can be liable in nuisance because t he stream of commerce can carry pollutants every bit as effectively as a stream of water.city of san diego,supra,th at,d.as did the court in city of san diego,we reject this contention.
here,any failure to warn was not an activity directly connected with the disposal of solvents.in our view,such behavior is analogous to the manufacture,distribution,and supplying of materials in city of san diego it does not fall within the context of nuisance,but is better analyzed through the law of negligence or products liability,which have precedents to determine liability for failure to warn.see,carlin superior court cal th,d,anderson fiberglas cal d,artiglio general electric th,d.
thus,construing water code section,subdivision a in light of the common law principles bearing upon nuisance leslie salt,supra,d at,we conclude that those who took affirmative steps directed toward the improper discharge of solvent instance,by manufacturing a system designed to dispose of wastes improperly or by instructing users of its products to dispose of wastes be liable under that statute,but those who merely placed solvents in the stream of commerce without warning adequately of the dangers of improper disposal are not liable under that section of the act.
we have reviewed the legislative history of the relevant portions of the polanco act and the act,and see nothing inconsistent with this result.indeed,the legislative history of the causes or permits language in a different provision within the act,water code section,supports our conclusion that the legislature did not intend the act to impose liability on those with no ownership or control over the property or the discharge,and whose involvement in a discharge was remote and passive.the phrase causes or permits was added to the statute in,in an amendment providing civil penalties for those who,among other things,caused or permitted waste or oil to be discharged into the waters of the state.stats,ch,see stats,ch.the department of finance enrolled bill report stated,effects of this bill would be waste dischargers would be more careful in their operations and some funds would be provided for cleanup of anonymous oil spills.cal.of finance,enrolled bill on bill reg.sess.
water code section was again amended in,to authorize imposition of civil liabilities on a ny person who,without regard to intent or negligence,causes or permits a discharge of hazardous substances into the waters of the state.stats,ch.the statute also provided there would be no liability if the discharge were caused by events beyond the discharger control,including any circumstance or event which causes the discharge despite the exercise of every reasonable precaution to prevent or mitigate the discharge.id.at.an enrolled bill report on this revision stated this bill would provide a higher standard of liability for anyone who discharges a reportable quantity of a hazardous substance in or on the state waters where it creates a condition of pollution or nuisance the imposition of this higher standard of care will provide a greater incentive for hazardous waste handlers to avoid spills.cal.environmental quality agency,enrolled bill on assem.bill reg.sess.thus,it appears section was intended to encourage hazardous waste handlers to be careful in their operations and to avoid spills.persons who had no activ
