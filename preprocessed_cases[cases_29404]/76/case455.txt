in this case we decide whether a state water authority properly relied on its existing easement as authority to construct a second water intake and pipeline to draw water from a lake to meet growing consumption demands.we hold that the easement did not grant rights for that construction.we next decide whether the water authority can condemn an easement for construction and operation of the second intake and pipeline.we hold that the prospective easement,which restricts access to only a small portion of the lake,does not practically destroy the lake public recreational use.we therefore affirm the court of appeals judgment in part,and reverse and remand in part.
river authority and canyon regional water authority are both agencies and political subdivisions of the state of texas.the river authority owns lake dunlap and uses it for generating hydroelectric power,flood control,public recreation,and providing water to the water authority.under their contractual arrangement,the river authority granted an easement to the water authority,under which the water authority draws water through an intake and pipeline structure from the lake to its nearby pumping station.the water authority then sells that water to water districts and municipalities in guadalupe,comal,and bexar counties.
to satisfy increased consumption and increasingly strict aquifer restrictions,the water authority developed plans to expand its lake dunlap water treatment plant capacity from six million gallons per day to sixteen million gallons per day.the original water intake and pipeline could not accommodate the increased volume,so the water authority proposed to add a second intake upriver from the existing intake and the lake dam.initially,the river authority approved the proposal.but it changed its mind one month after construction began and sued the water authority,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and arguing that the water authority construction was outside of the scope of the easement.the water authority responded that the easement allowed the new intake location,and alternatively counterclaimed for condemnation of the property required to complete the project.
the river authority obtained a temporary restraining order halting construction,which the trial court subsequently dissolved upon being persuaded that the river authority had an adequate remedy at law and thus did not need injunctive relief the river authority then moved for partial summary judgment on two grounds the easement agreement does not authorize the water authority expansion,and the water authority can not condemn the property right to draw water that it seeks.the water authority moved for partial summary judgment on the ground that it has the right to condemn whatever new is necessary to construct the second intake.the trial court concluded that the water authority easement allows the water authority to construct the second intake and gives it limited power to identify and describe any needed.the trial court further held that the water authority has the right of eminent domain to take what it needs for the second intake,but that the river authority can seek compensation for any taking.the river authority appealed,and the court of appeals reversed the trial court,holding that the easement allows for only one intake,antonio.the court of appeals further held that the water authority presented no evidence showing that the water authority purpose could not be otherwise accomplished,id.at,and thus granted summary judgment for the river authority on the condemnation claim and remanded the case to the trial court to determine attorney fees,id.at.
the water authority appealed,arguing that its easement over lake dunlap surface is sufficient to allow construction of the second intake and pipeline.alternatively,the water authority argues that it may properly condemn any additional property under its general eminent domain powers.see act of may,ch.laws.we hold that the easement does not give the water authority sufficient rights to construct the new intake pipeline,but that the water authority may obtain the necessary rights by condemnation.
when both parties move for summary judgment and the trial court grants one motion and denies the other,the reviewing court should review the summary judgment evidence presented by both sides and determine all questions presented and render the judgment the trial court should have rendered.workers comp.comm patient advocates of.
the water authority argues that the plain language of its easement agreement allows it to build the second water intake and pipeline.the express terms of the easement determine the scope of the easement holder rights.dewitt county,parks.the rules of contract construction and interpretation apply to easement agreements.id.at.
here the river authority granted to the water authority an easement and over and across all that certain tract or parcel of land described in exhibit exhibit a describes two parcels,the second of which is labeled an easement for the construction and use of a river water diversion point and a restricted zone easement on the surface of lake dunlap.it contains a description that corresponds with the location of the first water intake and pipeline,and a restricted zone easement on the surface of lake dunlap marked by a radius from the inlet location.the description further provides that parcel is for the purpose of allowing the construction,operation,and maintenance of the intake diversion piping and to restrict further use of the area within the radius on the surface of lake dunlap in accordance with the requirements of the texas health department regulations.as the court of appeals noted,the grant of the easement serves two purposes to allow for the intake pipeline and to allow for its required restricted zone radius.at.the easement agreement can not be read to grant the water authority any interest beyond those two express purposes.see marcus cable,krohn,holding that the scope of the conveyed interest is determined by the express terms of the grant and that if a particular purpose is not provided for in the grant,a use pursuing that purpose is not allowed.we thus affirm the court of appeals decision that the easement does not itself convey to the water authority sufficient rights to construct the new water intake.
the texas legislature granted the water authority eminent domain power for various purposes,act of may,ch.laws,including the authority to obtain rights it needs to build,operate,and maintain facilities for the treatment and transportation of water,id.laws at.the river authority does not dispute the water authority power to condemn property for public use,but the river authority argues that the water authority can not condemn an easement to expand its lake dunlap water intake facilities because doing so would practically destroy the existing public use of the lake.
