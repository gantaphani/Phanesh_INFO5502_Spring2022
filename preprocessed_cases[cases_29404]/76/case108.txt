factual history 
the water district is a rural water district that was created by a judicial order upon a petition filed in the athens county court of common pleas in,pursuant to ohio ann.joint appendix at.as a water district,is an independent political subdivision of the state of ohio,governed by ohio ann.territory was described in the petition approved by that court.
as a rural water district,assumed the debt that its predecessor owed to the united states department of agriculture usda.as a result,has been indebted to the usda since its inception.subsequently incurred another debt to the usda when it sold revenue bonds to the rural economic and community development service recds,which was formerly known as the farmers home administration fmha.bonds were issued on february,in the principal amount of at interest,that will expire on february.at.the loans were not made in order to help finance the university estates project and apparently have no connection in any way to the university estates transaction.
university estates owns acres of property,all of which is outside the boundaries of both and athens.university estates plans to develop this property into a golf course and approximately homes.the property is close to the boundaries of both and athens it borders athens on athens northern side,and is,at its closest point,feet roughly one third of a mile from boundary.at aff.of steven mullaney.has taken no formal steps to change its boundaries to include university estates property,such as by filing a petition in state court under ohio ann.in contrast,athens has begun the process of changing its boundaries to include university estates.on october,athens city council authorized a development agreement with university estates,pursuant to which athens would annex university estates and provide it with water.at ordinance and development agreement.
standing in athens way,however,is this also wishes to supply university estates with water and claims that b vests with the right to serve university estates.although does not currently supply university estates with water the property as of yet has no access to water from any supplier and does not currently have lines extending into university estates territory,claims that it could supply university estates with water almost immediately.refers to an water main that it owns,which is immediately adjacent to the university estates site.supplemented by two nearby storage tanks,the transmission line,claims,can provide water to university estates at a rate far exceeding the estimates of university estates expected usage.a valve,a tap in,and a pumping station will be necessary to connect the main to university estates.however,there was unrebutted testimony that the valve is an apparently minor and inexpensive addition and the and the pumping station as part of the water apparatus internal to the site are to be provided by the developer of the property,not the water supplier.at dep.test.of john collins.
procedural history 
on november,filed this lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio,alleging that the proposed water supply arrangement between athens and university estates would violate b.upon for summary judgment and an hearing,the district court granted summary judgment to and issued a declaratory judgment that the provision of water from athens to university estates would violate b.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
standards of review 
this court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.bukowski city of akron,cir.although the district court denial of a motion for summary judgment is usually treated as a nonappealable interlocutory order,when an appeal from a denial of summary judgment is presented in tandem with a grant of summary judgment,this court has jurisdiction to review the propriety of the district court denial of summary judgment.hamad woodcrest condo.ass n,cir quotation omitted.the district court denial of summary judgment based on purely legal grounds is reviewed de novo.id.at.summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
background to b 
over forty years ago,congress passed the agricultural act of,stat,which sought to preserve and protect rural farm life in a number of respects.title iii of the act which is known as the consolidated farm and rural development act was concerned largely with issues of agricultural credit.title iii contained two sections that are at issue here,sections a and b.section a of the act,now codified at a,made federal loans available to water service associations.section b,now codified at b,protected the recipients of such loans from competition,to a certain extent.the text of section b reads 
the service provided or made available through any such association shall not be curtailed or limited by inclusion of the area served by such association within the boundaries of any municipal corporation or other public body,or by the granting of any private franchise for similar service within such area during the term of such loan nor shall the happening of any such event be the basis of requiring such association to secure any franchise,license,or permit as a condition to continuing to serve the area served by the association at the time of the occurrence of such event.
b.this provision prevents local governments from expanding into a rural water association area and stealing its customers the legislative history states that the statutory provision was intended to protect the territory served by such an association facility against other competitive facilities such as local governments,as otherwise rural water service might be threatened by the expansion of the boundaries of municipal and other public bodies into an area served by the rural system,at,reprinted in.
the concept of economies of scale is an integral part of b rationale by protecting a rural water association customer base,the provision allows such associations to spread their fixed costs over a large group of users.in so doing,the statute aims to prevent rural water costs from becoming prohibitively expensive to any particular user,to develop a system providing fresh and clean water to rural households,and to protect the federal government as insurer of the loan.id.by including service to other rural residents,the cost per user is reduced and the loans are more secure in addition to the community benefits of a safe and adequate supply of running household water.see also.elkhorn water dist.city of wilmore,cir stating that the act safeguard s the financial viability of rural associations and farmers home administration loans and encourage s rural water development by expanding the number of potential users.we have stated that this provision should be given a liberal interpretation that protects rural water associations indebted to the fmha from municipal encroachment.elkhorn,at citation omitted.
in order to state a claim under b,a plaintiff must establish that it is an association within the meaning of the act it has a qualifying outstanding fmha loan obligation and it has provided or made service available in the disputed area.adams county reg l water dist.vill.of manchester,cir.the first two elements are not in dispute here the parties agree that is an association within the meaning of the act and that has a qualifying outstanding fmha loan obligation.the only element in controversy here is whether satisfies the third element of the test.
c.the has provided or made service available requirement 
the key question is whether satisfies the requirement that the association has provided or made service available in the disputed area.id.at.unfortunately,the statute and the legislative history provide no help in explaining this phrase,which is derived from the statute itself.see scott hounsel,note water associations and federal protection under b a proposal to repeal monopoly status,noting that the statute does not define provided or made available.without any guidance from congress or the supreme court,federal appellate courts have interpreted this language in a variety of ways.different circuits use different factors to determine whether a water association can invoke the protections of,including whether the water association has the physical ability to serve the area in question,and whether it has a legal duty or legal right to do so.
to determine whether service was made available,many courts begin with a pipes in the ground or physical ability approach that examines whether the water association has the physical means presently to serve the area.this inquiry asks whether the association can demonstrate that it has adequate facilities within or adjacent to the area to provide service to the area within a reasonable time after a request for service is made.sequoyah county rural water dist.town of muldrow,cir citation omitted.the tenth circuit has adopted this approach but has also required that the water association have the right under state law to serve the area in question.id.at.the eighth circuit applies this same test,requiring that a water association show both that it has the physical means to serve the area and that it has a legal right to do so.rural water system city of sioux center,cir,cert.denied,d.
neither of those circuits requires that a water association have a legal duty to serve in order to receive protection under.that is,however,the approach of the fourth circuit,which apparently requires both a duty to serve and a physical ability to serve.bell arthur water greenville utils.comm n,cir the fifth circuit has adopted a far looser approach,apparently holding that service is made available through either a duty to serve or a physical ability to serve.alamo water supply city of san juan,cir,cert.denied,d.
as the above analysis makes clear,the circuits are in conflict as to what they require.in.elkhorn,we adopted the same approach that the eighth and tenth circuits have taken.the first requirement under.elkhorn is the pipes in the ground requirement.in.elkhorn,we plainly stated that i f an association does not already have service in existence,water lines must either be within or adjacent to the property claimed to be protected by section b prior to the time an allegedly encroaching association begins providing service in order to be eligible for section b protection.elkhorn,at emphasis added.the second requirement of.elkhorn is that the water district must have the legal right under state law to serve the area in question.id.at noting that lexington south elkhorn admits that it has not obtained from the kentucky public service commission the right to construct facilities or to serve customers within portions of the disputed areas,which distinguish es this case from other cases in which courts have upheld water districts rights to section b protection.because neither of these requirements was met,we dismissed the water district claim under b.id.at stating that because the plaintiff has not established its authorization to serve the disputed properties or its ability to provide the service,it can not be said to have made service available.
in this case,has clearly satisfied both of these requirements.first,under state law,has a legal right to serve the area.as even athens seems to acknowledge,ohio law permits water districts t o supply water to users within and without the district.ohio ann.a emphasis added.under the plain text of this statute,which athens has not even attempted to distinguish,has the right to provide service outside its boundaries.second,has the physical ability to serve university estates within the meaning of our pipes in the ground test.it is undisputed that has water lines within or adjacent to the relevant property that could meet university estates needs.currently has an line immediately adjacent to university estates,and also has water storage tanks that augment the system.athens only argument is that some additional work would have to be done before could supply university estates with water.athens points out that own expert testified that would need a valve,some,and a pumping station in order to supply university estates with water.the valve is apparently a minimal addition that costs roughly,and the and pumping station would be provided by university estates,regardless of whether athens or supplied the water.to argue,as athens does,that water service must be available immediately evidently in the sense that someone at university estates must be able to go over to the faucet and turn on the water,would be to ignore our statement in.elkhorn that the made available requirement is satisfied not only when the pipes are within,but also when they are merely adjacent to the property.the evidence here admits of only one conclusion,that has adequate facilities within or adjacent to the area to provide service to the area within a reasonable time after a request for service is made.sequoyah county,at quotation omitted bell arthur,at holding that service was not made available when the water district only had a pipeline running near the disputed area and a pipeline was necessary to serve the area glenpool util.servs.auth.creek cty.rural water,cir holding that service was made available when the water district had a water line that ran within fifty feet of the property,cert.denied,d.
offensive and defensive uses of section 
having established the physical ability to serve university estates and a legal right to do so under state law,argues that it is therefore entitled to summary judgment.we,however,believe that can not properly invoke the protections of b.central to our conclusion is the fact that is not seeking to use the statute to protect its users or territory from municipal incursion in this case.it instead is seeking to use the statute to foist an incursion of its own on users outside of its boundary that it has never served or made agreements to serve.to grant what is essentially monopoly status over property that it has never served or contracted to serve,and that is outside of its boundary,we believe,would be wholly inconsistent with the statute text and legislative history,as well as our case law.ultimately,we agree with athens that b can be used only as a shield to defend against invasion rather than as a sword to wage one.
this case presents unique facts.has brought this lawsuit under b,claiming that athens has improperly curtailed or limited activities by contracting to provide university estates with water.athens,however,is not attempting to serve users within boundary.nor is athens attempting to steal customers that may be outside of boundary.instead,athens is merely seeking to persuade unserved users to sign up with athens rather than for water service.believing athens action to be outside of the statute intended prohibition,we hold today that a claim under b has not been established under these circumstances.when a rural water district boundaries are geographically determined by the state,we hold that a rural water district can not use b as a sword to force new customers who are outside that geographic area to receive water service through the rural water distri
