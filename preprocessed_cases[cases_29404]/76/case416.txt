plaintiff pajaro valley water management agency the agency brought this action to recover certain charges alleged to be owed by defendant william mcgrath.mcgrath defended the action on the ground,among others,that the enactment under which the agency assessed the charges was unconstitutional.the agency brought a motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication,contending among other things that mcgrath constitutional challenge was barred by a prior judgment in which the issue of the validity of the charges had been determined adversely to him.mcgrath replied that because the action was commenced in municipal court,which lacked jurisdiction over any action involving the legality of a tax or similar charge,the judgment was beyond the rendering court power and thus void.the trial court rejected this argument and granted summary judgment.we will affirm the court order insofar as it summarily adjudicated mcgrath defenses concerning the validity of the charge assuming the municipal the court lacked jurisdiction of those issues when they first arose,the municipal court merged into the superior court prior to trial.accordingly there was no lack of fundamental jurisdiction to render the judgment.however,we will reverse the summary judgment in light of the agency failure to establish the amount owed as a matter beyond substantial controversy.
background 
mcgrath owns property in watsonville on which he operates a groundwater extraction facility,a well.in july,the agency began imposing groundwater augmentation charges against the extraction of water from this well.the agency contends,and mcgrath does not dispute,that none of these charges have ever been paid.
on february,the agency filed a complaint in the municipal court of santa cruz county,alleging that mcgrath owed plus interest.on june,mcgrath filed an answer generally denying the allegations of the complaint and affirmatively alleging that the charges sought had been levied contrary to law,in that they are being collected for purposes other than those specifically authorized by statute.mcgrath appeared at all times in propria persona,though he had the assistance of an attorney in preparing some of his written filings.
effective july,the santa cruz county municipal court was unified with the santa cruz county superior court pursuant to proposition.const.amend.cal.trial courts eff.date of unification as of,as of.on that date the action automatically became a limited case pending before the superior court.see cal.
about a year later the matter came on for trial.the agency moved in limine to exclude evidence going to the validity of the charges,contending among other things that these challenges were precluded by mcgrath failure to pursue administrative remedies.in opposition,mcgrath characterized the validity of the groundwater augmentation fee as a crucial issue and a key question.this case is not a mere collection issue,he wrote.this case addresses the validity of the assessment and authority of the agency to impose the augmentation fees on mcgrath.in a trial brief he elaborated on his argument that the agency,in its quest to raise money,has ignored the express limitations of the act.the brief appeared to substantially recapitulate an opinion memorandum addressed to the california farm bureau federation,apparently authored by staff counsel for that organization,including the suggestion that the charge might violate proposition,the right to vote on taxes act.
on august,the court in that action entered judgment for the agency in the amount of plus costs.the judgment recited that the court had heard the testimony and considered the evidence.so far as the record shows,the judgment was not appealed.
the agency brought this action on april.it alleged that defendant continued to be delinquent,and prayed for damages in the amount of at least not including the judgment.in his answer mcgrath admitted that the agency had sent him billings,that the notices referred to in the complaint were sent to him,and that the correspondence and proceedings described in certain allegations occurred.he denied any debt to the agency and asserted affirmative defenses including that if the charge in question was a special tax,it violated various constitutional and statutory provisions if it was an assessment,it violated other laws if it was a fee or charge for a property related service,it failed to comply with still other laws and it fail ed to recognize the priority of overlying water rights and is unconstitutional under california constitution article x section.mcgrath also alleged that the interest sought by the agency was usurious.
the agency brought a motion for summary judgment or,in the alternative,for an adjudication as to its first cause of action statutory liability and as to defendant seventh through eleventh affirmative defenses,which concerned the alleged invalidity of the charge as well as a usurious interest rate.the agency contended that the challenges to the validity of the charge were barred by failure to exhaust administrative remedies,failure to exhaust judicial remedies,and collateral estoppel.mcgrath opposed the motion on the ground,among others,that the judgment in the earlier matter would not support a collateral estoppel because it was void.
in response to the summary judgment motion,mcgrath admitted that the agency had brought a previous action against him for unpaid groundwater augmentation charges,that he had asserted affirmative defenses to that complaint,including that the charges were levied contrary to law,that he had described the validity of the groundwater augmentation fee as a crucial issue to be decided and a key question,and that in defense of that action he had alluded to proposition.he did not effectively dispute the point that after a trial in that action,the court had entered judgment against him on the merits 
the agency claimed that as of december,mcgrath owed,with additional charges accruing at the rate of per day.mcgrath asserted in his declaration that assuming the validity of the charge,the amount due was in dispute and was calculated by him at,not including the amount embraced in the earlier judgment.he had conceded in deposition that the agency had sent him invoices for augmentation charges and that he had not paid any of those invoices.however,the record contains no unequivocal evidence of the dates on which invoices were sent or received.
the court granted summary judgment,essentially sustaining all of the agency contentions concerning both the viability of the affirmative defenses and the amount due.mcgrath filed this timely appeal 
discussion 
collateral estoppel 
the trial court summarily adjudicated mcgrath defenses as being without merit on the ground,among others,that those defenses are barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel.that doctrine,known more recently as issue preclusion,prevents a party from obtaining a second adjudication of an issue that has already been adjudicated against that party on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction.the doctrine operates to bar relitigation of issues previously litigated between the same parties on a different cause of action if the issues for which collateral estoppel is sought in the second action are identical to those litigated in the first action were actually litigated and necessarily decided in determining the first action are asserted against a participant in the first action or one in privity with that party and the former decision was final on the merits.citation.rice crow th,d.
mcgrath does not dispute the presence of these four elements.he invokes the principle,however,that a void judgment will not operate as a bar to relitigation of the issues purportedly adjudicated.rochin pat johnson manufacturing th,d the doctrine of res judicata is inapplicable to void judgments see rest d,judgments,stating general rule that a valid and final personal judgment has preclusive effect.the question,then,is whether the former judgment is truly void.
a judgment is void if the court rendering it lacked subject matter jurisdiction or jurisdiction over the parties.subject matter jurisdiction relates to the inherent authority of the court involved to deal with the case or matter before it.citation.lack of jurisdiction in this fundamental or strict sense means an entire absence of power to hear or determine the case,an absence of authority over the subject matter or the parties.citation.carlson eassa th,d,quoting abelleira district court of appeal cal d,abelleira.
a court does not necessarily act without subject matter jurisdiction merely by issuing a judgment going beyond the sphere of action prescribed by law.speaking generally,any acts which exceed the defined power of a court in any instance,whether that power be defined by constitutional provision,express statutory declaration,or rules developed by the courts and followed under the doctrine of stare decisis,are in excess of jurisdiction abelleira,supra,cal d at.the distinction is critical,because a ction in excess of jurisdiction by a court that has jurisdiction in the fundamental sense,jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties is not void,but only voidable.citations.in contrast to cases involving other types of jurisdictional defects,a party may be precluded from challenging action in excess of a court jurisdiction when the circumstances warrant applying principles of estoppel,disfavor of collateral attack or res judicata.citation.conservatorship of th,d,fn.omitted.
mcgrath argument thus necessarily depends on the premise that the court rendering the earlier judgment acted without jurisdiction in the fundamental sense.this premise in turn rests on the statutory exclusion from municipal court jurisdiction of issues concerning the validity of a tax or similar charge.as in effect in february,when the previous action was commenced,code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,granted original jurisdiction to the municipal court in all cases at law in which the demand,exclusive of interest,or the value of the property in controversy amounts to thousand dollars or less,except cases that involve the legality of any tax,impost,assessment,toll,or municipal fine stats,ch,west cal.legis.service,italics added.the effect of the italicized language was to den y to the municipal court and confer upon the superior court exclusive jurisdiction over cases involving the legality of any tax,impost,assessment,toll or municipal fine.california employment stabilization commission municipal court d,california employment see witkin,cal.procedure ed.jurisdiction.it is at least arguable,and we may assume for present purposes,that a municipal court judgment purporting to adjudicate such issues would be jurisdictionally defective in the fundamental sense that the rendering court completely lacked subject matter jurisdiction,rendering the resulting judgment void and without preclusive effect.
however,on june,the voters adopted senate constitutional amendment proposition,which had the effect of empowering each county to abolish the municipal court in that county by merging its judges and resources into the superior court.among the provisions enacted was article,section,subdivision e of the california constitution,providing that the municipal and superior courts shall be unified upon a majority vote of superior court judges and a majority vote of municipal court judges within the county.in those counties,there shall be only a superior court.the courts in santa cruz county were unified under these provisions as of july.upon unification,all causes were within the original jurisdiction of the superior court.trial court unification revision of codes july cal.law revision com,fn.omitted trial court unification.accordingly,by august,when judgment was entered in the first action between these parties,the action was pending not before the municipal no longer the superior court.
had the judgment been rendered prior to unification it might well be void because mcgrath answer to the complaint,by tendering issues beyond the competence of the municipal court,ousted that court of jurisdiction,quite possibly in the fundamental sense.see wiggins washington nat.life ins.d.from the moment defendant filed its for declaratory relief in the instant action the municipal court lost jurisdiction over the cause and was obliged to suspend further proceedings in the action and to transfer it to the superior court.after unification,however,the case was no longer pending before the municipal court,a court of limited jurisdiction,but before the superior court,a court of general jurisdiction,and indeed the only court in which it could now be tried.see trial court unification,supra,cal.law revision com,supra,at pp.in a county in which the courts have unified,the superior court has original jurisdiction of limited civil cases wozniak lucutz th,fn,d parties references to limited jurisdiction court and unlimited jurisdiction court were misleading misnomers because a fter unification,there is only one superior court citation in the superior court,there are either limited civil cases or unlimited civil cases.the court therefore did not lack the fundamental power to adjudicate the matter.see glade glade th,d there is only one superior court in a county and jurisdiction is vested in that court,not in any particular judge or department.whether sitting separately or together,the judges hold but one and the same court.
it is true that after the matter was converted to a superior court action,mcgrath challenge to the validity of the charge continued to have some potential effect.code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,defines limited cases as those in which the amount in controversy is not more than,but adds,this paragraph does not apply to cases that involve the legality of any tax,impost,assessment,toll,or municipal fine thus when mcgrath answer tendered issues concerning the validity of the charges,it had the effect of potentially changing the matter from a limited case to an unlimited case.that change,however,would not affect the fundamental jurisdiction of the court it would only relieve the parties of certain limitations affecting the manner in which the case could be adjudicated.see snukal flightways manufacturing,cal th,d,quoting trial court unification,supra,cal.law revision com,supra,at,fn.omitted in a county in which the courts have unified,the superior court has original jurisdiction of limited civil cases,but these cases are governed by economic litigation procedures,local appeal,filing fees,and the other procedural distinctions that characterize these cases in a municipal court.
mcgrath answer thus created an occasion or opportunity to disqualify the matter from treatment as a limited case.code civ,subd.a.in contrast to the previous regime,however,this disqualification did not call for automatic transfer to a different court instead it provided a basis for reclassification of the matter for treatment as an unlimited civil case within the same court.see code civ,et this would have exempted the case from certain economic litigation procedures trial court unification,supra,cal.law revision com,supra,at see code civ,shifted appellate jurisdiction from the appellate division of the superior court to the court of appeal code civ,subjected the matter to increased filing fees,and in particular,a reclassification fee chargeable to the party whose pleading triggered the reclassification code civ,subd.c,and removed certain restrictions on the preclusive effect of a judgment 
the fact that the matter was subject to reclassification had no effect on the fundamental jurisdiction of the court.indeed the statutes governing reclassification strongly indicate that a matter may proceed to trial and judgment as a limited case even though it might be subject to reclassification.thus the statutes provide that the clerk shall reclassify a matter upon tendering by a party of a or amended pleading that requires reclassification.code civ.this duty only arises,however,if the pleading is accompanied by the required classification fee.failing that,the clerk shall not reclassify the case and the case shall remain and proceed as a limited civil case.code civ,subd.b see.a matter may also be reclassified on the motion of a party,but reclassification is only mandatory if the motion is filed within a specified time,or the moving party shows good cause for not seeking reclassification earlier.code civ,subd.b see,subd.a.in all other situations,the motion is addressed to the discretion of the court.code civ,subd.a the court,on its own motion,may reclassify a case at any time.moreover,if the court grants such a motion and no party pays a required reclassification fee within a stated time,the court may,among other options,order the case to proceed as a limited civil case.code civ,subd.d.
the code thus explicitly contemplates situations in which a matter can proceed as a limited case even though it possesses characteristics that would support and require on timely motion and payment of fees reclassification to unlimited status.these provisions can not be reconciled with mcgrath premise that the court presiding over a limited case lacks jurisdiction in the fundamental sense merely because the case could be reclassified as unlimited.in contrast,prior to unification a transfer to superior court was mandatory no matter when or how the jurisdictional defect first appeared code civ.
nor does an adjudication of these issues in a limited case offend any underlying policy of which we are aware.the general purpose of requiring such issues to be adjudicated in the superior court,rather than the municipal court,was to protect the fiscal interests of taxing authorities.see madera black cal,general purpose of the provision was to give to the sovereign power of the state the protection of having the legality of any exaction of money for public uses or needs cognizable in the first instance in the superior courts alone.an additional rationale was suggested in unemp.com.francis homes d,based upon the supreme court appellate jurisdiction as distinct from discretionary jurisdiction over actions challenging the legality of a tax.this provision was evidently intended to ensure statewide uniformity on issues concerning the scope of a public entity taxing powers,an objective facilitated by excluding such issues from municipal court jurisdiction.ibid.that rationale,however,lost all vitality in when the supreme court appellate jurisdiction over such cases was abolished.see witkin,cal.procedure,supra,courts.the exclusion of such cases from municipal court jurisdiction continued to serve the objective noted in madera black,supra,cal,protecting taxing entities by guaranteeing that any challenge to their taxing power would be tested under the more rigorous procedures available in superior court.this rationale doubtless retains vitality after reunification.but the simple fact is that neither party here sought to take advantage of the protections of unlimited status.although it was mcgrath who made those protections available by pleading constitutional defenses,and the agency for whose benefit they were made available,neither party sought to invoke them.under these circumstances no discernible policy would be served by depriving the judgment of preclusive effect.
in sum,we are unable to discern any basis in precedent or policy to deny the former judgment the preclusive effect formerly granted to municipal court judgments and now granted to judgments in limited cases it is,in respect to the matter directly adjudged,conclusive between the parties and their successors in interest code civ.since mcgrath does not dispute that the previous judgment directly adjudged the affirmative defenses at issue here,the trial court properly granted summary adjudication against him with respect to those defenses.this conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider the other grounds on which the agency attacked those defenses.
ii.damages 
amount owed 
mcgrath contends that even if the trial court properly adjudged his affirmative defenses to be without merit,it erred by entering judgment for the agency because the record disclosed triable issues of fact concerning the amount owed.
the agency damages were,of course,an element of its cause of action.see witkin,cal.procedure,supra,pleading,goehring chapman university th,d.as a result,the agency could not establish a prima facie entitlement to summary judgment without showing both the fact and the amount of damages.see code civ,subd.p moving plaintiff establishes threshold entitlement to summary judgment if it prove s each element of the cause of action entitling the party to judgment on that cause of action.to carry this burden the agency relied entirely on the declaration of charlies mcniesh,its general manager,who averred that mcgrath accounts are delinquent from to present time.these accounts are reflected in bills sent to him that are detailed statements of what he owes.with respect to the first cause of action the amount owed is.this reflects the amounts which were billed to mcgrath for three years up to the filing of the complaint,plus interest,plus a water use fee pursuant to the statute for those charges within the year before the filing of the complaint.in addition,because a billing cycle has passed since the filing of the complaint,the agency has included charges incurred since reflected in the july bill,including interest on the july bill up to and including december,plus a water use fee pursuant to the statute for these charges.all of these fees have been calculated pursuant to a fee schedule adopted by the agency under ordinance and,as amended.the computation is attached as exhibit italics added.exhibit b consists of a table summarizing the agency claimed damages under the heading pvwma william mcgrath.
mcgrath objected to the quoted paragraph on the grounds that it lacked a foundation in personal knowledge and constituted improper opinion testimony under evidence code section.he objected to exhibit b on the grounds of evidence code sections hearsay,authentication of writings,subdivision a secondary evidence of writing,and production of business records.the trial court overruled these objections,stating that pursuant to evidence code section and hearsay rules,the plaintiff is entitled to provide a summary calculation of damages to simplify the presentation.
this ruling was erroneous several of mcgrath evidentiary objections were.the declaration recapitulated the contents of exhibit b,which in turn recapitulated the contents of certain bills not before the court.all bills,the exhibit,and the hearsay,evidence of a statement that was made other than by a witness while testifying at the hearing and that is offered to prove the truth of the matter stated,subd.a.to overcome a hearsay objection,the agency had to show that one or more hearsay exceptions applied at each of these three levels.
the mcniesh declaration itself is hearsay windigo mills unemployment ins.appeals bd.d,but is made specially admissible in connection with motions in general and summary judgment motions in particular code civ,subds.b,d see.this special authorization implies a hearsay exception,so that in the situations specified by statute,otherwise admissible testimony may be given by declaration,provided it is under oath.witkin,cal.evidence ed.hearsay.
here,however,the declaration explicitly recapitulated the contents of a second writing,exhibit b.that document was not incorporated in the mcniesh declaration,or even vouched for it was merely described as attached.it was therefore not given under oath,and did not fall within the implicit hearsay exception for affidavits and declarations.
moreover,the mcniesh declaration explicitly describes the amount owed,the matter asserted as being derived from yet a third level of documentary hearsay,the bills containing the amounts that were reflected in the final figure.the original bills might be admissible over a hearsay objection as business records,or perhaps official records,but to establish either exception would require a showing of the time and circumstances of the documents creation.no such showing was attempted.accordingly,of the three levels of hearsay on which the agency proof depended,an exception appears only for mcniesh declaration.this falls short by.the evidence of the amount of arrearages was objectionable,and upon proper objection,inadmissible.given that mcgrath did object on the
