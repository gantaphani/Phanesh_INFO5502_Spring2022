petitioner monterey peninsula water management district,a public agency,imposed a fee on a public utility customers for work it had undertaken to mitigate environmental damage caused by the utility.the agency fee was charged as a line item on the utility bill and was collected by the utility on behalf of the agency.the question before us is whether the california public utilities commission puc or commission,which is empowered to regulate the rates and charges of public utilities,had the authority to review the amount of the agency fee.we conclude that the puc did not have such authority.
the legislature created the monterey peninsula water management district the district in in response to concerns that the private water supplier serving the monterey peninsula area did not have the ability to perform functions which are normally performed by public agencies,including,among other things,the management and regulation of the use,reuse,reclamation,conservation of water and bond financing of public works projects.stats,ch.the legislature conferred on the district broad powers to manage and regulate water use and distribution in the monterey peninsula area.it also gave the district the power to levy and collect taxes and assessments upon land within the district,see,and,and t o fix,revise,and collect rates and charges,subd.b.the legislature further provided that the district may contract that all its charges be collected by any public utility,and that such charges be billed upon the same bill as the utility own charges and collected as one item,subd.d.
the district operates in the same geographical region as real party in interest california american water cal am,a privately owned public utility that supplies water to property owners in the monterey peninsula area.see cal,art.xii,defining the term public utilities to include p rivate corporations that own,operate,control,or manage a line,plant,or system for the production,generation,transmission,or furnishing of heat,light,water,or power directly or indirectly to or for the public.in,the state water resources control board the water control board determined that cal am was diverting more water from the carmel river than either its licenses or the common law entitled it to divert.order on four complaints filed against the california american water company july,water control bd.order no.wr,at chttp as of january,hereafter order no.wr.the water control board imposed limits on cal am future use of carmel river water.it further charged cal am with responsibility for the mitigation program,a program started by the district in as a program to mitigate the environmental impacts of low streamflow in the carmel river.id.at.the water control board ordered cal am to continue the mitigation program in the event the district ceased implementing the program at the end of the designated term.id.at.
the district,however,decided to continue implementing the mitigation program after the initial period had expired.the district also undertook a second remedial measure,the aquifer storage and recovery program,in which it pumped surplus carmel river water into the seaside groundwater basin during the winter season for retrieval during the summer season,with the aim of reducing the need for diverting carmel river water during the summer months.although the water control board order no.wr does not expressly refer to the aquifer storage and recovery program,the parties have understood the program to fall within cal am general mitigation responsibilities under that order.
since,the district has assessed a user fee on cal am customers,and it has contracted with cal am to include this fee on cal am water bill.cal am collects the district fee from cal am customers and transfers the resulting revenue to the district,which uses the revenue to fund,among other things,the two remedial programs.the district fee is currently set at percent of each cal am customer water charge.
because cal am is a public utility,its rates are subject to approval by the puc.the puc powers under the california constitution include the power to fix rates for all public utilities subject to its jurisdiction.cal,art.xii.the public utilities code further specifies that a ll charges demanded or received by any public utility for any product or commodity furnished or to be furnished or any service rendered or to be rendered shall be just and reasonable.every unjust or unreasonable charge demanded or received for such product or commodity or service is unlawful.pub,hereafter section.
in july,cal am sought the puc approval for a rate increase in the monterey peninsula area.the puc approved the rate increase,but in so doing,it raised a number of questions about the district user fees.see final decision authorizing rate increase in monterey water district and toro service area cal,at chttp word.pdfd as of january,hereafter decision.the puc acknowledged that t he management district has a variety of funding mechanisms at its disposal over which this commission has no jurisdiction.id.at.but the puc concluded that it had authority to review the fees used to fund the mitigation programs,explaining that i f the expenditures are properly cal am responsibility,we must ensure that the projects undertaken by the management district on cal am behalf are necessary and are being provided in the most manner.ibid.the puc further explained that the cal am rate increase that the puc had approved would lead to a corresponding increase in the district fee,but that no evidence demonstrated an increase in the district costs or how the district planned to use the additional revenues.id.at.
the puc determined that the record before it did not provide sufficient legal or factual support to determine the appropriate level of cal am funding for the mitigation work.to the extent that cal am and its ratepayers are legally responsible for these programs,it continued,we expected cal am to discharge that responsibility in an efficient and effective manner either by its own actions or as a joint project with the management district.ibid.the puc accordingly directed cal am either to take over the mitigation work itself or to meet and confer with the district to discuss the possibility of doing the mitigation work as a joint project,with the district charging the cost of its services to cal am rather than to cal am customers,and with cal am recovering that additional expense by way of a special surcharge.id.at.the puc provided that the parties could also consider other cost effective and efficient methods for cal am to fully meet any responsibility it may have for the mitigation work.id.at.the puc ordered cal am to file,within days,an application setting forth a new method of collecting funds to support mitigation program costs properly assignable to cal am,whether performed by cal am or the management district.ibid.
cal am did not,however,file an application setting forth a new method of funding mitigation costs.cal am instead applied to the puc for authorization to collect the district usual user fee and remit the collected amount to the district,as it had done in the past.then,before the puc responded,cal am,the district,and the puc division of ratepayer advocates moved for approval of a settlement agreement under which all moving parties agreed that the district requested user fee was appropriate.the moving parties further argued that the puc had no authority to regulate the charges of a public agency such as the district.
the puc rejected both cal am application and the settlement agreement.the puc later denied the district application for rehearing.we granted the district petition for a writ of review,subd.f review of puc decisions pertaining solely to water corporations shall only be by petition for writ of review in the supreme court.
created by the california constitution,the public utilities commission has exclusive jurisdiction to supervise and regulate public utilities.it has no authority,however,to regulate public agencies like the district,absent a statute expressly authorizing such regulation.see county of inyo public utilities com.cal d,county of inyo.
