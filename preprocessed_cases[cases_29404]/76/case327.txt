california law requires a local agency to refund sewer service fees paid for which no sewer services were provided.code,subd.b.where a person paid such fees and is still residing at the same location,the local agency is required to refund such fees in their entirety upon determining the premises is not connected to the sewer system,subd.c.
here,from through,the city of escondido city supplied water through a single water meter to a residential condominium homeowners association and starting in billed for sewer services per gallon of water that flowed through that meter.the association used some of that water for its swimming pool and related bathroom facilities,which are connected to the city sewer system.however,according to the association,upwards of percent of the water was used for irrigating landscape common areas.in the city determined those landscape areas are not connected to the city sewer system and at the association request installed a separate,second water meter to supply water exclusively to that part of the property.
the primary issue in this case is whether,for the period of time from to before the second water meter was installed,the homeowners association is entitled to a refund under section of sewer service fees paid for the water used for irrigating the common area landscaping,for which no sewer services were provided.
we conclude section does not apply because liability for wrongfully collecting sewer service fees under this statute does not depend on a property owner subjective or particular use of water through a single water meter,but rather on whether the premises serviced by that meter are or are not connected to the sewer system.here,during the period the property was supplied by a single water meter,the premises was,in fact,connected to the city sewer system.accordingly,we affirm the trial court order denying the association petition for a writ of mandate.

cape concord homeowners association sewer service fees 
cape concord homeowners association cape concord,a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation,is the residential owners association for a common interest development known as cape concord in the city.the development consists of residential units and common areas,and is divided into two phases,called turnbridge and nantucket.
the cape concord common areas consist of landscaping and a swimming pool and pool house at each phase.cape concord uses water to irrigate the common area landscape and supply water for the swimming pools and pool houses,which contain showers,sinks,and toilets.an overwhelmingly vast majority of the water used by cape concord is for irrigation.
before there was one water meter supplying cape concord water at turnbridge and another meter at nantucket.from the development inception in through,the city classified cape concord c ommercial at s ingle f amily.under this classification,cape concord paid a flat rate for sewer service,ranging from about to each month.
in the city changed cape concord classification to c ommercial.as a result,the city began charging cape concord for sewer services based on the quantity of water used,as measured by each of the two meters,regardless of whether the water was used for irrigation or the houses.
c.the meter split 
in cape concord was having financial difficulties and was particularly concerned about its high water bills.the july water bill,for example,exceeded.
at cape concord request,the city inspected the property.the purpose of the meeting was to determine whether the water meters at cape concord could be split to avoid the sewer service charge on its irrigation use.the city determined that the existing water line at each phase could be split into two meters one exclusively servicing the swimming pool and pool house which used the sewer system,and the other supplying water exclusively for irrigating common area landscaping which did not use the sewer system.by splitting the meters in this manner,cape concord would not be assessed a sewer fee on water used exclusively for irrigation.
in october and november,the city added a second water meter at turnbridge and also at nantucket.as a result,one meter serviced water exclusively for irrigating common area landscaping,and the other for the swimming pools and pool houses.
the city reclassified the meters providing irrigation as i rrigation i nstitutional,a classification exempt from a sewer service fee.after the meter split,the city did not charge cape concord sewer service fees for water from the meters.
in deposition testimony,mary unland,whom the city designated as its most qualified person regarding the meter split,explained that water meters service premises that are not connected to the city sewer system 
q and why does the irrigation classification get the sewer service charge 
a irrigation meters that are irrigation only,and that how we classify them,is that they irrigation only,are not connected to the city sewer system.
a therefore,we do charge them sewer.
q so the irrigation lines service property that is not connected to the sewer system,is that right 
a that is correct.
q the idea is the irrigation meter services water to property that not connected to the sewer,correct 
q therefore,no sewer service or wastewater fee would apply,correct 
q okay.and so this meter here,does in fact have an irrigation classification,correct 
a now it does,irrigation only,yes.
q in order to get that classification,somebody at the city must have determined that that water meter was servicing water to property for purposes that were not connected to the sewer system,right 
q and you do know who that was,correct 
q but you know that determination had to be made at the time that that meter was classified as irrigation,correct 
the meter split dramatically reduced cape concord water bill.cape concord contends that after the meter split,percent of the water used at turnbridge was for irrigation only.based on this,cape concord estimated it paid in sewer service fees at turnbridge for which city provided no sewer services.
cape concord contends that after the meter split,percent of the water used at nantucket was for irrigation.assuming this same percent ratio,cape concord estimated it paid in sewer service fees at nantucket for which the city provided no sewer services.
