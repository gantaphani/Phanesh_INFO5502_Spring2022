natural resources defense council and santa monica baykeeper appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of two municipal entities that plaintiffs allege are discharging polluted stormwater in violation of the federal water pollution control act the clean water act,act,or cwa,stat,codified as amended at et.plaintiffs contend that county of los angeles county and los angeles county flood control district district are discharging polluted urban stormwater runoff collected by municipal separate storm sewer systems into navigable waters in southern california.the levels of pollutants detected in four santa clara river,the los angeles river,the san gabriel river,and malibu creek collectively,the watershed rivers exceed the limits allowed in a national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit which governs municipal stormwater discharges in the county.although all parties agree that numerous standards have been exceeded in the watershed rivers,defendants contend that there is no evidence establishing their responsibility for,or discharge of,stormwater carrying pollutants to the rivers.the district court agreed with defendants and entered a partial final judgment.
we conclude that the district court erred with respect to the evidence of discharges by the district into two of the watershed los angeles river and san gabriel river.specifically,plaintiffs provided evidence that the monitoring stations for the los angeles and san gabriel rivers are located in a section of owned and operated by the district and,after stormwater known to contain pollutants passes through these monitoring stations,this polluted stormwater is discharged into the two rivers.accordingly,plaintiffs were entitled to summary judgment on the district liability for discharges into the los angeles river and san gabriel river,and therefore we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the district on these claims.
plaintiffs,however,failed to meet their evidentiary burden with respect to discharges by the district into the santa clara river and malibu creek.plaintiffs did not provide evidence sufficient for the district court to determine if stormwater discharged from an controlled by the district caused or contributed to pollution exceedances located in these two rivers.similarly,plaintiffs did not delineate how stormwater from controlled by the county caused or contributed to exceedances in any of the watershed rivers.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants on these claims.
factual and procedural background 
stormwater runoff in los angeles countya.the 
stormwater runoff is surface water generated by precipitation events,such as rainstorms,which flows over streets,parking lots,commercial sites,and other developed parcels of land.whereas natural,vegetated soil can absorb rainwater and capture pollutants,paved surfaces and developed land can do neither.when stormwater flows over urban environs,it collects suspended metals,sediments,nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus,floatable trash,used motor oil,raw sewage,pesticides,and other toxic contaminants.envtl.def,epa,cir.this runoff is a major contributor to water pollution in southern california rivers and the pacific ocean and contributes to the sickening of many ocean users each year.
the county is a sprawling amalgam of populous incorporated cities and significant swaths of unincorporated land.the district is a public entity governed by the los angeles county board of supervisors and the department of public works.the district is comprised of cities and some unincorporated areas of the county.the county and the district are separate legal entities.
in the district,stormwater runoff is collected by thousands of storm drains located in each municipality and channeled to a storm sewer system.the municipalities in the district operate to collect and channel stormwater.the county also operates an for certain unincorporated areas.unlike a sanitary sewer system,which transports municipal sewage for treatment at a wastewater facility,or a combined sewer system,which transports sewage and stormwater for treatment,contain and convey only untreated stormwater.see a,b.in the county,municipal are highly interconnected because the district allows each municipality to connect its storm drains to the district extensive and infrastructure the that infrastructure includes miles of open channels and miles of storm drains.the length of the system,and the locations of all storm drain connections,are not known exactly,as a comprehensive map of the storm drain system does not exist.while the number and location of storm drains are too numerous to catalogue,it is undisputed that the collects and channels stormwater runoff from across the county.that stormwater is channeled in the to various watercourses including the four watershed rivers at the heart of this litigation the los angeles river,the san gabriel river,the santa clara river,and malibu creek.the watershed rivers drain into the pacific ocean at santa monica bay,los angeles harbor,and long beach harbor.
the gravamen of plaintiffs action is that by allowing untreated and stormwater to flow unabated from the into the watershed rivers,and eventually into the pacific ocean,defendants have violated the clean water act.
b.the clean water act and npdes permit 
the clean water act is the nation primary law.the act purpose is to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.a.to serve those ends,the act prohibits the discharge of any pollutant by any person unless done in compliance with some provision of the act.fl.water mgmt.dist.miccosukee tribe of indians,quoting a.discharge of a pollutant is defined as any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.see comm.to save mokelumne river east bay mun.util,cir characterizing discharge as add ing pollutants from the outside world to navigable water.
under the clean water act,fall under the definition of point sources.a point source is any discernible,confined and discrete conveyance,including but not limited to any pipe,ditch,channel,tunnel,conduit,well,discrete fissure,container,rolling stock,concentrated animal feeding operation,or vessel or other floating craft,from which pollutants are or may be discharged.
a person or entity wishing to add pollutants to navigable waters must comply with the npdes,which requires dischargers to obtain permits that place limits on the type and quantity of pollutants that can be released into the nation waters.miccosukee tribe,at a,p.the act generally prohibits the discharge of any pollutant from a point source into the navigable waters of the united states unless the point source is covered by an npdes permit.defenders of wildlife browner,cir quoting a,a emphasis added see also arkansas oklahoma,describing npdes permitting system.an npdes permit requires its permittee to follow the requirements of numerous clean water act provisions,see a,which include effluent limitations,standards,water monitoring obligations,public reporting mechanisms,and certain discharge requirements.see id.
the act uses two standards,by which a discharger of water may be evaluated effluent limitations and water quality standards.arkansas oklahoma,at citing,see also sierra club.union oil of,cir,vacated on other grounds,reinstated,cir.an effluent limitation is any restriction established by a state or the environmental protection agency epa administrator on quantities,rates,and concentrations of chemical,physical,biological,and other constituents which are discharged from point sources into navigable waters.an guideline is determined in light of the best practicable control technology currently available.union oil,at quoting b a.
standards are used as a supplementary basis for effluent limitations,so that numerous dischargers,despite their individual compliance with limitations,can be regulated to prevent water quality from falling below acceptable levels.union oil,at citing epa ex rel.state water res.control,hereafter epa.standards are developed in a process.first,the epa,or state water authorities establish a waterway beneficial use.natural res.def.council,epa,cir see also cal.water code f beneficial uses of the waters of the state that may be protected against quality degradation include,but are not limited to,domestic,municipal,agricultural and industrial supply power generation recreation aesthetic enjoyment navigation and preservation and enhancement of fish,wildlife,and other aquatic resources or preserves.once the beneficial use is determined,water quality criteria that will yield the desired water conditions are formulated and implemented.see nrdc epa,at see also a,c a i water quality standards are provisions of state or federal law which consist of a designated use or uses for the waters of the united states and water quality criteria for such waters based upon such uses.
unlike effluent limitations,which are promulgated by the epa to achieve a certain level of pollution reduction in light of available technology,standards emanate from the state boards charged with managing their domestic water resources.see arkansas oklahoma,at.the epa gives the states guidance in drafting standards and state authorities periodically review water quality standards and secure the epa approval of any revisions in the standards.id.
the epa has authorized the state of california to develop standards and issue npdes permits.under the water quality control act,california state law designates the state water resources control board and nine regional boards as the principal state agencies for enforcing federal and state water pollution law and for issuing permits.see cal.water code.beginning in,the california state water resources control board for the los angeles region the regional board issued an npdes permit the permit to cover stormwater discharges by the county,the district,and incorporated municipalities in the county collectively the permittees or see city of arcadia state water res.control,d.the permit was renewed in,and.
the permit is divided into two broad sections findings by the regional board and an order authorizing and governing the permittees discharges order.the findings cover many introductory and background subjects,including a history of npdes permitting in the county applicable state and federal laws governing stormwater discharges studies conducted by the county and researchers about the deleterious effects of polluted stormwater coverage and implementation provisions and guidelines for administrative review of permit provisions.the permit covers all areas within the boundaries of the permittee municipalities over which they have regulatory jurisdiction as well as unincorporated areas in los angeles county within the jurisdiction of the regional board.in total,the permit governs municipal stormwater discharge across more than square miles of land in the county.
the permit relates the many federal and state regulations governing stormwater discharges to southern california watercourses.among these regulations is the water quality control plan for the los angeles region the basin plan.under california law,the regional boards water quality plans,called basin plans,must address the beneficial uses to be protected as well as water quality objectives,and they must establish a program of implementation.city of arcadia,d at quoting city of burbank state water res.control,cal citing cal.water code j.the permit provides that t he basin plan designates beneficial uses of receiving waters and specifies both narrative and numerical water quality objectives for the receiving water in los angeles county.receiving waters are defined as all surface water bodies in the los angeles region that are identified in the basin plan.permittees are to assure that storm water discharges from the shall neither cause nor contribute to the exceedance of water quality standards and objectives nor create conditions of nuisance in the receiving waters,and that the discharge of water to the has been effectively prohibited.the permit incorporates and adopts the basin plan,which sets limits on bacteria and contaminants for the receiving waters of southern california.the standards limit,among other pollutants,the levels of ammonia,fecal coliform bacteria,arsenic,mercury,and cyanide in southern california inland rivers.
the permit contains myriad prohibitions and conditions regarding discharges into and from the.under part,the permittees are directed to effectively prohibit water discharges into the and watercourses unless allowed by an npdes permit.under part,titled receiving water limitations,discharges from the that cause or contribute to the violation of the water quality standards or water quality objectives are prohibited.the water quality standards and water quality objectives are defined in the permit as water quality criteria contained in the basin plan,the california ocean plan,the national toxics rule,the california toxics rule,and other state or federal approved surface water quality plans.such plans are used by the regional board to regulate all discharges,including storm water discharges.
the permit provides that permittees shall comply with the discharge prohibitions through timely implementation of control measures and other actions to reduce pollutants in the discharges in accordance with the los angeles quality management program sqmp and its components and other requirements of this order the sqmp includes descriptions of programs,collectively developed by the permittees in accordance with provisions of the npdes permit,to comply with applicable federal and state law.the permit sets out a procedure to ensure permittee compliance when any standards are breached 
a upon a determination by either the permittee or the regional board that discharges are causing or contributing to an exceedance of an applicable water quality standard,the permittee shall promptly notify and thereafter submit a receiving water limitations rwl compliance report to the regional board that describes best management practices bmps that are currently being implemented and additional bmps that will be implemented to prevent or reduce any pollutants that are causing or contributing to the exceedances of water quality standards.
c within days following the approval of the rwl compliance report,the permittee shall revise the sqmp and its components and monitoring program to incorporate the approved modified bmps that have been and will be implemented,an implementation schedule,and any additional monitoring required.
d implement the revised sqmp and its components and monitoring program according to the approved schedule.
so long as the permittee has complied with the procedures set forth above and is implementing the revised sqmp and its components,the permittee does not have to repeat the same procedure for continuing or recurring exceedances of the same receiving water limitations unless directed by the regional board to develop additional bmps.
when a violation arises,a permittee must adhere to the procedures in its compliance report until the exceedances abate.
the permit requires the permittees,inter alia,to reduce pollution in stormwater to the maximum extent practicable mep.each permittee is vested with the necessary legal authority to prohibit discharges to the,and is directed to develop stormwater and urban runoff ordinances for its jurisdiction.
the permit has both and requirements,which include monitoring of mass emissions at seven mass emission monitoring stations water column toxicity monitoring tributary monitoring shoreline monitoring trash monitoring estuary sampling bioassessment and special studies.
this case concerns high levels of pollutants,particularly heavy metals and fecal bacteria,identified by monitoring stations for the four watershed rivers the monitoring stations.monitoring measures all constituents present in water,and the readings give a cumulative picture of the pollutant load in a waterbody.according to the permit,the purpose of monitoring is to estimate the mass emissions from the,assess trends in the mass emissions over time,and determine if the is contributing to exceedances of water quality standards by comparing results to the applicable standards in the basin plan.the permit establishes that the principal permittee,which is the district,shall monitor the stations.the permit requires that readings be taken five times per year for the watershed rivers.
the los angeles river and san gabriel river monitoring stations are located in a channelized portion of the that is owned and operated by the district.see excerpts of record at see also dist.docket declaration of aaron colangelo ex.n deposition of mark pestrella at.the los angeles river monitoring station is located in the city of long beach in a concrete lined trapezoidal channel.the los angeles river monitoring station measures total upstream tributary drainage of square miles,as the los angeles river is the largest watershed outlet in the county.the san gabriel river monitoring station is located in pico rivera and measures an upstream tributary watershed of square miles.
the malibu creek monitoring station is not located within a channelized portion of the but at an existing stream gage station near malibu canyon road.it measures miles of tributary watershed.the santa clara river monitoring station is located in the city of santa clara and measures an upstream tributary area of square miles 
exceedances in the watershed rivers 
between and,the four monitoring stations identified hundreds of exceedances of the permit standards.these exceedances are not disputed.for instance,monitoring for the los angeles and san gabriel rivers showed separate exceedances.these included high levels of aluminum,copper,cyanide,fecal coliform bacteria,and zinc in the rivers.further,ocean monitoring at surfrider beach showed that there were separate bacteria exceedances on days,including days where the fecal coliform bacteria limit was exceeded.
the district admits that it conveys pollutants via the,but contends that its infrastructure alone does not generate or discharge pollutants.according to defendants,the district conveys the collective discharges of the numerous municipalities.moreover,defendants identify thousands of permitted dischargers whose pollutants are reaching the watershed rivers

ii.proceedings before the district court 
based on data by defendants,plaintiffs catalogued the exceedances in the watershed rivers.beginning on may,plaintiffs sent a series of notice letters to defendants concerning these exceedances.on march,based on these purported violations,plaintiffs commenced this action.after the district court dismissed certain elements of plaintiffs initial complaint because notice of the permit violations was defective,plaintiffs sent defendants an adequate notice letter on july.
plaintiffs filed the first amended complaint complaint on september.in the complaint,plaintiffs assert six causes of action under the clean water act.only the first four of plaintiffs claims,which relate to the exceedances in the watershed rivers,and which the district court designated the watershed claims,are before us.the first three watershed claims allege that,beginning in or,the district and the county caused or contributed to exceedances of standards in the santa clara river claim,the los angeles river claim,and the san gabriel river claim,in violation of a,p.the fourth watershed claim alleges that,beginning in,defendants caused or contributed to exceedances of the water quality standards and violated the total maximum daily load tmdl limits in malibu creek.plaintiffs four watershed claims each rest on the same premise the permit sets limits for each of the four rivers the stations have recorded exceedances of those standards an exceedance is with the permit and,thereby,the clean water act and defendants,as holders of the permit and operators of the,are liable under the act.
before the district court,plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on two of the watershed claims the los angeles river and san gabriel river exceedances.defendants for summary judgment on all four watershed claims.
in a march,order,the district court denied each for summary judgment on the watershed claims.nrdc county of los angeles,civ.ahm,wl.cal,amended on other grounds,wl.although the district court accepted plaintiffs arguments that the permit clearly prohibits discharges from the that cause or contribute to the violation of water quality standards or water quality objectives,wl,at,and that stations are the proper monitoring locations to determine if the is contributing to exceedances of the water quality standards or water quality objectives,the district court held that plaintiffs were attempting to establish liability without presenting evidence of who was responsible for the stormwater discharge.the district court observed that although the district is responsible for the pollutants in the at the time they pass the stations,that does not necessarily determine the question of whether the water passing by these points is a discharge within the meaning of the permit and the clean water act.id.at.unable to decipher from the record where the ended and the watershed rivers begin,or whether any upstream outflows were contributing stormwater to the,the district court stated that plaintiffs would need to present some evidence monitoring data or an admission that some amount of a pollutant is being discharged though at least one district outlet.id.at.
following supplemental briefing,the district court again determined that plaintiffs failed to present evidence that the pollutants passed through the defendants outflows at or near the time the exceedances were observed.nor did plaintiffs provide any evidence that the mass emissions stations themselves are located at or near a defendant outflow.the district court thereupon entered summary judgment for defendants on all four watershed claims.
under.b,the district court entered a partial final judgment on the watershed claims because they were factually and legally severable from the other claims and t he parties and the court would benefit from appellate resolution of the central legal question underlying the watershed claims what level of proof is necessary to establish defendants liability.plaintiffs timely appeal.

discussion 
determining whether the county or the district violated the permit conditions,and thereby the clean water act,requires us to examine whether an exceedance at a monitoring station is a permit violation,and,if so,whether it is beyond dispute that defendants discharged pollutants that caused or contributed to exceedances.
whether exceedances at stations constitute permit violations 
the clean water act regulates the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters,prohibiting their discharge unless certain statutory exceptions apply.russian river watershed protection comm.city of santa rosa,cir citing a.one such exception is for discharges by entities or individuals who hold npdes permits.id.the npdes permitting program is the centerpiece of the clean water act and the primary method for enforcing the effluent and standards established by the epa and state governments.am.iron steel inst.epa,see also nw.envtl.advocates city of portland,cir citizen suits to enforce water quality standards effectuate complementary provisions of the cwa and the underlying purpose of the statute as a whole.friends of the everglades.water mgmt,cir citing wildlife fed gorsuch,there is indeed some basis in the legislative history for the position that congress viewed the npdes program as its most effective weapon against pollution.
to decipher the meaning and enforceability of npdes permit terms,we interpret the unambiguous language contained in the permit.russian river,at.we review a permit provisions and meaning as we would any contract or legal document.see nw.envtl.advocates,at.as described supra,the permit prohibits discharges into receiving waters that exceed the water quality standards established in the basin plan and elsewhere.specifically,section provides d ischarges from the that cause or contribute to the violation of water quality standards or water quality objectives are prohibited.section of the permit reads discharges from the of storm water,or water,for which a permittee is responsible for,shall not cause or contribute to a condition of nuisance.
nevertheless,defendants contend that exceedances observed at stations can not establish liability on behalf of any individual permittee.their argument in this respect,as we discuss more thoroughly infra,relies heavily on their belief that the record is bereft of evidence connecting defendants to the exceedances.defendants also assert that the stations are neither designed nor intended to measure the compliance of any permittee and,therefore,can not form the basis for a permit violation.defendants also argue that municipal compliance with an npdes stormwater permit can not be reviewed under the same regulatory framework as a private entity or individual.in support of this contention,defendants cite to a epa rule 
when enacting this provision,congress was aware of the difficulties in regulating discharges from municipal separate storm sewers solely through traditional treatment and intended for epa and npdes states to develop permit requirements that were much broader in nature than requirements which are traditionally found in npdes permits for industrial process discharges or potws.the legislative history indicates,municipal storm sewer system permits will not necessarily be like industrial discharge permits.often,an treatment technology is not appropriate for this type of discharge.
brief of appellees quoting national pollutant discharge elimination system permit application regulations for storm water discharges.
as we detail infra,neither the statutory development of the clean water act nor the plain language of epa regulations supports defendants arguments that npdes permit violations are less enforceable or unenforceable in the context.in fact,since the inception of the npdes,congress has expanded npdes permitting to bring municipal dischargers within the clean water act coverage.
regulating operators 
the npdes permitting program originated in the amendments to the clean water act,stat,reprinted in codified as amended at.at the time,the npdes program was viewed as the primary means of enforcing the act effluent limitations.natural res.def.council costle,see also natural res.def.council,epa,cir examining statutory history of amendments to the clean water act hereafter nrdc epa.the permitting program is codified at section of the clean water act.in,the epa promulgated regulations categorically exempting discharges from a number of classes of point sources including separate storm sewers containing only storm runoff uncontaminated by any industrial or commercial activity.costle,at citing.the epa exemption of certain point sources,including,from section blanket requirement was invalidated by the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in costle.id.at.the costle court highlighted that t he wording of the cwa,legislative history,and precedents are clear the epa administrator does not have authority to exempt categories of point sources from the permit requirements of.id.at.
in the period following the costle decision,the epa did not promulgate regulations addressing discharges by operators.see nrdc epa,at citing national pollutant discharge elimination system permit application regulations for storm water discharges application deadlines.in,after continued nonfeasance by the epa,congress enacted the water quality act amendments to the clean water act to regulate stormwater discharges from,inter alia.see defenders of wildlife,at ultimately,in,congress enacted the water quality act amendments to the cwa.nrdc epa,at recognizing both the environmental threat posed by storm water runoff and epa problems in implementing regulations,congress passed the water quality act of.internal citations omitted see also.p ermits for discharges from municipal separate storm sewer systems must require controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable,and where necessary water controls,and must include a requirement to effectively prohibit water discharges into the storm sewers.furthermore,epa in consultation with state and local officials must develop a comprehensive program to designate and regulate other storm water discharges to protect water quality.
the principal effect of the amendments was to expand the coverage of section permitting requirements.nrdc epa,at.section p established a phased and tiered approach for npdes permitting.nw.envtl.def.ctr.brown,cir citing p.the purpose of this approach was to allow epa and the states to focus their attention on the most serious problems first.nrdc epa,at.phase i included five categories of stormwater discharges,deemed the most significant sources of stormwater pollution,who were required to obtain an npdes permit for their stormwater discharge by.brown,at citing p.the five categories of the most serious discharge were 
p municipal and industrial stormwater discharges 
a a discharge with respect to which a permit has been issued under this section before february.
b a discharge associated with industrial activity.
c a discharge from a municipal separate storm sewer system serving a population of or more.
d a discharge from a municipal separate storm sewer system serving a population of or more but less than.
e a discharge for which the administrator or the state,as the case may be,determines that the stormwater discharge contributes to a violation of a water quality standard or is a significant contributor of pollutants to waters of the united states.
p emphases added.of the five categories of phase i dischargers required to obtain the first permits,two are operators municipalities with populations over,and municipalities with populations between and.id.p c d.indeed,as noted supra,the permit at issue here was first authorized in pursuant to the amendments.
rather than regulate individual sources of runoff,such as churches,schools and residential property which one congressman described as a potential nightmare and as regulations prior to theoretically required,congress put the npdes permitting requirement at the municipal level to ease the burden of administering the program.brown,at.that assumption of municipal control is found in the permit at issue.of the permit states that permittees shall posses adequate legal authority to r equire persons within their jurisdiction to comply with conditions in permittee ordinances,permits,contracts,model programs,or orders hold dischargers to its accountable for their contributions of pollutants and flows.
defendants position that they are subject to a less rigorous or unenforceable regulatory scheme for their discharges can not be reconciled with the significant legislative history showing congress intent to bring operators under the system.even the selectively excerpted regulatory language defendants present to us congress was aware of the difficulties in regulating discharges from municipal separate storm sewers and intended for epa and npdes states to develop permit requirements that were much broader in nature than requirements which are traditionally found in npdes permits does not support defendants view.indeed,this excerpt is but one paragraph from a longer section titled,storm water quality management programs for municipal systems.the quoted language follows a paragraph which reads 
section p iii of the cwa mandates that permits for discharges from municipal separate storm sewers shall require controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable mep,including management practices,control techniques and systems,design and engineering methods,and such other provisions as the director determines appropriate for the control of such pollutants.
emphasis added.the use of such mandates and commands to supports defendants notion that npdes permits are unenforceable against municipalities for their stormwater discharges.moreover,the paragraphs that follow the excerpt explain why developing controls to manage municipal stormwater is preferable to controlling pollution through effluent technologies.id.the regulations highlight that congress recognized that permit requirements for municipal separate storm sewer systems should be developed in a flexible manner to allow permit conditions to reflect the wide range of impacts that can be associated with these discharges.id.rather than evincing any intent to treat permitting differently for municipalities,the epa merely explains why state authorities that issue permits should draft rules,as the regional board did here,and why standards may be preferable over effluent limitations.avoiding wooden permitting requirements and granting states flexibility in setting forth requirements is not equivalent to immunizing municipalities for stormwater discharges that violate the provisions of a permit.
enforcement of violations 
part and parcel with defendants argument that they are subject to a relaxed regulatory structure is their view that the permit language indicates that monitoring is not intended to be enforced against municipal dischargers.defendants claim that measuring serves only an hortatory defendants state,the mass emission monitoring program neither measures nor was designed to measure any individual permittee compliance with the permit.this proposition,which if accepted would emasculate the permit,is unsupported by either our case law or the plain language of the permit conditions.
the plain language of cwa authorizes citizens to enforce all permit conditions.nw.envtl.advocates,at emphasis in original.we used these words,and emphasized all permit conditions,because the language of the clean water act is clear in its intent to guard against all sources and superintendents of water pollution and clearly contemplates citizen suits to enforce a permit or condition thereof.id.citing f,f see also.highlands conservancy,huffman,cir in other words,the statute takes the water point of view water is indifferent about who initially polluted it so long as pollution continues to occur.
we have previously addressed,and rejected,municipal attempts to avoid npdes permit enforcement.in northwest environmental advocates,we considered a challenging the city of portland operation of a combined sewer system which periodically overflowed and discharged raw sewage into two rivers.at.the plaintiffs brought suit on the basis of an npdes permit condition which prohibit ed any discharges that would violate oregon water quality standards.id.at.reviewing the history of the amendments and the supreme court decision in pud of jefferson county washington department of ecology,we recognized that congress had authorized enforcement of state standards,lest municipalities be immunized on the technicality that not all water standards can be expressed as effluent limitations.id.at.the overflows from the portland sewer system were caused primarily by uncontrollable,the amount of stormwater entering the system.id.at.because the total amount of water entering and leaving the sewer system was unknown,it was impossible to articulate effluent standards which would ensure that the gross amount of pollution discharged would not violate water quality standards.id.only by enforcing the standards themselves as the limits could the purpose of the cwa and the npdes system be effectuated.id.at.indeed,we noted that prior to the incorporation of effluent limitations,the clean water act depended entirely on enforcement based on standards.id.at.however,troubled by the almost total lack of enforcement under the old system,congress added the effluent limitation standards not to supplant the old system but to improve enforcement.id.at quoting,sess,reprinted in.
moreover,the plain language of the permit countenances enforcement of the standards when exceedances are detected by the various compliance mechanisms,including monitoring.first,the permit incorporates and adopts the basin plan,which sets the standards for bacteria and contaminants for the receiving waters of southern california,including the watershed rivers.the permit then sets out a monitoring program for those standards,the goals of which explicitly include a ssessing compliance with this order.compliance under the clean water act primarily means adhering to the terms and conditions of an npdes permit.epa,at thus,the principal means of enforcing the pollution control and abatement provisions of the amendments is to enforce compliance with a permit.the first monitoring program listed in the permit is mass emissions.while defendants are correct in noting that monitoring has as one of its goals estimat ing the mass emissions from the,defendants fail to mention that another goal,listed just below estimating,is d etermin ing if the is contributing to exceedances of water quality standards.
part.d of the permit,titled duty to comply,lays any doubts about municipal compliance to rest each permittee must comply with all terms,requirements,and conditions of this order.any violation of this order constitutes a violation of the clean water act and is grounds for enforcement action,order termination,order revocation and reissuance,denial of an application for reissuance or a combination thereof.this unequivocal language is unsurprising given that all npdes permits must include monitoring provisions ensuring that permit conditions are satisfied.see a a t he administrator of the epa shall require the owner or operator of any point source to i establish and maintain such records,ii make such reports,iii install,use,and maintain such monitoring equipment or methods including where appropriate,biological monitoring methods,and iv sample such effluents in accordance with such methods,at such locations,at such intervals,and in such manner as the administrator shall prescribe.i specifying the monitoring requirements for compliance,mass for each pollutant limited in the permit,and volume of effluent discharged ackels epa,cir t he act grants epa broad authority to require npdes permitees to monitor,at such intervals as the administrator shall prescribe,whenever it is required to carry out the objectives of the act.
our prior case law emphasizes that npdes permit enforcement is not permit term is simply enforced as written.see union oil,at it is unclear whether the court intended to excuse these violations under the upset defense or under a de minimis theory.in either event,the district court erred.the clean water act and the regulations promulgated under it make no provision for rare violations.see also united states cps chem,for enforcement purposes,a permittee discharge monitoring reports constitute admissions regarding the levels of effluents that the permittee has discharged.as we explained in union oil,congres
