colich construction,colich,a general contractor,submitted a bid for a public works contract to construct orange county water district ocwd groundwater replenishment system unit ii pipeline project the project.colich bid listed golden state boring and pipe jacking,gsb,as a subcontractor.after ocwd awarded the contract to colich,gsb persistently refused to sign the subcontract requiring it to obtain a performance bond as gsb gratuitously had offered to do in its successful bid for the subcontract.the impasse led colich to seek ocwd approval of its request to substitute gsb out of participation in the project.after an evidentiary hearing,ocwd authorized the substitution,finding under public contract code section,subdivision a that gsb unjustified intransigence constituted an unwillingness to execute a written subcontract for the scope of work specified in its.gsb petition for writ in mandamus proceedings code civ,was denied by the superior court.
on appeal,gsb argues colich had no right to insist on a performance bond because colich failed to make a statutory request for bond under section.we conclude the superior court did not err in rejecting gsb argument and finding the bond was a condition gsb imposed upon itself as part of the consideration for colich acceptance of its bid for the subcontract.
statutory background 
the subletting and subcontracting fair practices act,sections et the act,establishes a detailed mandatory framework for competitive bids on public works contracts.the act requires general contractors to identify in their bids all subcontractors who will perform work or labor or render service to the prime contractor in excess of of percent of the total bid of the prime contract,subd.a.the requirement emanates from the legislature finding that the practices of bid shopping and bid peddling in connection with the construction,alteration,and repair of public improvements often result in poor quality of material and workmanship to the detriment of the public,deprive the public of the full benefits of fair competition among prime contractors and subcontractors,and lead to insolvencies,loss of wages to employees,and other evils.
the act thus binds a contractor to its listed subcontractors,even though the parties have not yet entered into a contractual relationship.brady golden th,d.it confers a statutory right on the listed subcontractor to perform the specified work.land associates construction th,d.once a subcontractor has been designated,the prime contractor can not substitute another subcontractor unless the awarding authority consents and one of certain situations exists.valley crest landscape,city council th,d.
the circumstances justifying substitution are set forth in sections and.as relevant here,grounds for substitution exist w hen the subcontractor listed in the bid,after having had a reasonable opportunity to do so,fails or refuses to execute a written contract for the scope of work specified in the subcontractor bid,when that written contract,based upon the general terms,conditions,plans,and specifications for the project involved or the terms of that subcontractor written bid,is presented to the subcontractor by the prime contractor,subd.a.
when notified of the prime contractor request for substitution,the subcontractor may submit written objections to the awarding agency and obtain an administrative hearing,subd.a.thereafter,a subcontractor that believes an awarding authority has violated the act statutory mandate may be entitled to bring an administrative mandamus under code of civil procedure section.brady golden,supra,th at,fn,d.
the bid and the parties negotiations 
in august,ocwd issued a notice inviting bids for construction of a,dollar project designed to assist the district groundwater replenishment operations for recharging ocwd groundwater basin.bids were due by on october.colich,the bidding prime contractor,neither advertised for subcontract bids subbids nor issued any written invitations for bids.the parties agree colich informally requested bids for subcontracts.on the final day for bidding on the prime contract,just a few minutes before the deadline,gsb faxed to colich the low bid for subcontracting about million of tunneling and grout work.the proposal stated,inter alia,if bond is required,a fee of of the contract price will be added.colich promptly submitted its million prime bid,listing gsb as a subcontractor.
gsb unilateral offer to obtain bonding was to take center stage as the parties further negotiated the terms of the subcontract.for instance,when gsb twice faxed to colich revised proposals inserting terms omitted from the initial subbid,it reiterated its offer to provide a bond if required,and with the second fax transmission,gsb further memorialized the proposal under a formal heading labeled bonds,setting forth the matter in standardized format,as follows the cost of a bond premium is not included in the contract price.if desired by and paid by others,gsb will furnish a payment and performance bond at of the contract value.italics indicate blanks.thus,all of gsb subbid negotiations referred to the bonding offer.
ocwd awarded colich the prime contract,and in january,colich sent gsb a letter of intent advising gsb it had been selected and a subcontract would soon follow.thereafter,apparently concerned with gsb performance on another project,colich asked the subcontractor to sign a written statement of understanding agree ing to bare sic responsibility for your contractual obligations and the potential delays and damages caused by gsb.the statement of understanding recited that gsb agreed to reimburse colich for any delay costs or damages pertaining to the project,and warned that if gsb failed to do so,colich would diligently pursue contractor substitution on this basis.gsb executed the statement of understanding.
in,colich sent gsb the subcontract agreement containing,inter alia,a verbatim provision for the bonding as proposed by gsb in its subbid,to wit,if bond is required,a fee of of the contract price will be added.in early april,colich orally asked gsb to submit a bond on the project.in response,gsb president,jeffrey johnson,wrote we will make every effort to provide the requested bond.before a bond can be obtained,the bonding agent is requiring updated financial statements.gsb accountant is aware of the project and will complete the financials as soon as possible.colich construction has waited over months to request a bond.colich construction and colich sons have never asked for a bond in the last years the company owners have done business.per the proposal,the bond will be of the contract total.the amount to be made payable to gsb upon issuance of bond.if you have any further questions,please feel free to contact our office.
that letter was contradicted two days later by gsb attorney,who wrote of gsb position that colich had waived any right to demand a bond,to wit at this time i have been informed by gsb that your firm is requiring gsb to submit a performance and a payment bond on the subject matter contract,which requirement gsb contends,was just recently made after gsb had already provided submittals pursuant to your request.it is gsb position that it is not required to provide a bond on this project since colich failed to clearly specify the amount and requirement of the bond in its written published request for subbids on the subject matter project.pursuant to public contract codes section c,if your firm fails to make such demand,your firm is precluded from imposing any bond requirements upon gsb.
as discussed more fully,post,the statute to which gsb attorney alluded,section,subdivision c,precludes a prime contractor from imposing bond requirements where it has failed to specify bond requirements,in accordance with this subdivision,in the written or published request for subbids.here,it is undisputed colich never issued a written or published request for subbids.it simply considered subcontractors responses to an informal invitation for subbids and chose the lowest bid,which was submitted by gsb only minutes before colich deadline to submit its project bid to ocwd.
