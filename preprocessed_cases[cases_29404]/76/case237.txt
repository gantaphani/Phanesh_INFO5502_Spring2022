this appeal poses the issue of whether sovereign immunity bars individual landowners and water users collectively,the farmers of the westlands water district westlands from suing the united states for allegedly having violated a contract the united states entered into with westlands for the delivery of water.the district court originally concluded that sovereign immunity had been waived and proceeded to rule on the merits of the farmers claims.the court then changed its mind on reconsideration,ruling that sovereign immunity barred the farmers claims.we affirm that ruling.we agree with the district court that sovereign immunity deprived it of jurisdiction to hear the farmers claims.because the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain those claims,we vacate the district court rulings on the merits of those claims.
background 
this is another in a long line of cases involving the central valley project the cvp,the nation largest federal water management project.westlands receives water from the san luis unit of the cvp pursuant to a contract the contract with the united states the validity and enforceability of the contract was upheld in pursuant to a stipulated judgment in stipulated judgment,barcellos wolfsen,westlands water.no.cv barcellos,which resolved litigation that arose out of the government assertion in that the contract was invalid.the barcellos judgment required the government to perform the contract.
in,the sacramento river chinook salmon was listed as a threatened species under the endangered species act the esa.in,the delta smelt of the joaquin delta was also designated as a threatened species.the national marine fisheries service determined that both species were jeopardized by the continued operation of the cvp.in response,the bureau of reclamation the bureau reduced westlands allocation of cvp water for to fifty percent of its contractual supply.the bureau made this reduction pursuant to the esa,which required federal agencies to avoid jeopardizing threatened species,and pursuant to the central valley project improvement act the cvpia,which sought to protect the requirements of fish and wildlife in the use of cvp water.see generally united states,cir discussing the aforementioned events more thoroughly.
landowners and water users within the westlands district then brought suit in district court,claiming that the reduction violated the contract as upheld by barcellos.the district court held that article of the contract freed the government from liability for the reduction.barcellos wolfsen westlands water,barcellos iii.we affirmed,holding that article a of the contract unambiguously absolves the government from liability for its failure to deliver the full contractual amount of water where there is a shortage caused by statutory mandate,at.we noted,however,that the westlands members could challenge the merits of the bureau compliance with the esa and cvpia in a separate case.id.
westlands instituted the present action in may.the natural resources defense council nrdc and the farmers subsequently intervened.in,westlands dismissed its complaint without prejudice.the farmers remained as plaintiffs and filed a second amended complaint.
on june,the district court filed an order that wiped out most of the farmers claims.the court dismissed the statutory claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the tucker act,although it noted that the farmers may be able to bring those claims in the court of federal claims.the court rejected the farmers contention that the reclamation statutes constituted contracts and dismissed those claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
that left remaining the farmers claim that the reduction violated appropriative water rights the farmers claim that the reduction violated trust law the farmers claim that certain cvpia surcharges violated the contract and the constitution and the farmers claim that the reduction was in breach of the contract.with regard to the first two claims,the farmers asserted that the contract incorporated appropriative water rights and trust obligations.the farmers argued that all four of their remaining claims therefore arose under the contract,to which the government waiver of sovereign immunity under allegedly applied.the court agreed with the farmers that it had jurisdiction to consider these claims because the farmers were a contracting entity under.but the court ruled against the farmers on the merits of the first three claims,granting summary judgment for the government.the farmers managed to keep their case alive when the court ruled that they had raised triable issues of fact with regard to the fourth claim.
those issues would never be tried,however.on april,the court altered its ruling on sovereign immunity pursuant to a motion for reconsideration by the government.the court ruled that,in light of our decision in klamath water users protective ass patterson,cir,the farmers were only incidental,not intended,beneficiaries of the contract.as such,they were not a contracting entity under toward whom the government had waived sovereign immunity.finding no other basis for a waiver of sovereign immunity,the court entered final judgment for the government on august.
the farmers timely appealed.though it had previously dismissed its claims as a plaintiff,westlands returned to the litigation as an intervenor,out of concern that its rights could be affected.both westlands and the nrdc filed briefs in this appeal as intervenors.
ii.sovereign immunity bars the farmers suit 
the government argues that the farmers claims are barred by sovereign immunity.we review issues of sovereign immunity and subject matter jurisdiction de novo.clinton babbitt,cir.it is well settled that the united states is a sovereign,and,as such,is immune from suit unless it has expressly waived such immunity and consented to be sued.gilbert dagrossa,cir.we strictly construe in favor of the government the scope of any waiver of sovereign immunity.dep t of the army blue fox,d.any claim for which sovereign immunity has not been waived must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.gilbert,at.
as a preliminary matter,we reject the farmers claim that the government sovereign immunity defense is barred by issue and claim preclusion pursuant to the decision in barcellos wolfsen,westlands water.barcellos i.for issue preclusion to apply,the issues litigated must not be merely similar,but must be identical.central delta water agency united states,cir citation omitted.in barcellos i,the district court rejected the government sovereign immunity defense on two alternate grounds.the first ground was that the ultra vires exception to sovereign immunity applied because the government had allegedly committed an ultra vires agency action.barcellos i.at.the second ground was that sovereign immunity had been waived pursuant to the mccarran amendment,because the relief sought fell under that amendment,at.
neither ground applies in this case.the farmers do not allege that the government committed an ultra vires agency action.nor does the mccarran amendment apply.this is a private lawsuit for damages between the farmers and the government,which is not the type of suit contemplated by the mccarran amendment 
the mccarran amendment provides that the united states is deemed to have waived its immunity in any suit for the adjudication of rights to the use of water of a river system or other source a,or for the administration of such rights a.the mccarran amendment,however,does not authorize private suits to decide priorities between the united states and particular claimants,only suits to adjudicate the rights of all claimants on a stream.dugan rank,d citation omitted.
metro.water dist.of cal.united states,cir,aff by california united states,d per curiam see also united states dist.court in for water div,d the mccarran amendment does not cover consent by the united states to be sued in a private suit to determine its rights against a few claimants.this is not a suit to adjudicate or administer the rights of all claimants on a stream 
we note that the farmers did not even plead jurisdiction under the mccarran amendment in their second amended complaint they pleaded only under.
because the issue in barcellos i is not identical to the issue presented in this case,the government is not issue precluded from claiming sovereign immunity.nor does claim preclusion apply.one requirement of claim preclusion is that the prior litigation involved the same claim or cause of action as the later suit.central delta water agency,at.in evaluating this requirement,the most important consideration is whether the two suits arise out of the same transactional nucleus of facts.id.citation omitted.w hen considering whether a prior action involved the same nucleus of facts for preclusion purposes,we must narrowly construe the scope of that earlier action.id.at.as explained above,the facts the district court relied on to find a waiver of sovereign immunity in barcellos i do not apply here.additionally,this action arises out of the government allocation of cvp water for based on designations of threatened species that occurred long after barcellos i had been decided.as such,the nucleus of facts underlying this action differs from the nucleus of facts underlying barcellos 
the farmers suit may nevertheless proceed in district court if the waiver of sovereign immunity applies.section provides in its entirety 
consent is given to join the united states as a necessary party defendant in any suit to adjudicate,confirm,validate,or decree the contractual rights of a contracting entity and the united states regarding any contract executed pursuant to federal reclamation law.the united states,when a party to any suit,shall be deemed to have waived any right to plead that it is not amenable thereto by reason of its sovereignty,and shall be subject to judgments,orders and decrees of the court having jurisdiction,and may obtain review thereof,in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.any suit pursuant to this section may be brought in any united states district court in the state in which the land involved is situated.
emphasis added.the farmers assert that they are intended beneficiaries of the contract and therefore a contracting entity under.our holding in klamath compels us to reject this argument.
the plaintiffs in klamath were irrigators in the klamath basin.the california oregon power company copco and its successor in interest,pacificorp,operated a dam the dam in the klamath basin pursuant to a contract with the united states.klamath,at.it was undisputed that the dam was built to help the united states satisfy its contractual obligations to water users in the basin,including the irrigators.id.copco interest related primarily to controlling the flow of water to the hydroelectric facilities downstream from the dam.id.
just as the contract is subject to the requirements of statutes such as the esa and the cvpia,see,at,operation of the dam in klamath was also subject to the requirements of such statutes,see klamath,at.in,the bureau of reclamation issued an interim operating plan for the dam in response to the designation of certain fish species in the klamath river and klamath basin as threatened or endangered,and in consideration of the rights of certain indian tribes.id.at.the bureau and pacificorp modified the contract to implement the interim plan,but did not include the irrigators in the negotiations leading to the modification.id.at.the irrigators sued for breach of the contract based on their alleged status as beneficiaries.id.
we began our analysis by observing that,b efore a third party can recover under a contract,it must show that the contract was made for its direct it is an intended beneficiary of the contract.id.while the intended beneficiary need not be specifically or individually identified in the contract,it must still fall within a class clearly intended by the parties to benefit from the contract.id.at.we presumed the irrigators to be incidental,rather than intended,beneficiaries of the contract unless the contract evinced a clear intent to the contrary 
parties that benefit from a government contract are generally assumed to be incidental beneficiaries,and may not enforce the contract absent a clear intent to the contrary.government contracts often benefit the public,but individual members of the public are treated as incidental beneficiaries unless a different intention is manifested.
id.emphasis added internal citations and quotation marks omitted.we concluded after examining the plain language of the contract that the irrigators were not intended beneficiaries the plain language of the contract is sufficient to rebut the contention that the irrigators are intended beneficiaries.neither article nor article illustrates an intention of copco or the united states to grant the irrigators enforceable rights.id.
like the irrigators in klamath,the farmers in our case fail to satisfy the clear intent standard required to establish intended beneficiary status.the farmers rely on articles and b of the contract.to be sure,these provisions do make reference to third party water users,but neither provision evinces a clear intent to make the farmers intended beneficiaries.though the opinion in klamath did state that an explicit reference to a third party was not a necessary condition to finding that party to be an intended beneficiary,it in no way implied that an explicit reference was a sufficient condition to finding that party to be an intended beneficiary.
article reads in pertinent part 
should any assessment or assessments required by the terms of this contract and levied by the district against any tract of land or water user in the district and necessary to meet the obligations of the district hereunder be judicially determined to be irregular or void,then such tract shall have no right to any water furnished to the district pursuant to this contract,and no water made available by the united states pursuant thereto shall be furnished for the benefit of any such lands or water users,except upon the payment by the landowner of his assessment or a toll charge for such water,notwithstanding the existence of any contract between the district and the owner or owners of such tract.contracts,if any,between the district and the water users involving water furnished pursuant to this contract shall provide that such use shall be subject to the terms of this contract.it is further agreed that the payment of charges at the rate and upon the terms and conditions provided for herein is a prerequisite to the right to the use of water furnished to the district pursuant to this contract,and no irregularity in levying taxes or assessments by the district nor lack of authority in the district,whether affecting the validity of district taxes or assessment or not,shall be held to authorize or permit any water user of the district to demand water made available pursuant to this contract unless charges at the rate and upon the terms and conditions provided for herein have been paid by such water user.
we agree with the district court that r ather than manifesting an intent to create enforcement rights in individual water users,article focuses on the absolute requirement that users first pay assessments and charges to the districts to obtain water.it is only the district,not the water users,that has directly enforceable rights to obtain water from the government under the contract.mem.op.order re federal defs.mot.to,orff united states,at.
article references to third party water users do not establish that the farmers possess enforceable rights against the government.article states that contracts,if any,between the district and the water users involving water furnished pursuant to this contract shall provide that such use shall be subject to the terms of this contract.emphasis added this sentence,however,in no way delineates a contractual relationship between the farmers and the government.it only describes a potential contractual relationship between westlands and the farmers.article also provides that no irregularity in levying taxes or assessments shall be held to authorize or permit any water user of the district to demand water made available pursuant to this contract unless charges at the rate and upon the terms and conditions provided for herein have been paid for by such water user.this only seems to reinforce the view that the farmers must satisfy certain conditions precedent before obtaining water from westlands whatever rights the farmers accordingly have under article are against westlands,not the government.indeed,article similarly states that the payment of charges at the rate and upon the terms and conditions provided for herein is a prerequisite to the right to the use of water furnished to the district.emphasis added.article,while defining in part the farmers rights to water as provided by westlands,does not demonstrate an intention to grant the farmers enforceable rights against the government.
the farmers reliance on article b is similarly unavailing.article b provides in full 
in the event that in any year there is delivered to the district by reason of any shortage or apportionment as provided in subdivision a of this article or any discontinuance or reduction of service as set forth in subdivision d of article hereof,less than the quantity of water which the district otherwise would be entitled to receive,there shall be made an adjustment on account of the amounts paid to the united states by the district for water for said year in a manner similar to that provided for in article.to the extent of such deficiency,such adjustment shall constitute the sole remedy of the district or anyone having or claiming to have by,through,or under the district the right to the use of any of the water supply provided for herein.
the farmers claim that the anyone referenced by article b includes them.article b does indicate that individuals that have a right by,through,or under westlands to the water provided by the government have an adjustment remedy against the government where a shortage of water or discontinuation or reduction in service occurs.that said,article b explicitly states that the adjustment remedy is a reduction on account of the amounts paid to the united states by westlands pursuant to other provisions in the contract.because only westlands under the contract has direct contractual privity with the government and is obligated to pay it money,the contested language of article b can only sensibly refer to individuals or entities to whom westlands has contractually assigned its rights and duties under the contract and who are now in contractual privity with the government.it can not establish the inconsistent proposition that these same individuals or entities are intended third party beneficiaries of the contract 
article and article b merely show that the contract operates to the farmers benefit and was entered into with the farmers in mind.that by itself is not enough under klamath to confer intended beneficiary status on the farmers.see klamath,at although the contract operates to the irrigators benefit by impounding irrigation water,and was undoubtedly entered into with the irrigators in mind,to allow them intended third party beneficiary status would open the door to all users receiving a benefit from the project achieving similar status,a result not intended by the contract.see also id.t he recitation of constituencies whose interest bear on a government contract does not grant these incidental beneficiaries enforceable rights.because the contract does not illustrate an intention of westlands or the united states to grant the farmers enforceable rights,id.at,the farmers do not qualify for the waiver of sovereign immunity as intended beneficiaries 
nor do the farmers qualify for the waiver under recordable contracts between them and the government.pursuant to the contract,the farmers entered into recordable contracts with the government in the late and early regarding the sale of,and the farmers rights to receive water for,excess lands.excess lands were lands owned by water users that exceeded the maximum acreage permitted to receive cvp water under federal reclamation law.the recordable contracts subjected the right to receive water for excess lands to the provisions of both the contract and each recordable contract.the recordable contracts also required the sale of excess lands within a period and set forth an appraisal procedure to determine sale prices.
the farmers allege that each recordable contract fully incorporates the contract,thereby entitling them to sue the government under as contracting entities of the recordable contracts.we disagree.far from fully incorporating the contract,article of the recordable contracts simply subjects the farmers rights to receive cvp water to the provisions of the contract and of the recordable contract each recordable contract directly incorporates only articles,and of the contract,which relate to the provision of water to,and the valuation and sale of,excess lands.yet the farmers are not attempting to enforce any of those provisions,or any other provision of the recordable contracts,in this lawsuit.instead,they are suing for an alleged breach of the contract.the fact that the farmers are contracting entities to recordable contracts that reference the contract does not make the farmers intended beneficiaries of the contract or otherwise give them a right to enforce that contract.
the barcellos judgment does not qualify the farmers for the waiver of sovereign immunity,either.paragraph of that judgment expressly provides that the judgment shall not be considered a contract or an amendment for purposes of neither this judgment nor the stipulation for compromise settlement is a contract or an amendment to a contract with the united states as described in section a of the act.thus,even though the farmers may be parties to the barcellos judgment,that does not qualify them as a contracting entity for purposes of 
finally,we reject the farmers attempt to sue as trust beneficiaries.the farmers contend that westlands acts as a trustee for them and that,because westlands has failed to pursue a claim against the government,they may step into the trustee shoes to sue.we disagree.even if westlands does act as a trustee for the landowners an issue we do not decide,the farmers,as beneficiaries,have not met the requirements for suing in westlands shoes.
t he beneficiary of a trust generally is not the real party in interest and may not sue in the name of the trust.saks damon raike,th,d.there is an exception to this rule,however.w here a trustee can not or will not enforce a valid cause of action that the trustee ought to bring against a third person,a trust beneficiary may seek judicial compulsion against the trustee.in order to prevent loss of or prejudice to a claim,the beneficiary may bring an action in equity joining the third person and the trustee.the beneficiary may also sue third persons who directly participated with the trustee in breaches of trust.id.at internal citations omitted.the farmers have neither sought judicial compulsion against westlands,nor alleged that the government directly participated with westlands in any breach of trust.they have therefore failed to establish that they may sue in the shoes of westlands.
in sum,the district court properly dismissed the farmers claims for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that they were barred by sovereign immunity.the farmers do not qualify for the waiver of sovereign immunity under the mccarran amendment because the mccarran amendment does not apply to this suit for money damages.nor do the farmers qualify for the waiver of sovereign immunity under.the farmers are not intended beneficiaries of the contract under klamath,and neither the recordable contracts nor the barcellos stipulated judgment makes them a contracting entity under.finally,the farmers have not met the requirements for suing in the shoes of westlands as beneficiaries.
iii.the district court rulings on the merits must be vacated 
the very purpose of the sovereign immunity doctrine is to prevent a judicial examination of the merits of the government position.wildman united states,cir.because the government never waived its immunity from suit,the district court never had jurisdiction to issue its r
