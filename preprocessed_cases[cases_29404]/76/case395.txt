background 
a.the delta watershed 
the swrcb describes the delta watershed as the largest watershed in california t he sacramento river and the san joaquin rivers sic flow into the delta.the outflow from the delta flows into suisun bay and then into san francisco bay.t he availability of water throughout the delta watershed is generally affected by the demand for water of suitable quality within the delta and suisun marsh.without adequate freshwater outflow from the delta into suisun bay,seawater intrudes into the delta and degrades water quality.high salinity and low delta outflows can be harmful to agricultural production,municipal and industrial uses of water,and to various species of fish and wildlife throughout the estuary.in re water right permits in the joaquin delta watershed state water resources control bd.at decision.
under authority granted in sections and,the swrcb included standard water right permit term term in over permits for diversion within the delta watershed as originally drafted,term read the state water resources control board reserves jurisdiction over this permit for the purpose of conforming the season of diversion to later findings of the board on prior applications involving water in the sacramento river basin and delta.action by the board will be taken only after notice to interested parties and opportunity for hearing.decision at.
the central valley project cvp operated by the bureau of reclamation usbr and the state water project swp operated by the real party in interest dwr substantially alter flows within the delta watershed the projects store winter and spring runoff and then release and transport it to satisfy demands within the sacramento river basin,san joaquin basin,tulare basin,san francisco bay area communities and southern california communities.decision at.
in,the swrcb required the usbr and dwr to meet specified water quality standards in the delta and suisun marsh the effect of the standards was to require the projects to release water from storage or to curtail diversions when the flow entering the delta would otherwise be insufficient to meet the water quality standards.decision at,citing in re permit application and other permits of united states bureau of reclamation,state water resources control bd.at decision.up to that date,the board had made no general effort to regulate water users season of diversion on a basis.permits were issued for a fixed season of diversion with the understanding that water might not always be available to a later permittee after satisfying the rights of riparians and earlier appropriators.decision at.
water right permit term 
after the swrcb adopted decision,the usbr and the dwr protested numerous water right applications within the delta watershed.the protests were based on claims by the usbr and the dwr that diversion by new applicants at certain times would force the projects to release more stored water to meet the delta water quality standards established by decision.as an interim solution to the problem,the board adopted standard water right permit term term on march,thereby allowing the swrcb to process new water right applications pending development of a method for determining when water was available for appropriation id.at.after,the swrcb included term in nearly all water right permits and licenses issued as an original permit term or through amendment.id.at,state water resources control bd.order wr order wr.
term provides 
no diversion is authorized by this permit when satisfaction of inbasin entitlements requires release of supplemental project water by the central valley project or the state water project.
inbasin entitlements are defined as rights to divert water from streams tributary to the joaquin delta or the delta for use within the respective basins of origin or the legal delta,unavoidable natural requirements for riparian habitat and conveyance losses,and flows required by the board for maintenance of water quality and fish and wildlife.export diversions and project carriage water are specifically excluded from the definition of inbasin entitlements.
supplemental project water is defined as water imported to the basin by the projects,and water released from project storage,which is in excess of export diversions,project carriage water,and project inbasin deliveries.
the board shall notify the permittee of curtailment of diversion under this term after it finds that supplemental project water has been released or will be released.the board will advise the permittee of the probability of imminent curtailment of diversion as far in advance as practicable based on anticipated requirements for supplemental project water provided by the project operators.order wr at.
in,the swrcb approved the method of calculation and implementation of term set forth in state water resources control board order wr order wr.order wr at,order wr at.it found that in view of the small quantity of water involved,it was inefficient to establish regulation of hundreds of parties diverting small quantities of water.decision at.accordingly,the swrcb applied the term method of calculating water availability only to those term permits which authorize d direct diversion at a rate of cfs or more or which authorize d diversion to storage of af per year or more.order wr at.
notice to plaintiffs 
pursuant to decision and order wr,the swrcb included term in the four water right permits issued to plaintiffs in.thereafter,the swrcb issued licenses to the two phelpses and ratto,and conn.each water right license included term.none of the plaintiffs challenged the swrcb inclusion of term in his permit or license.
on june,the swrcb sent plaintiffs a document entitled notice of curtailment of water diversion during.the first paragraph read 
your permit or license for the appropriative water right identified by the application number on the mailing label above,contains a term standard term that prohibits diversion of water when satisfaction of inbasin entitlements requires release of stored water supplemental project water by the central valley project of the state water project.you are hereby notified that the state water resources control board has determined that supplemental project water is being released in the joaquin delta watershed.italics added.
the second paragraph stated in large,bold type 
you must immediately discontinue water diversion under the specified appropriative water right from the date of receipt of this notice through august,unless notified earlier.
the notice also explained that failure to comply with the notice of curtailment could result in imposition of administrative civil liability,including monetary penalties not to exceed per day 
the swrcb sent plaintiffs a second set of curtailment notices on june.the notices directed plaintiffs to immediately discontinue water diversion through august.at no time did plaintiffs challenge the and notices of curtailment.
on july,the chief of the swrcb division of water rights division sent plaintiffs separate administrative civil liability complaints pursuant to section the complaints charged plaintiffs with the unauthorized diversion of water during the and term curtailment periods.the chief proposed civil liability in the following amounts phelps out of a potential maximum of ratto out of a potential maximum of and conn and ron silva out of a potential maximum of.on plaintiffs request,the swrcb set a public hearing on january,on the complaints for civil liability.after hearing,the swrcb issued order no.wro on february,imposing civil penalties of against the phelpses,against ratto,and against.

plaintiffs challenges to term are 
plaintiffs challenge the swrcb imposition of term diversion restrictions on grounds that 
the swrcb abused its discretion by imposing the restrictions without determining that the restrictions would achieve the purpose for which they were imposed,that is,without making adequate water quality findings 
the swrcb implementation of the diversion restrictions deprived plaintiffs of their rights under the watershed protection act 
the swrcb implementation of the diversion restrictions deprived plaintiffs of their rights under the delta protection act dpa 
the swrcb implementation of the diversion restrictions deprived plaintiffs of their first in time,first in right seniority over project water rights and 
the swrcb based implementation of the diversion restrictions on wrongfully substituted delta outflow standards.capitalization omitted.
we conclude plaintiffs failure to challenge imposition of term on these grounds within the time period set forth in section,subdivision b bars judicial review of the issues.
section,subdivision b provides any party aggrieved by any decision or order may,not later than days from the date of final action by the board,file a petition for a writ of mandate for review of the decision or order.except in cases where the decision or order is issued under authority delegated to an officer or employee of the board,reconsideration before the board is not an administrative remedy that is required to be exhausted before filing a petition for writ of mandate.subdivision d bars judicial review of the swrcb decision or order i f no aggrieved party petitions for a writ of mandate within the time provided by this section 
the court applied section,subdivision b in north gualala water state water resources control board th,d,a challenge to the swrcb jurisdiction to compel the company to obtain a permit to pump ground water.id.at,d.the court held that the company waived its challenge to the swrcb interpretation of a term contained in its existing permit by failing to raise the issue within days of the swrcb issuance of orders premised on the disputed interpretation.id.at,d.the court explained that the company could not,consistent with section,manifest its acceptance of the conditions placed on the new permit and then wait until nearly two years later to challenge the premise on which they were based.id.at,d see also county of imperial mcdougal cal d,challenge barred if landowner has acquiesced therein by either specifically agreeing to the challenged condition or failing to challenge its validity,and accepted the benefits afforded by the permit.
in this case,plaintiffs had four opportunities to challenge the swrcb decision to include term in their permits and licenses before the swrcb imposed civil penalties in.first,plaintiffs could have raised the arguments when the swrcb included term in the permits issued in pursuant to decision and order wr.second,plaintiffs could have raised these arguments when the swrcb included term in the licenses it issued to plaintiffs between and.third,plaintiffs could have challenged the notices of curtailment of water diversion they received in june.fourth,they could have challenged the notices of curtailment of water diversion they received in july.plaintiffs raised these issues for the first time at the hearing on the swrcb complaints for administrative civil liability which resulted in order wro.
on appeal,plaintiffs repeat the arguments made in the trial court that they were not required to comply with section,subdivision b at any time before the swrcb served the complaints against them for administrative civil liability.there is no merit in plaintiffs arguments.
challenge to issuance of permits and licenses 
plaintiffs characterize their arguments as as applied rather than facial challenges to implementation of term.plaintiffs maintain that their challenges to the swrcb action were not ripe for review until the chief of the division of water rights division exercised his discretion to interpret and apply term to them during the summers of and.citing evidence code section they also contend that it was the swrcb burden to demonstrate that notwithstanding the authority,discretion,afforded by wr,on its face,term nevertheless inevitably pose s a present total and fatal conflict with the watershed protection statute,delta protection act and rule of priority and that there is no future hypothetical situation under which term could be applied consistent with those laws.we are not persuaded by plaintiffs attempt to circumvent the section time bar by creating a false distinction between a facial and as applied challenge to term.
at the hearing on plaintiffs petition for writ of mandate,the parties acknowledged that the existence of the claimed distinction between a facial and as applied challenge to term turned on the scope of discretion granted to the chief of the division under order wr.findings,and of order wr delegated the following aspects of term implementation to the chief of the division 
in order to allow for timely implementation under term,authority to review technical data,determine compliance with the conditions in finding herein whether supplemental water and other conditions exist,decide whether to implement term,and notify appropriators of the begining sic and ending of diversion restrictions will be delegated to the chief,division of water rights.
as experience with the operation of term is gained,additional exceptions to the use of the term in permits and licenses may be indicated.the chief,division of water rights will be granted authority to institute such exceptions after providing opportunity for swrcb comment.
experience may also indicate that there are short periods of time when it would be impractical to implement the diversion restrictions in term in spite of compliance with the conditions set forth in finding herein.the delegation of authority to the chief,division of water rights will include authority to determine such situations.
the court requested supplemental declarations that put forth with more clarity how the term formula is actually used and how the discretion,if any,aside from additional exceptions,aside from this short time frame neither of which were applicable or relevant to this particular lawsuit,how it is used.is there any judgment involved in the determination of carriage water or is that just addition of these eighteen variables that are put forth in the reports 
the swrcb submitted the declaration of john,a supervising water resource control engineer with the division which described how the division used mathematical formulas to determine whether the term criteria were satisfied.in opinion,the chief exercised no discretion in the calculation of the carriage water value or the supplemental project water value.plaintiffs offered no evidence to contradict declaration.
the trial court found that order wr and decision provided detailed formulas,specific definitions and precise directions for the chief of the board division of water rights to use in calculating when the conditions for implementing diversions under term have been triggered,in deciding whether to implement term,and in notifying term permittees and licensees about the beginning and end of diversion curtailments.order wr and decision left virtually no issue regarding term language,policy objectives or methods of calculation to the discretion of the chief in implementing term curtailments in individuals cases.
based on our independent review,we conclude that order wr and decision can not,in this case,be read to grant the chief of the division broad discretion in the implementation of term.the discretionary language in paragraphs and of order wr refers to situations inapplicable to plaintiffs.we also conclude that the record supports the trial court factual findings regarding the manner in which the chief implemented paragraph by utilizing the formulas set forth in order wr and decision 
we also reject plaintiffs argument that their claims were not ripe for review when the swrcb issued the permits and licenses which contained term.the ripeness requirement,a branch of the doctrine of justiciability,prevents courts from issuing purely advisory opinions.citation.it is rooted in the fundamental concept that the proper role of the judiciary does not extend to the resolution of abstract differences of legal opinion t he ripeness doctrine is primarily bottomed on the recognition that judicial decisionmaking is best conducted in the context of an actual set of facts so that the issues will be framed with sufficient definiteness to enable the court to make a decree finally disposing of the controversy.pacific legal foundation california coastal com.cal d.
consistent with the ripeness doctrine,section,subdivision b applies to a ny party aggrieved by any decision or order italics added.in other words,where an agency applies regulations to a party injury,a sufficient controversy exists to satisfy the ripeness requirement.coral construction,city and county of san francisco th,d specific application of the challenged ordinance to a bid submitted by construction company was sufficient injury.here,plaintiffs were aggrieved by the inclusion of term in their permits and licenses because it gave the swrcb the authority to order curtailment of water diversions for additional periods based on assessment of water availability.
challenge to issuance of curtailment notices 
plaintiffs contend they were not required to raise their challenge to the implementation of term at the time the curtailment notices were issued because the notices were merely notices of potential future violations.citing western surgical supply affleck d,western surgical,they argue that mere notice of violation does not constitute an agency enforcement of an order giving rise to a mandate proceeding.plaintiffs assert,it was not until approximately a year to two years subsequent to these notices that plaintiffs were for the first time put on notice of,and charged with,an actual violation of term.
plaintiffs lack of notice argument ignores the unequivocal language of the curtailment notices which informed plaintiffs that they must immediately discontinue water diversion under the specified appropriative water right from the date of receipt of this notice through august,unless notified earlier.we conclude plaintiffs were clearly aggrieved by the curtailment notice within the meaning of section,subdivision b because it required plaintiffs to immediately discontinue diversion of water under their licenses.implementation of term was ripe for challenge upon plaintiffs receipt of the curtailment notices in june.
plaintiffs reliance on western surgical is misplaced.in that case,a wholesale distributor of drugs and medical supplies filed a petition for writ of mandate to restrain the state board of pharmacy from enforcing certain regulations and orders at a time when misdemeanor criminal complaints were pending in connection with the same violations.however,the board of pharmacy had taken no action to enforce the administrative notices of violations.western surgical,supra,d at.the court denied the petition on grounds there was nothing to review id.at,and a determination as to the validity of the statutes involved would amount to an unwarranted interference with the criminal proceedings now pending in the municipal courts.id.at.here,there were no pending proceedings,criminal or otherwise,to delay enforcement of term upon notice of curtailment.
next,we reject plaintiffs claim that code of civil procedure section is inapplicable to judicial review of the curtailment notices because section authorizes,but does not mandate,the swrcb to hold a hearing on a petition for reconsideration of swrcb action.section,subdivision c states that,s ection of the code of civil procedure shall govern judicial proceedings under this section.italics added.this language read in conjunction with section,subdivision a it is the intent of the legislature that all issues relating to state water law decided by the board be reviewed in state courts,indicates the legislature intent that section govern judicial review of all cases relating to state water law.nothing in subdivision b of section limits the type of proceeding subject to judicial review.we therefore conclude that judicial review is not limited to proceedings in which by law a hearing is required,subd.a.
plaintiffs offer no support for their argument that the curtailment notices do not constitute a final action by the swrcb and therefore are not subject to judicial review.as we stated,the notices are unequivocal in directing plaintiffs to immediately stop diverting water pursuant to term.section,subdivision b provides judicial review for a ny party aggrieved by any decision or order italics added.plaintiffs exhaustion of remedies argument is irrelevant because the swrcb does not challenge plaintiffs petition on that ground.
finally,plaintiffs argue that even if their challenges to implementation of term are barred under section,subdivision b,the issues are ripe for declaratory relief.section,subdivision d states that failure to file a timely writ of mandate means that the challenged order is not subject to review by any court.where,as here,the legislature has designated a remedy by which to review an administrative action,declaratory relief is unavailable.county of los angeles state water resources control bd.th,d.
c.the merits of plaintiffs term claims 
having concluded plaintiffs challenges to term are,we also explain why there is no merit in plaintiffs substantive claims as a matter of law.
water quality findings 
plaintiffs argue that before imposing the term curtailments,the swrcb was required to make an express finding that plaintiffs diversions would cause the projects to release storage water to offset the impact of plaintiffs diversions on water quality in the delta.plaintiffs also maintain that imposition of term was not warranted because reclamation and farming of plaintiffs lands by plaintiffs and their predecessors actually resulted in substantial water savings to the projects.
before the adoption of term,as an interim measure in,the swrcb did not attempt to regulate permittees season of diversion on a basis.as late as,it simply excluded the months of july and august from the season of diversion in all term permits.in some areas,the board excluded additional periods of time where necessary for protection of local prior rights,fish flow requirements and other restrictions imposed by adjudication.decision at.there is no indication the swrcb conditioned imposition of this curtailment on whether diversion by a particular permittee might impact local prior rights,fish flow requirements and other restrictions ibid.
in decision,the swrcb concluded that it was appropriate for term permittees to share responsibility with the projects in meeting all delta water quality standards whether based on protection of agricultural uses,municipal and industrial uses,or fish and wildlife and other public interest requirements.decision at.it also found that d ue to the wide variation in water availability from year to year,a procedure such as that provided by term allow ed for more efficient utilization of water supplies when they were available and better protection of prior rights when water supplies were scarce.id.at.balancing the need for efficient administration with the policy of shared responsibility,the swrcb found that it was inefficient to establish regulation of hundreds of parties diverting small quantities of water and applied the term method of determining water availability only to those term permits which authorize d direct diversion at a rate of cfs or more or which authorize d diversion to storage of af per year or more.decision at.nothing in decision or order wr suggests the swrcb intended to condition imposition of term on the possible impact of a particular permittee or licensee diversion on water quality during the curtailment period.indeed,such a procedure appears contrary to calculation of available water.in any event,we will not read a causation requirement into the term narrative formula or mathematical equations in the absence of a showing that the swrcb so intended.
rights under the watershed protection act wpa 
plaintiffs argue that term deprived them of their right to use water from their own watershed,that is,the delta,in violation of section.they also assert that they were not required to pay the projects for water in order to exercise their rights under the wpa.plaintiffs arguments conflict with principles of water rights law.
at the same time that the legislature established the cvp in,it enacted a provision which later became known as the watershed protection act.el dorado irrigation dist.state water resources control bd.th,d el dorado united states state water resources control bd.d.section provides in the construction and operation by the department of any project under the provisions of this part a watershed or area wherein water originates,or an area immediately adjacent thereto which can conveniently be supplied with water therefrom,shall not be deprived by the department directly or indirectly of the prior right to all of the water reasonably required to adequately supply the beneficial needs of the watershed,area,or any of the inhabitants or property owners therein.section applies to the operation of the swp by the dwr and the operation of the cvp by the usbr.united states state water resources control,supra,at.see also el dorado,supra,at,d swrcb cases,supra,th at,d.
order wro,the swrcb decision at issue here,described the impact of term on water right permittees and licensees when the projects store and release water.term is based on the assumption that the water rights of the dwr and the usbr to appropriate uncontrolled flows for export from the southern delta are junior to all other water rights in the watershed.the water stored upstream by the dwr and the usbr during periods of excess flow,however,is appropriated at times when its appropriation does not injure any other water right holders.when this water is subsequently released from the reservoirs to flow downstream to the export facilities,it is already appropriated,and is not naturally present in the rivers.water that is appropriated and is flowing in a channel under the control of its appropriator is not subject to appropriation by others.citation.accordingly,the stored water transported through the rivers to the export pumps by the projects is not available for others to appropriate.it also is not available to riparian right holders,since it is not natural flow.italics added.
we affirmed this reading of the wpa in el dorado,supra,th at page,d,which involved a challenge to the swrcb inclusion of term in the irrigation district permit to appropriate water from the south fork of the american river.we explained that although the irrigation district may be entitled to assert a priority under section over the usbr and the dwr to the diversion of water originating in the watershed of the south fork of the american river,that priority does not extend to water the projects have properly diverted to storage at an earlier date.if the irrigation district wants water properly stored by the projects,it must pay for it.id.at,d.although we affirmed the trial court judgment against the swrcb on the ground that its inclusion of term in the irrigation district permit violated the rule of priority,we expressly held that the area of origin statutes did not justify the trial court decision to invalidate the inclusion of term in the permit.ibid.
the swrcb interpretation of the impact of term on diversion of already appropriated water is consistent with section,which provides that t he provisions of the wpa shall not be so construed as to create any new property rights other than against the department as provided in this part or to require the department to furnish to any person without adequate compensation therefor any water made available by the construction of any works by the department.italics added.
plaintiffs maintain that under the wpa,the swrcb should not authorize term diversion curtailments when project activity is responsible for degrading water quality.plaintiffs contend that the swrcb should authorize diversion curtailments only where plaintiffs diversions affect water quality.they argue that t o the extent the delta water quality standards would still be impaired even if the projects halted all of their operations and removed all constructed works which impair those standards,then the board would next have to quantify how much impairment of those standards is caused by plaintiffs diversions made during those curtailment periods.once the foregoing was quantified,the board would then have to quantify how much stored water the projects must release to offset plaintiffs impairment of those standards.this court already rejected this claim in the context of stored water releases from new melones reservoir for the purpose of meeting downstream water quality objectives 
section is not concerned with why a particular beneficial need for water exists within the area of origin.for example,it does not matter why there is excess salinity at vernalis or why there is reduced outflow from the delta.what matters is that these conditions exist,they have adverse impacts on beneficial uses of water in the delta,and releases from new melones can be used to mitigate those impacts.to the extent water from new melones is being used for those purposes,it is being used to supply the beneficial needs of the area of origin,and the san joaquin county parties can not assert any priority to that water under section for their consumptive use of the water.even if more new melones water might be available for consumptive use by the san joaquin county parties if the usbr found other ways to mitigate the adverse impacts of exports on the delta,that does not mean the usbr is violating section by using new melones water to mitigate those impacts.swrcb cases,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.
based on the foregoing authority,we conclude that the wpa does not bar enforcement of term against plaintiffs.
rights under the delta protection act 
plaintiffs argue that implementation of term deprived them of their rights under the delta protection act dpa to divert delta water.they maintain that the projects have a statutory duty under section to provide for salinity control and an adequate water supply in the delta without compensation by plaintiffs.contrary to plaintiffs argument,nothing in the language of the dpa gives plaintiffs a new right to divert water in the delta or entitlement to project water without paying for it.
sections through are commonly known as the delta protection act.swrcb cases,supra,th at,d.section sets forth the legislature dual goals in maintaining an adequate water supply in the delta sufficient to maintain and expand agriculture,industry,urban,and recreational development in the delta and a common source of fresh water for export to areas of water deficiency is necessary to the peace,health,safety and welfare of the people of the state.swrcb cases.supra,at,d.the dpa gives preference to the first goal of salinity control by providing that no one may divert water from the delta that is necessary for salinity control or to provide an adequate water supply for users within the delta.id.at,d see.
the swrcb explained in the challenged order wro that n o provision in the delta protection act accords a water right to users of water in the delta plaintiffs must have adequate existing water rights,acquired under the laws that govern acquisition of water rights,before they can divert and use water from the channels of the delta.if existing water rights are not adequate to supply the needs of water users,the delta protection act does not ensure the delta water users an adequate supply.the water users can,however,make arrangements with the dwr and pay adequate compensation to the dwr for the water,pursuant to water code section.order wro at.the swrcb continued stored water that dwr releases into the delta when term is in effect water made available by the construction of dwr oroville reservoir.accordingly,if the delta water users adequately compensate dwr,they can take water attributable to dwr storage releases from the delta when term is in effect.id.at,italics added.
we begin by rejecting plaintiffs argument that the projects are under a statutory mandate to provide them with delta water without compensation.section reads in relevant part among the functions to be provided by the state water resources development system,in coordination with the activities of the united states in providing salinity control for the delta through operation of the federal central valley project,shall be the provision of salinity control and an adequate water supply for the users of water in the joaquin delta.if it is determined to be in the public interest to provide a substitute water supply to the users in said delta in lieu of that which would be provided as a result of salinity control no added financial burden shall be placed upon said delta water users solely by virtue of such substitution.italics added.read in its entirety,providing salinity control and an adequate water supply are among the functions of the swp under section.there is nothing in the language of the dpa to require the swp to serve all the functions in any given situation.we recognized in the swrcb cases that the dpa serves dual goals and must,in the first instance,balance needs and export needs.th at,d.
in the swrcb cases,we also affirmed in the swrcb legal conclusion that the dpa creates no new and separate water right to users of water in the delta by stating that,nothing in the delta protection act purports to grant any kind of water right to any particular party.th at,d.thus,the swrcb properly concluded in order wro that plaintiffs must have adequate existing water rights,acquired under the laws that govern acquisition of water rights,before they can divert and use water from the channels of the delta.if existing water rights are not adequate to supply the needs of water users,the delta protection act does not ensure the delta water users an adequate supply.order wro at,italics added.
first in time rights of seniority 
citing el dorado,plaintiffs argue implementation of term deprived them of their first in time,first in right appropriative rights against water rights held by the projects.they note that the usbr holds a permit issued on application which is junior to all four of plaintiffs permits and authorizes direct diversion of cfs from the stanislaus river for hydropower generation any day of the year.in re petition for assignment of application,state water resources control bd.at.in addition,plaintiffs state that the usbr holds water rights permit,and which are junior to licenses held by the phelpses and authorize diversion for hydropower as well as other uses.decision,supra,table i,at.without citing evidence in the record,plaintiffs maintain that the usbr use of these junior permits could result in or creates the potential for taking water away from the river systems to which the phelpses and other plaintiffs have a prior right.there is no merit in this argument.
in el dorado,we held that the swrcb abused its discretion and violated the rule of priority by imposing term on the irrigation district water right permit and failing to impose it on other,more junior appropriators in the watershed.th at,d.in other words,should the swrcb have applied term to all the permittees and licensees entitled to appropriate the water available for appropriation we described how the rule of priority functions under a dual system of water rights that recognizes the doctrine of riparian rights and appropriative rights.id.at,d.with respect to appropriative rights,as between appropriators,the rule of priority is first in time,first in right.citation.the senior appropriator is entitled to fulfill his needs before a junior appropriator is entitled to use any water,citing united states state water resources control,supra,d at.based on the rule of priority,we concluded the swrcb abused its discretion by imposing term on the irrigation district and not the more junior appropriators.plaintiffs do not contend in this case that there are other,appropriators in the watershed that are capable of diverting water during the term curtailment period.
we also made clear in el dorado that the rule of priority applies only to the use of natural or abandoned flows in a watercourse.no riparian or appropriator has a right to use water that was previously stored or imported by another upstream and then released into the watercourse for use th at,d,italics added.under its express language,term applies to curtail diversion of permittees and licensees only when the natural flow is insufficient to meet delta water quality standards and the projects are required to release stored or imported water to meet those objectives.none of the plaintiffs permits entitled them to divert stored water or imported water.
water quality standards 
finally,plaintiffs contend that the swrcb abused its discretion in basing implementation of term on water quality objectives set forth in in re implementation of water quality objectives for the san francisco joaquin delta estuary,state water resources control bd.decision rather than those required under decision,adopted in.the newer standards increased the amount of water required.plaintiffs concede that the swrcb has discretion to modify all aspects of term,but argue that the issue is whether it can do so in a manner that deprives plaintiffs and other water right holders subjected to term of the right to use water pursuant to their licenses without affording them some form of notice and a hearing before issuing the curtailment notices.
although we disagree with plaintiffs that the director has broad discretion in the implementation of term we conclude there is nothing in the term narrative formula that prevents the swrcb from using the only valid,measure of water quality available in order to protect the beneficial use of the delta.the court decision in united states state water resources control,supra,d,invalidated the water quality standards set forth in decision.rather than remand the case,the court allowed the swrcb to continue proceedings already under way to establish new water quality objectives that were implemented under decision in.id.at.decision at.plaintiffs had ample notice that the water quality standards set forth in decision were inapplicable.
the remainder of the court findings are supported by substantial evidence 
plaintiffs state in the introduction to their opening brief although plaintiffs and their predecessors have been diverting water onto these same lands for irrigation since the and pursuant to what was thought and recognized to be,riparian and overlying water rights,in an effort to further protect the rights to divert they filed applications for appropriative water rights from the swrcb in the.this statement is misleading in light of the evidence.plaintiffs cite no evidence to support the claim they filed permit applications to further protect recognized,riparian and overlying water rights.more importantly,the record does not support plaintiffs claim to water rights in addition to those granted by the swrcb in their permits and licenses.
a.the court factual findings 
the trial court made the following factual findings in support of its denial of plaintiffs 
plaintiffs claim that the swrcb was estopped from enforcing term against them is undermined by the admonitions of the board staff during the term curtailment period that plaintiffs would have to prove the existence of their previously assumed riparian rights or potentially face civil penalties for diversions during the curtailment period.
at best,the evidence is speculative and inconclusive as to whether plaintiffs parcels retained riparian rights after their conveyance and whether any such retained rights were preserved by continuous use thereafter.
plaintiffs do not overcome the lack of solid,credible evidence to establish retained and preserved riparian rights by their assertion of a riparian rights theory based on the connection between groundwater and surface water.
the evidence does not establish an essential element of a right to appropriate water the actual appropriation of water from the san joaquin or middle rivers before for the irrigation of plaintiffs parcels on upper roberts island.
in light of the principles governing appellate review,we conclude the court findings are supported by substantial evidence.mchugh cal,hall,supra,th at,d.
plaintiffs argue that the swrcb was estopped from enforcing term against them given the specific and repeated written assertions previously made by the board staff that plaintiffs indeed had riparian rights which would supply their needs during times when term might be in effect.plaintiffs cite in support of their argument the following handwritten in various inspection reports and license checks prepared by swrcb staff between and.

the doctrine of equitable estoppel is based on foundation of conscience and fair dealing.city of long beach mansell cal d,mansell.the supreme court expressed the doctrine in its classic form the vital principle is that he who by his language or conduct leads another to do what he would not otherwise have done shall not subject such person to loss or injury by disappointing the expectations upon which he acted.such a change of position is sternly forbidden.it involves fraud and falsehood,and the law abhors both.seymour oelrichs cal,disapproved on another ground in sterling taylor cal th,d.
estoppel may be applied against the government where justice and right require it.mansell,supra,cal d at.however,courts will not apply estoppel to a public agency if the result will be the frustration of a strong public policy.bib le committee of bar examiners cal d.public policy must be considered where a party raises estoppel to prevent enforcement of environmental statutes.see people ex rel.state air resources bd.wilmshurst th,d air quality and raley california tahoe regional planning agency d.land use.
based on these principles,mansell and its progeny describe the inquiry involved in determining whether estoppel is proved first,a court must determine whether the traditional elements necessary for assertion of an estoppel against a private party are present.these elements include the following the party to be estopped must be apprised of the facts he must intend that his conduct shall be acted upon,or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel had a right to believe it was so intended the other party must be ignorant of the true state of facts and he must rely upon the conduct to his injury.citation.second,the court must weigh the equities and consider the impact on public policy of permitting an estoppel in a given case.the existence of an estoppel is a factual question.citation.mcknight ranch,franchise tax bd.th,d mcknight ranch see mansell,supra,cal d at.we conclude there is substantial evidence to support the trial court finding that plaintiffs failed to establish the element of reliance.
first,the cited comments reflect staff assumptions based on the fact plaintiffs land is located in the delta lowlands on roberts island one comment refers to the claims of riparian rights.there is no indication of the various contact reports and inspect reports that the plaintiffs claimed riparian rights had ever been adjudicated.
second,case law is clear that unauthorized legal representations by agency staff can not provide the basis for estoppel against the agency.illinois commercial men state bd.of equalization cal d,pipe trades dist.council aubry th,d california horse racing bd.los angeles turf club d.in hampson superior court d,the petitioners filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging a regional water quality control board denial of their request for an exemption from a waste discharge prohibition included in a water quality control plan.id.at.petitioners alleged that they had secured an agreement from the executive officer of the regional board authorizing their exemption from the prohibition.they also alleged that the agreement estopped the regional board from later denying the exemption.the appellate court ruled that the executive officer lacked the authority to make a binding agreement regarding an exemption,and a ny person dealing with a state agency is chargeable with knowledge of all of the powers possessed or which may be legally exercised by the officers in charge of such agency id.at.here,plaintiffs fail to show that the swrcb granted staff members the authority to make definitive determinations regarding riparian rights.
third,even if we were to conclude plaintiffs were entitled to rely on the staff comments which suggested plaintiffs held riparian rights,which we do not,the swrcb notified plaintiffs in and that it questioned their riparian claims.plaintiffs were informed that the swrcb would likely require proof of the right,including results of a title search.
finally,we will not the court weighing of the equities,including public policy considerations,in its rejection of plaintiffs estoppel claim.mcknight ranch,supra,th at,d.decision outlines the history of the swrcb efforts to protect water quality in the delta.term linked the availability of water for permittees and licensees with delta water quality standards,and reflected swrcb policy that diverters of water should share responsibility for meeting those standards.
riparian rights 
plaintiffs argue on appeal that they were entitled to divert water during the and term curtailment periods because they held riparian rights apart from water rights granted in their permits and licenses.they maintain that the trial court rejection of their claim to riparian rights is contrary to the law and the evidence.
the riparian doctrine confers upon the owner of land contiguous to a watercourse the right to the reasonable and beneficial use of water on his land.people shirokow cal d.the extent of lands having riparian status is determined by three criteria the land is contiguous to or abuts the stream the parcel is the smallest parcel held under one title in the chain of title leading to the current owner and the parcel is within the watershed of the stream.rancho santa margarita vail cal d.w here the owner of a riparian tract conveys away a noncontiguous portion of the tract by a deed that is silent as to riparian rights,the conveyed parcel is forever deprived of its riparian status.id.at,citing anaheim union water fuller cal.in deciding whether a parcel is riparian,the court looks to evidence of the present natural topography,not past geological conditions.rancho santa margarita vail,supra,at.
here,the evidence is uncontradicted that none of plaintiffs parcels currently abuts a natural watercourse because each connection with the san joaquin or middle rivers was severed when the parcels were conveyed in the or.moreover,plaintiffs do not contest the swrcb finding that the deeds did not address access to the water courses,that is,they were silent as to whether the land retained its riparian status after the transfers.indeed,plaintiffs counsel conceded at the hearing on plaintiffs that the issue was the evidence other than language in the deed s because there was no language in the deed s to show they retained riparian rights in parcels that no longer abut natural water courses.
in the face of the foregoing evidence,plaintiffs took three different approaches in their effort to prove they held riparian rights.first,plaintiffs argued that there was a hydrologic connection between water in the underground strata of their land and the surface waters in the river channels which gave rise to riparian overlying rights to divert surface waters.see hudson dailey cal,hudson.second,if the court found that connection between the water in the underground strata and the surface waters was not immediate enough to create a riparian right,plaintiffs maintained that they had a right to draw from the common underground supply of percolating water.see id.at.third,plaintiffs asserted that extrinsic evidence showed that plaintiffs and their predecessors in interest intended to retain their riparian rights when they acquired the parcels.see id.at.
in hudson,plaintiff was a landowner who claimed riparian rights in a stream directly supplied by saturated soils and gravels in the valley through which the san jose creek ran.cal.at.she also argued that the underground water consisted of percolating water to which she had a right separate from her riparian claim.id.at.plaintiff filed a complaint alleging that defendants bored wells and unlawfully deprived her of water from the underground stream.plaintiff sought to quiet title in her riparian rights and to enjoin defendants from pumping water from the wells to the extent it prevented her from obtaining a sufficient quantity of water.the trial court ruled for defendants and plaintiff appealed.the supreme court concluded the evidence supported the trial court judgment.id.at.even if we were to accept that the theories described in hudson apply in the case before us,we conclude the record supports the court rejection of plaintiffs claims.
plaintiffs expert,chris neudeck,gave lengthy testimony interpreting maps,photographs and drawings which plaintiffs claimed showed the connection between underground strata and surface water courses,the existence of percolating water,and plaintiffs intent to retain the ability to divert water from various channels after severance.neudeck also relied on a declaration prepared by peter ohm,a purported eyewitness to water diversions through terra cotta pipe on the conn property.however,given the undisputed dates of the deeds of conveyance,it is unlikely ohm had personal knowledge of the facts to which he testified by declaration.the swrcb evidence,including its expert nick wilcox interpretation of maps,photographs and drawings,contradicted neudeck testimony in important respects.
the court gave detailed reasons for rejecting plaintiffs evidence.where evidence is in conflict,we must resolve the conflict in favor of the trial court finding,supra,cal.at,see witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.
appropriative rights 
next,plaintiffs assert that there is insufficient evidence to support the court finding that plaintiffs did not hold appropriative rights.once again,we must uphold the trial court finding based on the rule of conflicting evidence,supra,cal.at.
appropriative rights initiated prior to the amendment to the water commission act are commonly referred to as rights.people murrison th,fn,d.the court compared riparian and appropriative water rights in pleasant valley canal borror th,d under common law principles,riparian owners shared with one another a right to the entire natural flow of the stream running through their properties.that is,they were entitled to proportional shares of the water depending upon how much each was then applying to a reasonable beneficial use.the right protected prospective uses as well,so their respective entitlements might change as their uses changed.they were,however,required to use the water on their riparian land.appropriators,on the other hand,were entitled to use only as much water as they could put to a reasonable beneficial use,and only then to the extent their use did not interfere with the rights of riparians or senior appropriators.the right could be lost by disuse but could not be expanded except by a new appropriation.unlike riparian rights,appropriative rights were not tied to the land appropriated water could be put to a different use or used at another location if that could be done without injury to others.citation.most importantly,although riparians were limited to reasonable uses among themselves,there was no such restriction on their right relative to appropriators they were entitled to the full flow of the stream even if the uses to which they were putting the water were unreasonable or wasteful.citations.
in this case,the trial court found that plaintiffs failed to establish actual appropriation of water for irrigation before.as we already explained,neudeck and wilcox gave conflicting interpretations of the maps,photographs and drawings submitted into evidence.specifically,they disagreed on the extent of irrigation on upper roberts island,the reach of the sloughs,the extent of dry farming and the use of grain crops.
calculation of civil penalties 
plaintiffs contend that the swrcb failed to consider two of the mandatory factors set forth in section when it set the amount of civil penalties to be assessed against plaintiffs.they also argue the swrcb should be estopped from levying the amounts sought in the order because two inspection reports issued in listed the potential penalty as per year,rather than per day.the trial court found that the swrcb adequately and reasonably considered all the circumstances relevant to the amounts of civil liability imposed on plaintiffs in orde
