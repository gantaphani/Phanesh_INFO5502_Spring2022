in this lawsuit,the state of mississippi seeks damages from the city of memphis and memphis light,gas and water mlgw collectively,memphis,for the alleged conversion of groundwater in the memphis sands aquifer the aquifer.the district court dismissed mississippi lawsuit without prejudice,holding that tennessee is an indispensable party to the suit and that the court was without power to join tennessee.we affirm.
background 
the aquifer is located beneath portions of tennessee,mississippi,and arkansas.there is no interstate compact governing use of the aquifer water,and thus no specific volumes of groundwater from the aquifer have been apportioned to mississippi,tennessee,or arkansas.the aquifer is the primary water source for both desoto county,mississippi,and the city of memphis,tennessee,which lies just across the state line from desoto county.mississippi seeks past and future damages,as well as equitable relief,related to memphis allegedly wrongful appropriation of groundwater from the aquifer mississippi alleges that part of the groundwater that memphis pumps from the aquifer is mississippi sovereign property and that the state must therefore be compensated.
mlgw,a division of the city of memphis,owns and operates one of the largest artesian water systems in the world.it is responsible for providing gas,electricity,and water to its residential,business,governmental,and other customers,who are primarily citizens of memphis.although three of its groundwater well fields are located near the tennessee border,all of mlgw wells are located within tennessee,and memphis and tennessee contend that this municipal water program operates under the direction and control of tennessee law 
mississippi asserts that mlgw groundwater pumping has created an underground cone of depression centered under memphis and extending into mississippi.mississippi states that this cone of depression causes groundwater that would otherwise lie beneath mississippi to flow across the border and into the cone under tennessee,and thus become available to be pumped by memphis.mississippi argues that due to the growth of memphis water system the aquifer is being drawn down at a higher rate than it is being replenished,thus causing water levels to drop.
mississippi filed its first complaint against memphis in february.memphis filed a motion to dismiss on several bases,including that the state of tennessee was an indispensable party pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.the motion to dismiss was denied in august.memphis then moved to amend the district court order or to certify an interlocutory appeal.construing the motion to amend as a motion for rehearing,the district court denied both motions in september.memphis filed an answer and subsequent amended answer.mississippi filed an amended complaint in october,eliminating certain claims and clarifying its request for an award of monetary damages for memphis alleged misappropriation of mississippi groundwater.
in june,memphis moved for judgment on the pleadings,again arguing that tennessee was an indispensable party to the suit.memphis also moved for partial summary judgment on several of mississippi claims.in september,the court denied the motions.
in late january,shortly before the bench trial was to start,the district court announced that it had decided sua sponte to revisit the issue of tennessee possible status as an indispensable party and thus the court jurisdiction.after briefing from the parties and oral argument,the district court dismissed the suit for failure to include tennessee,an indispensable party mississippi appeals.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court decision to dismiss for failure to join an indispensable party for an abuse of discretion.hs,wingate,cir.determining whether an entity is an indispensable party is a,endeavor,and federal rule of civil procedure emphasis on a careful examination of the facts means that a district court will ordinarily be in a better position to make a rule decision than a circuit court would be.pulitzer,cir.however,a court abuses its discretion when its ruling is based on an erroneous view of the law.chaves medina star,cir.
determining whether to dismiss a case for failure to join an indispensable party requires a inquiry.first the district court must determine whether the party should be added under the requirements of rule a.rule a requires that a person subject to process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction be joined if 
a in that person absence,the court can not accord complete relief among existing parties or b that person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that disposing of the action in the person absence may i as a practical matter impair or impede the person ability to protect the interest or ii leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double,multiple,or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of the interest.
a.while the party advocating joinder has the initial burden of demonstrating that a missing party is necessary,after an initial appraisal of the facts indicates that a possibly necessary party is absent,the burden of disputing this initial appraisal falls on the party who opposes joinder,at.
if the necessary party can not be joined without destroying jurisdiction,the court must then determine whether that person is indispensable,that is,whether litigation can be properly pursued without the absent party.hs,at.the factors that the district court is to consider in making this determination are laid out in rule b 
the extent to which a judgment rendered in the person absence might prejudice that person or the existing parties the extent to which any prejudice could be lessened or avoided by a protective provisions in the judgment b shaping the relief or c other measures whether a judgment rendered in the person absence would be adequate and whether the plaintiff would have an adequate remedy if the action were dismissed for nonjoinder.
mississippi contends that the district court misapplied rule in holding that tennessee is a necessary and indispensable party because its suit does not implicate any sovereign interest of tennessee.mississippi argues that its suit does not require an equitable apportionment of the aquifer because the state owns the groundwater resources of the state as a attribute of statehood,and thus there is no interstate water to be equitably apportioned.mississippi further argues that it is not seeking relief for damages caused by the direct actions of tennessee,and therefore the suit is not an action between states invoking the original jurisdiction of the supreme court.
memphis responds that the district court correctly determined that the nature of mississippi claims and asserted ownership of a water resource that it shares with tennessee makes tennessee an indispensable party to suit.memphis argues that because tennessee sovereign ownership rights in the aquifer water,the same which mississippi seeks to protect,are implicated,the case can not be properly resolved without tennessee participation.memphis points to a century of supreme court case law addressing the equitable apportionment of interstate waters among states to argue that the district court correctly held that joining tennessee would create a suit between states that must be filed in the supreme court 
tennessee is a necessary party to this water ownership dispute 
the district court held that tennessee was a necessary party under rule a because in its absence complete relief could not be accorded between memphis and mississippi.the court explained that it could not determine whether memphis had misappropriated water from the aquifer without determining what portion of the aquifer belongs to mississippi and tennessee respectively,and thus an equitable apportionment of the aquifer between the states was required.in so holding,the district court rejected mississippi argument,renewed on appeal,that only mississippi water is at issue.mississippi fundamental argument as to why tennessee presence in the lawsuit is unnecessary is that the aquifer water is not
