today we consider whether farmers and farming entities collectively,farmers that irrigate their land using water from the san luis unit of the central valley project the nation largest reclamation project may maintain a claim under the administrative procedure act apa to compel the united states bureau of reclamation the bureau to provide the farmers irrigation districts with more water than it is currently providing.the farmers argue that several federal statutes require the bureau to provide irrigators with sufficient irrigation water to satisfy the farmers needs before delivering water to any other party for any other purpose.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the bureau on several grounds,including that the bureau does not have a statutory duty to release a certain amount of water for irrigation and that,consequently,the farmers claims did not satisfy the final agency action requirement of the apa.although the district court discussed this issue in terms of sovereign immunity,we resolve the case slightly differently.
pursuant to the supreme court unanimous decision in norton southern utah wilderness alliance suwa,d,we hold that the bureau is not legally required to take a discrete action to deliver the farmers preferred amount of san luis unit water for irrigation before it provides water for other purposes.the bureau retains the discretion to allocate san luis water among various parties to satisfy its various obligations.there is no final agency action,nor is there any action that the bureau has unlawfully withheld.see.the farmers claims amount to a broad programmatic attack on the way the bureau generally operates the central valley project,see suwa,at,and therefore the farmers have not established subject matter jurisdiction under the apa alvarado table mountain rancheria,cir.
reclamation projects are indispensable features of agriculture in the western united states.the reclamation act of set in motion a massive program to provide federal financing,construction,and operation of water storage and distribution projects to reclaim arid lands in many western states.orff united states,d see generally.when the department of the interior decides to build and operate a reclamation project,the agency must appropriate,purchase,or condemn necessary water rights in strict conformity with state law.california united states,d.as the farmers acknowledge,the bureau obtained all of the water rights involved in the san luis unit in the under both federal and state law.op.br.at.
the central valley project cvp is a system of dams,reservoirs,levees,canals,pumping stations,hydropower plants,and other infrastructure that distributes water throughout california vast central valley.orff,at.the cvp was originally taken over and executed by the united states under the reclamation act and was reauthorized by the rivers and harbors act of,stat,the cvp act.westlands water dist.united states,cir.the bureau is the agency within the department of the interior charged with administering the cvp.
congress initially prioritized the purposes of the cvp as follows t he said dam and reservoirs shall be used,first,for river regulation,improvement of navigation,and flood control second,for irrigation and domestic uses and,third,for power.cvp act emphasis added.however,congress amended the cvp act in with the central valley project improvement act,stat.cvpia,which the purposes of the cvp.united states,cir.the hierarchy of purposes now reads,t he said dam and reservoirs shall be used,first,for river regulation,improvement of navigation,and flood control second,for irrigation and domestic uses and fish and wildlife mitigation,protection and restoration purposes and,third,for power and fish and wildlife enhancement.cvpia a emphasis added cvp act.the cvpia also requires that the bureau operate the cvp to meet all obligations under state and federal law,including but not limited to the federal endangered species act,et cvpia b.
in,congress authorized the secretary of the interior to construct and operate the san luis unit as an integral part of the cvp.act of june,a,stat,the san luis act.the san luis act states that the principal purpose of the unit is to furnish water for irrigation and identifies four incident al purposes among them,fish and wildlife benefits.id.the san luis act also provides that t he principal engineering features of said unit shall be a dam and reservoir at or near the san luis site,a forebay and afterbay,the san luis canal,the pleasant valley canal,and necessary pumping plants,distribution systems,drains,channels,levees,flood works and related facilities.id.
the reclamation act authorizes the bureau to enter into contracts for the use of reclamation water for several purposes,including irrigation.see.as is relevant here,the bureau contracts with irrigation districts for the delivery of water from the san luis unit.each contract contains a shortage provision excusing the bureau from the full amount of its contractual water delivery obligations if water shortages are caused by,among other things,drought,mechanical malfunctions,or statutory obligations on the part of the bureau to deliver water for other purposes such as obligations imposed by the endangered species act and the cvpia.once the bureau contracts with an irrigation district,the district in turn contracts with like the farmers.
according to the bureau deputy regional resources manager,every year the bureau projects the amount of cvp water that will be available based upon reservoir storage,precipitation,runoff forecasts,and other indices.decl.of richard stevenson,april.it then allocates that water among the bureau contractors,including irrigation districts and wildlife refuges.
the farmers allege that for decades the bureau delivered enough water to the irrigation districts which then sold the water to the farmers or the farmers to irrigate of their lands to their satisfaction.but in the last several years the bureau has provided less water for irrigation,allocating substantial amounts of san luis water for other purposes particularly for the protection and restoration of fish and wildlife.the bureau also allows a significant volume of water to flow naturally,rather than capturing it to be used for irrigation.according to the farmers,the bureau has unlawfully transmute d the unit from an irrigation project into a fish and wildlife enterprise.op.br.at.
the farmers filed suit under the apa in the united states district court for the eastern district of california.the farmers contended that the bureau is required by federal law to deliver more water for irrigation and less water for purposes such as fish and wildlife.they claim they are entitled to the amount of water that they have historically put to beneficial use presumably making this historical measurement sometime before the bureau began curtailing its deliveries of irrigation water.at oral argument,counsel for the farmers estimated this amount as approximately,at least in times when there is no water shortage.
the bureau moved for judgment on the pleadings,and the farmers moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the bureau motion,denied the farmers motion,and granted summary judgment to the bureau.the district court determined that with respect to most of the statutory provisions cited by the farmers,the bureau did not have a mandatory duty to act to provide a certain amount of irrigation water,the farmers thus did not satisfy the final agency action requirement of the apa,and the farmers claims were therefore barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.the court held in the alternative that the farmers lacked prudential standing.with respect to four of the farmers claims,the district court held that the farmers lacked constitutional standing.
the farmers timely appeal.
we review de novo the district court interpretation of federal statutes such as the reclamation act,the cvp act,and the san luis act.firebaugh canal united states,cir.when interpreting a statute,our starting point is the plain language of the statute.consejo de desarrollo economico de mexicali united states,cir.that plain meaning controls except when its application leads to unreasonable or impracticable results.de osorio mayorkas,cir en banc internal quotation marks omitted.
where no other statute provides for judicial review of agency action,as is the case here,the apa allows challenges to final agency action.agency action includes a failure to act.the farmers do not challenge a specific water allocation by the bureau.rather,they allege that the bureau has generally failed to deliver enough water to the irrigation districts for those districts to sell sufficient water to the farmers.in such a failure to act case,a court can compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.
the supreme court explained the requirements of in suwa.in that case,the court considered an apa claim that the bureau of land management blm violated several statutory provisions by failing to take action with respect to vehicle use on federal land.at.noting that a failure to act within the meaning of the apa is the failure of the agency to issue an agency rule,order,license,sanction or relief,id.at,the court held that judicial review of a failure to act under is properly understood to be limited to a discrete action,id.at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.general deficiencies in compliance lack the specificity requisite for agency action,id.at,and thus broad programmatic attack s on an agency administration of a program are prohibited,id.at.
the court also explained that even discrete agency action can not be compelled under unless that action is demanded by law.id.at.statutory goals that are mandatory as to the object to be achieved but leave the agency with discretion in deciding how to achieve those goals are insufficient to support a failure to act claim because such discretionary actions are not demanded by law.id.at.
therefore,a claim under can proceed only where a plaintiff asserts that an agency failed to take a discrete agency action that it is required to take.id.at.absent such an assertion,a section claim may be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.alvarado,at see also gros ventre tribe united states,cir upholding the district court dismissal of an apa claim for lack of jurisdiction because the government was not required to take discrete nondiscretionary actions.
with these standards in mind,we turn to the farmers claims.
the farmers have no contractual rights with the bureau to irrigation water obtained as a result of its reclamation works,and the farmers do not contend that they are beneficiaries of the bureau contracts with the irrigation districts.see orff,at,holding that the government had not waived its sovereign immunity with respect to suits brought by farmers claiming beneficiary status klamath water users protective ass patterson,cir construing contract between the bureau and the california oregon power company and holding that irrigators were not intended beneficiaries.
rather than basing their claims in contract,the farmers argue that various reclamation statutes independently impose mandatory obligations upon the bureau to distribute more water to the irrigation districts.the farmers contend they are entitled to whatever amount of water they historically put to beneficial use and that the bureau may use only surplus water for any purpose other than irrigation.op.br.at.
the farmers divide their claims into three groups.they contend that the bureau is violating statutory duties to operate the san luis unit in a manner that fully utilizes it for irrigation above other purposes,to exercise its water rights to san luis water,and to recoup project costs.op.br.at.we conclude that none of the statutes identified by the farmers requires the bureau to take a discrete nondiscretionary action.
we first consider whether four federal statutes impose on the bureau a mandatory duty to operate the cvp so as to provide the farmers with their preferred amount of water.
section of title of the united states code authorizes the secretary to enter into contract to supply water from any project irrigation system for other purposes than irrigation provided that no water shall be furnished for the uses aforesaid if the delivery of such water shall be detrimental to the water service for such irrigation project,nor to the rights of any prior appropriator.emphasis added.the farmers rely on to argue that their lands are suffering just such a detriment and that,therefore,the bureau must operate the san luis unit to provide them with more irrigation water before distributing water for purposes.
the fatal flaw in the farmers argument is that although they allege generally that they are being harmed by the bureau practice of allocating water for the protection of fish and wildlife a purpose which,like irrigation,the bureau is required to promote under the cvpia they have not identified a single contract as a cause of that harm.further,the statute does not describe any specific action the bureau is required to take in the event an irrigator claims detriment resulting from a reclamation contract.thus,without addressing the farmers argument that they are prior appropriators within the meaning of,we conclude that these claims fail for lack of a discrete statutory duty.
the farmers next cite section of the cvp act,which provides for the sale of electric energy generated by the cvp in order to permit the full utilization of the works constructed to accomplish the cvp purposes.because section also states that the cvp dam and reservoirs shall be used,after river regulation,for irrigation and other uses,the farmers claim the entire infrastructure of the cvp must be used for irrigation before the bureau may distribute water for purposes.op.br.at quoting cvp act emphasis added.
the statute,as amended by the cvpia,lists the purposes of the cvp,improving navigation,river regulation,irrigation,fish and wildlife protection and restoration,and authorizes the sale of electricity to accomplish those purposes.section does not indicate in the slightest that the bureau must take any nondiscretionary action,much less deliver a certain amount of water to its irrigation contractors so that those contractors can then sell it to the farmers.
the farmers also rely on the second sentence of section a of the san luis act,which states that the principal engineering features of the san luis unit shall be a dam and reservoir and necessary pumping plants,distribution systems,drains,channels,levees,flood works and related facilities.the farmers rely on our decision in firebaugh canal for the proposition that this statutory language creates a mandatory duty to distribute more water for irrigation.
firebaugh canal involved a challenge to the secretary of the interior failure to complete construction of a master interceptor drain for the san luis unit.at.the majority held that because section a of the san luis act states that the principal engineering features of the san luis unit shall include necessary drains,the agency was required to construct the interceptor drain.id.at.firebaugh canal described the government responsibility under a as a mandatory duty to provide drainage service and held that providing such service constitute d agency action unlawfully withheld under.id.at.although the majority held that the district court can compel the department of interior to provide drainage service as mandated by the san luis act,it recognized that the district court can not eliminate agency discretion as to how it satisfies the drainage requirement.id.at emphasis added.
the farmers argue that section a,as interpreted in firebaugh canal,requires the bureau to distribute the farmers preferred amount of irrigation water before it engages in any fish and wildlife protection efforts.we disagree that firebaugh canal stands for so attenuated a proposition.section a of the san luis act simply describes the necessary engineering features of the san luis unit,and firebaugh canal simply holds that the agency was required to construct the interceptor drain.neither the statute nor firebaugh canal says anything in terms of a duty to distribute a particular amount of water for irrigation.
moreover,because firebaugh canal was decid
