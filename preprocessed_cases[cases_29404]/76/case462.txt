this case is before the court on appeal from a circuit court judgment validating a proposed bond issue.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.for the reasons expressed below,we affirm in part and reverse in part the circuit court judgment.
factual and procedural history 
in october,the south florida water management district the district,filed a complaint in the fifteenth judicial circuit seeking validation of certificates of participation cops,pursuant to chapter of the florida statutes,in order to purchase land owned by the united states sugar corporation for the purpose of everglades restoration.the court issued a notice and order to show cause and scheduled a hearing for december.after the district filed a supplemental complaint,the trial court issued an amended notice and order to show cause,which retained the december hearing date.the state attorneys for each of the judicial circuits within the district jurisdictional boundaries ninth,tenth,eleventh,fifteenth,sixteenth,seventeenth,nineteenth,and twentieth circuits responded to the complaint on various dates.on december,the new hope sugar company and okeelanta corporation hereinafter collectively referred to as new hope served an answer and a memorandum in opposition to the complaint.the parties appeared before the court on december and the court granted the district motion to continue the hearing.the court subsequently entered a second amended notice and order to show cause,rescheduling the bond validation proceeding for february.
in january,several other parties appeared in the cause.on january,united states sugar corporation served a notice of appearance and motion to intervene as a party defendant.on january,dexter lehtinen,already a defendant in his individual capacity,served a notice of appearance and answer on behalf of the miccosukee tribe of indians of florida the tribe.other individuals and the concerned citizens of glades also filed notices of appearance and answers to the complaint.the national audubon society and florida audubon society served a notice of appearance and a notice of intervention.accelerated discovery proceedings took place between december and february.various motions and memoranda of law were filed by the parties in february.
the validation hearing was held over a number of days in february,march,july,and august of.counsel appeared on behalf of the district,new hope,the tribe,the state attorneys,concerned citizens of glades,the audubon society,nathaniel reid,and sugar.in the midst of these proceedings,various parties filed motions to abate the proceedings and reopen them for the court to consider new evidence regarding a modification of the transaction,which the court granted.the parties engaged in more expedited discovery and filed more motions during this time.
on august,the circuit court issued its final judgment,validating the cops in the amount of million,an amount sufficient to purchase acres of property from sugar.the order contained eight pages of factual findings and sixteen pages of legal conclusions.the court found that the district responsibilities include restoring and cleaning up the everglades ecosystem the district governing board had adopted resolutions amending the district plan to include acquisition of the sugar lands,establishing a master program,and authorizing the issuance of cops to finance these transactions all of the meetings related to this matter had been open,public,and duly noticed.the court also found that under the master agreement,the district will purchase the property and ground lease the property to a nonprofit leasing corporation.in turn,the leasing corporation will lease back the property to the district,which will manage the property and make improvements to it.under the agreement,the district must determine annually whether to appropriate funds to pay the leasing corporation for the annual rental of the property,and the district regains possession of the property at the end of the ground lease.additionally,a master trust agreement was executed to issue cops and to hold the proceeds from the cops in trust to pay the costs of acquiring,constructing,and installing facilities on the sites.the cops are secured by the lease payments.the court concluded that the district has the legal authority to issue the cops,that the cops will serve a legal purpose water storage and treatment,and that the issuance of the cops complies with the requirements of law.
in june,pursuant to sections and,florida statutes,and rule of the florida administrative code,new hope requested a formal administrative hearing challenging the district purchase of land from sugar.later,the tribe filed a similar request.the district consolidated the parties separate petitions for administrative hearing and dismissed them with prejudice for lack of standing.both new hope and the tribe filed notices of administrative appeal,requesting that the district court grant them a formal hearing for their administrative law claim.the district filed an all writs petition,asking this court to transfer the administrative appeals cases from the district court because the cases deal with the same issues presented in the bond validation proceedings.we granted the petition and transferred the cases 
in september,the tribe and new hope filed separate notices of appeal regarding the bond validation proceeding.we granted the district unopposed motion to consolidate the two bond validation appeals.we heard oral argument from the parties in april.
issues and analysis 
the parties raise a number of issues regarding the validity of the cops,including whether the trial court findings of fact are complete whether the trial court should have considered the economic feasibility of the project to be funded by the cops whether the cops serve a public purpose whether the transaction violates various constitutional provisions whether the proposed financing structure is legal whether cops may be issued to purchase an option to buy certain property in the future and whether the district may legally convey purchased lands to municipalities.
judicial inquiry in a bond validation proceeding,both at the trial court and this court,is limited to determining whether a public body has the authority to issue the subject bonds whether the purpose of the obligation is legal and whether the authorization of the obligation complies with the requirements of law.see city of gainesville state,so d.this court reviews the trial court findings of fact for substantial competent evidence and its conclusions of law de novo.id.citing panama city beach cmty.redev.agency state,so d,and city of boca raton state,so d.the final judgment of validation comes to this court clothed with a presumption of correctness.see strand escambia county,so d.moreover,the appellants have the burden of demonstrating that the record and evidence fail to support the lower court conclusions.see wohl state,so d.we consider the issues raised within this legal framework.
findings of fact and economic feasibility 
the tribe and new hope argue that the factual findings made by the trial court in its order of final judgment are incomplete because the trial court failed to consider the economic feasibility of the project and because the court failed to recognize that the proceeds of the cops will be used to purchase acres from sugar and not to finance infrastructure projects on the land.
in its conclusions of law in the final judgment,the trial court recognized that the economic feasibility of the project is outside of its scope of review.the court acknowledged that the tribe and new hope had made strong arguments that the project is economically impossible.the court also questioned the wisdom of seeking this large amount of cops during the current economic times.however,the court stated that it was bound by precedent which instructs that economic feasibility is collateral to bond validation proceedings and cited a number of previous decisions by this court that stand for this proposition.ultimately,the court stated that it can not and does not base its decision on whether the district will have the financing to actually complete a project of this magnitude.
this court has repeatedly explained that 
the fiscal feasibility of a revenue project is an administrative decision to be concluded by the business judgment of the issuing agency.such problems as the advisability of the project and its income potential,must be resolved at the executive or administrative level.they are beyond the scope of judicial review in a validation proceeding.
state manatee county port,so d.in town of medley state,so d,we explained that the reasonableness and economic feasibility of the financing plan were the responsibility and prerogative of the governing body of the governmental unit in the absence of fraud or violation of legal duty.see also washington shores homeowners ass city of orlando,so d,stating that homeowners complaint as to advisability of project is collateral to and beyond the scope of bond validation proceedings state city of sunrise,so d,explaining that the court can not reach the question of whether the bond revenue plan is fiscally sound or whether the financing method was wise.
this court has adhered to these limitations over the years.for example,in state school board of sarasota county,so d,we stated that q uestions of business policy and judgment are beyond the scope of judicial interference and are responsibility of the issuing governmental units.similarly,in state city of daytona beach,so d,we stated that questions concerning the financial and economic feasibility of a proposed plan are to be resolved at the executive or administrative level and are beyond the scope of judicial review in a validation proceeding.
the rationale that underlies the limited judicial review in bond validation cases was explained by this court in town of medley so d at 
t he courts do not have the authority to substitute their judgment for that of officials who have determined that revenue certificates should be issued for a purpose deemed by them to be in the best interest of those whom they represent 
a contrary holding would make an oligarchy of the courts giving them the power in matters such as this to determine what in their opinion was good or bad for a city and its inhabitants thereby depriving the inhabitants of the right to make such decisions for themselves as is intended under our system of government.
indeed,t he function of a validation proceeding is merely to settle the basic validity of the securities and the power of the issuing agency to act in the premises.its objective is to put in repose any question of law or fact affecting the validity of the bonds.manatee county port,so d at.
new hope argues that there was no administrative determination of the economic feasibility of this plan.however,the governing board passed three separate resolutions authorizing this project,argued the merits of the project at various board meetings,and heard reports by district staff at a number of meetings and workshops.a reviewing court can not go behind the resolutions of the governing board which authorized this project.thus,we agree with the trial court conclusion that economic feasibility is beyond the scope of judicial review in a bond validation proceeding.
public purpose 
the tribe and new hope argue that the purpose of the obligation is not legal because the proceeds of the cops will not be used for the purposes delineated by the district,but merely to buy land.they also argue that the public purpose can not be discerned here because the district does not have specific projects planned for the various parcels of land to be acquired.
this court has held that legislative declarations of public purpose are presumed valid and should be considered correct unless patently erroneous.strand escambia county,so d,quoting boschen city of clearwater,so d.in its resolution approving the purchase of the land from sugar and the issuance of the cops,the district governing board stated that the acquisition of the land 
will serve a public purpose by increasing the water storage capability of the district to reduce harmful freshwater discharges from lake okeechobee to florida coastal rivers and estuaries improving the timing and quality of delivery of cleaner water to the everglades ecosystem preventing phosphorous from entering the everglades ecosystem eliminating the need for water into lake okeechobee and improving the sustainability of agriculture and green energy production all as more particularly described in staff report entitled summary of benefits of the ussc land acquisition attached hereto as exhibit 
resolution,at,governing board of the south florida water management district.the summary of benefits referred to in the governing board resolution was authored by two district directors and the district chief scientist.this report goes into great detail as to each of the benefits listed as a public purpose in the governing board resolution.
additionally,the legislature has declared that it is necessary for the public health and welfare that water and resources be conserved and protected and that the acquisition of real property for this objective shall constitute a public purpose for which public funds may be expended.stat.the legislature has also given water management districts the authority to issue revenue bonds to finance the undertaking of any capital or other project for the purposes permitted by the state constitution and to pay the costs and expenses incurred in carrying out the purposes of this chapter.stat.in fact,the legislature has provided that 
t he powers and authority of districts to issue revenue bonds shall be coextensive with the powers and authority of municipalities to issue bonds under state law.the provisions of this section constitute full and complete authority for the issuance of revenue bonds and shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purpose.
for purposes of section,the definition of a project is broadly defined as 
a governmental undertaking approved by the governing body of a water management district and includes all property rights,easements,and franchises relating thereto and deemed necessary or convenient for the construction,acquisition,or operation thereof,and embraces any capital expenditure which the governing body of a water management district shall deem to be made for a public purpose,including the refunding of any bonded indebtedness which may be outstanding on any existing project.
b.stat.works of the district are also broadly defined in chapter as those projects and works,including,but not limited to,structures,impoundments,wells,streams,and other watercourses,together with the appurtenant facilities and accompanying lands,which have been officially adopted by the governing board of the district as works of the district.stat.
thus,the district has authority to acquire lands to further the objective of conserving and protecting water and resources.this objective has been deemed a public purpose by the legislature.the district can also issue revenue bonds to finance the costs of carrying out its responsibilities and projects under chapter.its authority to issue such bonds is coextensive with that of municipalities and is to be liberally construed so that it can serve its purpose.the lands upon which the district projects reside are part of its statutorily defined works.in fact,it would be impossible for the district to construct its projects without first acquiring the accompanying lands.these statutes provide ample evidence to satisfy the first prong of our review,whether the district has the authority to issue the subject bonds.see city of gainesville,so d at.
the appellants cite this court decision in state suwannee county development authority,so d,in support of their argument that no public purpose has been proven.in suwannee county,the development authority sought validation of revenue certificates for the purchase of land and construction of buildings that would be leased to private businesses.id.at.there were no definite plans as to what land would be purchased with the proceeds from the sale of the certificates,what buildings would be constructed,or what firms would lease the buildings.id.the development authority intended to devise the program after the validation.id.on review,this court explained that in order to determine whether an agency may lawfully expend the bond proceeds for the contemplated purpose,the issuing governmental agency should set forth in the petition for validation a description of the purpose for which the proceeds are to be used,which description should be sufficiently detailed to enable a member of the public and the state to determine whether the issuing agency can lawfully expend public monies therefor.id.at.thus,petitions for validation of bonds and revenue certificates should set forth in reasonable detail the purpose or purposes which will be accomplished with the proceeds.id.at.
the complaint for validation and two supplements to the complaint that were filed in this case describe the land to be acquired with the proceeds of the cops and the structure of the financing agreement.the complaint also states that the land will be used to further the district mandate to restore natural resources.exhibits filed with the complaint include the governing board resolutions which authorize the land purchase,the issuance of cops,and the financing structure a report detailing the benefits to be derived from the land acquisition a number of reports relating to the district projects and the everglades restoration and copies of the master agreement,the master trust agreement,the ground leases to be used for the leases between the district and the leasing corporation,the assignment agreement between the leasing corporation and the named trustee,and the cops to be issued.in all,well over pages of exhibits were filed with the complaint for validation.
this is a far cry from the suwannee county case,where the complaint did not specify what land would be purchased,what buildings would be constructed,and to whom the buildings would be leased.here,the acres have been identified.the land will be leased back to sugar,which will be required to maintain the land as specified in the ground lease and to use best practices in its farming.the land will eventually house various water storage and treatment projects.at the july,evidentiary hearing,the district executive director specified the various projects and uses for each parcel of the acres.in fact,it was the lack of such projects or planned uses for the remaining acres that caused the trial court to deny validation of cops for the purchase of those additional acres.
this court addressed a similar challenge based on the fact that plans and specifications of the proposed improvements were not offered in evidence by the governmental entity seeking validation in rianhard port of palm beach district,so d.in that case,we concluded that the introduction of the supporting resolution,which sufficiently describe d the purposes for which the funds derived from the sale of the certificates would be expended,was all that was necessary to justify validation.id.we reiterated this holding in strand,when we stated that the admission of a resolution may be sufficient evidence justifying a bond validation.strand,so d at.there,the county offered into evidence its ordinance and resolution authorizing bonds for a road construction project and presented testimony concerning the purpose of the project and the financing mechanism.see id.at.we concluded that these legislative findings were competent,substantial evidence sufficient to support the final judgment.id.at.
the same can be said in the instant case,where the trial court conducted nine days of evidentiary hearings resulting in thousands of pages of transcripts,heard testimony from numerous expert witnesses,and considered numerous evidentiary materials.the transcript contains numerous passages in which the trial judge questions witnesses to gain more information and asks the parties to clarify various issues.the trial court order of final judgment is comprehensive and.the arguments by the appellants here do not meet the burden of demonstrat ing from the record the failure of the evidence to support the government body and the trial court conclusions.wohl state,so d.the trial court final judgment of validation comes to this court clothed with a presumption of correctness.strand,so d at citing wohl,so d at.we conclude that there is competent substantial evidence in the record to support the finding of a public purpose.
constitutional challenges 
the tribe and new hope argue that the transaction is not valid because it does not comply with several provisions of the florida constitution.these include the prohibition in article vii,section against using the state taxing power or credit to aid a private entity or person the requirement of article vii,section that voters must approve bonds or cops which are payable from ad valorem taxation and mature more than twelve months after issuance and the requirement in article vii,section that bonds issued by the state or its agencies must first be approved by the legislature through an act relating to appropriations or by general law.for the reasons explained below,we conclude that the instant transaction does not violate any of these constitutional provisions.
public purpose test of article vii,section 
article vii,section of the florida constitution provides in pertinent part neither the state nor any county,school district,municipality,special district,or agency of any of them,shall give,lend or use its taxing power or credit to aid any corporation,association,partnership or person the appellants contend that the land acquisition in this case violates this constitutional provision because the district is buying lands that will then be leased back to sugar for a number of years,therefore not meeting the paramount public purpose test.
the basic test for determining whether an expenditure of public funds violates this section of the florida constitution is whether such expenditure is made to accomplish a public purpose.if the district has used either its taxing power or pledge of credit to support issuance of bonds,the purpose of the obligation must serve a paramount public purpose and any benefits to a private party must be incidental.see state jea,so d,citing state osceola county,so d.if the district has not exercised its taxing power or pledged its credit to support the bond obligation,the obligation is valid if it serves a public purpose.see id.at northern palm beach county water control dist.state,so d.incidental private benefit from a public revenue bond issue is not sufficient to negate the public character of the project.jea,so d at.
as used in article vii,section,credit means the imposition of some new financial liability upon the state or a political subdivision which in effect results in the creation of a state or political subdivision debt for the benefit of private enterprises.jacksonville aviation,so d,quoting nohrr brevard county educ.facilities,so d.this court has explained that the lending of credit means 
t he assumption by the public body of some degree of direct or indirect obligation to pay a debt of the third party.where there is no direct or indirect undertaking by the public body to pay the obligation from public funds,and no public property is placed in jeopardy by a default of the third party,there is no lending of public credit.
id.quoting state housing fin,so d.under this definition,we conclude that the cops in this case do not contemplate a pledge of the district credit,and that only a public purpose,not a paramount public purpose,need be shown.
in its final judgment,the trial court concluded that the acquisition of the land would serve the public purpose of water storage and treatment.the trial court noted that the governing board had voted to approve the acquisition after much debate and that district witnesses had outlined,parcel by parcel,the immediate and future benefits to be gained by the land acquisition.the court found that the following benefits would be achieved storage and treatment of water before it is pumped into lake okeechobee additional storage and treatment facilities that will work in conjunction with comprehensive everglades restoration projects basins and land that will be valuable for future land swaps.
examples of valid public purposes that have been recognized by this court rather broadly include an road improvement project within a unit of a water control district,see northern palm beach county water control,so d at,the construction of an office building for a multistate insurance company,see linscott orange county indus.dev,so d,and the purchase of mortgages from private homeowners to alleviate shortages in public housing,see state housing fin,so d.
under the constitution of,it is immaterial that the primary beneficiary of a project be a private party,if the public interest,even though indirect,is present and sufficiently strong.state housing fin,so d at.further,public ownership of a project to be funded by bond revenues is a significant factor in a finding of public purpose.northern palm beach county water control,so d at citing orange county indus.dev.auth.state,so d.
in the instant case,the district will retain title to the lands acquired.the land will be leased back to the seller sugar to continue its agricultural operations,which will generate revenues and maintain the land until the district can construct the infrastructure projects required for water storage and treatment for everglades restoration.because we conclude that the purchase of the property serves the public purposes of furthering everglades restoration and the management of water resources,the requirements of article vii,section are satisfied.
voter referendum requirement of article vii,section 
article vii,section of the florida constitution,provides 
local,school districts,municipalities,special districts and local governmental bodies with taxing powers may issue bonds,certificates of indebtedness or any form of tax anticipation certificates,payable from ad valorem taxation and maturing more than twelve months after issuance only 
a to finance or refinance capital projects authorized by law and only when approved by vote of the electors who are owners of freeholds therein not wholly exempt from taxation or 
b to refund outstanding bonds and interest and redemption premium thereon at a lower net average interest cost rate.
the trial court concluded that the referendum requirement of article vii,section does not apply in this case because the district obligation to make the lease payments is an annual obligation that does not extend more than twelve months and the lease payments are not payable from ad valorem taxation within the meaning of the constitutional provision.the trial court found that the arguments advanced by the tribe and new hope ignored the plain language of the florida constitution,the relevant florida statutes,the governing resolution and agreements,and this court recent decision in strand escambia county,so d,in which this court reaffirmed its distinction between pledges of ad valorem taxing power and the use of ad valorem tax revenues.we agree.
in state miami beach redevelopment agency,so d,we explained that a referendum is not required by article vii,section when there is no direct pledge of the ad valorem taxing power.although contributions may come from ad valorem tax revenues,w hat is critical to the constitutionality of the bonds is that,after the sale of the bonds,a bondholder would have no right,if funds were insufficient to meet the bond obligations to compel by judicial action the levy of ad valorem taxation.id.at.where a governing body is not obliged and can not be compelled to levy any ad valorem taxes,then the obligation is not payable from ad valorem taxation for purposes of article vii,section,and referendum approval is not required.see also state school bd.of sarasota county,so d reaching same conclusion as to validity of bonds and cops to be issued by several school boards for the construction of schools.we recently reaffirmed our adherence to this reasoning in strand,when we rejected strand motion on rehearing asking us to recede from the decision in miami beach as it relates to the meaning of payable from ad valorem taxation in article vii,section.strand,so d at.
the trial court found that the district has not pledged its ad valorem taxing powers to pay any sum under the lease agreement or any of the leases,can not be compelled to levy any ad valorem tax to pay the lease payments,and can not be compelled to pay any lease payments beyond one year.we agree.under the terms of the master lease purchase agreement,the basic lease payments are payable only from funds appropriated by the governing board and are not payable from any source of taxation.the district has not pledged its full faith and credit for payment of such sums.further,the agreement provides that n either the leasing corporation,the trustee,nor any certificate holder may compel the levy of ad valorem taxes by the governing board to pay the lease payments.the district chief financial officer also testified that the way the deal was structured,none of the certificate holders could ever compel the district to levy ad valorem taxes in order to pay the district obligations.under the nonappropriation clause of the agreement,the obligations and liabilities are dependent upon appropriations being made by the governing board.additionally,the governing board is free to terminate the lease annually without further obligation and the certificate holders are limited to lease remedies.the failure of the governing board to appropriate the sufficient funds for lease payments does not constitute a default,does not require payment of a penalty,and does not limit the district right to purchase or use facilities similar in function.instead,the nonappropriation of the funds results in the termination of the lease,requiring the district to surrender possession of the facilities to the trustee for the remainder of the term of the ground lease.however,the fee title to the property remains in the name of the governing board.thus,the terms of the agreement maintain the district full budgetary flexibility.state brevard county,so d,see also sarasota county,so d at finding that annual renewal option preserves the boards full budgetary flexibility.
the tribe and new hope assert that this nonappropriation clause is illusory because the district can not practically walk away from its obligation.they cite frankenmuth mutual insurance magaha,so d,and volusia county state,so d,in support of this argument.however,we find both cases to be distinguishable from the instant case.
frankenmuth involved a master lease agreement for computer equipment to be used for county payroll and central data processing for the county offices.in addition to a nonappropriation clause that terminated the lease if the funding authority failed to appropriate funds to make the lease payments,the agreement also contained a nonsubstitution clause,providing that the county could not purchase or rent substitute computer equipment for two years in the event of nonappropriation.see frankenmuth,so d at.although the agreement stated that there was no pledge of ad valorem taxes by the county and the county could not be compelled to appropriate funds to make the lease payments,we concluded that the nonsubstitution clause rendered the nonappropriation clause illusory by compelling the county to make the lease payments or suffer the penalty of losing the computer equipment and not being able to substitute other computer equipment for two years.see id.at.thus,the county was morally compel led to pledge ad valorem taxes to fulfill the obligations of the lease.id.at.
similarly,in volusia county,so d at,the county pledged all available revenues and covenanted to do all things necessary to continue receiving the various revenues pledged in bonds for the construction of a new jail.we concluded that these two pledges would inevitably lead to higher ad valorem taxes during the life of the bonds,which amounts to the same thing.id.
here,the master lease agreement contains a nonappropriation clause that gives the district the right to terminate the lease on an annual basis if the governing board should decide not to appropriate the funds for the lease.as this court explained in frankenmuth,such nonappropriation or nonrenewal clauses are essential to prevent municipal financing arrangements from being classified as debt under state law,thus triggering requirements such as voter referendum.so d at quoting frankenmuth mut.ins.magaha.weekly fed.unlike volusia county,there are no further pledges as to the source of revenues or efforts to maintain revenues.unlike frankenmuth,the only the penalties for nonappropriation are normal lease penalties,the district loses possessory interest for the term of the lease and this interest may be for the benefit of the certificate holders.at the termination of the lease,the district regains possession and it always retains title to the land.we conclude that this structure maintains the district budgetary flexibility and thus does not require a referendum under article vii,section.
however,the arrangement could run afoul of this constitutional provision if the district should include under the master lease any lands that have been financed through a pledge of its ad valorem taxing power.under resolution of the governing board,the certificates of participation will be payable from basic lease payments to be made by the district under the initial lease schedule related to the lease of the sugar lands or other lands it currently owns.resolution,at,governing board of the south florida water management district may,emphasis added.the substitution of other lands that implicate a pledge of the district ad valorem taxing power would run afoul of the referendum requirement of article vii,section,and therefore such lands may not be substituted.
legislative approval under article vii,section f 
article vii,section of the florida constitution governs state bonds and revenue bonds.subsection f provides that e ach project,building,or facility to be financed or refinanced with revenue bonds issued under this section shall first be approved by the legislature by an act relating to appropriations or by general law.this provision applies to bonds issued by the state or its agencies.art.vii,d.const.the trial court concluded that the legislative approval was not required in this case because the district was not a state agency for purposes of article vii of the florida constitution.the trial court based this conclusion on the fact that article vii,section a of the florida constitution prohibits the state and its agencies from levying ad valorem taxes,while article vii,section b authorizes the levy of ad valorem taxes for water management purposes and for all other special districts.the court reasoned that because the district can and does levy ad valorem taxes,it can not be deemed a state agency under article vii.
water management districts have an amorphous nature in florida law,being deemed state agencies or arms of the state for some purposes,but not for other purposes.compare.sugar cane league,south.water mgmt,so d,dca explaining that the district is a regulatory state agency subject to florida administrative procedure act,with martinez south.water mgmt,so d dca determining that the district was not subject to the provisions of the workplace act because it was not a state agency.in this case the dispositive question is whether the district is a state agency for purposes of article vii,section f,which would require legislative approval through general law or an appropriations act before the district could issue revenue bonds.in the past,we have concluded that water management districts are not included in the prohibition against state ad valorem taxation in article vii,section a of the florida constitution.see johns river water mgmt.dist.deseret ranches of florida,so d,concluding that ad valorem taxes levied by the district did not violate the constitutional prohibition against state ad valorem taxes because article vii,section specifically authorizes the levying of ad valorem taxes for water management purposes,and section of the florida statutes provides the implementing legislation for ad valorem taxation to finance the works of the district.while the appellants are technically correct that deseret ranches did not hold that water management districts are not state agencies,we did recognize that the districts are not the state for purposes of finance and taxation under article vii of the florida constitution.see id.
accordingly,we agree with the trial court conclusion that legislative approval is not required before the district can issue these certificates of participation.
financing structure 
the tribe asserts that the financing structure in this case is not legal.the trial court succinctly characterized the financing structure in its order of final judgment 
the district proposes to issue cops pursuant to a classic,annual appropriation,structure that has been consistently approved by the florida supreme court.here,the district will purchase property which it will then ground lease to the leasing corporation.the leasing corporation will lease such property back to the district pursuant to the master lease purchase agreement.the district will manage such property and may make improvements thereto.pursuant to section of the master lease purchase agreement,the district must annually determine whether to appropriate funds,which may include proceeds from ad valorem taxes,to pay the leasing corporation for the annual rental of such property.each of these structural elements is similar to those present in school board of sarasota county,where title to the public lands remained in the school boards,the ground lease was up to thirty years,and m oney from several sources,including ad valorem taxation,was used to make the annual facilities lease payments.school bd.of sarasota county,so d at.
if,in any year,the district determines not to appropriate funds to make the annual rental payments,the lease term of all leases under the master lease purchase agreement will terminate no later than the end of the district fiscal year for which the district appropriated funds to make the lease payments.upon such termination,the district must immediately surrender and deliver possession of the property to the trustee as assignee of the leasing corporation.the district surrenders possession only for the remaining period of the ground lease but does not surrender ultimate ownership of the property.at the end of the ground lease,the district regains possession of the property.during such period of the ground lease,the district may freely substitute other property for the property then controlled by the leasing corporation pursuant to the ground lease.
the tribe argues,first,that the district has no authority to form and utilize the nonprofit leasing corporation,and second,that the financing structure is questionable under contract law because the leases between the district and the nonprofit leasing corporation are not supported by adequate consideration.
the first argument was rejected by the trial court,which concluded that government entities may create nonprofit corporations for the sole purpose of facilitating a cops transaction.indeed,in leon county educational facilities authority hartsfield,so d,a nonprofit corporation was established solely for the purpose of facilitating the financing,acquisition,construction,and equipping of a project by the authority to operate a dormitory and food service project to serve students at the local universities and colleges.the authority entered into a agreement with the nonprofit corporation that was financed through the issuance of cops.similarly,in school board of sarasota county,so d at,the school boards of several counties entered into agreements with nonprofit entities which were financed with cops.those agreements provided for the lease of public land owned by the boards to the nonprofit entities by way of ground leases,the construction or improvement of public educational facilities upon the leased lands and the annual leaseback of the facilities to the respective school boards by way of facilities leases,and the conveyance of the lease rights of the nonprofits entities to trustees by way of trust agreements.see id.
section of the florida statutes authorizes water management districts to issue revenue bonds.section gives water management di
