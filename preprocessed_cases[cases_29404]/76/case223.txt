san francisco baykeeper and citizens committee to complete the refuge collectively baykeeper filed this citizen suit under the clean water act,et,cwa or the act against cargill salt division and cargill,incorporated collectively cargill.baykeeper alleged that cargill discharged pollutants into waters of the united states without a permit.the body of water into which cargill allegedly discharged waste is a,intrastate pond the pond,not determined to be a wetland,that collects polluted runoff within cargill waste containment facility located near the southeastern edge of san francisco bay.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of baykeeper after determining that the pond qualifies as a water of the united states because it is adjacent to a protected water of the united states mowry slough.cargill then brought this appeal.because we conclude that mere adjacency provides a basis for cwa coverage only when the relevant waterbody is a wetland,and no other reason for cwa coverage of cargill pond is supported by evidence or is properly before us,we reverse the district court summary judgment.
background 
cargill and its predecessors have conducted operations at the edge of san francisco bay,in alameda county,california,since the.in,the united states acquired some acres of cargill lands for inclusion in the don edwards san francisco bay wildlife refuge the refuge.cargill retained an easement over acres that permits it to continue its operation.
cargill produces salt by evaporating water from the bay in a series of ponds.the harvesting and refinement of the salt results in the production of waste residue that is heavily saline and contains other pollutants.cargill maintains within the refuge a waste containment facility that it uses for disposal of residue.the northern portion of the disposal site the upper elevation contains a pile of uncovered waste several acres in size the pile.during storms,rainwater carries residue from the upper elevation including the pile to the southern portion of the site the lower elevation where it drains into the pond.an earthen levee separates the southern edge of the pond from mowry slough,a navigable tributary of san francisco bay.the parties agree that mowry slough is a water of the united states.
the horizontal distance between the edge of the slough and the edge of the pond varies considerably depending on the tide.at low tide,the pond and the slough are separated by as much as feet,including the surrounding wetlands.at high tide,however,slough water inundates the wetlands up to the levee and has,on some occasions,overtopped the levee and flowed into the pond.while there is no evidence in the record that liquid has ever flowed from the pond to the slough,the district court made no specific rulings on that issue.cargill from time to time pumps waste water away from the pond to prevent the level of the pond from approaching the top of the levee.
in,baykeeper filed a citizen suit pursuant to against cargill,stating various claims under the cwa arising from cargill alleged unpermitted discharge of pollution into waters of the united states the pond.from the beginning,the parties have disputed whether the pond is within the coverage of the cwa.
in its first motion for summary judgment,baykeeper alleged that the pond is a water of the united states under the migratory bird rule of the environmental protection agency the epa,june,because it is used intermittently as habitat by migratory birds.the district court agreed and granted summary judgment in favor of baykeeper on two claims while appeals were pending here,however,the supreme court issued its decision in solid waste agency of northern cook county united states army corps of engineers swancc,d,holding that the identical migratory bird rule of the army corps of engineers the corps,when applied to isolated intrastate waters,exceeded the corps authority under the cwa.id.at.in light of swancc,we vacated the district court summary judgment and remanded for consideration of whether alternative grounds exist for cwa jurisdiction.san francisco baykeeper cargill salt,cir.
on remand,baykeeper again moved for summary judgment,this time advancing the theory that the pond is a water of the united states because it is adjacent to mowry slough.cargill opposed the motion,arguing that,under controlling regulations,adjacency provides a basis for cwa coverage only in the case of wetlands.baykeeper has apparently never argued or presented evidence that the pond qualifies as a wetland under the applicable regulatory definition.see.
the district court granted summary judgment a second time in favor of baykeeper after determining that bodies of water that are adjacent to navigable waters are waters of the united states and are therefore protected under the clean water act.noting that adjacent wetlands qualify for cwa protection under the applicable regulations and supreme court precedent,the court reasoned that the same characteristics that justif y protection of adjacent wetlands apply as well to adjacent ponds.in support of its determination that the pond is a water of the united states,the district court found as undisputed facts that the pond was adjacent to mowry slough at the time that the suit was filed the soils between the pond and mowry slough are saturated and the berm between the pond and mowry slough leaked and allowed slough water to enter the pond at high tide.
the parties subsequently entered into a settlement agreement setting forth potential remedies contingent on further proceedings,and preserving the right to appeal certain issues including the district court finding of cwa jurisdiction based on adjacency.as part of the agreement,baykeeper waived the right now or in the future to assert any theories of cwa jurisdiction over the site including the pond,other than the adjacent waters theory upon which the district court based its jurisdictional ruling.the district court issued a final judgment incorporating the terms of the settlement agreement,and this appeal followed.

discussion 
we conclude that the district court improperly expanded the regulatory definition of waters of the united states when it held that bodies of water that are adjacent to navigable waters are subject to the cwa by reason of that adjacency.our conclusion is based on the cwa,the regulations promulgated by the agencies responsible for administering it,and the decisions of the supreme court addressing the reach of the act and its regulations.
congress passed the cwa in to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.stat,codified at a.one of its principal provisions prohibits the unpermitted discharge of pollutants into navigable waters.a.the term navigable waters is defined elsewhere in the act to mean waters of the united states.id.
by not defining further the meaning of waters of the united states,congress implicitly delegated authority to the epa and the corps,the agencies charged with the cwa administration.see chevron,usa natural res.def.council,d holding that congressional delegation to an agency may be implicit although the corps initially construed the act to cover only waters,the corps and the epa have since issued nearly identical regulations expanding the definition of waters of the united states to include some intrastate waterbodies that are not navigable in the traditional sense 
as relevant here,current regulations protect not only waters but also tributaries of such waters,waters e waterbodies whose use or misuse could affect interstate commerce,id.waters c,and,most important for our purposes,wetlands adjacent to waters other than waters that are themselves wetlands otherwise covered by the act,id.waters g.wetlands are defined to mean 
areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support,and that under normal circumstances do support,a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.wetlands generally include swamps,marshes,bogs,and similar areas.
under the controlling regulations,therefore,the only areas that are defined as waters of the united states by reason of adjacency to other such waters are wetlands.there is little doubt that the regulatory definition is intended to be exhaustive the context makes that clear,as does the fact that the definition states what waters of the united states means,not what those waters include.see shell oil epa,giving restrictive effect to a definition that states what a term means as opposed to what it includes.disregarding the unambiguous regulations limiting to wetlands the areas subject to the cwa because of adjacency,the district court determined that the pond is covered by the act because the same characteristics that justif y protection of adjacent wetlands apply as well to adjacent ponds.this analysis was improper.
when legislation implicitly grants to an agency the authority to elucidate the meaning of a statutory provision,a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.chevron,at.see also united states mead,d,dep t of ecology epa,cir an agency reasonable interpretation of a statute is entitled to deference even if the agency could also have reached another reasonable interpretation,or even if the court would have reached a different result had it construed the statute initially.this principle applies with particular force where,as here,statutory construction involves reconciling conflicting policies,and a full understanding of the force of the statutory policy in the given situation depends upon more than ordinary knowledge respecting the matters subjected to agency regulations,dep t of ecology,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted parenthesis in original.the district court did not determine,nor was it argued,that the existing regulatory definition of waters of the united states is unreasonable because it fails to include all waterbodies,or some other subcategory of waterbodies,adjacent to navigable waters.moreover,for reasons that will become apparent,it was not unreasonable for the epa to view wetlands as a special category subject to cwa jurisdiction that otherwise would not extend beyond navigable waters.we conclude,therefore,that the district court erred when it found that the pond is subject to cwa jurisdiction solely because it is adjacent to mowry slough.
it is true that,in certain kinds of cases,there is a tension between the purpose of authorized citizen suits and chevron deference.the purpose of the citizen suit provision of the cwa,is to permit citizens to enforce the clean water act when the responsible agencies fail or refuse to do so.for that reason,the cwa provides that a citizen must give sixty days notice to the relevant agency prior to commencing a citizen suit,and can not bring such an action if the agency is prosecuting an enforcement action.see id.b.in most cases,citizen suits are brought to enforce limitations included in a permit issued by the epa,see,sierra club,lone star chapter cedar point oil,cir,and the suit does not call into question any interpretation of the statute by the agency.on occasion,however,a citizen sues because of a discharge that the epa has elected not to regulate.if the decision of the epa is given conclusive deference,the citizen suit would be defeated.suit is therefore allowed despite the epa inaction,and a court may decide whether the offending substance is a pollutant even when the epa has not decided that question.see id.at.thus,we have held that a court may,in entertaining a citizen suit,decide whether a discharge of particular matter into navigable waters violates the cwa even though the regulating agency determined that the discharge was not subject to the requirement of a permit.ass to protect hammersley,eld,and totten inlets taylor resources,cir.
these cases do not,however,justify courts in denying deference to the epa or the corps when,by formal regulation,those agencies construe the meaning of a statutory term that establishes the reach of the cwa that they administer.mead,at.stating that the overwhelming number of our cases applying chevron deference have reviewed the fruits of rulemaking or formal adjudication.indeed,in deciding the merits of the citizens claim in taylor resources,we were heavily guided by the epa definition of point sources in order not to undermine the agency interpretation of the clean water act.taylor resources,at.to decide the present case brought by baykeeper,the district court and we are required to determine whether cargill has discharged pollutants into a water of the united states without a permit.for reasons already stated,it is most appropriate to defer to the administering agencies in construing the statutory term waters of the united states,which establishes the reach of the cwa.deference is especially suitable because this borderline determination of areas to be made subject to the cwa is one that involves conflicting policies and expert factual considerations for which the agencies are especially well suited.see,dep t of ecology,at.because we do not want to undermine or throw into chaos the epa and the corps construction of the statute that establishes the reach of the cwa,chevron deference is required,even in this citizen suit.
baykeeper appears to concede that the regulatory definition of waters of the united states does not support the district court expansive construction.nevertheless,it argues that summary judgment was appropriately granted because the supreme court has repeatedly held that the cwa protects all waterbodies with a significant nexus to navigable waters.this is simply not the case.in united states riverside bayview homes,d,the court held that the corps did not exceed its statutory authority when it defined waters of the united states to include adjacent wetlands.id.at.the supreme court opinion leaves little doubt about two of its foundations that it is up to the corps to determine where waters of the united states end,and that the corps regulation was reasonable in treating adjacent wetlands as a unique category subject to the cwa despite their 
the corps has concluded that wetlands may affect the water quality of adjacent lakes,rivers,and streams even when the waters of those bodies do not actually inundate the wetlands.for example,wetlands that are not flooded by adjacent waters may still tend to drain into those waters.in such circumstances,the corps has concluded that wetlands may serve to filter and purify water draining into adjacent bodies of water and to slow the flow of surface runoff into lakes,rivers,and streams and thus prevent flooding and erosion in addition,adjacent wetlands may serve significant natural biological functions,including food chain production,general habitat,and nesting,spawning,rearing and resting sites for aquatic species.in short,the corps has concluded that wetlands adjacent to lakes,rivers,streams,and other bodies of water may function as integral parts of the aquatic environment even when the moisture creating the wetlands does not find its source in the adjacent bodies of water.again,we can not say that the corps judgment on these matters is unreasonable 
id.internal citations omitted.it is simply not permissible to conclude from this passage that a court is authorized to conclude,when the administering agencies have reasonably ruled to the contrary,that other bodies of water,which are not wetlands,are waters of the united states because they are adjacent to such waters.
sixteen years after bayview,the supreme court in swancc struck down the migratory bird rule,noting that isolated intrastate ponds,unlike wetlands,lack a significant nexus to navigable waters.at.swancc did not hold,however,that the corps would be required to regulate all bodies of water with some nexus to navigable waters,and it certainly did not hold that a court would be free to impose such a regulatory requirement if the administering agencies did not.
