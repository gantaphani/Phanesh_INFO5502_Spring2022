this appeal arises from efforts by the pyramid lake paiute tribe of indians to apply some of its truckee river water rights,as established under a federal court decree,to instream use rather than irrigation.the district court held that the tribe was entitled to change the use of the water rights,but was not entitled to apply the transportation loss portion of the rights.we affirm.
background 
the truckee river originates in california,flows into nevada,and terminates in pyramid lake.the lake is the principal natural feature of the pyramid lake reservation.acting under authority granted to it by the reclamation act of,stat,the federal government initiated the newlands reclamation project to divert water for irrigation from the truckee and carson rivers.because private landowners and the indians of the pyramid lake indian reservation held water rights,the united states brought suit in federal district court in to quiet title to all water rights in the project area.more than thirty years later,the federal district court in nevada entered a final decree adjudicating water rights in the truckee division of the project.united states orr water ditch,equity no.known as the orr ditch decree,it allows owners of water rights to change the place,means,manner or purpose of use of the waters to which the owner is so entitled,as long as they do so in the manner provided by law.
the pyramid lake paiute tribe of indians and the united states,as trustee for the tribe,sought in to make temporary changes to two water rights provided by the decree,claim and.they sought to change the use of water formerly used for irrigation of indian lands so that it would flow unimpeded into pyramid lake,where it would help preserve the tribe fishery.following the procedures specified in the orr ditch decree,the tribe and the united states applied to the nevada state engineer for an initial adjudication.on december,the engineer issued a ruling granting the applications in part.the engineer allowed the tribe to transfer the majority of the it had requested to fishery use approximately percent of its request under claim,and approximately percent of its request under claim,but did not allow the tribe to transfer the remaining portion of the claims.these remaining portions were transportation losses that,in the view of the engineer,could not be transferred to a use that did not entail such losses.
in january,the city of fallon and the irrigation district appealed the state engineer ruling to federal district court.in their appeal,the city of fallon and the irrigation district invoked,which allows a party to obtain an automatic stay of the state engineer ruling on a change application upon timely request and the posting of a bond.the district court issued the requested stay.the united states and the tribe appealed,objecting that the federal rules of civil procedure,rather than the nevada water law statute,should apply.we affirmed,holding that the stay procedure was an inseparable part of the nevada water code and was thus applicable to proceedings under the decree.united states orr water ditch,cir,amended by cir.
on march,the district court decided the merits of the underlying appeal from the state engineer ruling.see united states orr water ditch,d.the district court largely affirmed the engineer,upholding his decision that the tribe is entitled to transfer its water rights under claim and from irrigation to use in furtherance of its fishery in pyramid lake.parties on both sides appealed.this court dismissed the appeal of the irrigation district pursuant to a stipulation of the parties.all that remains is the appeal by the tribe and the united states.
ii.mootness 
the period encompassed by the temporary transfer in this case ended in november,but the question at issue in this appeal will almost certainly arise again.as we noted in orr water ditch,at,the united states and the tribe are repeat players who have stated that they intend to file virtually identical temporary transfer applications in the future.temporary transfer applications may involve changes in water use that are of brief duration such that the period will inevitably expire before any appeal can be heard.thus,for reasons similar to those stated in our previous opinion,this case falls into the exception to mootness for cases capable of repetition,yet evading review.see id.at quoting pac.terminal interstate commerce comm n.
iii.standard of review 
in proceedings under the orr ditch decree,we review the state engineer factual determinations to see if they are supported by substantial evidence.united states alpine land reservoir,cir.we uphold the state engineer legal conclusions as long as they are not contrary to law.id.although we consider the state engineer interpretations of nevada statutes persuasive,they are not controlling.united states orr water ditch,cir.we review de novo the district court conclusions of law.id.
iv.discussion 
the only question squarely presented in this appeal is whether the tribe may transfer the component of its decreed water rights under claim and.under the orr ditch decree,the tribe is entitled under claim to a maximum of of water per year to irrigate acres of reservation bottom lands.it is entitled under claim to a maximum of of one cubic foot per second.this equals a maximum of of water per year to irrigate acres of reservation bench lands.orr water ditch,d at.these maximum figures include an estimated amount of water that will be lost in the process of transporting the water from the river to the irrigated land.
the decree specifically provides as to claim that its allocations are based on an estimated transportation loss of fifteen percent.it further provides that the maximum amount of water diverted shall not exceed acre feet per year for the aggregate number of acres irrigated,while the amount of water applied to the land shall not exceed four acre feet per year for the aggregate number of acres irrigated.emphasis added.the decree provides as to claim that the maximum amount to be diverted from the river is per acre per year,and the maximum amount to be applied to the lands,after taking into account transportation loss,is per acre per year.
the decree general provisions similarly state that the maximum total allocation of water,described above,is based upon an estimate of transportation loss.it explains that the allocation may be modified depending on actual transportation loss 
if it shall appear at any time in regard to the actual use and need of water for irrigation that the amount hereinbefore estimated and allowed to be diverted from the river or stream into any ditch or canal is not sufficient after transportation loss to deliver to the land the flow allowed by this decree for application to the land,the allowance or flow as fixed by this decree for application to the land shall control,and there may,and hereby is allowed to be diverted from the stream a larger amount than the amount estimated for diversion from the stream,to the extent necessary to supply to the land,after actual transportation loss,the flow of water allowed by this decree for application to the land.whether more or less than the amount hereinbefore estimated for diversion from the stream by any ditch,the quantity of water diverted for irrigation shall in every case be only such an amount as will supply to the land,after actual transportation loss,the amount of water allowed by this decree for application to the land and the quantity needed for irrigation thereof.
thus,the constant maximum amount established by the decree is the amount of water allocated by this decree for application to the land.in addition to this amount,the decree accounts for transportation loss by allowing an additional amount estimated for diversion,such that the water applied to the land remains constant after taking into account transportation loss.this additional amount may be adjusted up or down based on actual conditions.
the estimates for transportation loss in the orr ditch decree are based on the assumption that the water will be used for irrigation.water rights holders under the decree are not,however,restricted to that use.
