introduction 
this case involves environmental regulation of municipal storm sewers that carry excess water runoff to the santa ana river as it passes through san bernardino county on its way to the pacific ocean.federal and state laws impose regulatory controls on storm sewer discharges.municipalities are required to obtain and comply with a federal regulatory permit limiting the quantity and quality of water runoff that can be discharged from these storm sewer systems.
in this instance,the regional water quality control board for the santa ana region the regional board conducted public hearings and then issued a comprehensive municipal storm sewer permit governing local public entities.two permittees,the city of rancho cucamonga and the city of upland,among others,filed an administrative appeal with the state water resources control board the state board.the state board summarily dismissed the appeal.the cities of rancho cucamonga and upland then filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint against the state board and the regional board.
the trial court sustained without leave to amend the demurrer of the state board to the entire action.it sustained the demurrer as to four causes of action and granted the motion to strike of the regional board.after a hearing,the trial court denied the petition for writ of mandate.
both procedurally and substantively,the city of rancho cucamonga challenges the conditions imposed by the npdes permit and waste discharge requirements the permit.it contends the procedure by which the permit was adopted was not legal,that the permit conditions are not appropriate for the area,and that the permit requirements are too expensive.because we conclude the permit was properly adopted and its conditions and requirements are appropriate,we reject these contentions.
the national pollutant discharge elimination system

for purposes of this case,the important point is described by the california supreme court in burbank part of the federal clean water act et is the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes,t he primary means for enforcing effluent limitations and standards under the clean water act.arkansas oklahoma,d.the npdes sets out the conditions under which the federal epa or a state with an approved water quality control program can issue permits for the discharge of pollutants in wastewater.a b.in california,wastewater discharge requirements established by the regional boards are the equivalent of the npdes permits required by federal law.burbank,supra,cal th at,d.
california act,et establishes a statewide program for water quality control.nine regional boards,overseen by the state board,administer the program in their respective regions,et,and.water code sections and authorize the regional board to issue federal npdes permits for periods,subd.b b.
as discussed more fully in part below,the npdes permits are subject to the informal hearing procedures set forth for administrative adjudications,et,tit,et the issuance of permits is specifically excluded from the procedures for administrative regulations and rulemaking,et.
factual and procedural background 
the regional board issued the first npdes permit for san bernardino county in.the principal permittee was the san bernardino flood control district the district.the permit required the permittees to develop and implement pollution control measures,using best management practices and monitoring programs,to eliminate illegal discharges and connections,and to obtain any necessary legal authority to do so.the management programs could be existing or new.
in,the district developed the npdes drain area management program damp.
the second npdes permit was issued in and was based on the report of waste discharge rowd prepared by the principal permittee and,including rancho cucamonga.the permit proposed extending the existing program,which included inspections of industrial and commercial sources policies for development and redevelopment better public education and implementation of a monitoring program.it offered a commitment to reduce pollutants to the maximum extent practicable.
in,the permittees submitted another rowd to renew their npdes permit.the rowd proposed continuing to implement and develop water quality management and monitoring programs.
based on the rowd,the regional board staff created five successive drafts of the permit,incorporating written comments by rancho cucamonga and others and comments made during two public workshops.some of the comments addressed the economic considerations of anticipated prohibitive compliance costs.
the notice of the public hearing to consider adoption of the permit hearing announced relevant regional board files are incorporated into the record the governing procedures were those for an informal hearing procedure as set forth in title,california code of regulations,section et and hearings before the regional water board are not conducted pursuant to government code section et,the alternative formal hearing procedure for administrative adjudication.the notice was mailed to all permittees.the accompanying fact sheet,which was publicly circulated,offered further information about the conduct and nature of the hearing and the legal and factual grounds for the regional board recommendation to adopt the permit.
the informal public hearing was conducted on april.neither rancho cucamonga nor any of the permittees objected to the form or substance of the hearing.ultimately,after a staff presentation and testimony,including a statement from rancho cucamonga counsel,the regional board adopted the permit.after the state board dismissed their administrative appeal,rancho cucamonga and upland filed the instant action.
the operative pleading is the second amended petition for writ of mandate and complaint.the petition alleges that the state board and the regional board acted illegally and in excess of their jurisdiction in developing,adopting and implementing the permit.based on pages of general allegations,the petition asserts eight causes of action,alleging the state board and the regional board violated sections,and of the water code the act the california environmental quality act pub.resources code,et the california administrative procedure act,the california constitution and the federal clean water act and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.
the state board successfully opposed the action on demurrer.the regional board eliminated four causes of action,the fourth,fifth,seventh,and eighth by demurrer and motion to strike.on the remaining four causes of action,the trial court found in favor of the regional board.
state board demurrer 
rancho cucamonga maintains the trial court should not have sustained the demurrer of the state board without leave to amend because the state board is the ultimate authority on npdes permits,and,therefore,was properly joined as a party because the state board has for all intents and purposes adopted the rules and policies of general application upon which the permit is based,it is clearly a proper party to this action.
the difficulty with rancho cucamonga theory of liability against the state board is,to quote gertrude stein about the city of oakland,there is no there there.gertrude stein,everybody autobiography.in other words,rancho cucamonga allegations against the state board lack any substance.instead,rancho cucamonga launches an unspecific attack on the state board without identifying any particular problems.the petition makes the unexceptional allegation that the state board formulates general water control policy which it implements and enforces through regional boards.it also alleges the state board has not complied with the administrative procedure act but it does not identify any objectionable policies or how there is no compliance.instead the petition complains about a state board letter directing that all npdes permits follow consistent principles regarding standard urban storm water mitigation plans.additionally,the petition maintains the permit included new reporting requirements and increased costs of compliance.
but the foregoing allegations did not articulate any improper state board conduct.the permit,issued by the regional board and not by the state board,is not subject to formal procedures,subd.b.the state board letter,explaining a precedential decision concerning mitigation plans,is not an example of formal,subd.b.by dismissing rancho cucamonga administrative appeal concerning the permit,the state board declined to become involved and the regional board decision to issue the permit became final and subject to judicial review.people ex rel cal.regional wat.quality control bd.barry d.but the state board was not made a proper party by reason of its dismissal of the administrative appeal.
furthermore,even if rancho cucamonga had identified any cognizable claim against the state board,it would have been barred by the statute of limitations for challenging an improperly adopted state board regulation or order.
we hold the trial court properly sustained without leave to amend the state board demurrer to the second amended petition for writ of mandate and complaint.
standard of review for petition for writ of mandate 
in deciding a petition for writ of mandate,the trial court exercises its independent judgment.code civ,subd.c,subd.d building industry,supra,th at,d.but,i n exercising its independent judgment,a trial court must afford a strong presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings,because the trial court ultimately must exercise its own independent judgment,that court is free to substitute its own findings after first giving due respect to the agency findings.fukuda city of angels cal th,d,fukuda.
on appeal,the reviewing court determines whether substantial evidence supports the trial court factual determinations.fukuda,supra,cal th at,d,building industry,supra,th at,d.the trial court legal determinations receive a de novo review with consideration being given to the agency interpretations of its own statutes and regulations.building industry,supra,at,d nasha city of los angeles th,d.
rancho cucamonga objections to the administrative record and lack of notice 
the notice of the administrative hearing for adoption of the permit included the statement that the regional board files would be incorporated as part of the record.before trial on the writ petition,rancho cucamonga attempted to raise an omnibus objection to the entire administrative record and a specific objection to four documents,three studies about marine pollution and one economic study.the trial court ruled the objections had been waived by not making them before or at the time of the hearing.applying the presumption of administrative regularity,we affirm the trial court evidentiary ruling.mason office of administrative hearings th,d.
the reasons given by rancho cucamonga as to why the trial court should have sustained its objections to all or part of the administrative record are that it did not waive its objections to the record because rancho cucamonga did not know the hearing was adjudicative the regional board did not provide notice of an informal hearing,and rancho cucamonga never had an opportunity to object to the administrative record.
as noted previously,government code section,subdivision b,makes the issuance of an npdes permit exempt from the rulemaking procedures of the administrative procedure act.permit issuance is a,not a,proceeding the exercise of discretion to grant or deny a license,permit or other type of application is a function.sommerfield helmick th,d city of santee superior court d.
instead,the regional board correctly followed the administrative adjudication procedures,et and the companion regulations at california code of regulations,title,sections for informal adjudicative public hearings.these procedures were announced in the notice of hearing which also stated that government code section et,governing formal administrative adjudication hearings,would not apply,thus satisfying government code section requiring notice of an informal hearing procedure.at the time of the hearing,rancho cucamonga did not object to the informal procedure.rancho cucamonga effort to argue that federal notice requirements,subd.b ii should also have been followed fails because this involved a npdes permit adopted according to california procedures.
because rancho cucamonga was given notice that the hearing on the permit would proceed as an informal administrative adjudication,it can not successfully argue it was relieved of the obligation to object to the administrative record at the time of the hearing.an informal administrative adjudication contemplates liberality in the introduction of evidence.cal.code,tit,subd.d and.if rancho cucamonga wished to object to the informal hearing procedures,including the liberal introduction of evidence,it should have raised its objections as provided by statute and regulation before or at the time of the hearing,and cal.code,tit,not a year later in the subsequent civil proceeding.
economic considerations for issuance of npdes permit 
rancho cucamonga next assignment of error is that the regional board failed to consider the economic impact of the requirements of the permit by not conducting a analysis.rancho cucamonga relies on the california supreme court burbank opinion,in which the court held when a regional board is considering whether to make the pollutant restrictions in a wastewater discharge permit more stringent than federal law requires,california law allows the board to take into account economic factors,including the wastewater discharger cost of compliance.burbank,supra,cal th at,d.rancho cucamonga contends that the permit exceeds federal requirements and that,therefore,this case should be remanded for a consideration of economic factors.see,subd.d.
the two problems with this argument are the trial court found there was no evidence that the permit exceeded federal requirements and rancho cucamonga does not explain now how it does so.there was also evidence that the permit was based on a fiscal analysis and a analysis.in the absence of the foundational predicate and in view of evidence that cost was considered,rancho cucamonga contention on this point fails.
we also reject rancho cucamonga related procedural argument that the regional board motion to strike was impermissible as piecemeal adjudication.regan roofing superior court th,d,lilienthal fowler superior court th,d.it is well recognized a court may strike all or part of a pleading as it did in this instance.code civ,and ph ii,superior court th,d.
substantial evidence 
rancho cucamonga also challenges the trial court independent factual determination that sufficient evidence supports the findings of the regional board.rancho cucamonga main contention is that the permit was not distinctively crafted for san bernardino county but,instead,copied a similar permit for other counties without identifying any particular water quality impairment in san bernardino county caused by the permittees.in other words,no evidence in the record supports issuance of the permit and the trial court did not identify any such evidence in its statement of decision.
one problem with rancho cucamonga foregoing argument is that the clean water act requires an npdes permit to be issued for any storm sewer discharge,whether there is any actual impairment in a particular region.communities,supra,th at,d.therefore,rancho cucamonga contention that the permit fails to identify impaired water bodies in the region is beside the point.
in its statement of decision,the trial court discussed the inadequacy of the arguments and evidence cited by rancho cucamonga and concluded the san bernardino permit is based in part on t
