in this case,we determine whether the environmental protection agency epa properly issued a national pollution discharge elimination system npdes permit under the clean water act to carlota copper company carlota.the permit allows discharges of copper into arizona pinto creek,a waterbody already in excess of water quality standards for copper.based upon provisions of the clean water act,the implementing regulations,and their applicability to the factual scenario of this case,we vacate the permit and remand.
factual background 
pinto creek is a desert river located near miami,arizona,approximately miles east of phoenix.it has been listed by the american rivers organization as one of the country most endangered rivers due to threats from proposed mining operations.pinto creek and its riparian environs are home to a variety of fish,birds,and other wildlife,some of which are specially protected.due to excessive copper contamination from historical mining activities in the region,pinto creek is included on arizona list of impaired waters under d of the clean water act,d,as a water quality limited stream due to of water quality standards for dissolved copper.
carlota proposed to construct and operate an copper mine and processing facility approximately six miles west of miami,arizona,covering over acres while extracting about million tons of ore.part of the operation plan includes constructing diversion channels for pinto creek to route the stream around the mine,as well as groundwater walls to block the flow of groundwater into the mine.
in compliance with the national environmental policy act nepa,et,the forest service prepared an environmental impact statement eis,after determining the project would potentially have a significant impact on the environment,and later finalized the document as its final eis forest service feis.the army corps of engineers also prepared an environmental assessment corps ea covering the physical construction of proposed diversion channels redirecting water from pinto creek and the powers gulch stream around the mine and into pinto creek.because the proposed action would involve the discharge of pollutants into pinto creek,carlota applied to the epa for an npdes permit under of the clean water act,in.the epa ultimately issued the permit,and the environmental appeals board appeals board,the internal appellate board of the epa,denied review.
whether the issuance of the permit to discharge a pollutant,dissolved copper,into pinto creek,which already exceeded the amount of dissolved copper allowed under the section d water quality standard,is in violation of the clean water act and the applicable regulations.
whether the epa failure to include and regulate all discharges from the carlota copper mine in the npdes permit violates the clean water act and the applicable regulations.
whether the epa complied with the requirements of the national environmental policy act nepa.
iii.procedural background 
the epa published for public comment a draft npdes permit for carlota in.to fulfill its requirements under nepa,the epa adopted the forest service feis and the corps ea.in response to comments received on its draft npdes permit,the epa amended the draft permit by adding two new conditions requiring additional groundwater discharges to augment the stream flow into pinto creek,and an offset provision whereby carlota would be required to remediate sources of copper loading from an upstream inactive mine site called the gibson mine.
on june,the arizona department of environmental quality arizona deq certified the final permit with the two new conditions as meeting state water quality standards under of the clean water act,and on july,the epa issued an npdes permit to carlota,as well as a record of decision formally adopting the forest service feis and the corps ea for the current permit.
on august,the petitioners filed their first petition for review of the npdes permit and the nepa documents with the appeals board.the petitioners argued that because pinto creek is an impaired water under the clean water act,the epa should establish a total maximum daily load tmdl for copper discharges into pinto creek before issuing carlota permit,the epa did not provide public notice of and a public comment period for the two new permit conditions,carlota needed an additional npdes permit for discharges from the gibson mine site,and the forest service feis and corps ea documents did not consider environmental impacts of the two new permit conditions.
the epa did not respond and,instead,withdrew portions of the challenged npdes permit stating that the permit was not severable from the contested conditions and that the permit should be stayed pending final agency action.the epa then prepared a supplemental environmental assessment epa supplemental ea analyzing only the two new conditions.in response to the petitioners contention of the necessity to establish a tmdl,the epa completed a tmdl for dissolved copper in pinto creek.the epa then provided a public comment period,but only for the two new permit conditions and the epa supplemental ea.the arizona department of environmental quality issued a second certification under of the clean water act in february.in accordance with its new analysis,the epa issued a finding of no significant impact on february,determining it would not have to prepare a new eis,and issued the permit.
on april,the petitioners filed a second petition for review with the appeals board challenging the epa decision to issue the carlota permit.the principal challenges were that the permit should have covered the diversion channels that discharged into pinto creek,the epa must regulate all project discharges,the permitted discharges violated arizona requirements and water quality standards,and the epa violated nepa in several ways.
the appeals board entered its order denying review on september.the epa issued the final npdes permit to carlota,and the petitioners filed for review in this court.
iv.analysis 
objective of the clean water act.
it is important to consider the objectives and purpose of the revisions of the clean water act,which are presently applicable to the considerations involved here.provides 
the objective of this chapter is to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.in order to achieve this objective it is hereby declared that,consistent with the provisions of this chapter it is the national goal that the discharge of pollutants into the navigable waters be eliminated by it is the national policy that the discharge of toxic pollutants in toxic amounts be prohibited.
under the revisions of the clean water act,there is direct federal regulation of the discharge of pollutants from point sources.pronsolino nastri,cir.p oint sources of pollution are those where the pollutant flows from a discrete conveyance,such as a pipe or tunnel.nonpoint sources of pollution are sources and are the responsibility of the states,with certain federal oversight.id.at.an example of a source is runoff from a farmland or timber harvesting.
our pronsolino opinion provides a detailed description of the operation of the clean water act.we here summarize the provisions pertinent to this case.
under of the clean water act,the states are required to set water quality standards for all waters within their boundaries,regardless of the sources of the pollution entering the waters.pursuant to d,d,each state is required to identify those waters that do not meet the water quality standard which is frequently called the d list.for impaired waters identified in the d list,the states must establish a tmdl for pollutants identified by the epa.a tmdl specifies the maximum amount of pollutant that can be discharged or loaded into the waters from all combined sources,so as to comply with the water quality standards.
each state is required to submit its d list and its tmdl to the epa for its approval or disapproval.if the epa disapproves either of those documents,the epa is responsible for preparing that document.the state then incorporates its d list and its tmdl or the epa approved document into its continuing planning process as required by e,e.
in this case,the state had prepared the d list,but it had not prepared a tmdl.therefore,in response to the petitioners objection,the epa prepared the tmdl utilized in its awarding of the permit.
carlota discharge into an impaired waterway.
the petitioners contend that as a new discharger carlota discharge of dissolved copper into a waterway that is already impaired by an excess of the copper pollutant violates the intent and purpose of the clean water act.under the npdes permitting program,i addresses the situation where a new source seeks to permit a discharge of pollutants into a stream already exceeding its water quality standards for that pollutant.section states in relevant part 
no permit may be issued 
i to a new source or a new discharger if the discharge from its construction or operation will cause or contribute to the violation of water quality standards.the owner or operator of a new source or new discharger proposing to discharge into a water segment which does not meet applicable water quality standards or is not expected to meet those standards and for which the state or interstate agency has performed a pollutants load allocation for the pollutant to be discharged,must demonstrate,before the close of the public comment period,that 
there are sufficient remaining pollutant load allocations to allow for the discharge and 
the existing dischargers into that segment are subject to compliance schedules designed to bring the segment into compliance with applicable water quality standards.
the plain language of the first sentence of the regulation is very clear that no permit may be issued to a new discharger if the discharge will contribute to the violation of water quality standards.this corresponds to the stated objectives of the clean water act to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.a.and that it is the national policy that the discharge of toxic pollutants in toxic amounts be prohibited.a.
the epa contends that the partial remediation of the discharge from the gibson mine will offset the pollution.however,there is nothing in the clean water act or the regulation that provides an exception for an offset when the waters remain impaired and the new source is discharging pollution into that impaired water 
the regulation does provide for an exception where a tmdl has been performed and the owner or operator demonstrates that before the close of the comment period two conditions are met,which will assure that the impaired waters will be brought into compliance with the applicable water quality standards.the plain language of this exception to the prohibited discharge by a new source provides that the exception does not apply unless the new source can demonstrate that,under the tmdl,the plan is designed to bring the waters into compliance with applicable water quality standards.
the epa argues that under the requirements of clause,there are sufficient remaining load allocations to allow for the discharge because the tmdl provides a method by which the allocations could be established to allow for the discharge.there is no contention,however,that these load allocations represent the amount of pollution that is currently discharged from the point sources and nonpoint sources,and there is no indication of any plan that will effectuate these load allocations so as to bring pinto creek within the water quality standards.the tmdl merely provides for the manner in which pinto creek could meet the water quality standards if all of the load allocations in the tmdl were met,not that there are sufficient remaining pollutant load allocations under existing circumstances.
with regard to the requirements of clause,the epa argues that the requirement of compliance schedules pertains only to point sources for which there is a permit.this does not correspond to the plain language of clause,which provides the existing discharges into that segment of pinto creek are subject to compliance schedules designed to bring the segment into compliance with applicable water quality standards.i.
we examine that language utilizing the definitions provided in the regulation.the term discharge is defined to mean the discharge of a pollutant.the term discharge of a pollutant,is defined as any addition of any pollutant or combination of pollutants to waters of the united states from any point source.id.at a emphasis added.thus,under the plain language of the regulation,compliance schedules are not confined only to permitted point source discharges,but are applicable to any point source.
the epa contends that this would amount to a complete ban of the discharge of pollution to impaired waters.this is based on its misreading of the plain language of the regulation to state that the remediation has to be completed before carlota discharge.the plain language of clause of the regulation,instead,provides that existing discharges into that segment of the waters are subject to compliance schedules designed to bring the segment into compliance with applicable water quality standards.i emphasis added.this is not a complete ban but a requirement of schedules to meet the objective of the clean water act.
here the existing discharges from point sources are not subject to compliance schedules designed to bring pinto creek into compliance with water quality standards.thus,carlota has not demonstrated that clause of i has been met.this is the regulation upon which carlota and the epa rely for issuance of the permit.
initially,carlota and the epa contended that the first and second sentences of i could be construed to apply independently,thus not requiring compliance with clauses and when an offset would result in a substantial net reduction of pollution to the impaired waters.the petitioners,on the other hand,maintained that the two sentences must be read together,not independently.however,the epa subsequently asked the appeals board to assume,for purposes of this decision,that clauses and do apply.see in re carlota copper,eab.thus,we are concerned in this case with whether the epa required carlota to fulfill all of the requirements of i,including clauses and,in order to issue a permit to it as a new discharger.
the respondents and carlota rely on arkansas oklahoma,d in support of their contentions.that case involved the issuance of a permit for a city in arkansas to discharge effluent into a stream in arkansas that entered a river that eventually flowed into oklahoma.oklahoma challenged the permit before the epa,alleging that the discharge violated oklahoma water quality standards.in that case,the epa found that the discharge would not lead to a detectable change in water quality,which the supreme court held was supported by substantial evidence.arkansas,at.in the opinion,the court stated that the parties have pointed to nothing that mandates a complete ban on discharges into a waterway that is in violation of those standards.the statute does,however,contain provisions designed to remedy existing water quality violations and to allocate the burden of reducing undesirable discharges between existing sources and new sources.see,d.id.at.section d of the clean water act,referred to by the court,is the one that provides for the establishment of water quality standards and tmdls.
the supreme court in arkansas oklahoma also referred to b,which provides for the development of programs to eliminate existing pollution in the context of waste treatment management.id.that section provides details required of any plan to eliminate the pollution,including schedules,time lines,identification of agencies,and identification of measures necessary to carry out the plan.
the appeals board stated that prior agency pronouncements confirm our position that,rather than completely banning new source discharges,i provides new sources with the opportunity to obtain a permit if the requirements specified in that section are met.in re carlota copper,eab.the prior agency position quoted states 
a new source or new discharger may,however,obtain a permit for discharge into a water segment which does not meet applica
