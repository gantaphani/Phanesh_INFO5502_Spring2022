in,federal and state environmental authorities officially recognized the massive polychlorinated biphenyls pcb contamination of the kalamazoo river in michigan by placing a portion of the river on the national priorities list npl.the ensuing litigation over which entities were responsible for what share of the considerable investigation and cleanup costs has traced an oscillation through and between various levels of the federal court system.in the latest appearance in our courthouse,kalamazoo river study group krsg,a consortium of former owners whose facilities polluted the river,appeals two distinct decisions of the district court for the western district of michigan regarding the allocation of investigation and remediation costs to rockwell and eaton corporation eaton.
following the placement of a stretch of the river on the npl,the member companies of the krsg entered into a remediation agreement with state and federal authorities.krsg then filed actions against several other manufacturers who operated facilities on the river,including rockwell and eaton,under the contribution provision of the comprehensive environmental response,compensation and liability act of cercla.see f.following lengthy trials,punctuated by visits to our court,the district court found both rockwell and eaton liable for some of the pcb contamination,but allocated none of the investigation or cleanup costs to rockwell and only a small portion to eaton.
krsg first appeals the district court denial of its motion to reopen the order relieving rockwell of any contribution responsibility.after the district court issued its order,krsg discovered new evidence of increased environmental contamination,prompting it to file the motion to reopen.the district court,construing krsg filing as a motion under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,denied the request as.krsg also appeals the district court order allocating to eaton only a small portion of the investigation costs and none of the future remediation costs.krsg contends that the district court applied an inappropriate standard of liability and that the district court made several errors in its factual findings.
we affirm both district court judgments.
facts and procedural history 
in their nearly battle,these adversaries have amassed a prodigious factual record,brimming with environmental assessments,ecological data,and scientific opinions.we have already comprehensively detailed many of the pertinent factual disputes elsewhere.see kalamazoo river study group rockwell int l,cir rockwell i kalamazoo river study group menasha,cir kalamazoo river study group rockwell int l,cir rockwell ii.however,a brief overview of the litigation is in order.
in,the federal environmental protection agency epa added to the npl a stretch of the kalamazoo river after discovering,in coordination with the michigan department of natural resources mdnr,large pcb concentrations in the river.rockwell i,at.in conjunction with the epa,the mdnr identified several paper mills owned by hm paper,allied,gp,and simpson plainwell paper simpson as the main sources of the pcb contamination.in december,these three mill owners entered into an administrative order by consent aoc with the mdnr,which required them to fund a remedial investigation of the npl site,even though these krsg members did not admit liability for the pcb pollution by signing the aoc.the fort james operating fort james,which also owned a facility located adjacent to the npl site,joined together with allied,gp,and simpson to form the kalamazoo river study group,which would conduct the investigation and of the river.rockwell i,at.
the study of the river,referred to as the remedial study,uncovered massive pcb contamination.the aoc mandated that for the purposes of the,krsg had to study an expanded stretch of the kalamazoo river.the zone included the eaton battle creek plant fifteen miles upstream of the npl site and the rockwell universal joint facility,located in allegan downstream of the npl site.the administrative successor to the mdnr,the michigan department of environmental equality mdeq,ultimately concluded in that the river contained over pounds of pcbs.
pcbs,which accumulate predominantly in organically rich,quiescent areas of the river,present a grave public health risk,mainly because they contaminate fish with potentially cancerous chemical waste.monsanto corporation produced several different varieties of pcbs all under the brand name aroclor,aroclors,and,with the higher number corresponding to a greater pcb molecular weight.the krsg companies used aroclor extensively in their and paper manufacturing operations for several decades beginning in the,and they also used aroclor in transformers,capacitors,hydraulic systems,and paints.throughout the npl site,aroclor is the most prevalent pcb,and the mdeq and epa determined that krsg companies were responsible for the bulk of the aroclor contamination at the npl site.the mdeq also detected aroclors and at the site,the questionable source of which forms the kernel of these appeals.
all four krsg companies have not disputed that they are liable and responsible parties within the meaning of cercla.see.they have,however,claimed that they only contributed minimally to the aroclor and pollution at the npl site and thus another party must be responsible for those pcbs.as responsible parties with a statutory right to contribution from potentially liable parties,see f,the krsg members brought an action in december against rockwell,eaton,and six other companies,including benteler industries and consumers power.krsg alleged that these factory owners were partially responsible for the pcb contamination at the npl site such that they owed krsg contribution for the costs of the investigation and future.
krsg contribution action against rockwell alleged that rockwell allegan facility,which produced universal joints for automobiles and construction equipment,contributed to the pcb contamination at the npl site.the allegan facility was in operation from the early until.in,the epa,in an unrelated action,added the allegan facility to the npl because of arsenic,cyanide,and chromium contamination,but not because of any widespread pcb contamination.soil tests at allegan did reveal the presence of some aroclor along with some aroclor and in the groundwater and light phase liquid the oily film on top of water.even though there existed no definitive proof that rockwell ever purchased pcbs or conducted manufacturing operations that would necessitate the use of oils,the presence of pcbs on the property indicated that it did in fact purchase and employ pcbs in its operation.this fact,however,did not resolve the more salient question of whether these pcbs actually found their way to the kalamazoo river such that they contributed to the overall pollution for which krsg was responsible.in december,the district court held that rockwell did release pcbs into the kalamazoo river npl site and was therefore liable for some of the pollution 
subsequently,in june,the district court set out to determine the precise allocation of costs rockwell owed to krsg.the district court focused almost exclusively on the quantity of pcbs released by rockwell versus the amount leaked by the krsg companies.it determined that g iven the low levels of pcbs on the rockwell property,and the fact that the river sediments and the fish tend to show no significant contribution by rockwell,the court finds that rockwell pcb contribution was very minimal,particularly in contrast to the contribution by ksrg members.joint appendix i at the court ruled that krsg could not recover from rockwell.ksrg appealed,arguing that the existence of a logical discontinuity between holding a party liable and allocating no costs demonstrated that the district court had abused its discretion.we affirmed the district court holding in december there was no inconsistency,and the district court had broad discretion to allocate the costs of the remedial investigation,even if the result was a zero allocation to a liable corporation.see rockwell ii,at.
the immediate circumstances giving rise to this appeal were borne of the acrimonious relationship between the epa and rockwell.in april,the epa revoked rockwell authority to investigate the allegan npl site because of multiple delays and acts of noncompliance by rockwell.throughout and,the epa assumed control of the investigation and discovered that the allegan facility in fact had dramatically higher pcb levels than rockwell had previously disclosed in some instances the new pcb levels were more than one hundred times the previously reported levels.on august,the epa ordered rockwell to abate an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health i at epa order.the epa also noted one pcb plume was then entering the kalamazoo river and another was migrating towards the river.
after learning of the epa order,krsg filed a motion with the district court on september,to reopen the cercla allocation proceedings fifteen months after the court had made its june allocation order.krsg claimed that rockwell had deliberately obfuscated this data in contravention of its statutory duty,and as a result krsg asked the court to use its equitable power to reconsider the allocation.krsg did not refer to its motion as a rule b motion,but on october,the district court ruled as if the motion were of the rule b mold.the district court denied krsg motion because krsg filed it after the time limit for rule b motions had expired.
on appeal,krsg offers several alternative arguments.first,krsg contends that the district court erroneously considered krsg motion as a rule b motion,because cercla itself provides an equitable basis for reopening an allocation order in the face of changed circumstances.second,krsg argues that if rule b does apply,then the district court should have invoked rule b instead of rule b because the district court original order was prospective and accordingly subject to rule b reasonable time limitation,as opposed to rule b time bar.third,krsg implicitly posits that the newly discovered evidence provides a sufficient basis for reallocating the remediation costs.
krsg originally brought a contribution action against eaton because eaton operated three facilities near the kalamazoo river npl site eaton marshall,eaton battle creek,and eaton kalamazoo.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of eaton as to the marshall and kalamazoo facilities in june.eaton battle creek,which is no longer in operation,was located fifteen miles upstream of morrow lake dam and twenty miles upstream of the kalamazoo river npl site.while it was beyond the boundaries of the npl site,it was within the larger confines of the zone.the battle creek facility manufactured automotive parts,namely engine valves and gears,and undisputedly released significant quantities of oil into the river for over four decades.the main question attendant to the contribution action against eaton is whether that oil contained pcbs and if it did,whether those pcbs affected the npl site and the zone.
there is some evidence that eaton battle creek employed oils in its manufacturing processes,although it appears that it did not do so on a regular basis.investigators discovered pcbs primarily aroclors,and in several sewer outditches and in the wood blocks that lined the floor at battle creek.the district court eventually concluded that the pcbs used in eaton battle creek facility were only found in the transformers and capacitors and the hydraulic fluids,and those fluids were not released to the river in any regular or measurable manner.ii at.in other words,eaton minimally used some hydraulic oils in closed systems the oil from these systems did not flush directly into the river and leaked only in small amounts onto the floor and possibly into various sewer ditches on the eaton property.
krsg attempted to prove that eaton pcbs actually entered the river and contributed to the pollution of the npl site or the zone by presenting undisputed evidence that morrow lake,situated between battle creek and the npl site,is polluted with primarily aroclor and minimally aroclor.krsg could not have polluted morrow lake,because it lies upstream of the krsg facilities,so the ensuing questions were whether eaton polluted morrow lake and whether any of the morrow lake pcb contamination impacted the npl site such that upstream polluters of morrow lake should be held responsible as contributing parties morrow lake is contaminated with aroclor constituting ninety percent of the total pcb contamination,and while there is evidence that battle creek wastewater discharge ditch is heavily contaminated with aroclors and at levels comparable to or exceeding the aroclor contamination at the actual npl site,other companies,including clark equipment,used this ditch.evidence also exists that between eaton battle creek and morrow lake,the pcbs appeared in high concentrations in areas with low amounts of organic material,suggesting that when one controls for the presence of organic content a procedure known as carbon normalization,the pcb concentration of aroclors and near battle creek was among the highest in the kalamazoo river area.
in december,the district court ruled that while the evidence showed that eaton did utilize some pcbs in its electrical and hydraulic equipment,any pcb leaks were minimal in volume and sporadic in occurrence,such that eaton was not liable for contribution.however,in assessing liability,the district court employed an improper liability standard,which caused us to remand the case for reevaluation.see kalamazoo river study group menasha,at.in may,the district court,while maintaining its previous holding that there was only the most scant evidence of a measurable pcb discharge into the npl site from battle creek,ruled that it was constrained to find that eaton is liable for some pcb releases to the kalamazoo river.ii at.
the district court then proceeded to receive evidence on the allocation of response costs between krsg and eaton.krsg presented the testimonies of brown and mclaughlin,with the latter stating that he discovered at battle creek pcb concentrations ranking in the upper of all pcb samples taken from the npl site.many of mclaughlin samples,which demonstrate the presence of high pcb concentrations,came from a drainage ditch leading to the river that eaton shared with clark equipment.mclaughlin concluded that battle creek significantly contributed to the pcb contamination at the npl site.
eaton,in response,relied on the testimony of connolly,who testified that the pcb concentrations in the ditch and several of the sample locations near the ditch outfall to the river were not characteristic of the pcb concentrations in the river between battle creek and morrow lake.connolly essentially posited that the aroclor,and concentrations in the general river channel were not consistent with eaton battle creek as a pcb point source.connolly noted the lack of a pcb gradient spanning the distance between battle creek and morrow lake.generally,pcb concentrations will be highest near the pcb source and will increasingly diminish as the distance from that source grows.comparing the kalamazoo river to other rivers with a normal pcb gradient,such as the hudson river in new york and the housatonic river in massachusetts,connolly highlighted the lack of a gradient stretching from the battle creek source to further downstream points.connolly testified that this lack of a gradient contradicted the conclusion that battle creek was a primary contributor of aroclor.connolly bolstered his theory by suggesting that the absence of a high concentration of pcb contamination at the upstream entrance to morrow lake provided strong evidence that facilities closer to morrow lake,such as the benteler industries and consumers power sites,were the true sources of the morrow lake contamination.
on august,the district court ordered eaton to pay ten percent of krsg investigation costs in the zone ten percent of the total investigation cost for that portion equals.first,the court noted that krsg had the burden of proving its equitable right to contribution by a preponderance of the evidence.ii at citing united states meyer,cir.second,the district court rejected mclaughlin testimony in favor of connolly,writing that while it did not find mclaughlin conclusions to be well supported,it found the testimony of connolly to be more persuasive ii at.it reached this conclusion because of connolly credentials and because it had more confidence in the science underlying connolly conclusions.in listing the reasons why it disfavored mclaughlin position,the district court noted that krsg claim that eaton principally contaminated the river with aroclor ignore d other potential sources of pcbs located upstream of eaton battle creek facility that could have contributed to the pcbs found in the former channel and current channel of the kalamazoo river near the ditch.ii at.consequently,the court agreed with connolly dual contentions that other parties contributed to the pcb contamination in morrow lake and that eaton discharged only a de micromis,ii at,amount of pcbs to the ditch.the court found persuasive the argument that only a fraction of this de micromis amount traveled to morrow lake and only a fraction of that fraction actually passed over the morrow lake dam to the npl site.
the court then reached the figure by applying the gore factors outlined in centerior service acme scrap iron metal,cir,and relying almost exclusively on the the amount of the hazardous waste involved.plaintiff experts had estimated that eaton was responsible for forty percent of the aroclors and at the npl site,but the district court rejected this contention as lacking an articulated scientific basis.ii at.instead,the district court accepted connolly estimate that only of the pcbs in the npl site could have come from morrow lake.in sum,the court rejected both the notion that morrow lake was a primary contributor of pcbs to the npl and that eaton was a primary contributor to the pcb contamination at morrow lake.
on appeal of the eaton decision,krsg first contends that a lthough the district court paid lip service to the preponderance of the evidence standard it applied a much more stringent standard,requiring krsg to disprove the potential responsibility of other upstream facilities.krsg eaton br.at.second,krsg claims that the district court committed clear factual errors by accepting the theory that the pcb contamination at morrow lake and at the npl site might have come from sources other than battle creek.
ii.jurisdiction 
the district court had proper jurisdiction over the original contribution action pursuant to b,the jurisdictional provision for cercla actions.the district court ability to hear krsg motion to reopen the allocation proceedings stems from those same jurisdictional provisions.in a november,order,we ruled that we had jurisdiction over krsg appeal from the district court denial of the motion to reopen the allocation proceedings against rockwell.we have jurisdiction over krsg appeal of the district court final eaton allocation decision pursuant to.
iii.analysis 
because krsg two appeals present completely distinct legal and factual issues,we discuss each in turn.first,we examine krsg claim that the district court erred in denying krsg motion to reopen the allocation decision against rockwell.second,we explore krsg argument that the district court erred both in its choice of a standard of liability and its application of that standard to the facts in its eaton allocation order.we hold that the district court acted properly in both instances.
krsg rockwell appeal 
standard of review 
generally,we review the denial of a rule b motion for abuse of discretion.see blue diamond coal trustees of the umwa combined benefit fund,cir.however,we must treat the district court interpretation and application of the federal rules of civil procedure as a question of law and,as with all legal questions,review the district court analysis de novo.jalapeno prop,llc dukas,cir citing indiana lumbermens mut.ins.timberland pallet lumber,cir.the district court decision to construe krsg motion to reopen as one falling under the umbrella of rule b,and more specifically rule b,is clearly an interpretation and application of the rules of civil procedure,and thus we review de novo this portion of the court analysis.
the reopening of allocation orders under cercla 
krsg bases its objection to the district court pigeonholing of its motion to reopen as a rule b motion on the notion that the inherently equitable nature of the cercla allocation mechanism permits the reopening of allocation judgments independent of rule b.krsg argues that cercla allocation orders are subject to revision whenever the equities underlying the decision shift.finding no aspect of cercla that confirms krsg assertion,we disagree.
krsg is certainly correct that principles of equity guide cercla contribution provision,but nothing in cercla compels the conclusion that the equitable underpinnings of an allocation decision exempt it from the requirement that motions to alter judgments be brought under rule b.cercla permits courts to allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate.f.there is nothing in f that suggests that rule b is not the proper vehicle for altering a judgment,and quite the opposite,f clearly states that all claims shall be brought in accordance with the federal rules of civil procedure.presumably,this illustrates congress intention to make cercla allocation decisions no less subject to the federal rules of civil procedure than any other contribution decision.
the crux of krsg argument is that because a district court relies upon equitable factors to make an allocation decision,such a decision is forever subject to revision should there be any alteration in the equities underlying the allocation order.krsg position can not prevail.the equitable basis of cercla allocation decisions does not deprive all allocation orders of their finality.other equitable decisions,such as an order mandating specific performance in a contract dispute,are not automatically subject to future revision.krsg does not point us to any part of cercla in which congress has expressed a desire that all allocation decisions should be considered ongoing or nonfinal such that there is another method by which relief from judgment may be sought other than rule b 
krsg directs our attention to two cases as support for its view that cercla contains an internal mechanism for reopening allocation decisions,but neither opinion persuasively proves krsg contention.in acushnet coaters,a federal district court fashioned an ongoing and provisional cercla allocation order,stating,either party may file with the court,when good cause to do so has developed factually,a motion supported by a showing of a material change in circumstances that justifies a change in the allocation of shares among the parties.id.at.uncertainty about the completeness of the evidence before the court prompted it to permit explicity a reasonable opportunity for any interested party to initiate later proceedings to modify the provisional allocation of equitable shares of legal responsibility id.at.the district court believed that aspects of cercla militated against finality,and it accepted the consequences of delay and greater expense of final adjudication in order to come closer to equitable allocation of legal responsibilities.id.at.the court issued a provisional judgment because of the insufficiency of the evidence before it,which prevented it from assessing equitable shares of legal responsibility with the degree of confidence implicit in findings made on a preponderance of the evidence.id.at.
krsg also cites the seventh circuit opinion in pmc,cir,for the proposition that district courts may always reopen an allocation judgment even in the absence of a rule b motion.in pmc,the district court had made sherwin williams liable for percent of the costs of cleaning up a hazardous waste site.sherwin williams sought contribution because pmc had dumped waste at the site after it acquired the property from sherwin williams.the court recognized that pmc might be responsible for future costs should it be ordered to clean up any waste,other than waste at issue in sherwin williams contribution order,that pmc contributed to the site after it purchased the property.id.at.however,the seventh circuit held that the district judge did not abuse his discretion in ruling that pmc did not owe sherwin williams contribution for already incurred costs because pmc dumped waste may have been too inconsequential to affect sherwin williams cost of cleaning up significantly.id.at.krsg directs our attention to the seventh circuit consideration of whether the allocation of cleanup costs was premature given that it concerned costs that pmc has not yet incurred.hypothesizing,the court confirmed that the allocation was proper because i t economizes on judicial time and it also lets the parties know at the earliest opportunity where they stand.id.the court continued,cooperativeness in doing the actual is a relevant equitable factor that can not be evaluated until the clean up is complete b ut this concern can be accommodated by allowing the district court to make an determination subject to the court revisiting the issue should a failure of cooperation or some other unforeseen circumstance make adherence to the original determination inequitable.id.citations omitted.
what these cases show is not that allocation decisions in cercla cases are inherently subject to change,but rather that courts have the power to fashion relief that is subject to future change.neither case stands for the proposition that cercla provides an alternative route for reopening decisions in lieu of rule b,but rather they affirm the broad equitable powers of the district court.the court in acushnet saturated nearly thirty written pages with an explanation for why a provisional ruling was necessary.while the acushnet court did discuss an ideal of flexibility within cercla,it did not nor could it establish a broad rule that allocation orders were provisional and exempt from rule b.it instead created a provisional order in the face of insufficient evidence when there was a concern that the evidentiary moorings of any fixed allocation would disintegrate in the future.
similarly,krsg focus on pmc is misplaced.the seventh circuit pmc decision only hypothesized about what a district court could do in the face of a premature claim if there were uncertainty about one of the equitable factors,cooperation.the seventh circuit statements in dicta did not establish a ground rule that all allocation decisions based on equitable determinations will always be subject to revisions.moreover,hurting rather than helping krsg argument is the fact that the seventh circuit affirmed the district court decision not to alter the allocation despite new evidence of contamination when the district court concluded that any contribution pmc may have made to the contamination at the site was negligible.
in allocating no costs of the future remediation to rockwell,the district judge mentioned nothing about a provisional order or potential alterations in the future.nor does the language of the district court order leave room for us to infer that the allocation decision was provisional or susceptible to change based upon future events.unlike the lower courts in acushnet and pmc,the district court did not describe how the circumstances of this case or the insufficiency of the evidence left open the possibility for future alteration of the allocation.rather,the district court here simply stated that under the gore equitable factors,rockwell should not be required to contribute to the remediation of the superfund site.the pcb releases by plaintiff members are more than sufficient to justify imposing on plaintiff the entire cost of response activities relating to the npl site.i at.this allocation order does not intimate that the evidence before the district court on any of the equitable factors considered was incomplete such that the order would be subject to revision without a rule b motion.nothing in our opinion,however,should be construed as ruling that district courts can not fashion provisional allocation orders or that district courts must explicitly label an allocation order provisional for a reviewing court to evaluate it as such.as demonstrated by acushnet and pmc,provisional allocation orders can be valuable equitable tools in the event of incomplete evidence.
this was not such an order.there is no reading of the district court opinion that suggests its order was ongoing or subject to change in the future.furthermore,we have been presented with no support for the notion that cercla provides a mechanism independent of rule b for revisiting allocation orders.
the district court choice between application of rule b or rule b 
krsg alternatively contends that if its motion to reopen is viewed as a rule b motion,then the more generous time limits of rule b should apply.the district court analyzed krsg motion as if it were a rule b motion and accordingly denied it as,because krsg filed its motion more than one year after the entry of the allocation order we review de novo the district court decision and hold that there was no error,because the district court initial allocation order was not prospective within the meaning of rule b and accordingly the time strictures of rule b control.
rule b states in pertinent part that the court may relieve a party from a n order when it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.unlike rule b motions,which can not be brought more than a year after an entry of judgment,rule b motions can be made within a reasonable time after the entry of the order.b.the application of rule b here turns on the meaning of prospective.the mere possibility that a judgment has some future effect does not mean that it is prospective because v irtually every court order causes at least some reverberations into the future,and has some prospective effect.twelve john does district of columbia.the essential inquiry into the prospective nature of a judgment revolves around whether it is executory or involves the supervision of changing conduct or conditions.id.at quotation omitted.injunctions permanent or temporary,some declaratory judgments,and particularly consent decrees are prospective judgments susceptible to a rule b challenge.see james moore,moore federal practice.money judgments,however,do not generally have prospective application because they are final in the sense of involving a set monetary outlay.id.at b.
most cases consider rule b prospective application clause in the context of consent decrees,which are prospective by nature.the supreme court in rufo inmates of suffolk county jail,d,held that a plaintiff in litigation could get relief under rule b where a significant change either in factual conditions or in law altered the equitable basis for an ongoing consent decree.id.at.the court made clear in rufo that this rule should not be limited to litigation,but while the court may have intended its analysis to apply to consent decrees involving private parties,the court did not expand the scope of the term prospective so as to encompass more varieties of equitable judgments.we are not aware of any case in which rufo has been applied to judgments other than consent decrees,declaratory judgments,and injunctions,which often require ongoing court supervision and future judicial involvement.see lorain naacp lorain bd.of,cir citing the rufo modification standard in the school desegregation context see also united states,applying rufo less stringent standard to antitrust consent decree outside of the context,but noting that rufo only applies to certain types of injunctive relief alteration in original united states,cir engaging in a rule b analysis when a declaratory judgment for future response costs would have prospective effect and there existed changed circumstances.
we also must heed the requirement that parties can not disguise rule b motions as b motions.what in reality is a b motion can not be labeled as a b motion to gain the benefits of a more generous limitations period.mcdowell dynamics of,cir.krsg complains that the new evidence of pcb dumping at the allegan facility alters the equitable calculus employed by the district court,but its claim sounds very much like a claim regarding newly discovered evidence,which is controlled by rule b.see cmc heartland partners union pac.in re chicago,milwaukee,paul pac.rr,cir considering under rule b claim that party was entitled to relief when there was new evidence regarding cleanup of site in an action concerning a noncontribution provision of cercla.
krsg is incorrect in its assertion that the district court allocation order was prospective in the rule b sense of the word.the district court allocation order was not a consent decree,an injunction,or even a declaratory judgment.rather,the allocation decision stated that rockwell was not responsible for any measurable pcb contamination to the npl site this was a judgment that rockwell was not required to contribute and it did not provide for any future supervision or alteration by the district court.merely because krsg requested contribution for future costs,which the district court denied,and merely because krsg prospective remediation expenses would be higher in a relative sense as a result of the district judge order,does not mean that the order was prospective under rule b.
thus,we agree with the district court decision to apply rule b,which permits motions for relief from orders based upon newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under rule b.b.rule b motions must be brought within one year after entry,which permits a party an extra days more than the usual period to file a motion for a new trial.krsg motion must fail because it was filed more than fifteen months after the entry of the judgment 
krsg eaton appeal 
krsg appeals both the evidentiary standard employed by the district court and the court allocation to eaton of only for ten percent of the investigation and for none of the future cleanup costs.more specifically,krsg claims that the district court paid lip service to the preponderance of evidence standard,while actually employing a much higher and more stringent standard in krsg estimation,the district court held it to an impermissible standard of absolute disproof because it required krsg to demonstrate conclusively that other parties did not cause the pcb contamination in the discharge ditch and in the river.we disagree.we conclude that the district court applied the appropriate preponderance of the evidence standard and neither abused its discretion in allocating only ten percent of the costs to eaton nor committed a clear error in its factual findings.
standards of review 
we review different aspects of the district court order using different standards of review.we review de novo the legal conclusions of the district court,but we review the court factual findings following a bench trial for clear error.menasha,at.we review the district court allocation decision more deferentially,particularly because of the equitable nature of cercla contribution decisions.see franklin county convention facilities auth.am.premier underwriters,cir noting the district court broad discretion in allocating cercla contribution.we will overturn the district court allocation order only if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error of judgment.rockwell ii,at quoting logan dayton hudson,cir.the factual findings underlying the district court allocation order are reviewed for clear error.schroyer frankel,cir see also franklin county,at noting in a cercla contribution opinion that w here two logically permissive interpretations of the evidence exist,the trial judge selection can not be adjudged clearly erroneous on appeal.
the district court application of a standard of liability 
the district court application of a preponderance of the evidence standard is a mixed question of law and fact that we review de novo.cercla contribution plaintiffs must prove that they are entitled to reimbursement by a preponderance of the evidence.see goodrich betkoski,cir.nothing in the wording of the cerlca contribution provision suggests otherwise.see f.in his august allocation order,the district judge wrote that although krsg is not required to prove its case with mathematical precision,or scientific certainty,it still has the burden of proving its equitable right to contribution by a preponderance of the evidence.ii at.krsg asserts that the district court only nominally applied this standard,while effectively holding krsg to a much higher standard.this argument is misguided because the district judge specifically stated that he was employing a preponderance of the evidence standard and even made clear that krsg did not have to prove its case with scientific certainty,or absolute proof as krsg labels it.krsg argument that the allocation order focused too heavily on krsg inability to disprove the possible contamination by other facilities on the kalamazoo river is a contention that the district court misweighed the evidence it is not an assertion that the district court applied an inappropriate burden of proof.
the district court allocation decision 
we affirm the district court judgment because the court neither clearly erred in its factual finding nor abused its discretion in allocating only a small portion of krsg investigation costs to eaton.krsg contends that the district court improperly required krsg to disprove the complicity of potentially responsible parties other than eaton.eaton responds that krsg did not provide enough evidence that eaton could ever be ruled in as a pcb contributor and thus that krsg failure to rule out other potential contributors was only one part of the district court final order.we accept neither view,but rather affirm the district court order because it appropriately weighed the evidence presented by both sides to conclude that eaton was only minimally responsible for some of the investigation costs incurred by krsg.
first,there is no indication that the district court clearly erred in its factual findings.some of the evidence does support the theory that eaton contributed to the pcb contamination for which krsg is responsible.aroclors and,which comprise percent of the pcb contamination at the npl site and ninety percent of the pcb contamination at morrow lake,were found at battle creek.throughout its history,eaton battle creek discharged large quantities of oil to the river,and the wastewater ditch connecting the battle creek facility to the river contained high pcb concentrations,particularly when one controls for the amount of carbon content.additionally,krsg expert,mclaughlin,testified that no other potentially responsible party upstream of morrow lake,including clark equipment with whom eaton shared the wastewater ditch,released as much pcbs to the river as eaton.mclaughlin also concluded that sources closer to morrow lake,such as benteler industries and consumers power,did not release pcbs to morrow lake and thus eaton must be responsible.
eaton countered krsg evidence with support of its own and ultimately the court found eaton proof more compelling than krsg.the evidence presented by eaton showed that it barely used any oils at battle creek and that most of the pcbs found in the wood floors came from transformers and hydraulics.the pcbs in the floor were thus the result of incidental and minor spillage,the oil from which would not have been flushed to the river.eaton expert explained that polluted rivers generally have a higher concentration of pcbs near the source with decreasing concentrations as one travels further from the source.there was no such gradient stretching downstream from battle creek,and the mdnr found scant proof of pcb contamination in the stretch of river between battle creek and morrow lake,which indicated that sources closer to morrow lake,such as benteler industries and consumers power,primarily contaminated the lake with pcbs.such a conclusion was bolstered by the fact that the downstream portions of morrow lake had higher pcb concentrations than the entrance to the lake closer to battle creek if there was an upstream pcb source,the upstream entrance to morrow lake should have had high pcb levels because of its high organic content,but in reality it
