background 
statutory background 
congress enacted the cwa to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.a.in furtherance of the cwa objective of eliminating the discharge of pollutants into the navigable waters,the act prohibits the discharge of any pollutant.cwa a,a.the cwa defines the discharge of a pollutant as any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.cwa.a point source is any discernable,confined and discrete conveyance,including but not limited to,any pipe,ditch,channel from which pollutants are or may be discharged.cwa.
despite a general prohibition on the discharge of pollutants,the cwa also establishes a permit system that authorizes the discharge of some national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes.see cwa.under the npdes,the epa and approved states may issue permits for the discharge of pollutants that meet certain requirements outlined in.taken together,a and prohibit the discharge of any pollutant from a point source into navigable waters of the united states without an npdes permit.envt l advocates epa,cir quoting plains res.council fidelity exploration dev,cir.
npdes permits place limits on the type and quantity of pollutants that can be released into the nation waters.water mgmt.dist.miccosukee tribe of indians,d,and must set forth effluent limitations,ocef,at.effluent limitations are restriction s on the quantit y,rates,and concentration of chemical,physical,biological,and other constituents which are discharged from point sources into navigable waters.cwa.
the specific effluent limitations in an npdes permit are determined according to the more general elgs and nspss,guidelines that are separately promulgated by the epa.cwa b,b cwa b,b dupont de nemours train,d.elgs are restrictions on water pollution that apply to sources of pollution already in existence,see cwa b nspss are restrictions that apply to new sources of pollution.cwa a.a approach to water quality focuses on the achievable level of pollutant reduction given current technology.ocef,at see also waterkeeper alliance,epa,cir stating that elgss and nspss are,because they are established in accordance with various technological standards that the act statutorily provides for example,the best available technology economically achievable or the best conventional pollutant control technology and that these standards vary depending upon the type of pollutant involved,the type of discharge involved,and whether the point source in question is new or already existing.
section m provides that,every two years,the epa shall publish in the federal register a plan which shall identify categories of sources discharging toxic or nonconventional pollutants for which elgs and nspss have not yet been published,and establish a schedule for promulgation of effluent guidelines for categories identified.under this schedule,the promulgation of these guidelines shall be no later than years after the publication of the plan.id.elgs and nspss are relevant to this appeal because the plaintiffs claim that the epa violated a duty to promulgate elgs and nspss for the construction industry after it was listed as a category in a plan developed under m.
administrative proceedings 
in march,the epa announced that it was undertaking rulemaking to address pollution from storm water discharge associated with construction activities,specifically for new development,as well as to those associated with redevelopment activities,march.in its public notice,the epa stated that it chose to begin development of elgs for the construction and development industry,in relevant part,to support applicable state and local requirements for erosion and sediment controls and storm water best management practices,because s tate and local requirements vary widely and s ediment loadings from construction site discharges can be orders of magnitude higher than those associated with discharges from undisturbed areas,and also because construction site runoff can contribute high loadings of nutrients and metals to receiving streams.id.in,the epa published its final notice of an effluent guidelines plan,which listed construction activities as a category requiring guidelines under m.
on june,the epa issued a proposed rule to address storm water discharge from construction sites,june.the epa did not set forth a single proposed rule,but described three options it was considering.option was to establish minimum requirements for conducting site inspections and providing certification as to design and completion of controls required by the authority issuing npdes permits.id.at.option would establish elgs as well as the minimum requirements comprising option.id.option would establish no new requirements,and b oth the control requirements and the certification requirements would be left to the best professional judgment of the permitting authority.id.
on april,the epa published its final action under the caption proposed rule withdrawal,april.the epa stated t his action withdraws the proposed elgs and nspss that epa proposed for the construction and development industry on june.id.at.it further stated,w e have decided not to promulgate elgs and standards for the construction and development industry and instead have selected the option option that relies on the range of existing programs,regulations,and initiatives at the federal,state,and local level for the control of storm water runoff from construction sites.id.at.
the epa explained its decision not to promulgate elgs and standards by stating that it believed that construction site storm water discharges were already being adequately addressed because the existing npdes regulations require permits for the vast majority of construction sites nationwide,and that the cost was simply too high and disproportionately large given the reductions that would be attributable to the proposed elgs.id.the epa had determined that the annual cost of the proposed elgs would be more than half a billion dollars and would result in the displacement of a number of jobs while the existing permit programs were capable of controlling of sediment runoff from construction sites and the proposed rule would only remove an additional more.id.the epa also decided not to promulgate nsps s because discharges associated with construction activity generally are not appropriately characterized as new sources,and the epa believed that the definition of new source should be read to exclude construction sites.id.at to include construction activity itself within the definition of a new source would be to view construction sites as things that are themselves constructed.
in subsequent years,the epa removed the construction industry from plans it published under m.see.in its plan,the epa stated 
t he analysis under cwa section m b applies only to industrial categories of sources that are discharging amounts of toxic or nonconventional pollutants to waters of the united states.epa did not consider,under this analysis,industrial activities where conventional pollutants,rather than toxic or pollutants,are the pollutants of concern.for example,although epa had identified stormwater discharges from the construction industry as a new category in its and effluent guidelines program plans,epa is not identifying the construction industry in this plan based on new information that discharges from this activity consist predominately of conventional pollutants under cwa a,in this case total suspended solids.
at.in its plan,epa similarly stated that it did not identify the construction industry because its discharges consist almost entirely of conventional pollutants,and that the epa mistakenly identified this industry under section m b in the plan,not realizing that its discharge was so composed.at.according to the epa,it corrected its mistake by removing the industry from its plan.id.
district court proceedings 
nrdc and the brought this suit to challenge the epa decision not to issue elgs and nspss for the construction industry after it had listed the industry in a plan it issued under m.the epa and the moved to dismiss,claiming that this court,not the district court,had original jurisdiction pursuant to b e,b e,that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue,and that certain claims were precluded the district court denied the motion to dismiss.
the district court granted the plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment on the basis that the epa failed to comply with the cwa by not performing its duty to promulgate elgs and nspss for the construction industry.the district court issued a permanent injunction requiring the epa to issue elgs and nspss for the construction industry no later than december.defendants now appeal these rulings.
discussion 
district court original.standard of review 
we review a district court assumption of jurisdiction de novo.united states bennett,cir.we also review a district court interpretation of the cwa de novo.league of wilderness mountains biodiversity project forsgren,cir.
cwa a grants the district court jurisdiction over suits against the administrator where there is alleged a failure of the administrator to perform any act or duty under this chapter which is not discretionary with the administrator.section a is an exclusive grant of original jurisdiction to the district courts.trustees for alaska epa,cir.cwa b e grants the courts of appeal jurisdiction to r eview the administrator action in approving or promulgating any effluent limitation or other limitation under section,or of this title.section b e is an exclusive grant of original jurisdiction to the courts of appeal.ocef,at referring to b as the circuit court exclusive jurisdiction maier epa,cir calling the court of appeals jurisdiction under b exclusive.however,we have cautioned that our jurisdiction under b is not to be construed expansively,particularly given the specificity and precision that congress used in identifying the actions that fall under b.envt l advocates,wl,at.
defendants argue that the district court erred in exercising jurisdiction under a,and that this court has exclusive original jurisdiction over plaintiffs claim that the epa violated its duty to promulgate elgs and nspss under b e plaintiffs argue that the district court properly exercised its jurisdiction.we agree with plaintiffs,and we hold that where a plaintiff alleges that the epa has failed to perform a duty under the cwa and the plaintiff does not challenge the substance of any existing regulations,the district courts have exclusive jurisdiction under a.
in trustees for alaska,the nrdc alleged a failure by the epa to comply with a nondiscretionary duty to promulgate rules.at.we concluded that the district court had exclusive jurisdiction over the action under a,stating that where a plaintiff alleges a failure by the epa to perform any act or duty under the cwa which is not discretionary,the federal district courts have exclusive jurisdiction.id.quoting cwa a.here,as in trustees for alaska,the plaintiffs have alleged a failure by the administrator to perform a duty.id.t he epa has not yet promulgated regulations establishing elgs governing the placer miner industry.
we acknowledge that the underlying facts in trustees for alaska differ slightly from the facts of this case.though the epa did not promulgate elgs for the relevant industry in either case,in trustees for alaska,the agency had not undertaken a rulemaking or any other procedural step towards promulgating elgs.in contrast,here,the epa gave notice and provided comment periods and proposed three options before choosing not to promulgate elgs and nspss related to storm water runoff from construction sites.and,as a result of its rulemaking,the epa made an affirmative choice to rel y on the range of existing programs,regulations,and initiatives at the federal,state,and local level for the control of storm water runoff from construction sites.at.
this distinction does not affect our jurisdictional analysis,however,because plaintiffs do not challenge the substance of any of these existing programs or regulations.plaintiffs do not discuss the substance of any existing regulations or express any opinion concerning the existing regulations.thus,just like the plaintiffs in trustees for alaska,plaintiffs here are concerned exclusively with the epa failure to promulgate certain guidelines.such an action falls squarely within the district court jurisdiction.trustees for alaska,at see cwa a granting the district court jurisdiction over suits against the administrator where there is alleged a failure of the administrator to perform any act or duty under this chapter which is not discretionary with the administrator.
indeed,the fact that plaintiffs do not challenge the substance of any existing regulations is precisely why b e is inapplicable.section b e grants the court of appeals jurisdiction to r eview the administrator action in approving or promulgating any effluent limitation or other limitation under section,or of this title.even if,as defendants argue,we could construe the epa decision to rely on existing regulations as an approval of an other limitation under one of the enumerated sections,this is insufficient to bring plaintiffs claim within b e.this is so because plaintiffs do not seek a review of the existing regulations that the administrator is alleged to have approved.
to the extent any doubt remains about whether the district court had original jurisdiction over plaintiffs claim,it is easily resolved by our recent decision in our children earth foundation.in ocef,environmental groups contended that the epa failed to fulfill its mandate to review effluent guidelines and limitations in a timely manner and in accord with standards.at.the court affirmed the district court exercise of jurisdiction under a,stating that this court exclusive jurisdiction under b extends only to a substantive review of the appropriateness of the guidelines actually promulgated,and not to the threshold question of whether the statutory requirements of the cwa have been met.id.at emphasis added see also envt l advocates,at section b e authorizes original court of appeals jurisdiction for challenges to regulations that establish numerical limitations and similar limits.because plaintiffs never requested such a substantive review,but rather asked the district court to answer the threshold question of whether the statutory requirements of the cwa were met with respect to regulating storm water runoff from construction activities,ocef confirms that the district court exercise of jurisdiction under a was proper.at.
this case differs from the tenth circuit decision in maier precisely because plaintiffs are not requesting a review of existing regulations.in maier,the court held that it had jurisdiction under b e to hear a challenge to the epa denial of a petition requesting that the epa initiate a rulemaking on certain cwa regulations.at.at first glance,maier bears some similarity to this case because the plaintiff in maier challenged the epa choice not to take a certain action.see id.at.in maier,however,as a part of his challenge,the plaintiff argued that the existing regulations were inadequate.id.the maier court noted that it had no difficulty construing the suit as a challenge to an action in approving or promulgating under b e because the plaintiff was essentially challenging the sufficiency of the epa secondary treatment regulation.id.at.indeed,the court specified that w here petitioners challenge is to the substance of a regulation that the agency has already promulgated,exclusive jurisdiction in the court of appeals may not be evaded merely by styling the claim as one for failure to revise.id.emphasis added.moreover,the maier court went on to distinguish the case before it from trustees for alaska and other cases,like this case,where the epa had failed to issue the disputed regulations at all.id.at.
pennsylvania department of environmental resources epa,cir,also supports our analysis.that case involved the epa promulgation of nspss for the coal mining industry.id.at.the epa had added the coal mining industry as a new category of point sources and promulgated regulations but,for certain water polluting discharges,the regulations issued merely deferred the promulgation of regulations.id.at.noting that the plaintiffs were seeking to compel the epa to perform a duty to promulgate nspss,the court concluded that the suit should have been brought in district court under a.id.at.
significantly,the third circuit noted that in cases where the courts of appeal have jurisdiction to review a failure to act under,the review focuses on the substance or effect of promulgated regulations and not a petitioner request that the epa be ordered to promulgate new or different regulations.id.at.we agree with the third circuit that an allegation of inadequacy of a set of regulations is quite different from what plaintiffs allege here that a needed regulation was nonexistent.id.we therefore hold that the district court properly exercised its jurisdiction over plaintiffs claim that the epa had violated its duty to promulgate elgs and nspss for the construction industry under a.
standard of review 
we review a district court determination of standing de novo.buono norton,cir.
plaintiffs 
organizations have standing to sue on behalf of their members when a the members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right b the interests the organization seeks to protect are germane to the organization purposes and c neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.ecological rights found.pac.lumber,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the challenge only whether the members of the plaintiffs nrdc and waterkeeper alliance have standing to sue in their own right under article iii we conclude that they do.
to meet article iii standing requirements,the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden to show that it has suffered an injury in invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical that the injury is fairly trace able to the challenged action of the defendant and that it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan defenders of wildlife,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.in addition to these article iii standing requirements,our exercise of jurisdiction is also limited by prudential considerations.bennett spear,d.one such consideration is whether a plaintiff grievances arguably fall within the zone of interests protected or regulated by the statutory provision invoked in the suit.id.section a of the cwa is,however,a provision that extends standing to the outer boundaries of article iii.ecological rights,at citing middlesex county sewerage auth.sea clammers ass n,d.as a result,we need not consider whether plaintiffs have prudential standing in this case.
we turn first to whether the members of the plaintiffs have suffered an injury in fact.the injury in fact requirement in environmental cases is satisfied if an individual adequately shows that she has an aesthetic or recreational interest in a particular place,or animal,or plant species and that that interest is impaired by a defendant conduct.see also ocean advocates army corps of eng rs,cir stating that injury in fact requires an individual to show a connection to the area of concern sufficient to make credible the contention that the person future life will be less enjoyable if the area in question remains or becomes environmentally degraded internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the injury to the plaintiff,not to the environment,is the relevant showing.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d.
members of the nrdc and waterkeeper alliance have submitted several declarations averring that they have suffered an injury in fact.these declarations state that the members have,for years,used particular waterways for aesthetic and recreational purposes.they also state that the individuals use and enjoyment of those waterways has been diminished due to storm water discharge from construction sites,and many declarations describe having observed storm water discharge flowing directly from construction sites into the waterways the members use.the supreme court found similar evidence sufficient to establish injury in fact in friends of the earth.in that case,the court concluded that the environmental group members established injury in fact where their reasonable concerns about the effects of laidlaw discharges,directly affected their recreational,aesthetic,and economic interests.friends of the earth,at.similarly,here,the members statements that their use of specific waterways has been diminished due to their concerns about discharge from a particular source here,the construction sites are sufficient to establish injury in fact.
also argue that the members of the plaintiffs can not show that their injury is fairly trace able to the challenged action of the defendant or redressable by the relief they,the epa promulgation of elgs and nspss.lujan,at.these factors,both of which address causation,are closely related and we discuss them together.see allen wright,d noting that the traceability and redressability requirements of article iii standing are closely related.
at the outset of this analysis,we observe that plaintiffs showing on these two their injuries are traceable to the epa failure to promulgate elgs and nspss and would be redressed by the epa promulgation of elgs and be entirely precise absent knowledge of the substance of the regulations that the epa would promulgate if required to do so as the district court noted,to require a precise showing would mean that no plaintiff would have standing to bring such a suit,as one can not demonstrate the efficacy of regulations that have yet to be issued.thus,plaintiffs can satisfy the traceability and redressability factors by showing that the type of storm water discharge causing their injury is that which elgs and nspss aim to address,and that elgs and nspss are likely to reduce the risk of the pollution causing their injury.see ecological rights,at acknowledging that the cwa rules are designed to reduce the risk of pollution.plaintiffs have made this showing.
first,the members declarations support that the pollution they complain of is that which elgs and nspss aim to address.the members declarations support that storm water discharge flows from active construction sites into the bodies of water they use and enjoy,and that the storm water runoff they complain of is polluting and diminishing the quality of the bodies of water they use.see,anna slawsky decl.i have personally seen sediment run off from a construction site and a construction site puppy creek runs brown from this site in lowell during rains and the erosion along route mentioned above.michael mullen decl.b eginning in until the present day,i have conducted inspections of the prospect ridge subdivision extension in troy,alabama a number of my inspections at prospect ridge were made during or just following rain events.during my inspections i witnessed runoff with very high turbidity and excessive amounts of sediment entering streets and subsequently storm drains or unnamed tributaries to big creek.don mcenhill decl.i have personally witnessed construction activities causing major discharges of pollutants,including sediment,and documented well over construction sites releasing pollutants into the russian river watershed.id.during the rain season of,i conducted several site visits at the vintage greens subdivision development in windsor,california.i was interested in this development because it was a large development and stormwater discharged would flow into the windsor creek and then to the russian river.during my visits i witnessed constant stormwater flows containing sediment from the construction site brown in color and very turbid.constance powell decl.construction and development is continuing i have personally seen sediment run off from construction sites flow directly to lake johnson.in one declaration,michael mullen,the choctawhatchee riverkeeper and the director of the center for environmental research and service at troy university,described how he sampled the turbidity of two tributaries and concluded that,as a result of construction runoff,the turbidity downstream from the construction site was higher than the turbidity upstream in both tributaries.michael mullen decl.
contend that the plaintiffs causation evidence is nevertheless insufficient because they have not definitively established that the pollution they complain of is composed of the toxic and pollutants that elgs and nspss address.we disagree.by including the construction industry in plans issued pursuant to m,the epa necessarily identified the construction industry as a source of toxic and nonconventional pollutants.see cwa m b requiring the epa to publish a plan identifying categories of sources discharging toxic or nonconventional pollutants for which guidelines have not previously been published emphasis added.in fact,the epa has explicitly stated that storm water runoff from construction sites includes toxic and nonconventional pollutants 
american petroleum institute epa,does not suggest that any further evidence of causation is required in this case.in american petroleum institute,the plaintiffs challenged the epa decision not to list sediment found in discarded unleaded gasoline storage tanks ugsts as hazardous waste under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra.id.at.the plaintiffs standing was challenged on the ground that they failed to link the harms of which their members complain with the regulatory actions that they wish epa to take.id.the circuit faulted the plaintiffs for failing to present evidence that the landfills that their members lived near were of a class substantially likely to receive shipments or that the effects of ugsts are evident in the landfill groundwater.id.at.the court further noted that the affidavits the plaintiffs submitted did not trace the pollution of concern to ugsts waste.id.at.in contrast to the plaintiffs in american petroleum institute,who were challenging the epa failure to classify one particular pollutant as hazardous waste,the plaintiffs here allege the epa has violated a statute designed to reduce the risk of pollution.we have previously noted that the cwa,in contrast to the statute at issue in american petroleum institute,embodies a range of prophylactic rules designed to reduce the risk of pollution.ecological rights,at.and we have further stated that i t is not necessary for a plaintiff challenging violations of rules designed to reduce the risk of pollution to show the presence of actual pollution in order to obtain standing.id.
second,by requiring effluent limitations,which are developed according to elgs and nspss,as a part of a strategy to eliminate the discharge of pollutants and restore and maintain the integrity of the nation waters,a,congress has expressed its view that developing elgs and nspss reduces the risk of the pollution causing the members injury.where congress has expressed the need for specific regulations relating to the environment,that expression supports an inference that there is a causal connection between the lack of those regulations and adverse environmental effects.see wildlife fed n,at see also alaska ctr.for the env t browner,cir noting that plaintiffs could meet the redressability requirement because congress had already determined the relief they sought was the appropriate means of achieving desired water quality where other methods had failed int l ladies garment workers union donovan,a s congress passed the act partly to provide redress to employers from unfair competition,the suggestion that effective enforcement of the act will not have this effect directly contravenes the congressional judgment underlying the act.
together,the members declarations establishing that storm water discharge from the construction industry is polluting the waterways they use,the epa findings that such discharge may consist of toxic and pollutants,and congress determination that elgs and nspss reduce the risk of such pollution,are sufficient to establish traceability and redressability.based on the foregoing,we conclude that the plaintiffs have standing.
only one of the plaintiffs must have standing to permit our review.thus,we consider the standing,a matter that challenge,only very briefly.see massachusetts epa.at only one of the petitioners needs to have standing to permit us to consider the petition for review.as with the plaintiffs,the contend that the do not claim an injury that is traceable to the epa decision not to promulgate elgs and nspss or that would be redressed by the promulgation of elgs or nspss.
claim an injury to their proprietary interest in protecting their waterways see city of sausalito,cir a municipality has a proprietary interest in protecting its natural resources from harm.specifically,they claim that they are injured by the increased pollution in their waterways from upstream,construction sites due to the absence of national standards to govern storm water runoff from construction sites.this injury is sufficient to constitute an injury in fact.see id.concluding that the city of sausalito met its burden to establish an injury in fact based on its proprietary interests.
the have also submitted declarations to establish that the pollution they complain of is connected to a lack of national standards.patricia primi,an environmental scientist in the environmental protection bureau of the new york state office of the attorney general,submitted a declaration attesting that storm water runoff from construction sites in vermont,new hampshire,and massachusetts is contributing pollutants to the long island sound,and that storm water runoff from vermont is contributing pollutants to the lake champlain basin.patricia primi decl.angus eaton,the chief of the general permits section in the division of water for the new york state department of environmental conservation,submitted a declaration supporting that the upstream states to which primi referred have different discharge standards enabling a discharge downstream of excessive amounts of pollutants found in stormwater runoff from construction sites.angus eaton decl.and,as stated above,we take into account congress view that the promulgation of elgs and nspss will reduce the likelihood of the pollution of which the complain.see supra section.a.we therefore conclude that the also have standing.

we must decide whether the epa had discretion to determine whether to promulgate elgs and nspss for storm water runoff from the construction industry once it listed the construction industry as a point source category in a p
