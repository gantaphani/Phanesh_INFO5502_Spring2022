allegretti company allegretti appeals a judgment entered under code of civil procedure section in favor of the county of imperial county on allegretti inverse condemnation action seeking just compensation for county alleged taking of allegretti right to use groundwater underlying its property.county had approved allegretti application for a conditional use permit to activate a well on its property on the condition,imposed under a county ordinance,that allegretti extract no more than per year of water from the aquifer underlying its property.at the close of allegretti liability case,the trial court ruled there was no compensable taking and entered judgment on specific findings,inter alia,that county restriction did not deprive allegretti of all economically viable use of its property,and allegretti had not shown county regulation did not advance a legitimate state interest.
on appeal,allegretti contends county action was without jurisdiction and constituted a physical taking of its water rights,mandating just compensation under the federal and state constitutions.allegretti further contends that assuming county action amounted to a regulatory taking,compensation was mandated because the regulation deprived it of all economically beneficial or productive use of its land the penn factors of economic impact,interference with expectations,and character of the governmental action compel a finding that the regulation effected a taking and county unauthorized action failed to substantially advance a legitimate state interest.finally,allegretti contends the trial court misapplied the law pertaining to temporary takings in reaching its conclusions,requiring reversal of the judgment.
we conclude county actions,either during the course of the permitting process,in approving the permit with the use restriction,or in defending against allegretti inverse condemnation action,did not effect a physical or regulatory taking.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
allegretti owns property in imperial county that overlies groundwater basins,which are accessed by allegretti and its farmer tenant for irrigation purposes via wells and pumps.in october,allegretti filed with county an application for a conditional use permit to redrill an inoperable well,one of several existing wells on the property,so that it could add approximately acres of land for crop production.allegretti tenant used the remaining operating wells to actively farm portions of the land between and.in june,county approved the conditional use permit for allegretti redrilling project subject to certain conditions,including one limiting allegretti draw of groundwater to per year from all production wells on site.allegretti did not record the permit and it never took effect.allegretti acknowledges there are no present restrictions on the use of water from its existing wells.
in november,allegretti sued county for inverse condemnation in part,it alleged county had no jurisdiction to require allegretti to obtain a conditional use permit,and that a regulatory taking resulted from county requirement that allegretti obtain a permit and show reactivation of its well would not significantly or adversely affect either the environment or the groundwater basin county successfully demurred to the complaint on the ground allegretti had failed to seek a writ of administrative mandamus and thus it did not state a cause of action since county had jurisdiction under imperial county ordinance sections et hereafter the ordinance to issue a conditional use permit for the well reactivation in an unpublished opinion on allegretti appeal of that order allegretti i,supra,we reversed the judgment.we concluded that although county had general regulatory authority to control allegretti use of the water underlying its property,see baldwin county of tehama th,d,the record on appeal did not show county was acting on standards specific enough to permit it to limit allegretti groundwater use.allegretti i,supra.the sole question resolved by our decision in allegretti i was whether allegretti was required to pursue a writ of administrative mandate before filing its action for inverse condemnation.ibid.
following remand,the matter proceeded to a bifurcated trial on allegretti inverse condemnation cause of action,with a first phase bench trial on liability to precede a second phase on the issue of just compensation.at the close of allegretti liability case,county moved for judgment under code of civil procedure section.the court granted the motion.in its statement of decision,the court ruled,inter alia,county application of section of the ordinance did not deprive allegretti of all economically viable use of its property.the court found,t he sole evidence at trial was that a significant portion of the property is farmed by a tenant who is paying rent to allegretti there is no evidence that allegretti has been denied all viable use of the property.the court further found,allegretti evidence failed to show that the conditions placed on issuance of the permit would have any economic impact at all.c ounty restricted total groundwater removal to per year as a condition to well allegretti offered no evidence that it had the ability to extract water in excess of absent the restriction.finally,the court ruled allegretti did not show county regulation failed to advance a legitimate state interest.
the court entered judgment accordingly.allegretti appeals.
discussion 
standard of review 
the standard of review of a judgment and its underlying findings entered pursuant to code of civil procedure section is the same as a judgment granted after a trial in which evidence was produced by both sides.in other words,the findings supporting such a judgment are entitled to the same respect on appeal as are any other findings of a trial court,and are not erroneous if supported by substantial evidence.san diego metropolitan transit development bd.handlery hotel,th,d.when the decisive facts are undisputed,however,the reviewing court is confronted with a question of law and is not bound by the findings of the trial court.citation.in other words,the appellate court is not bound by a trial court interpretation of the law based on undisputed facts,but rather is free to draw its own conclusion of law.ibid.
whether there was a compensatory taking is a question of law,and we are not bound by the lower court interpretation of the evidence presented on the question below.yee mobilehome park rental review bd.th,d see also bass enter.prod.united states,whether a taking is compensable under the fifth amendment is a question of law based on factual underpinnings.
ii.general principles of takings law 
the state and federal constitutions guarantee real property owners just compensation when their land is taken for public use cal,art.i,lingle chevron,d lingle herzberg county of plumas th,d.the fifth amendment takings clause,made applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment,does not prohibit the taking of private property,but instead places a condition on the exercise of that power.lingle,supra,at.at.in other words,it is designed not to limit the governmental interference with property rights per se,but rather to secure compensation in the event of otherwise proper interference amounting to a taking.ibid.
the paradigmatic taking requiring just compensation is a direct government appropriation or physical invasion of private property.lingle,supra,at.at.but government regulation of private property may,in some instances,be so onerous that its effect is tantamount to a direct appropriation or ouster and such regulatory takings may be compensable under the fifth amendment.lingle,supra,at.at.supreme court precedents recognize two categories of regulatory action that generally will be deemed per se takings for fifth amendment purposes.ibid.first,where government requires an owner to suffer a permanent physical invasion of his as minor as cable lines and boxes bolted onto an apartment building roof and exterior must provide just compensation.id.at.at,citing loretto teleprompter manhattan catv,d loretto see also yee city of escondido,d the government effects a physical taking only where it requires the landowner to submit to the physical occupation of his land.a second categorical rule applies to regulations that completely deprive an owner of all economically beneficial use of her property.lingle,supra,at.at,quoting lucas south carolina coastal council,d lucas.i n lucas the high court held that the government must pay just compensation for such total regulatory takings,except to the extent that background principles of nuisance and property law independently restrict the owner intended use of the property.lingle,at.at.
outside these two categories,regulatory takings challenges are governed by the essentially ad hoc,factual inquiries set forth in penn central,supra.lingle,supra,at.at penn central,at.herzberg,supra,th at,d.there is no set formula,but several factors have particular significance.citation.primary among those factors are t he economic impact of the regulation on the claimant and,particularly,the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct expectations.citation.in addition,the character of the governmental action for instance whether it amounts to a physical invasion or instead merely affects property interests through some public program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good may be relevant in discerning whether a taking has occurred.citation.the penn central each has given rise to vexing subsidiary served as the principal guidelines for resolving regulatory takings claims that do not fall within the physical takings or lucas rules.lingle,at.at see herzberg,at,d.
each of these penn central inquiries aims to identify regulatory actions that are functionally equivalent to the classic taking in which the government directly appropriates private property or ousts the owner from his domain.accordingly,each of these tests focuses directly upon the severity of the burden that government imposes upon private property rights.lingle,supra,at.at herzberg,supra,th at,d.
iii.county permit condition does not constitute a physical taking 
we first address allegretti contention that county action effected a physical taking of allegretti water rights mandating compensation as a per se taking.relying on air rights cases,cases involving the government diversion of water from landowners,and the decision of the united states court of federal claims in tulare lake basin water storage dist.united states.tulare lake,allegretti maintains county regulation,which it characterizes as denying it access to the aquifer on its land,physically took allegretti right to use the water as if it had diverted it elsewhere.allegretti argues,when one is precluded from exercising the right to use water today,the right to use that particular water is gone forever.
in response,county points out its sole actions were refusal to issue a permit in the absence of full compliance with the california environmental quality act ceqa and issuance of an alternative permit with conditions that would have placed a limit on allegretti groundwater extractions.it,as well as amicus attorney general,argues those actions did not physically invade,impound or appropriate allegretti property and convert it to some other use,and thus it is not a categorical physical taking under united states supreme court precedents.both county and the attorney general challenge allegretti reliance on tulare lake as misplaced they maintain tulare lake conflates physical and regulatory takings analyses and was wrongly decided.
the united states supreme court in loretto,supra,carefully distinguished permanent physical takings from both temporary physical invasions and regulations merely restricting the use of private property.loretto,supra,at.it pointed out that a compensable physical taking would occur in circumstances where real estate is actually invaded by superinduced additions of water,earth,sand,or other material,or by having any artificial structure placed on it id.at.flooding results in an actual,permanent invasion of the land,amounting to an appropriation of,and not merely an injury to,the property id.at.telegraph or telephone lines,rails and underground pipes or wires are placed above or below an owner property id.at.or where the government causes frequent aircraft flights immediately above an owner property,as such action is analogous to construction of an elevated railway causing an intrusion so immediate and direct as to subtract from the owner full enjoyment of the property and to limit his exploitation of it.id.at,citing causby.such circumstances are not the same as where,for example,the government orders nonessential gold mines to cease operations for the purpose of conserving equipment or manpower loretto,at,citing united states central eureka mining,d government did not occupy,use,or in any manner take physical possession of the gold mines or of the equipment connected with them.
more recently,in brown legal foundation of,d the court explained when the government physically takes possession of an interest in property for some public purpose,it has a categorical duty to compensate the former owner,citation,regardless of whether the interest that is taken constitutes an entire parcel or merely a part thereof.thus,compensation is mandated when a leasehold is taken and the government occupies the property for its own purposes,even though that use is temporary.citations.similarly,when the government appropriates part of a rooftop in order to provide cable tv access for apartment tenants citation or when its planes use private airspace to approach a government airport citation,it is required to pay for that share no matter how small.brown legal foundation of,supra,at,quoting preservation council,tahoe regional planning agency,d.california authority abides by these distinctions.see ehrlich city of culver city cal th,d,hensler city of glendale cal th,d,njd,city of san dimas th,d categorical taking requires that the government physically take possession of an interest in property for a public purpose loewenstein city of lafayette th,d.
in the context of water rights,our highest court has found a physical taking where the government diverted water for its own consumptive use or decreased the amount of water accessible by the owner of the water rights.washoe county united states,citing dugan rank,d government upstream impounding of water at a dam constitutes a taking of water rights from downstream owners,analogizing government action to taking of airspace over land int l paper county.united states.taking found where the secretary of war ordered a private power company to withdraw water from the petitioner mill to increase power production for government uses.
county action with respect to allegretti in the present of a permit condition limiting the total quantity of groundwater available for allegretti be characterized as or analogized to the kinds of permanent physical occupancies or invasions sufficient to constitute a categorical physical taking.the county did not physically encroach on allegretti property or aquifer and did not require or authorize any encroachment yee city of escondido,supra.it did not appropriate,impound or divert any water.the county permit decision does not effect a per se physical taking under any reasonable analysis.
we are not persuaded by allegretti reliance on the court of federal claims decision in tulare lake,supra,as support for the proposition that use restrictions on underground water rights are analogous to a categorical physical taking.in tulare lake,water districts argued that their water rights,which were contractually conferred by certain governmental agencies,were taken in violation of the fifth amendment by use restrictions imposed by the state water resources control board the board under the endangered species act.id.at.comparing the circumstances to the overflights of aircraft found to constitute a taking in united states causby,supra,the tulare lake court held the restrictions caused a physical taking of the plaintiffs contractual entitlement to a particular amount of water from the board facilities 
allegretti has provided no authority compelling us to follow the holding of an intermediate federal court.to the contrary,we are not bound by lower federal court decisions.people gray cal th,d.even if we found it appropriate to consider tulare lake,we would find it distinguishable by virtue of the existence of identifiable contractual rights between the plaintiffs and water rights holder,rights that are not present in this case.
in any event,the persuasive value of tulare lake has been undercut in klamath irrigation district united states.klamath,in which the court rejected the underpinnings of its tulare lake decision.id.at with all due respect,tulare appears to be wrong on some counts,incomplete on others,and distinguishable,in all events.in klamath,the court criticized tulare lake treatment of the plaintiffs contracts as absolute and confer ring on plaintiffs a right to the exclusive use of prescribed quantities of water,without adequately considering whether the contracts were limited in the event of water shortage by prior contracts,prior appropriations,or other state law principles.klamath.at.the court further faulted tulare lake for neglecting to consider whether the plaintiffs claimed use of water violated state doctrines,including those designed to protect fish and wildlife,noting as a consequence tulare lake awarded just compensation for the taking of interests that may well not exist under state law.klamath.at.finally,the court noted the tulare lake decision did not consider numerous decisions vitiating takings claims by the availability of contract remedies,citing hughes communications galaxy,united states,the concept of taking as a compensable claim theory has limited application to the relative rights of party litigants when those rights have been voluntarily created by contract.in such instances,interference with such contractual rights generally gives rise to a breach claim not a taking claim united states winstar,d glendale fed.bank,fsb united states,castle united states.for these reasons,klamath rejected tulare lake approach and supporting rationales.
we likewise decline to rely on tulare lake reasoning to find a physical taking under the circumstances presented by county action.aside from the deficiencies noted in klamath,supra.at,we disagree with tulare lake conclusion that the government imposition of pumping restrictions is no different than an actual physical diversion of water.tulare lake,supra.at.the reasoning is flawed because in that case the government passive restriction,which required the water users to leave water in the stream,did not constitute a physical invasion or appropriation like the government diversion in international paper united states,supra,or its low flight of army and navy airplanes in causby,supra,at page.tulare lake reasoning disregards the hallmarks of a categorical physical taking,namely,actual physical occupation or physical invasion of a property interest 
iv.county action is not a regulatory taking 
allegretti contends that if we conclude county permit decision must be analyzed as regulatory action,we should nevertheless hold it constitutes a categorical taking because it denied allegretti all economically beneficial or productive use of its land by preventing the full utilization of water that allegretti had a right to access.alternatively,allegretti contends county action constitutes a taking under penn central factual analysis.
county act in conditioning allegretti permit on certain water use limitations is of a regulatory nature,and as we previously held in allegretti i,it is an act taken under the authority of its police powers.a government regulation that restricts certain private uses of a portion of an owner property does not constitute a categorical taking it is to be analyzed under regulatory takings jurisprudence.see brown legal foundation of,supra,at.preservation council,tahoe regional planning agency,supra,at.hensler city of glendale,supra,cal th at,d.
total regulatory taking 
when government regulation completely deprives an owner of all economically beneficial us e of its land,a taking is established and just compensation is due.lingle,supra,at.at lucas,supra,at.see also palazzolo rhode island,d njd,city of san dimas,supra,th at,d loewenstein city of lafayette,supra,th at,d.
allegretti maintains it presented evidence that demonstrated a deprivation of economically beneficial or productive use by showing productive use of allegretti acre farm had been restricted by lack of the ability to pump sufficient water from underground to irrigate and cultivate more than acres,sometimes less the owner had a reasonable belief and expectation he could farm the full acres and make a substantial profit on his investment and the owner and his tenant farmer would be able to farm more land if they could gain access to additional water for irrigation.allegretti argues being able to farm or or acres out of a acre farm may be some use,but it is not economically beneficial or productive use of a dollar investment that was made nearly a ago in anticipation of farming the entire ownership.
allegretti concedes an ability to irrigate and farm four to eight hundred acres of its property even if county permit condition were in effect and therefore this has not been a total regulatory taking.allegretti misstates the requisite economic deprivation to constitute a categorical regulatory taking we do not assess whether a regulation deprives some or even a vast majority of economic use as lingle most recently emphasized it must deprive an owner of all economically beneficial use of the land.lingle,supra,at.at.the trial court ruled county permit condition did not result in such a deprivation on a finding that a significant portion of the property is farmed by a tenant who was paying allegretti rent.allegretti does not challenge the evidence to support this factual finding and indeed,michael morgan,allegretti tenant,who leased acres of allegretti property at per acre,testified he had upwards of acres in production at the time of trial 
penn central analysis 
when a regulation does not result in a physical invasion and does not deprive the property owner of all economic use of the property,a reviewing court must evaluate the regulation in light of the penn central factors.kavanau santa monica rent control board cal th,d,kavanau.penn central emphasized three factors in particular t he economic impact of the regulation on the claimant the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct expectations and the character of the governmental action.kavanau,cal th at,d,accord,lingle,supra,at.at palazzolo rhode island,supra,at.
these factors are the sole criteria on which allegretti relies in asserting its taking claim.we may dispose of a takings claim on the basis of one or two of these factors.bronco wine jolly th,d,citing maritrans united states,where the nature of the governmental action and the economic impact of the regulation did not establish a taking,the court need not consider expectations,ruckelshaus monsanto,d disposing of takings claim relating to trade secrets solely on absence of reasonable expectations,andrus allard,d.
applying the three penn central factors relied upon by allegretti does not persuade us to find county action constitutes a regulatory taking.importantly,the basis for this factual inquiry is the owner entire property holdings at the time of the alleged taking,not just the adversely affected portion.buckley california coastal com.th,d,citing keystone bituminous coal debenedictis,d.thus the relevant parcel is allegretti acres,and not merely its right to draw water from it,florida rock indus.united states.
beginning with the last mentioned penn central factor,the character of the governmental action,county action did not physically invade or appropriate allegretti property or groundwater.accordingly,that factor does not support a taking.see connolly pension ben.guar,d golden cheese voss d.
as for the economic impact of county regulation,allegretti concedes it did not establish the precise amount of such an impact through expert testimony at trial,but maintains such testimony is unnecessary because it is plain that county action has restricted allegretti ability to draw water to the capacity of its existing wells,thus limiting its farm production to between and acres of a parcel.allegretti criticizes the trial court reliance on the fact allegretti was receiving rental income on a portion of the property,claiming the preservation of some economically beneficial use is not sufficient to constitute a defense in the county favor.
in addressing economic impact,we ask whether the regulation unreasonably impair s the value or use of the property in view of the owners general use of their property,pruneyard shopping center robins,d.not only is the use to which the property owner puts his or her property important,but the economic impact needs to be considered in the context of other laws and regulatory schemes.see connolly pension benefit guar,supra,d evaluating economic impact of imposing withdrawal fees on employers who leave pension funds within context of entire erisa scheme.we note the supreme court has repeatedly upheld land use regulations that destroy or adversely affect real property interests.keystone bituminous coal debenedictis,supra,at,fn.
allegretti has not demonstrated any economic impact from county per year limitation other than unspecific lay testimony regarding reduced profits via a rental rate or diminution in value as a result of its inability to use the entirety of its property for farming.it is well established that mere diminution in value of property,however serious,does not constitute a taking.concrete pipe and products of california,construction laborers pension trust for southern cal,d,citing village of euclid ambler realty.approximately diminution in value hadacheck sebastian.diminution see also long beach equities,county of ventura d.penna.coal mahon.g overnment hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law.under penn central,regulations that prohibit the most beneficial use of the property or which prohibit a beneficial use to which individual parcels had previously been devoted and thus cause substantial individualized harm are not takings.penn central,supra,at.like most land use regulations,the ordinance may have the inevitable effect of reducing the value of regulated properties,but even a significant diminution in value is insufficient to establish a confiscatory taking.terminal plaza city and county of san francisco d,quoting griffin development city of oxnard cal d.
allegretti has not demonstrated compensable interference with distinct investment backed expectations penn central,supra,at.kavanau,supra,cal th at,d,by county per year limitation.the sole evidence on which it relies is joe allegretti testimony that he purchased the land for million and made improvements with the expectation he could farm all acres and make a substantial profit off the investment.it also points to joe allegretti testimony that he could farm more acres if he had more operable wells,and testimony from allegretti tenant that he intended to farm all acres,but could not because there was not enough water.citing city of barstow mojave water agency,supra,cal th at,d,allegretti asserts it has the right to put to use as much of that water as it needs in order to irrigate its cropland.
there are several flaws in this argument.first,the evidence does not reveal distinct,as opposed to abstract,expectations.joe allegretti testimony was only that he had purchased the farm having been given lots of reassurances that it could be a viable farming operation emphasis added and that his investment had not yet reached expectation a reasonable expectation must be more than a unilateral expectation or an abstract need.ruckelshaus monsanto,supra,at.further,as our high court in city of barstow acknowledged,although an overlying user such as allegretti may have superior rights to others lacking legal priority,allegretti water right is nonetheless restricted to a reasonable beneficial use consistent with article x,section of the california constitution.city of barstow mojave water agency,supra,cal th at,d.allegretti claim to an unlimited right to use as much water as it needs to irrigate flies in the face of that standard,and it has not pointed to any evidence in the record that its proposed irrigation of all acres would be reasonable within the meaning of the constitutional restriction.second,allegretti claim is essentially that it has lost at least the potential for substantial profits.allegretti claim of loss of anticipated profits or gain is not compensable,as it demonstrate s no more than a possible restriction upon more economic uses of its property.terminal plaza city and county of san francisco d.because of its very uncertainty,the interest in anticipated gains has traditionally been viewed as less compelling than other interests.andrus allard,supra,at.for the foregoing reasons,allegretti claim of a regulatory taking under penn central is not persuasive.
whether county action substantially advances a state interest is no longer a valid standard to assess an unconstitutional taking under the fifth amendment 
applying the standard of agins city of tiburon,d agins,that a regulatory taking be found when an ordinance does not substantially advance legitimate state interests,allegretti maintains county permit condition effects a taking because an act taken without jurisdiction and arbitrary as a matter of law is incapable of furthering or advancing any legitimate governmental objective.
in lingle,the court reconsidered the validity of agins substantially advance s state interests standard as a regulatory takings test and disavowed it,concluding it prescribes an inquiry in the nature of a due process,not a takings test,and that it has no proper place in our takings jurisprudence.lingle,supra,at.at.the substantially advances inquiry,the court explained,reveals nothing about the magnitude or character of the burden a particular regulation imposes upon private property rights.nor does it provide any information about how any regulatory burden is distributed among property owners.in consequence,this test does not help to identify those regulations whose effects are functionally comparable to government appropriation or invasion of private property it is tethered neither to the text of the takings clause nor to the basic justification for allowing regulatory actions to be challenged under the clause.id.at.at.
further,the substantially advances inquiry is prior to and distinct from the question whether a regulation effects a taking,for the takings clause presupposes that the government has acted in pursuit of a valid public purpose conversely,if a government action is found to be instance because it fails to meet the public use requirement or is so arbitrary as to violate due is the end of the inquiry.no amount of compensation can authorize such action.lingle,supra,at.at.finally,application of the agins formula is practically difficult to apply,requiring courts to scrutinize the efficacy of a vast array of state and federal regulations,and empowers courts to improperly substitute their judgments for that of the legislature or expert administrative agencies.lingle,supra,at.at.
in its reply brief,allegretti maintains while the agins formula is no longer viable under the fifth amendment,it remains part of california takings law,in part based on the use of that standard by the california supreme court in landgate,california coastal com.cal th,d,landgate.even if that were the case,the test does not assist it.as we explain below,applying landgate test,county action does not constitute a taking.
application of landgate 
the attorney general,as amicus curiae for county,contends we need not reach the question whether county action constitutes a taking under penn central because any regulatory taking claim by allegretti is one involving a temporary taking that is procedurally barred by the california supreme court decision in landgate,supra,cal th,d.county reiterated that position at oral argument before us.while allegretti criticized the trial court analysis of landga
