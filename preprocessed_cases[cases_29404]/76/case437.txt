in this matter we are required to analyze and apply the delayed discovery rule in a toxic contamination case to determine whether the statute of limitations bars the personal injury and wrongful death claims of plaintiffs and the claims of eight other plaintiffs brought pursuant to proposition we conclude that the trial court did not correctly apply the rule to the facts and consequently erred in denying defendant lockheed martin corporation lockheed motion for summary with respect to the personal injury plaintiffs.with respect to the proposition claims,we seriously question whether lockheed can be held liable when it is undisputed that it ceased operations in the area in.however,lockheed seeks reversal solely on the ground that the delayed discovery rule can never be applied to causes of action brought pursuant to proposition.we are not prepared to so hold,and believe that its contentions are properly considered in determining the retroactive scope of proposition.accordingly,we grant lockheed petition for writ of mandate in part.
factual and procedural background 
this petition arises from claims made by nearly persons for personal injuries as a result of exposure to toxic contaminants in the redlands water supply.petitioner lockheed,alleged to have been one of the polluters when it operated a plant in mentone from to,is a defendant in a series of related actions brought between february,and february,that have been consolidated for pretrial purposes under the caption in re redlands tort litigation.the causes of action at issue are for negligence,wrongful death,strict liability for ultrahazardous activity,and violation of proposition 
the parties have been litigating the claims of approximately test plaintiffs pursuant to a case management order.the trial court refers to these test plaintiffs as the first tier plaintiffs or ftp.lockheed moved for summary judgment adjudication with respect to of the ftp on the ground that all their causes of action were barred by the applicable statute of limitations,given that its alleged wrongful conduct occurred more than years before,and that each plaintiff suffered appreciable harm more than one year prior to filing suit.although lockheed conceded that the delayed discovery exception applied in principle to the personal injury claims,it contended that due to the widespread publicity concerning water contamination in redlands,a reasonable person would have suspected a link between the contamination and their injuries more than a year before filing suit.lockheed contended that the delayed discovery exception is not applicable to claims under proposition.
the trial court concluded that the delayed discovery rule applied to the proposition claims as well as to the other causes of action.the trial court found that lockheed had met its initial burden by showing that all of the ftp causes of action had accrued prior to one year before their complaints were filed,so that in order to save their claims the plaintiffs were required to show that the delayed discovery rule applied.
in order to determine whether a triable issue of fact existed with regard to the application of the discovery rule,the trial court assessed the effect of widespread publicity about contamination of the redlands groundwater.the publicity included over articles in local newspapers,public notices and fact sheets,and public meetings.the trial court divided the publicity into two categories.the first series of articles,television programs,and radio segments from september through may discussed the contamination of the groundwater,and the second series of articles and paid advertisements published from june to march,discussed the various lawsuits and injuries allegedly sustained from the contamination.the court found that in the first series of articles the media was preoccupied with contamination only,not whether this contamination caused personal injuries or death.in the first series of articles,the information given at most would have alerted the plaintiffs to the fact that the groundwater was contaminated with trichloroethylene tce,a weak carcinogen that would only produce health hazards if the plaintiffs were exposed to the contaminant over a period.in addition,the first series of articles stressed that the contaminated water was not being delivered to the citizens of redlands.
in the trial court view,the second series of articles and paid advertisements discussed injuries sustained from contamination.the articles primarily discuss the lawsuits that were filed and the basis for those lawsuits.the articles contained specific information regarding contaminated water causing personal injuries.these articles often appeared as headline news stories and appeared on the front pages of the newspaper.therefore these articles contain sufficient information and are sufficiently notorious to meet that test criteria for imputing knowledge.the court imputed knowledge of these articles to ftp who testified that they read or subscribed to the redlands daily facts,or san bernardino sun from december,through february.accordingly,the trial court granted summary judgment as to eight test plaintiffs who filed their actions more than one year after the articles appeared in the newspaper to which they subscribed or read.
although the trial court found that the notice of contamination should be imputed to all citizens of redlands based on the first series of articles,it refused to impute knowledge that the contamination might cause injuries based on these articles.therefore,it denied summary adjudication of the personal injury and wrongful death claims of plaintiffs who regularly read and subscribed to the newspapers during the period when the first series of articles were published.
as to the proposition claims,the court found,as mentioned above,that the newspaper articles and television and radio segments from the first series of publicity was pervasive and notorious regarding disposal of toxins onto the land and the subsequent contamination of the groundwater.accordingly,it found that notice of the contamination should be imputed to all citizens of redlands unless they were able to show how they failed to learn of it.the trial court granted summary adjudication against all but eight ftp on the proposition claims.those eight were either minors in the or persons who had not lived in the area during the time of most or all of the publicity,and the trial court found that they had raised a triable issue on delayed discovery of the proposition claims.
discussion 
a.the delayed discovery rule 
the common law rule is that a statute of limitations begins to run upon the occurrence of the last element essential to the cause of action,even if the plaintiff is unaware of his cause of action.the harshness of this rule has been ameliorated by application of the discovery rule in cases where it would be manifestly unjust to deprive a plaintiff of a cause of action before he is aware he has been injured.mangini d.thus,the discovery rule provides that the accrual date of a cause of action is delayed until the plaintiff is aware of his injury and its negligent cause.the plaintiff is charged with this awareness as of the date he suspects or should suspect that his injury was caused by wrongdoing,that someone has done something wrong to him.accordingly,the period of limitations will begin to run without regard to whether the plaintiff is aware of the specific facts necessary to establish his claim,provided that he has a suspicion of wrongdoing,which he is charged with once he has notice or information of circumstances to put a reasonable person on inquiry.jolly eli lilly cal d.mckelvey boeing north american,th,d.
a plaintiff whose claims would be barred without the benefit of the discovery rule must specifically plead and prove facts to show the time and manner of discovery,and the inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence.norgart upjohn cal th,d.
we must first consider whether to apply our state formulation of the delayed discovery rule in light of the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla et.cercla provides that i n the case of any action brought under state law for personal injury,or property damages,which are caused or contributed to by exposure to any hazardous substance,or pollutant or contaminant,released into the environment from a facility,if the applicable limitations period for such action as specified in the state statute of limitations or under common law provides a commencement date which is earlier than the federally required commencement date,such period shall commence at the federally required commencement date in lieu of the date specified in such state statute.a.it does not create a federal statute of limitations nor does it alter the length of a state statute of limitations,but it does require that the limitations period begin to run no earlier than the date on which the plaintiff discovers,or should have discovered,the injury and its cause.where a state applies the discovery rule such that the statute of limitations commences on the same date under both state law and cercla,there is no federal preemption.angeles chemical spencer jones th,d.
based on the plain language of this section,cercla applies to state law claims for damages caused by the release of hazardous substances,even in the absence of an underlying cercla claim.boeing north american,cir,see also angeles chemical spencer jones,supra,th,d applying to a complaint alleging only causes of action under state law.
title united states code section defines the f ederally required commencement date for state limitations periods as the date the plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known that the personal injury was caused or contributed to by the hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant concerned.b a.thus,the federal and california discovery rules appear to be the same.however,in the recent decision of,supra,a panel of the ninth circuit concluded that cercla preempted,because under california discovery rules the statute of limitations would start earlier.the majority in concluded that california courts have formulated a standard for determining when a plaintiff is on inquiry notice that is fundamentally distinct from the federal standard set forth in title united states code section.the discovery rule as applied by california courts provides that the plaintiff discovers the cause of action when he at least suspects a factual basis,as opposed to a legal theory,for its elements,even if he lacks knowledge thereof norgart upjohn,supra,cal th at,d.the majority opined that title united states code section sets a later date for filing complaints because the federal discovery rule requires more than a mere suspicion of a claim,supra,at.
we believe that the majority has not correctly interpreted the california discovery in comparison with the federal discovery rule.we believe,as the dissent in did,that the standards are substantially the same.
contrary to the majority suggestion,california law does not provide that the period of limitations begins to run merely on a vague suspicion of wrongdoing,but only when a plaintiff has notice or information of circumstances to put a reasonable person on inquiry.reasonably should have known is in practical effect not a different standard than reasonably should have suspected.under either standard,a prospective plaintiff may not sit on his or her rights until the acquisition or possible acquisition of sufficient evidence to succeed on the claim.jolly eli lilly,supra,cal d at.constructive knowledge is also imputed to plaintiffs under the federal standard,and many courts in the federal system have applied the discovery rule in a variety of contexts using reasonable suspicion language we note,for example,that in actions under the federal tort claims act the accrual of a cause of action may be postponed in certain circumstances until the plaintiff has,or with reasonable diligence should have,discovered the critical facts of both his injury and its cause.federal courts have applied this postponed accrual rule in a manner similar to the california discovery rule.discovery of the critical facts of injury and causation is not an exacting requirement,but requires only knowledge of,or knowledge that could lead to,the basic facts of the injury,knowledge of the injury existence and knowledge of its cause or of the person or entity that inflicted it a plaintiff need not know each and every relevant fact of his injury or even that the injury implicates a cognizable legal claim.rather,a claim will accrue when the plaintiff knows,or should know,enough of the critical facts of injury and causation to protect himself by seeking legal advice.citations.a claim does not accrue when a person has a mere hunch,hint,suspicion,or rumor of a claim,citations,but such suspicions do give rise to a duty to inquire into the possible existence of a claim in the exercise of due diligence,citation.kronisch cir.
we are not persuaded by the majority assertion in that s everal federal courts have distinguished the federal knowledge standard from a standard that commences a limitations period when a plaintiff merely suspects the cause of injury,reasoning that the federal standard requires more than suspicion alone,supra,at.the cited cases interpreted the discovery rule from other states and concluded merely that under the facts of that particular case a triable issue of fact had been raised whether the plaintiff knew or should have known of the injury and its cause.ballew robins cir evenson osmose wood preserving of america cir maughan sw servicing,cir.none of the cases contained a comparison of the state discovery rule with a federal standard.
thus,because we are not bound by the decisions of the lower federal courts even on federal questions people crittenden cal th,fn,d,we will apply california authority based on our conclusion that cercla does not preempt our rule in that both standards are substantially similar.
b.the personal injury claims 
we now turn to the substance of the trial court ruling denying lockheed motion for summary adjudication of the personal injury claims of ftp.we review the trial court order independently.norgart upjohn,supra,cal th at,d.
although the trial court found that ftp had notice of the contaminated groundwater as a result of the widespread and pervasive publicity,it denied summary adjudication of their personal injury claims on the ground that they lacked sufficient information to place them on inquiry notice to trigger the statute of limitations.lockheed contends that the trial court did not correctly apply discovery rules to the undisputed facts.we agree.
there is no dispute that there was extensive media publicity beginning in to about the contamination of the groundwater in redlands.the issue in this case is whether that publicity placed a reasonable person who suffered injury on inquiry notice to trigger the statute of limitations.the resolution of this issue requires us to apply the law to these uncontested facts,thus it is a proper subject for summary judgment.while resolution of the statute of limitations issue is normally a question of fact,where the uncontradicted facts established through discovery are susceptible of only one legitimate inference,summary judgment is proper.jolly eli lilly,supra,cal d at.
the trial court noted that for years the local newspapers were preoccupied with the contamination of the land and groundwater.based on the pervasive and widespread publicity in the first series of publicity,the trial court imputed notice to all citizens of redlands that the groundwater had been contaminated with toxins unless they showed how they failed to learn of the contamination.eight of the ftp,either minors or those who had not lived in the area during the period of most or all of the publicity,were successful in making this showing but were not.as a result,the trial court concluded that the proposition claims of these ftp were barred.we believe that the trial court properly placed the burden on plaintiffs to show how they failed to learn of contamination in light of the pervasive publicity.constructive knowledge may be imputed to plaintiffs based on extensive and widespread publicity if a reasonable person would have
