the western distinct population segment of the steller sea lions wdps live in the great northern pacific ocean region off alaska,and they were declared endangered in.more recently,in two of the seven they inhabit,they have been experiencing population declines because they have been showing signs of nutritional stress.in,the national marine fisheries service nmfs or the agency therefore limited commercial fishing in those waters,causing representatives of the fishing industry and the state of alaska plaintiffs to file this action challenging the limitations.
the plaintiffs principal argument is that the nmfs violated the endangered species act esa because it based the fishing restrictions on declines in rather than in the entire population of the endangered species.plaintiffs also contend the agency utilized the wrong standards in measuring the effects of continued fishing and failed to find a sufficient causal link between authorizing fisheries and the population decline.we hold that use of subregions did not violate the esa and that the agency utilized appropriate standards to find that continuing previous fishing levels in those would adversely modify the critical habitat and jeopardize the continued existence of the entire population.we therefore affirm the district court judgment rejecting plaintiffs claims.
background 
statutory framework 
this case involves the interaction of three statutes the magnuson stevens fisheries conservation act msa,the esa,and the national environmental policy act nepa.the first concerns management of fisheries,and the others concern more generally the environmental consequences of government actions.plaintiffs claim nmfs violated all three in its promulgation of a biological opinion biop reducing commercial fishing in wdps habitat.
the msa governs the federal management of fisheries in various waters off the united states and establishes regional councils that are responsible for the sustainable management of fisheries.h.these councils create fishery management plans,which are prepared using scientific evidence and are geared toward ensuring conservation of the fisheries.id.the secretary of commerce must approve the management plans,which can include,among other things,limitations on or closure of fishing in designated zones.id.
the esa requires the secretaries of interior and commerce to list endangered species and designate their critical habitats.c.section f of the esa requires the secretary of commerce to design and carry out recovery plans and to implement programs to conserve the species under section a.f,a.section a of the esa mandates that federal agencies ensure that actions they take will not jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species.a.
under the esa,when a governmental entity plans to take action that may impact an endangered species,it must consult with the agency that has authority over the species.the consulted agency must then prepare a biop to determine whether the planned action will either likely jeopardize the species continued existence or adversely modify its critical habitat.see wildlife fed marine fisheries,cir.if either of those criteria is met,the agency may suggest a reasonable and prudent alternative rpa,which is designed to avoid jeopardy or adverse habitat modification.b a wildlife fed n,at.
the nmfs in this case stands at the intersection of the msa and the esa.its duty is to ensure that actions taken by the regional councils,including fishery management plans,do not jeopardize the continued existence of a threatened or endangered species or adversely modify critical habitat of an endangered species.see greenpeace marine fisheries serv.greenpeace iv,d.in this case it must evaluate the effect of the fishing plans on the wdps and its habitat.
the third statute,nepa,requires study of the environmental effects of any government action.c.under nepa,an agency planning an action may use an environmental assessment ea to determine whether the proposed action,including an rpa,would have a significant environmental impact.if the action would have such an effect,the agency must prepare an environmental impact statement eis.id.if it would not,no eis is required.an eis must describe the environmental consequences of the governmental action and the alternatives that were considered by the agency.when an agency makes a decision after preparation of an eis,it must prepare a record of decision rod,stating its decision,the alternatives it considered,and how its decision minimizes environmental harms.
in this case,the operation of these statutes has a profound impact on both the steller sea lions and on fishing interests because the statutes deal with the habitat in which sea lions live.this habitat includes their food sources,and,as a result,the resources available for commercial fishing.environmental groups,the state of alaska,and fishing industries,therefore,have all long been concerned about how the federal government applies these statutes in the waters off alaska,and their concerns have led to a decade of litigation concerning the scope of federal regulation of these fisheries.
history of regulation of fisheries and wdps 
the regulation at issue in this case has centered on the bering islands and gulf of alaska regions,which are home to steller sea lions and to commercial fisheries that are governed by the msa.see greenpeace marine fisheries serv.greenpeace i,d.by,there had been a decline in the sea lion population over a period,so the nmfs listed the entire steller sea lion population as threatened under the esa.id.at.seven years later,because of new research,the agency divided the population of the steller sea lions into the eastern distinct population segment and the wdps.id.the new research revealed genetic differences between the two populations.id.there were also markedly different survival rates in the two populations.therefore,the agency changed the wdps status to endangered,because of the precipitous,large population decline among this segment,contrasted with the more stable population trend among the eastern population segment,may.
the regional council responsible under the msa for the areas affected by the agency actions in this case is the north pacific fishery management council.it has been preparing fishery management plans on an annual basis since the msa was passed in.these plans set limits on the total amount of fishing permitted as well as times and areas of fishery closure,and they allocated the allowable catch among vessels.pursuant to the esa,the council consulted with nmfs on the plans,and nmfs prepared biops.up until,nmfs had found that the council fishery management plans adequately took into account the needs of the steller sea lions and that there was no jeopardy to the species or adverse modification of its habitat as a result of the fisheries.
in,however,nmfs issued a biop that concluded that the fishing was causing some jeopardy to the species and adversely modifying its critical habitat.this led to a first round of litigation concerning regulation of fishing in the alaskan waters.environmental groups,including groups who are in this case,and fishing industry interests all challenged nmfs conclusions contained in the biop.that earlier litigation resulted in several district court opinions,greenpeace i,d at greenpeace marine fisheries serv.greenpeace ii,d,greenpeace marine fisheries serv.greenpeace fff,d,greenpeace iv,d at,which led to revisions of the biop with respect to fishery management.
in addition to reviewing fishery management pursuant to the esa and msa,nmfs was also required by the esa to plan for sea lion population recovery.in,nmfs promulgated a recovery plan for steller sea lions pursuant to section of the esa.the agency did so using scientific experts working with interested parties,including fishing interests.
when,in,nmfs divided the sea lion population into eastern and western distinct population segments,separate recovery plans were required for each of the two species.the most recent recovery plan for the wdps was published in and divided the wdps into seven subregions to monitor the species progress.nmfs concluded in the plan that it was important to consider vital rates and demographic characteristics when considering the status of recovery of the western dps because subregional impacts could indicate that extinction risk may still be high.
the plan further established specific criteria that had to be met before the wdps could be downlisted or delisted.to downlist the wdps to threatened or to delist it entirely,the plan required progress in growth of the wdps population as a whole,and stable or increasing populations in five of the seven.the plan further mandated that the species could not be delisted if the wdps population in any two adjacent declined significantly or if the population in a single declined more than.the recovery plan itself is not challenged here,nor is there any dispute that the wdps as a whole is not meeting the recovery criteria set forth in the plan and therefore remains endangered.
the decline in the wdps population and the lack of robust recovery,despite the extensive efforts since,has led to concerns about the health of the species and hence to federally funded research studying possible causes of the decline,including fishing.the north pacific fishery management council,in,cited this new research in requesting that the nmfs initiate a new consultation pursuant to the esa to determine the impact of continued fishing at the rates authorized by the fishery management plans.the protected resources division of nmfs conducted the study using the new research on the impact of commercial fishing and other factors on the wdps population.during its study,it took into account the recovery plan to determine whether continued fishing would jeopardize the wdps or adversely modify the species critical habitat.
this consultation process culminated in nmfs promulgation of a new biop in.that biop concluded that continued fishing would have deleterious impacts on the species and the habitat in which it lives and that,therefore,greater limitations on commercial fishing were required.the plaintiffs challenge that biop in this action.
c.the challenged agency actions the biop,ea and interim final rule 
in november,after surveying the new research on the causes of wdps lack of recovery,nmfs issued the biop pursuant to the esa and an ea pursuant to nepa.the biop was promulgated after review by the council and public comment,including feedback from the fishing industry plaintiffs here.the biop concluded that continuing to authorize fisheries at the levels previously authorized in the fishery management plans would both jeopardize the continued existence of the wdps and adversely modify its critical habitat.relying on the plan geographic divisions,the biop found that the wdps was experiencing population declines in two of the,although the population was increasing in four others.the biop concluded that these declines caused the entire wdps population to fall short of the recovery plan goal of a statistically significant increase of the species population as a whole.
the agency critical finding was that natality rates were lower for the wdps than for the eastern population,and that the most likely explanation for the difference was that portions of the wdps were experiencing nutritional stress.the biop concluded that nutritional stress had directly or indirectly contributed to the reduction in population growth.it observed that although the nutritional stress hypothesis had been questioned by some experts,fishery presence in the two wdps was nevertheless negatively correlated with population numbers.in other words,as fishing increased,the wdps population fell.
with respect to the standard for measuring or determining adverse habitat modification,the biop noted that we had previously held part of the agency regulatory definition of adverse modification conflicted with the statute.see gifford pinchot task force fish wildlife,cir.the agency therefore relied on the statutory language of the esa,a,framing the critical question to be whether the action reduces the value of critical habitat for the conservation of the species.applying this standard,the biop found the weight of evidence suggested that continued authorization of the fisheries was likely to adversely modify the critical habitat of the wdps and jeopardize its continued existence.the biop acknowledged there were potentially multiple factors contributing to the decline in the wdps population,but it found nutritional stress was one contributing cause.thus the agency concluded it was mandated by the esa to take steps to prevent continued fishing from likely reducing or negatively affecting the survival and recovery of the wdps.
the biop therefore proposed an rpa that restricted the activity of several fisheries and closed other fisheries in the aleutian islands region.the rpa recommended closure of all mackerel and cod fishing in one part of the region and reducing the catch allowed in others.the rpa recommended swift implementation to support the recovery of the wdps population,which so far had not met the criteria outlined in the recovery plan.
pursuant to nepa,nmfs also prepared an ea,which considered various alternatives.nmfs found that of the various legally permissible alternatives,the rpa was the least likely to disrupt fishing or reduce the number of jobs and that the rpa fishing restrictions would have no significant impact on the environment.nmfs therefore promulgated an interim final rule,implementing the new restrictions,as described in the rpa.the likelihood of adverse economic consequences to the fishing industry,however,prompted this litigation.
district court proceedings 
the plaintiffs challenged the agency actions under the administrative procedure act apa,contending that the biop,ea,and finding of no significant impact ran afoul of the msa,esa,and nepa.the district court granted a motion by environmental groups oceana,and greenpeace,who had participated in the previous litigation,to intervene as defendants.
the district court held that the agency applied the correct standards under the esa.it ruled that the agency consideration of population declines in two was permissible because these declines implicated the survival and recovery of the species as a whole.it further held that the agency properly relied on the statutory definition of adverse modification and that the agency consideration of the impact of continued fishing on the wdps recovery was appropriate.the district court rejected plaintiffs other esa contentions as well,concluding that the rpa was supported by the record and that the agency was not required to show a definitive causal connection between authorization of fisheries and harm to the wdps.
with respect to nepa,however,the district court found that the agency should not have summarily concluded the restrictions would cause no significant impact,and it ordered the agency to prepare an eis.the court refused to enter a broader injunction that would have also required the agency to suspend the new restrictions or prepare a rod.
in this appeal,plaintiffs argue the agency violated the esa and that the district court nepa injunction was too narrow.plaintiffs contend that the biop violated the esa in relying on trends in two rather than considering population trends of the whole species.they further contend that the agency should have applied the regulatory definition of adverse habitat modification that this court has partially rejected.they additionally argue the agency should have limited its consideration to possible affirmative harm to the existing population rather than focusing on the adverse effect of fishing on the species recovery.plaintiffs also contend there must be a definitive causal link shown between authorization of commercial fishing and injury to the wdps population or habitat.plaintiffs finally contend the court abused its discretion under nepa by not requiring the agency to prepare a rod in addition to requiring an eis.
our review of agency actions,including the promulgation of a biop,is narrow.under the apa,we must determine only if the agency actio
