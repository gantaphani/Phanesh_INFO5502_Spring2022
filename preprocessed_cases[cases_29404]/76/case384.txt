konstantine and alexandra skoumbas appeal the dismissal of their suit seeking damages for inverse condemnation,nuisance,and trespass,following a grant of summary judgment in favor of the city of orinda the city.the trial court concluded the city could not be held liable for erosion caused by water discharged from a storm drain because there was no evidence the entire drainage system was a public improvement owned by the city or its predecessor in interest.we conclude that the critical inquiry is not whether the entire system was a public improvement,but rather whether the city acted reasonably in its maintenance and control over those portions of the drainage system it does own.accordingly,we conclude the existence of triable issues of material fact precluded the grant of summary judgment,and reverse.
factual and procedural background 
the skoumbas property consists of several undeveloped parcels of land on an orinda hillside in an area known as the oak springs subdivision that was created in the.their property is to the west and downhill from a subdivision,tract,developed in the.tract includes candlestick road,a publicly dedicated street that ends in a.surface water from the surrounding area of tract flows onto candlestick road,and is collected in a catch basin that channels the water into an underground metal pipe.the metal pipe runs under tract,and continues downhill into the oak springs subdivision,where it discharges surface water near the uphill border of the skoumbas property.the surface water discharge has allegedly caused substantial erosion and damaged the skoumbas property.the city admits it owns candlestick road,the catch basin,and the first feet of drainpipe,but contends it is not responsible for any flow of water below the first feet of pipe because the city says the rest of the pipe is privately owned.
the drainage system for tract was originally constructed by the subdivision developer as it was originally constructed,the candlestick road storm drain was an diameter drainage pipe laid in a drainage easement on lots and that extended downhill from the end of candlestick road and ended on lot of the oak springs subdivision the county did not accept the streets in the oak springs subdivision for public use,and no easement was identified on the subdivision map within the boundaries of lot.when the subdivision map for tract was approved in,the county board of supervisors did not accept on behalf of the public any of the streets,roads,avenues or easements shown thereon as dedicated to public use.
the storm drainage from candlestick road was the subject of extended discussion between the developer and the county around that time.a county flood control official advised the developer t he storm drain at the westerly end of candlestick road has been improperly located and does not extend to patricia lane it is recommended that the existing storm drain be extended to patricia road,that a culvert with a n headwall be placed beneath patricia road to direct the storm flow into the natural channel to the southwest,and sacked concrete outlet protection be constructed.this work shall be accomplished under a change order submitted by the developer to the public works department accompanied by a drawing showing relevant details.it is urgent that the foregoing described work be completed at the earliest date.
the developer engineers then sent the flood control district a plan for revisions to drainage at the end of candlestick road.the drawing showed an extension to the existing pipe that included a new pipe that crossed under patricia lane 
in,work was done to reconstruct and repair slide damage that affected candlestick road.as part of that work,candlestick road was shortened and repositioned.in its new configuration,the road ended some feet away from the top end of the drain line that was originally installed by the developer of tract.a new catch basin was constructed at the end of the street and feet of pipe was laid to connect the catch basin to the original drain line.the new section of drain was placed in a portion of lot of tract that was a easement.in march,candlestick road,as relocated and reconstituted,was dedicated and accepted as a public road 
it appears that erosion caused by the discharge from the storm drain off candlestick road was the subject of discussion between the county and an area property owner in.an owner of property that adjoined lot exchanged correspondence with the public works department in october where he said the culvert and flume from candlestick road are now carrying the entire of the hill.over two previous rainy seasons this flume has discharged water to the extent that a gulley approximately twenty feet deep has been cut out of the soil.but it does not appear that the drain was repaired or replaced at that time.in,the same property owner wrote to the public works department to say that while earth movement caused by grading activities on tract was repaired,the cavern or ravine caused by the drainage pipe still exists.the public works department responded to the property owner in september that it would not take any further action on the matter.the parties now disagree over whether someone altered the lowest portion of the drain pipe at some later date 
the skoumbases sued the city and the uphill owners whose property is traversed by the pipe running from candlestick road,seeking recovery for damages caused by the water that discharged onto their property the complaint alleged nuisance and trespass claims against all defendants,and inverse condemnation against the city.
the city moved for summary judgment,asserting it had no responsibility for the discharge of the storm water because the lower portion of the storm drain was privately constructed and privately owned.thus,the storm drain was not a public improvement.the skoumbases opposed,arguing the city could be held liable because the water that damaged their property originated in a public improvement,and there were triable issues of fact as to the city implied acceptance of the entire pipeline the trial court granted summary judgment for the city because there was no evidence the city expressly or impliedly accepted the lower segments of the drainage pipe as a public improvement the skoumbases timely appealed

a motion for summary judgment must be granted if all of the papers submitted show there is no triable issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.in determining whether the papers show there is no triable issue as to any material fact the court shall consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers,and all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence code civ,subd.c.a defendant has met its burden of showing a cause of action has no merit if it has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.once the defendant has met that burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.the plaintiff may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings to show a triable issue of material fact exists but,instead,shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists andrews foster wheeler llc,supra,th at,d.
our de novo review of the record leads us to conclude that the summary judgment in favor of the city must be reversed.we conclude the city did not establish that it had a complete defense to liability for damages to private property caused by water collected in a public catch basin off a public street and channeled into a section of public drain pipe.as a matter of law,the city ownership and control of a portion of the drainage system makes the city potentially liable for damage substantially caused by the city unreasonable diversion of water through the portions of the system.
liability for a public agency diversion of surface water 
water diffused over the surface of land,or contained in depressions therein,and resulting from rain,snow,or which rises to the surface in springs,is known as surface water.it is thus distinguishable from water flowing in a fixed channel,so as to constitute a watercourse,or water collected in an identifiable body,such as a river or lake.the extraordinary overflow of rivers and streams is known as flood water.keys romley cal d.the plaintiffs are suing to recover for damage to their property resulting from the discharge of surface water from tract that has been diverted into the culvert and storm drain at the end of candlestick road.they assert claims for nuisance,trespass and inverse condemnation.
article i,section of the california constitution permits private property to be taken or damaged for a public use only when just compensation has first been paid to,or into court for,the owner.when incidental damage to private property is caused by governmental activity,but the government has not reimbursed the property owner,a suit in inverse condemnation will lie to recover monetary damages for special injury.locklin city of lafayette cal th,d.this constitutional right to recover for inverse condemnation was originally thought to provide a broader right for individuals to recover against the government than they would have against a private party,as it was unnecessary to prove negligence or commission of a tort by the government.ibid.but in cases of damage caused by flowing water,the prevailing theory was that if a private party would have the right to inflict damage on the plaintiff property,the government could assert the same immunity,archer city of los angeles cal d.
this unique immunity recognized in inverse condemnation became known as the archer exception and involved the circumstances,peculiar to water law,in which a landowner had a right to inflict damage upon the property of others for the purpose of protecting his or her own property.such circumstances included the erection of flood control measures the common enemy doctrine and the discharge of surface water into a natural watercourse the natural watercourse rule.under private water law analysis,these rules immunized the landowner from liability for resulting damage to downstream property.arreola county of monterey th,d.but in recent cases,the archer exception has been curtailed and the murky rules pertaining to liability imposed upon government entities for damage caused by flowing water have been refined.see belair riverside county flood control dist.cal d,locklin city of lafayette,supra,cal th,d,bunch coachella valley water dist.cal th,d.
under modern authorities,the liability of public agencies for diversion of surface waters into a natural watercourse is relatively clear.t he public agency is liable only if its conduct posed an unreasonable risk of harm to the plaintiffs,and that unreasonable conduct is a substantial cause of the damage to plaintiff property.the rule of strict liability generally followed in inverse condemnation citation is not applicable in this context.locklin city of lafayette,supra,cal th at,d.in assessing a public agency conduct under the reasonableness standard prescribed in locklin,courts may consider whether the damage to their property,if reasonably foreseeable,would entitle the plaintiffs to compensation whether it is likely that the public agency would refrain from diverting the water in light of a remote possibility of unseen and unforeseeable direct damage to the property whether the plaintiffs suffered direct physical damage to their property as the proximate result of the diversion as deliberately planned and carried out whether the cost of the damage can be better absorbed,and with less hardship,by the taxpayers rather than the plaintiff owners of the damaged property and whether if uncompensated the plaintiffs would contribute more than their fair or proper share to the public undertaking of the project.id.at,d.but in all cases,these considerations are limited to situations where the public agency unreasonable conduct is a substantial cause of the damage to the plaintiffs property ibid.
in bunch coachella valley water,supra,cal th,d,our supreme court adopted the rule of reasonableness articulated in locklin to assess claims of inverse condemnation in cases where a public entity has diverted water in a flood control system that fails in a heavy rain and causes damage to property that has historically been subject to flooding.bunch reasoned that this reasonableness approach furthers the policies underlying the common enemy cases it does not discourage beneficial flood control projects by making the government an insurer against flood damage,and yet compensates injured property owners who otherwise would be required to contribute a disproportionate share of the cost of the project.pacific bell city of san diego th,d.in bunch,our supreme court concluded that the reasonableness test applies to cases involving public flood control works that cause physical damage to private property courts should use these factors in cases where a public entity flood control measures,designed to protect against potentially dangerous periodic flooding,cause property damage.bunch coachella valley water,supra,at,d.
finally,a landowner tort liability for the diversion of surface water is decided under a rule of reasonableness similar to that articulated in locklin.when a landowner diverts surface waters in an unnatural manner and damages a lower property,the upper landowner is liable in tort to the extent he or she failed to take reasonable care in the use of the upper property.keys romley,supra,cal d at.this rule of liability is referred to as the modified civil law rule.sheffet county of los angeles d.simply stated,the modified civil law rule provides that.if the upper owner is reasonable and the lower owner unreasonable,the upper owner wins.if the upper owner is unreasonable and the lower owner reasonable,the lower owner wins and.if both the upper and lower owner are reasonable,the lower owner wins also.burrows state of california d.
review of the summary judgment granted in this case 
the city does not dispute that it owns three drainage related mechanisms relevant to this case.they are candlestick road,the at the end of candlestick road,and the approximately length of drain pipe laid in when candlestick road was reconfigured and relocated.notwithstanding these facts,the city argues that it can not be held liable to the plaintiffs because it does not own the lower stretches of drain pipe,and thus should not be held responsible for water which passes through segments wherever and however it may flow in private segments or on private property thereafter.we disagree.the city asserted lack of ownership or involvement in development of the lower portion of the drainage system off candlestick road is not a complete defense to its possible liability to the plaintiffs.
as the city claims,in order for it to be held liable in inverse condemnation,damage to the plaintiffs property must occur as a result of a public improvement,public work,or public use.ullery county of contra costa d.this is true as far as it goes,but it does not go far enough.
the plaintiffs are suing over damage to their property caused by the outfall of storm water diverted from candlestick road and emanating from a public improvement to wit candlestick road,the and the initial section of pipe.under the balancing test that applies to claims of government liability for property damage caused by drainage of surface water to control flooding,the relevant question is whether the city ownership,operation or control of the improvements to candlestick road,the and the pipe wer
