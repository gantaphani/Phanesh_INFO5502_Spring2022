the rhode island coastal resources management council crmc challenges a decision by the federal district court,which has rejected two regulatory barriers crmc imposed to plans to build a liquified natural gas lng terminal in the city of fall river with a berth in massachusetts coastal waters of mount hope bay.weaver cove energy,llc weaver cove is the sponsor of the lng terminal.weaver cove energy,llc coastal res.mgmt.council,d.the barriers,which crmc has attempted to impose,are to necessary dredging by weaver cove in rhode island navigable waters,in a federal navigation channel.the federal energy regulatory commission ferc generally approved the project in,subject to certain conditions.until those conditions are met,weaver cove can not start construction.the commonwealth of massachusetts,joined by the city of fall river,has filed a brief as amicus curiae in support of crmc.
we address three main issues.the first is whether we have article iii jurisdiction to decide these matters.the second is whether the district court erred in holding that crmc failure to respond within six months to weaver cove application for federal consistency review requires there be a presumption of concurrence in the project,pursuant to c a of the coastal zone management act of czma.the third is whether crmc use of its state law licensing program for alterations to the coast,to block the project is preempted by the natural gas act nga.
for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court decision.
we first briefly explain the regulatory framework that governs this case.
central to this dispute are two federal statutes,the nga,and the czma.the nga was originally passed in the to facilitate the growth of the industry and requires ferc authorization for the importing of natural gas.a.ferc authority under the nga to regulate facilities engaged in the import of natural gas has long been interpreted as plenary and elastic,distrigas federal power comm n,and courts have interpreted the nga to preempt state regulatory authority within the scope of ferc jurisdiction,see,schneidewind anr pipeline,d.following a amendment,the nga explicitly grants ferc exclusive authority to approve or deny an application for the siting,construction,expansion,or operation of an lng terminal.id.e.parties wishing to build an lng terminal must file an extensive application with ferc,which must then consult with states regarding safety and environmental questions,b.
the nga creates a consolidated regulatory process for approving lng facilities that maintains the role of federal agencies and,in circumscribed areas,state agencies.it does so by limiting ferc exclusive authority in two ways relevant to this case.first,the nga,except where expressly provided,does not affect any federal agency authorities or responsibilities related to lng terminals.id.e emphasis added.in addition,the nga explicitly states that,unless otherwise provided,it does not affect the rights of states under three federal regulatory statutes,of which only the czma is pertinent to this case.id.d.
the czma establishes the relationship between state bodies,like the rhode island crmc,and federal agencies during the permitting process for lng terminal construction projects that impact coastal zones.it provides states with a limited opportunity to review applications to ensure they are consistent with state regulations,c a,and,in doing so,grants states a conditional veto over federally licensed or permitted projects,weaver cove,d at.that conditional veto,however,is itself subject to review.
in order to conduct a consistency review,state agencies must first have obtained approval from the federal national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa,a department of commerce agency,for the state agency own coastal management plan,d e,c a.coastal management plans set forth general state policies for developing and maintaining coastal areas and,as is the case in rhode island,may include not only the conditions for federal consistency review but also for state licensing programs.
once a state coastal management plan has been approved,an applicant for a federal permit wishing to undertake any activity the state plan regulates must certify with the local agency that the proposed activity is consistent with the coastal management plan id.c a.in support of the application,the applicant must submit all necessary data and information identified in the coastal management plan.a.under federal law,the state agency has thirty days from the time the application was submitted to notify the applicant and the federal agency if it takes the position that the applicant has failed to submit all of the required information.id.a.
importantly,the czma limits the time a state may conduct such a review,in order to prevent frustration of federal purposes.whether crmc failed to act within this limit is a key issue in this case.once an applicant submits its consistency certification,the state agency has six months either to concur with the certification or to object if it concludes that the proposed activity is inconsistent with the coastal management plan.c a.if the state agency fails to respond within six months,the state concurrence will be conclusively presumed.id.if the application is incomplete and the state agency so informs the applicant within the required time period,the state agency review period will commence on the date of receipt of the missing necessary data and information.a.however,the state agency review of whether the application is complete is not a substantive review of the adequacy of the information received,and the agency request for clarification of the information provided or its assertion that the information is substantively deficient does not toll the review period.id.c.these rules encourage states to act quickly when reviewing applications so that no one state can delay the federal approval process.congress was sufficiently concerned about the ability of local state agencies to delay projects that it did not use a generalized standard,such as a reasonable period of time as it did,for instance,in the telecommunications act of,c b,but capped the time at six months.
the czma also limits state authority to delay or prohibit projects subject to consistency review,by providing for federal review of state agency determinations.if the state agency objects to consistency certification,the applicant may appeal the decision to the secretary of commerce,who can override the objection on a finding that the activity is consistent with the objectives of this chapter or is otherwise necessary in the interest of national security.c a.the secretary decision,in turn,may be reviewed in federal district court see,millennium pipeline,gutierrez,d.
one other federal statute relevant to this case is the rivers and harbors act,at section.it prohibits construction or other work,such as dredging,in navigable waters without congressional authorization or a recommendation by the army corps chief of engineers as well as the secretary of the army authorization.id.because ferc exclusive authority under the nga does not disturb the army corps authority under the rivers and harbors act,e,parties seeking ferc approval for lng terminal proposals that include dredging in navigable waterways,like weaver cove,must also apply for approval from the army corps.
in rhode island,the federally designated agency under the czma is the appellant,crmc.crmc is responsible for administering rhode island coastal management plan,the rhode island coastal resources management program crmp.when a party wishes to conduct an activity listed in the crmp,such as dredging in rhode island,under state law,that party should obtain from the crmc a state law license called an assent.the more extensive category b assent process under state law is required for approval of all projects that involve major alterations proposed for rhode island tidal waters,shoreline features,or areas contiguous with shoreline features.id.a,d.if the party proposed listed activity is also part of a project that is subject to federal licensing,crmc is the body tasked with providing the required federal consistency review.
crmc document,labeled the federal consistency manual,emphasizes that although the assent and consistency review processes may overlap,they are distinct approvals.coastal res.mgmt.council,federal consistency manual,available at ency.pdf.the same list of activities that require assents also require consistency review.id.at.major alterations to the rhode island coastal area that trigger the more extensive category b assent process trigger the same level of review for consistency certifications.id.at.
finally,the manual states that a grant or denial of an assent in an application when a consistency review is ongoing constitutes a concurrence or an objection for the purposes of the review.id.at.a key difference between the two forms of review is that whereas the czma limits consistency review through the time limit,administrative review by the secretary of commerce,and federal judicial review,no federal statute limits how long state decisions regarding category b assent may take or provides for federal review.
the substantive provision of the state crmp most pertinent to this case is section c,which requires approval by the crmc for all dredging activities.particularly in dispute in this case is the meaning of section c of the crmp,which requires that w hen disposal is proposed for approved upland facilities,the applicant shall provide a letter of acceptance from that facility,unless the disposal is approved for the central landfill.c.
the crmc also coordinates some of its responsibilities with another state agency,the rhode island department of environmental management ridem.particularly relevant to this case is ridem role in identifying a list of approved upland sites for disposal of dredged material,which crmc is responsible for incorporating into a comprehensive plan for dredged material management.laws.
weaver cove proposes to build and operate a lng terminal in fall river.the proposed project received ferc approval in,subject to certain conditions weaver cove energy,llc,at.ferc found that the proposal will promote the public interest by increasing the availability of natural gas supplies in the new england market.id.
under the original lng proposal,submitted in,ships carrying lng would pass through waters in both rhode island and massachusetts,traveling up the taunton river to the terminal location.this has changed.according to weaver cove offshore berth amendment,the proposal now calls for ships to deliver their cargo to an offshore berth in mount hope bay,from which the lng would be transported via a submerged pipeline to the onshore terminal.the offshore berth,the pipeline,and the terminal would all be located in massachusetts.in both the original proposal and the amended version,the only planned activity in rhode island waters is dredging in a federal navigation channel to ensure the safe passage of the lng tankers.that dredging is the subject of this litigation.
on december,weaver cove filed an application,pursuant to the nga,for ferc approval of the proposed lng facility.ferc,as said,approved the application in subject to a number of conditions,one of which was that weaver cove was to file prior to construction documentation of concurrence from the crmc that the project is consistent with the rhode island crmp.weaver cove energy,llc,at emphasis in original.
turning to state regulatory requirements,such as category b assent,ferc added that state or local permits issued with respect to the jurisdictional facilities authorized herein must be consistent with the conditions in this order.id.at.although ferc encouraged weaver cove and local authorities to cooperate during local review of weaver cove proposal,it made clear that this does not mean that state and local agencies,through application of state or local laws,may prohibit or unreasonably delay the construction or operation of facilities approved by this commission.id.
following for rehearing,ferc reaffirmed this order in in all respects relevant to this case.weaver cove energy,llc,at.this court declined then to review the conditional order on ripeness grounds.city of fall river fed.energy regulatory comm n,cir.
because the proposed dredging activities also required approval from the army corps under the rivers and harbors act,weaver cove filed an application to the army corps on march.dredging is a listed activity in rhode island federally approved crmp.on filing its application to the army corps,weaver cove was therefore also required by the czma to file a consistency certification with crmc,which it did in july.with this application,weaver cove also applied for rhode island state law license for dredging,category b assent.however,weaver cove informed crmc that it believed the assent unnecessary.
within the window to inform applicants for concurrence that their applications are incomplete required by the czma,crmc informed weaver cove by phone that its consistency certification and category b assent application were,in crmc view,incomplete on two grounds.the validity of those grounds is at issue in this case.the first,quickly remedied by weaver cove,was that it had failed to submit the engineering plans with the stamp of a rhode island engineer.the second ground,at issue in this case,was that weaver cove application was incomplete,and so the clock was not ticking,because weaver cove had failed to provide documentation,pursuant to section c of the crmp,that dredged materials would be accepted by an approved upland facilit y.in a letter dated august,weaver cove replied that because the dredged materials were to be disposed of in massachusetts,and not in rhode island,section c of the crmp did not apply.on august,crmc responded,informing weaver cove that its application was still incomplete because it failed to file a water quality certificate but making no mention of the upland disposal issue.after additional communications,the parties failed to resolve the dispute.because it claimed to lack necessary data and information,crmc did not commence review of weaver cove consistency certification or its category b assent.it still has not done so.in short,as of this date,the appellant state agency has not acted on the merits of an application which has been pending before it since july.
over a year after its original application to crmc,weaver cove made separate filings to noaa,ferc,and the secretary of commerce,requesting a determination that crmc concurrence be conclusively presumed because crmc had failed to act on weaver cove application within the statutorily required deadline.c a.noaa took no action,ferc concluded it did not have authority to address the issue,and the secretary of commerce determined that he could not review the matter without an actual objection from crmc.this left the matter of whether crmc concurrence should be conclusively presumed to the courts for resolution.
weaver cove filed suit in the district court for the district of rhode island on june.it sought declaratory and injunctive relief,claiming that the disposal information and the water quality certification,which the appellant crmc had requested,were not necessary data and information,as required by the czma.weaver cove asserted the czma deadline should not be tolled and crmc concurrence should be conclusively presumed.in an amended complaint,weaver cove also argued that category b assent was preempted by provisions of the nga that grant ferc exclusive authority in approving lng facilities,e,and unlawful under the dormant commerce clause.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of weaver cove,on both the czma and the nga claims.weaver cove,d at.the court found that neither the disposal information,nor the water quality certificate were necessary data and information,and so weaver cove application was not incomplete.id.at.thus,crmc had failed to meet the statutory deadline and its concurrence was conclusively presumed.id.at.in particular,with respect to the disposal information,the court found,based on statutory interpretation and the interpretation which the other state agency of rhode island,ridem,had adopted,that the term approved upland facilities in section c of the crmp referred only to disposal facilities in rhode island.weaver cove,d at.since weaver cove intended to dispose of the dredged material out of state in massachusetts at that time the court concluded that crmc could not require proof that the material would be accepted.id.the district court,acting under the nga,also held the category b assent process utilized by crmc was preempted on three grounds.first,it found the process expressly preempted by the language of,granting ferc exclusive authority to approve or deny an application to build an lng terminal.weaver cove,d at.second,the court found the assent process implicitly field preempted because congress clearly intended that the nga occupy the entire field of lng regulation.id.at.finally,the district court found the category b assent process preempted here because it specifically conflicted with ferc jurisdiction to regulate lng facilities.id.at.the court also held that the case was not rendered moot by the changes in the project that occurred after the date weaver cove submitted its consistency certification.id.at.it did not reach the dormant commerce clause question.
jurisdiction 
we first hold that we have jurisdiction to hear this case.crmc does not raise any challenge to standing,mootness,or ripeness massachusetts,in its brief amicus curiae to this court but not to the district court,argues broadly that there is no case or controversy here,based on standing,mootness,and lack of ripeness.amici can not insert new arguments,not made by a party,into a case.pharm.research mfrs.of am.concannon,cir.nonetheless,we review standing,mootness,and ripeness in the constitutional sense to see whether we have article iii jurisdiction because we are independently obligated to do so,regardless of whether the parties raise the issue.pagan calderon,cir.for the reasons discussed below,we are satisfied we have jurisdiction.
we first address standing.massachusetts asserts that because weaver cove has not shown that a decision in their favor will relieve a discrete injury to them,weaver cove lacks standing.massachusetts epa,d quoting larson valente,d internal quotation marks omitted.it argues that events completely unrelated to crmc regulatory processes have prevented the project from proceeding.massachusetts is not entirely clear in explaining what those events are,but its brief earlier description of the project suggests it is referring to challenges weaver cove has faced in satisfying other state and federal permitting requirements.because crmc regulatory requirements do affect weaver cove ultimate ability to receive federal approval,we conclude that weaver cove has standing.
a plaintiff wishing to establish standing must show a concrete and particularized injury in fact,a causal connection that permits tracing the claimed injury to the defendant actions,and a likelihood that prevailing in the action will afford some redress for the injury.city of bangor citizens commc ns,cir quoting me.people alliance natural res.def.council mallinckrodt,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the plaintiff need not show that the defendant actions are the very last step in the chain of causation for the injury.bennett spear,d.it suffices if the plaintiff can show injury produced by determinative or coercive effect upon the action of someone else.id.
in this case,crmc actions have directly affected the federal regulatory processes that determine whether the lng terminal project can proceed.consistency review is a condition for ferc approval,and ferc has stated it has no authority to address crmc refusal to act while crmc inaction may not be the exclusive reason federal approval has not been granted,it is clear that failure to obtain concurrence from crmc has a determinative or coercive effect on the federal agencies.bennett,at.weaver cove therefore has standing to make its claims.
in addition,weaver cove has standing to make its preemption claims because it suffers a concrete injury from rhode island subjecting it to a preempted state law.even if crmc concurrence in weaver cove consistency certification were presumed,category b assent would still bar lng construction if we did not address it here.this would impose a palpable and considerable hardship on its project.pac.gas state energy res.conservation dev.comm n,d.
this case is not rendered moot by weaver cove failure to achieve complete regulatory approval for its original proposal or by its submission of the offshore berth amendment.a case is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.powell mccormack,d.we will only find a case moot if an intervening event makes it impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief.gulf of me.fisherman alliance daley,cir quoting church of scientology united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.
weaver cove efforts to obtain regulatory approval for the lng terminal from all of the relevant actors do indeed constitute a live issue.these efforts are ongoing and the offshore berth amendment represents an attempt by weaver cove to address some of the concerns that may have earlier delayed approval.while weaver cove still has conditions to meet following the amendment,weaver cove did,for example,get approval from the coast guard,which previously had been a hurdle.since crmc consistency certification remains a requirement of ferc and of the army corps,that question is clearly live.this is especially so because the offshore berth amendment itself does not render moot the dispute here with rhode island.as the army corps has itself noted,the planned dredging activities in rhode island have not changed,even under the amendment a decision in favor of the plaintiff in this case would provide effectual relief because it would clear a barrier to achieving approval for the project.
this case is also ripe.although federal regulatory approval for the offshore berth amendment is ongoing,our review of this case is neither advisory nor irrelevant to the ultimate approvability of the project.fall river,at.
massachusetts cites fall river in an attempt to argue that this case will lack ripeness until the project receives authorization from several key federal agencies.but it disregards important differences in the facts and procedural background of this case.in fall river,we held that a challenge to ferc conditional approval of this project was not ripe because the decision was not final until the completion of reviews by the united states coast guard and the department of the interior.id.at.because ferc decision was not final we could not be sure our opinion would not be advisory.id.at.in contrast,the plaintiff requested relief in this case would be final.crmc consistency review and category b assent requirements would cease to be barriers to ultimate approval of the project.another difference from fall river is that ferc and the other relevant agencies have expressly declined to resolve the issue raised by this appeal on the grounds that they have no authority to do so.it is true that resolutions of these issues might not secure the project ultimate approval,but it would neither be advisory nor irrelevant.
czma consistency review conclusive presumption of concurrence 
we hold that crmc concurrence with weaver cove dredging plans must be conclusively presumed under c a.we affirm the district court.weaver cove,d at.
a district court may grant summary judgment on a finding that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.an issue is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party,and a fact is material if it has the potential to affect the outcome of the suit.horizon lines of,cir quoting anderson liberty lobby,d centennial wireless,cir citation omitted.on appeal,we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.general,cir.
we review the district court holding that,in this case,a letter certifying acceptance of dredged material,as listed in section c of the crmp,did not constitute necessary data and information within the meaning of a because weaver cove did not intend to dispose of the waste in rhode island weaver cove,d at.if,as crmc contends,the letter is necessary data and information required by the crmp,crmc is not compelled to commence reviewing the consistency certification until weaver cove provides it.a.the deadline for presumed concurrence would be tolled until that time.id.if,on the other hand,the letter is not necessary data and information,as the district court found,the period from weaver cove submission of the consistency certification in july has clearly expired,and we are required to find crmc concurrence presumed.c a.we affirm the district court conclusion.
as the district court noted,the state crmp does not define approved upland facilit y.weaver cove,d at.however,other rhode island laws have shed light on the language meaning.rhode island marine waterways and boating facilities act of waterways and boating act,laws to,and associated regulations,set forth a comprehensive system regulating dredging activities and disposal of dredged materials in the state.the district judge relied on these regulations to conclude that facilities outside of rhode island are not among the approved upland facilities from which the crmp requires a letter of acceptance.weaver cove,d at.
we agree with the district court that the language of section c of the crmp can only be read to cover facilities located in the state of rhode island because the state regulatory framework for dredging only provides for the identification of approved upland facilities within the state.
we begin with the rhode island statutes that govern regulation of dredging in the state.rhode island law makes the crmc responsible for prepar ing,adopt ing and maintain ing a comprehensive plan for dredged material management for dredging that takes place in the coastal zone.laws.a.but the same statute delegates to ridem the task of adopt ing by rule a list of upland sites and types of areas suitable for beneficial use and disposal of dredged materials.id.b.this list is then incorporated in the crmc comprehensive plan for dredged material management.id.the waterways and boating act does not define upland sites,but it does define u pland areas as areas that are not in the coastal zone.id.thus,while both agencies may be responsible for interpreting whether upland disposal facilities can include out of state disposal facilities,only ridem is charged with approving upland sites.
ridem has in turn promulgated its own rules and regulations for dredging and the management of dredged material dredging regulations pursuant to the waterways and boating act.of envtl,rules and regulations for dredging and the management of dredged material,available at hereinafter dredging regulations.these regulations are also intended to be consistent with the czma,and must be implemented according to a written protocol jointly adopted by crmc and ridem,id.among the stated purposes of these regulations is to i dentify and list upland sites suitable for beneficial use disposal of dredged material,id,and,as the district court noted,the dredging regulations apply to all aspects of dredging proposed in marine waters of the state of rhode island,id.the dredging regulations do not contain an express definition for approved upland facilities,but they do define upland areas more narrowly than the corresponding term in the waterways and boating act,laws,as a ll areas of the state that are not in the coastal zone.dredging regulations emphasis added.
since ridem is tasked with approving upland disposal facilities,laws b,and it only approves upland facilities within the state of rhode island,dredging regulations,it follows that the approved upland facilities referred to by section c of the crmp should be read to be facilities within the state of rhode island.to hold otherwise would render the c r mp specific language a nullity.weaver cove,d at.
in any event,appellant has not pointed to any regulatory process for the approval of upland sites outside of rhode island,nor has it produced a list of approved facilities outside of the state.absent language in rhode island law to the contrary,we presume state laws,like this one,not to have extraterritorial effect.carnero boston sci,cir.
crmc responds that it has an interest in confirming that material dredged from its coast is properly disposed,regardless of the ultimate location,and that the district court improperly relied on another agency interpretation of the waterways and boating act,which it administers.citing language from both the waterways and boating act,laws,and the crmc organic statute,id.e,that designate crmc as the lead agency for purposes of regulating dredging activities,crmc argues that federal courts must defer to its broader interpretation of its own regulations for its own purposes.it explains that although ridem may,in its limited role of approving disposal sites,only be concerned with upland facilities within rhode island,crmc is more broadly concerned with ensuring the proper disposal of dredged material 
crmc cites no authority in support of its view,and in this context,the view is untenable.since for the purposes of czma consistency review,we are only concerned with the requirements of the crmp,crmc argument that it is entitled to deference in its interpretation of the waterways and boating act is inapposite.we are concerned only with its interpretation of section c of the crmp,and complementary regulatory schemes to the extent they shed light on its meaning.
it is true,as crmc points out,that federal agency interpretations of their own regulations when authorized by congress are controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.auer robbins,d quoting robertson methow valley citizens council,d.however,even if we applied that standard here,crmc can not satisfy it because the plain language of section c of the crmp calls for approved upland facilities emphasis added.thus,even if upland facilities can be interpreted to include facilities outside of rhode island,crmc has not pointed to any regulatory scheme that deals with the approval of facilities or even a list of approved facilities.the only regulatory scheme for approving upland facilities is that administered by ridem,and crmc interpretation of its regulation is therefore clearly erroneous 
this construction of state law also permits us to avoid an issue of whether a different construction would violate federal law.as noted,see supra note,an individual state may not purport to undertake out of state regulation for consistency review purposes without getting noaa consent.e.
preemption of state category b assent to dredging by section of the natural gas act and by ferc conditional approval 
we review the district court finding that crmc state law licensing program for coastal dredging,the category b assent process,is preempted by the nga,at least on the facts here.at stake is whether crmc may still delay the project based on weaver cove failure to satisfy section c of the crmp or other crmp requirements,despite our conclusion that concurrence in weaver cove consistency certification should be presumed.our standard when reviewing a district court finding of preemption is de novo.fitzgerald harris,cir spggc,llc ayotte,cir.
while the district court found the category b assent process preempted on a number of grounds,weaver cove,d at,we affirm for the narrowest reason,that of conflict preemption.
in its order,ferc analyzed weaver cove proposed dredging activities in both rhode island and massachusetts,assessed the environmental impact the dredging would have and compared it with alternatives,and analyzed the effect on the water and wildlife,land use,recreation,ship traffic,and air quality.weaver cove energy,llc,at discussing environmental issues reviewed and adopting the findings of ferc final environmental impact statement feis office of energy projects,fed.energy regulatory comm n,docket no,weaver cove lng project final environmental impact statement may hereinafter weaver cove feis.further,ferc concluded that the dredging was part of the construction and operation of the terminal project.thus,category b assent clearly conflicts with f
