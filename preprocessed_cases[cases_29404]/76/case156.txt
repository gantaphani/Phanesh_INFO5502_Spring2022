this appeal addresses one of the several administrative proceedings in which columbia riverkeeper,columbia pacific common sense,and wahkiakum friends of the river collectively riverkeeper have attempted to intervene in an effort to prevent lng development company,llc doing business as oregon lng,from constructing a liquefied natural gas facility and pipeline along the columbia river in oregon.as part of the lengthy terminal siting process,the coast guard provided the federal energy regulatory commission ferc with a letter of recommendation sometimes referred to as a lor regarding the suitability of the waterway for vessel traffic associated with the proposed facility.riverkeeper petitions for review of the coast guard issuance of the letter of recommendation,contending that we have jurisdiction under d,which authorizes judicial review of agency orders and actions that issue,condition,or deny any permit,license,concurrence,or approval.because the letter of recommendation is not such an order or action,we conclude we lack jurisdiction and dismiss the petition for review.
liquefied natural gas lng is natural gas that has been supercooled into liquid form and reheated back into gas form at natural gas terminals for transport to customers.gas light ferc.although the process for liquefying natural gas has been known since the century and used commercially since the,interest in transporting lng for commercial use increased first in the due to declines in gas reserves,and again more recently.see jacob dweck,david wochner,michael brooks,liquefied natural gas lng litigation after the energy policy act of state powers in lng terminal siting,energy.the supercooling process reduces the volume of the natural gas to of natural gas in vapor form,and,according to the coast guard,makes transporting liquefied natural gas the most economical way to import natural gas from overseas.once natural gas has been liquefied,it can be transported in an lng tanker to an lng import terminal,which receives,stores and processes the lng.these facilities are typically sited in coastal areas with shipping access.aes sparrows point lng,llc smith,cir.because activities involving lng have a potential for explosions,fires,and spills,federal,state,and local governments have taken steps to regulate the siting and operation of lng terminal facilities.
to understand the role of the coast guard letter of recommendation in the regulatory process,it is necessary to review the historical development of the legal framework for siting lng terminal facilities.prior to,different federal agencies allocated responsibility for regulating lng terminal facilities amongst themselves by means of interagency agreements,with little guidance from congress.the natural gas act of nga authorized ferc predecessor agency the federal power commission to approve the import and export of natural gas,and the extension and improvement of transportation facilities,but did not reference lng terminal facility siting responsibility.beginning in,congress enacted a series of pipeline safety statutes that gave the department of transportation dot authority to issue minimum safety standards for siting new liquefied natural gas pipeline facilities.dot and ferc ultimately entered into an interagency agreement to allocate their respective responsibilities.see memorandum of understanding between the department of transportation and the federal energy regulatory commission regarding liquefied natural gas transportation facilities.
in addition,the coast guard asserted authority over siting decisions affecting the safety and security of port areas and navigable waterways under the ports and waterways safety act,the magnuson act of,and executive order.in early,the coast guard and a dot subagency the office of pipeline safety operation of the materials transportation bureau entered into a memorandum of understanding regarding the division of regulatory responsibility over lng terminals.believing that the agreement gave it broad regulatory authority,the coast guard commenced a rulemaking proceeding and proposed regulations that would require any person siting an lng facility to obtain a use permit from the coast guard.liquefied natural gas facilities,proposed.after further congressional action suggested that the coast guard view of its regulatory authority was too broad,the coast guard reduced its ambition.pursuant to a revised memorandum of understanding with dot,signed in,the coast guard proposed revised regulations replacing its proposed use permit requirement with a requirement that a project proponent merely secure a letter of recommendation from the coast guard.liquefied natural gas waterfront facilities,proposed.
beginning in the,there was a rapid increase in efforts to site lng import terminals.in response to growing safety and environmental concerns,a number of states claimed authority to regulate lng facilities under specific state lng statutes or under general environmental,zoning,or construction laws.see parfomake vann,congressional research service,liquefied natural gas lng import terminals siting,safety,and regulation,at,see also,weaver cove energy,llc coastal res.mgmt.council,cir aes sparrows point lng,at.california also asserted exclusive authority to regulate lng facilities that did not impact interstate commerce,claiming that ferc lacked authority under the nga to regulate such sites.see,e,re sound energy solutions,notice of intervention and protest of the public utilities commission of the state of california,at,ferc docket no.
in,ferc,the coast guard,and a dot subagency the research and special programs administration responded to the terrorist events of september,by entering into another interagency agreement to divide regulatory responsibility for the safety and security review of waterfront lng facilities.this agreement confirmed that ferc had lead regulatory authority for the siting and construction of onshore lng facilities.the agencies also agreed that ferc would be the lead agency for preparing an environmental impact statement eis under the national environmental policy act nepa.
in,consistent with this interagency agreement,the coast guard issued a navigation and vessel inspection circular,nvic,providing guidance for persons seeking a permit to build and operate a lng terminal.the circular confirmed that ferc was responsible for authorizing the siting and construction of onshore lng facilities,and was the lead agency for the nepa process.the circular stated that the coast guard would serve as a cooperating agency under nepa,see,and would provide ferc with a letter of recommendation as required in the coast guard regulations that set forth its formal evaluation of the suitability of the waterway for lng marine traffic.according to the coast guard,issuing such a letter of recommendation was a federal action which requires compliance with nepa to the same extent as ferc authorization for construction and operation of an lng facility.
just a few months later,congress enacted the energy policy act epact of,stat,which finally clarified congress intent regarding the division of responsibility for siting and operating lng terminal facilities.the epact resolved a number of important issues.first,the act amended the applicable section of the natural gas act to give ferc the exclusive authority to approve or deny an application for the siting,construction,expansion,or operation of an lng terminal,stat.at,codified at e emphasis added,thereby precluding other federal or state agencies from asserting such authority.
second,in response to the states interest in having some control over lng import terminals within their jurisdiction,congress took a compromise position.although congress grant of exclusive authority to ferc in siting decisions precluded the states imposition of state law requirements,the epact preserved the states authority under several federal environmental laws to require project proponents to obtain a state compliance certification,stat.at,codified at d.but to prevent states from using this authority to block lng projects completely,see dweck,wochner,brooks,supra,at examining connecticut successful efforts to block the islander east pipeline project using its water quality certification authority under the cwa,the epact allowed for federal judicial review of an order or action of a state administrative agency acting pursuant to federal law to issue,condition,or deny any permit,license,concurrence,or approval,stat.at,codified at d see islander pipeline.dep t of envtl,cir stating that legislative history confirms that this provision was enacted to allow expedited federal judicial review of a state denial of a required federal permit see also dweck,wochner,brooks,supra,at noting that the conflict between islander east and connecticut led congress to enact d.
finally,the epact confirmed that ferc was the lead agency for the purposes of coordinating all applicable federal authorizations and for the purposes of complying with nepa,stat.at,codified at b.it required ferc to promulgate regulations for nepa compliance that require a of lng import terminal siting applications,stat.at,codified at a.
although the epact did not speak directly to the coast guard role in siting lng facilities,after the epact enactment,the coast guard revisited its internal procedures,and issued a new navigation and vessel inspection circular,nvic,on december.now understanding that its letter of recommendation was not a final decision,but rather mere advice to ferc the agency with exclusive authority to make all siting decisions under the epact,the coast guard determined its letter of recommendation did not constitute a permitting action and must not impose requirements or conditions mandated by the coast guard.accordingly,the coast guard no longer deemed its letter of recommendation to require separate compliance with nepa.in,congress confirmed this approach.in of the coast guard authorization act of,congress required the secretary of the department in which the coast guard is operating to make a recommendation,after considering recommendations made by the states,to the federal energy regulatory commission as to whether the waterway to a proposed waterside liquefied natural gas facility is suitable or unsuitable for the marine traffic associated with such facility,stat.this language confirmed congress intent to limit the coast guard role in licensing lng facilities to issuing letters of recommendation.
accordingly,by the year the coast guard issued the letter of recommendation in this case,the regulatory framework for a party seeking to site an lng facility was as follows.ferc was the exclusive siting authority and lead agency under nepa.b.ferc required an applicant to engage in a procedure before filing an application.see.among other steps,the applicant had to file a letter of intent and waterway suitability assessment with the captain of the of the zone in which the facility would be located,pursuant to and.after reviewing the letter of intent and accompanying assessment,the captain of the port would issue a letter of recommendation regarding the proposed facility.under coast guard regulations,a person directly affected by the letter of recommendation could request reconsideration by the coast guard officer responsible,id.a,and pursue two additional levels of administrative review,id.
after the project proponent filed an application with ferc,ferc would undertake an extensive review and consultation process with various federal,state,and local agencies,as well as private parties,and also convene public hearings.see e b.this process included the work necessary to comply with nepa.other state and federal cooperating agencies assist ferc in preparing an eis.the project proponent was required to obtain all necessary permits and approvals from state and other federal bodies,and could challenge the denial of any permits or approvals required under federal law in a federal court of appeals.see id.d.once this process was completed,ferc could issue a final decision approving or denying the application.see id.e.ferc could approve the application in whole or part,with such modifications and upon such terms and conditions as it found necessary and appropriate.id.e.
upon ferc issuance of the order,any person could apply for rehearing within days.id.a.within days of ferc order on the application for rehearing,an aggrieved party could obtain review of the order in the court of appeals wherein the company to which the order relates is located by filing a written petition.id.b.
we now turn to the facts of this case.in,oregon lng began the process it made an initial filing with ferc and filed a letter of intent and a preliminary waterway suitability assessment with the captain of the port for portland for a proposed lng terminal and pipeline.the letter stated that oregon lng intended to construct an lng facility on the east skipanon peninsula,near the confluence of the skipanon and the columbia river in warrenton,oregon.in august,ferc published a notice of intent to prepare an eis for the east skipanon lng terminal.lng development company,llc and oregon pipeline company notice of intent.
oregon lng filed its formal application for the east skipanon lng terminal with ferc in october,prompting ferc to issue a notice of application.lng development company,llc oregon lng oregon pipeline company,llc notice of applications.riverkeeper and other environmental organizations intervened in the ferc proceedings pursuant to on november,
on april,the captain of the port issued the letter of recommendation at issue in this case,and the accompanying analysis for oregon lng east skipanon lng terminal,pursuant to.the letter stated the captain determination that the applicable portions of the columbia river and its approaches are not currently suitable,but could be made suitable for the type and frequency of lng marine traffic associated with this project.the letter of recommendation included the following statement 
while this letter has no enforcement status,the determinations,analysis,and ultimate recommendation as to the suitability of this waterway,as contained in this letter,would be referenced in concert with a captain of the port order,should an lng transit be attempted along this waterway without full implementation of the risk mitigation measures.
the analysis accompanying the letter listed additional mitigation measures that were recommended to responsibly manage the safety and security risks of the project,while acknowledging that the specifics of each suggested mitigation measure would require further development through the creation of an emergency response plan as well as a transit management plan.
on may,riverkeeper and other intervenors requested reconsideration of the letter of recommendation under a,on the ground that the coast guard had failed to comply with nepa and the endangered species act esa.the captain of the port denied the motion for reconsideration on july,and riverkeeper filed an administrative appeal,see b,which was denied by a district commander on december.
thereafter,an assistant commandant denied riverkeeper second administrative appeal,see c,on august.in his august decision letter,the assistant commandant stated that issuance of the letter of recommendation was not an agency action under the esa or administrative procedure act apa,or a major federal action under nepa,because its issuance carries no legal significance in and of itself,the letter of recommendation was not a condition precedent for and does not bar ferc from authorizing the east skipanon lng terminal without adopting the captain of the port recommendations or incorporating any of the mitigation measures.the letter does not impose any legal requirement on any party to comply with its recommendations it is not legally binding on the coast guard,any other government agency,or oregon lng.nor does the letter have an impact on vessel traffic,because t he issuance of an lor neither authorizes,nor prohibits,an lng carrier from conducting a transit of the waterway and vessels are not required to obtain coast guard transit permits.rather,the issuance of a captain of the port letter is separate and distinct from the recommendations provided in an lor,which are not enforceable,and the captain of the port is not bound by the recommendations contained in the lor.
riverkeeper then filed a petition for review here,challenging the letter of recommendation and the august,decision pursuant to d of the natural gas act.oregon lng intervened in the proceedings.
as a threshold matter,we must determine whether d gives us jurisdiction to review riverkeeper challenge to the letter of recommendation and the coast guard final denial of riverkeeper administrative appeal.riverkeeper contends that in enacting d,congress intended to create an exception to the general rule that review of agency action is typically located in the district courts under the apa absent a specific statutory provision to the contrary,cal.energy comm dep t of energy,cir.we review questions regarding our jurisdiction de novo.sandoval luna mukasey,cir per curiam.it is to be presumed that a cause lies outside of federal courts limited jurisdiction,and the burden of establishing the contrary rests upon the party asserting jurisdiction.kokkonen guardian life ins.of,citations omitted.
we begin with the text of the jurisdictional statute,which provides in relevant part 
the united states court of appeals for the circuit in which a facility subject to section of this title is proposed to be constructed,expanded,or operated shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action for the review of an order or action of a federal agency other than the commission or state administrative agency acting pursuant to federal law to issue,condition,or deny any permit,license,concurrence,or approval hereinafter collectively referred to as permit required under federal law

neither we nor our sister circuits have defined the phrase order or action in d.in interpreting statutes authorizing judicial review of agency decisions,however,the supreme court has held that t he strong presumption is that judicial review will be available only when agency action becomes final.bell new jersey,holding that a statute allowing judicial review of any action by the secretary of education gives federal courts jurisdiction only over orders or actions that are final see also fpc metro.edison,holding that the word order in a section of the federal power act substantially identical to b refers only to final orders.this rule of construction reflects the supreme court inference that congress generally does not intend to afford opportunity for constant delays in the course of the administrative proceeding,such as would arise if courts could review every interim agency order or action.metro.edison,at.
nothing in d overcomes this strong presumption.bell,at.congress intent to authorize judicial review over only final orders or actions is strongly supported by the language of d,which limits judicial review to those agency decisions that issue,condition,or deny any permit,license,concurrence,or approval,the sort of final decisions that occur at the conclusion of an administrative process.further,reading d as limiting judicial review to final agency decisions is consistent with the interpretation of b,a related section of the same statute.although b permits federal court review of an order issued by ferc,the supreme court as well as our sister circuits and our own precedents read this language as authorizing judicial review only over final orders.see consol.gas supply ferc,cir considering b atlanta gas light fpc,cir same metro.edison,at considering language in the federal power act,b,which is substantially identical to b the steamboaters ferc,cir same papago tribal util.auth.ferc,same.in adding d to when it enacted the epact,congress did not give any sign it intended federal courts to exercise a broader scope of review over decisions than over ferc decisions.finally,the presumption that congress intended to authorize judicial review over only final agency decisions is supported by the same considerations relied on by the supreme court in metropolitan edison construing d as allowing judicial review of every interim action of a state or federal agency would do violence to the manifest purpose of the provision,at,which was to expedite siting decisions,see islander pipeline,at.accordingly,we conclude that d authorizes judicial review only over orders or actions that are final.an action or order is final when it imposes an obligation,denies a right,or fixes some legal relationship.city of fremont,at internal quotation marks omitted see also or.natural desert ass forest,cir same atlanta gas,at noting an order reviewable under b must be unambiguous in legal effect and have some substantial effect on the parties which can not be altered by subsequent administrative action.
section d limits our review not only to final actions and orders,but also to those that issue,condition,or deny any permit,license,concurrence,or approval hereinafter collectively referred to as permit required under federal law.although the statute does not define permit,license,concurrence,or approval,it collectively refers to these terms as permit,indicating that congress intended to capture the type of agency determination that grants or denies permission to take some action.see united states stevens,applying noscitur a sociis canon.the dictionary definition of permit is a written warrant or license granted by one having authority,merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed,which is similar to the definitions of the other statutory terms indeed,the terms are often defined by one another.see,black law dictionary ed defining permit as a certificate evidencing permission a license emphasis added id.at defining license as a permission,usu.revocable,to commit some act emphasis added.
accordingly,congress contemplated that an order or action reviewable under d would be a final agency action or order issuing,conditioning or denying an agency determination of a sort analogous to a permit that has the legal effect of granting or denying permission to take some action.
applying this interpretation,the letter of recommendation for the east skipanon lng terminal is not a permitting action or order under of the natural gas act.
on its face,the coast guard letter of recommendation for this terminal is not an agency determination granting or denying permission to take some action.as early as,the coast guard recognized that its siting authority was limited and retreated from its position that it was authorized to issue a use permit for lng terminal facilities.instead,it promulgated regulations allowing it to issue only a letter of recommendation.congress express grant of exclusive siting authority to ferc,see e,further clarified that the coast guard lacks authority over siting decisions.congress is assumed to know existing law,and congress did not require ferc to obtain or comply with the coast guard letter of recommendation,even though the coast guard had begun issuing such letters long before the epact was enacted.see goodyear atomic miller,we generally presume that congress is knowledgeable about existing law pertinent to the legislation it enacts.
congress subsequently confirmed that the coast guard only obligation was to make a recommendation to ferc as to the suitability of the waterway,stat.at because recommendation is not defined,we assume congress adopted the common meaning of the term recommendation,which is a suggestion or advisement without decisive authority,see merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed defining recommendation as the act of recommending id.defining recommend as to present as worthy of acceptance to endorse as fit worthy or competent advise.because nothing in the epact or the coast guard authorization act suggests that the coast guard recommendation is anything mo
