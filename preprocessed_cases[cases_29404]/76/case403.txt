introduction 
the california commission on state mandates the commission appeals from the judgment entered following the partial grant of for judgment on the pleadings.the county of los angeles,the los angeles county flood control district,and the cities of commerce,carson,downey,hawaiian gardens,montebello,santa fe springs,signal hill,artesia,beverly hills,la mirada,monrovia,norwalk,rancho palos verdes,san marino and westlake village collectively,filed a from the judgment.
in,the regional water quality control board regional water board,los angeles region,issued a national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit for municipal stormwater and urban runoff discharges,which obligated to inspect industrial,commercial and construction water treatment facilities which obligation claim the state previously performed and to install and maintain trash receptacles at transit stops.
presented test claims to the executive director of the commission seeking reimbursement for carrying out these obligations pursuant to the constitutional requirement for subvention arising from a state mandate cal,art.xiii b.the executive director returned the claims unadjudicated,because they did not involve an executive order under section of the government code section.in denying the appeals of,the commission noted it was without authority to declare a statute unconstitutional and concluded that section excludes from the subvention requirement any order,which includes a permit,issued by the regional water boards of the state water resources control board state water board.
section of article xiii b of the california constitution article xiii b,section provides in pertinent part whenever the legislature or any state agency mandates a new program or higher level of service on any local government,the state shall provide a subvention of funds to reimburse that local government for the costs of the program or increased level of service italics added.
as we shall discuss,section is unconstitutional to the extent it exempts regional water boards from the constitutional state mandate subvention requirement.its creation of an exception for regional water boards,which are state agencies,contravenes the plain,unequivocal,and reference to any state agency in article xiii b,section.moreover,a contrary conclusion is not compelled by virtue of the fact that section essentially mirrors the language of section,subdivision c c of the revenue and taxation code.a statute can not trump the constitution.
we decline to consider the commission new claim that the constitutional challenge to section by is barred by the limitation period of section of the code of civil procedure.this statute of limitations defense,which should have been raised before the trial court,is not cognizable on this appeal.
the commission urges that should this court conclude section is unconstitutional,the appropriate remedy is to afford the commission the opportunity to pass on the merits of the subject test claims on the issues of whether the subject permit qualifies as a state mandated program under article xiii b,section the permit amounts to a new program or higher level of service and the permit imposes costs on local entities.we find its position persuasive.
the filed by is premised on the theory that if subvention of funds from the commission is foreclosed by section,are entitled to pursue an independent action against the regional water board,los angeles region la regional water board.this,which is simply protective in nature,is moot.
in sum,we uphold the trial court issuance of a writ of mandate directing the commission to set aside its decisions affirming its executive director rejections of the subject test claims and to consider fully these test claims and determine whether are entitled to reimbursement without consideration of section,and we affirm the judgment in its entirety.
background 
article xiii b,section,subvention of funds for state mandates 
the electorate approved proposition in,thus adding article xiii b to the state constitution.while the earlier proposition limited the state and local governments power to increase taxes see cal,art.xiii a,added by initiative measure in primary june,proposition,the spirit of,imposed a complementary limit on the rate of growth in governmental spending.san francisco taxpayers board of supervisors cal th,d.this measure also provided for reimbursement to local governments for the costs of complying with certain requirements mandated by the state.long beach unified sch.dist.state of california d.
v oters were told that section of proposition was intended to prevent state government attempts to force programs on local governments without the state paying for them.ballot,special statewide.county of sonoma commission on state mandates th,d see also,county of los angeles state of california cal d,intent was not all local costs arising from compliance with state law to be reimbursable rather,intent was to prevent the perceived attempt by the state to enact legislation or adopt administrative orders creating programs to be administered by local agencies,thereby transferring to those agencies the fiscal responsibility for providing services which the state believed should be extended to the public.
section was included in article xiii b in recognition that article xiii a of the constitution severely restricted the taxing powers of local governments.citation.the provision was intended to preclude the state from shifting financial responsibility for carrying out governmental functions onto local entities that were ill equipped to handle the task.citations.specifically,it was designed to protect the tax revenues of local governments from state mandates that would require expenditure of such revenues.thus,although its language broadly declares that the state shall provide a subvention of funds to reimburse local government for the costs of a new program or higher level of service,read in its textual and historical context section of article xiii b requires subvention only when the costs in question can be recovered solely from tax revenues.county of fresno state of california cal d,italics original see also,lucia mar unified school dist.honig cal d,fn,a reimbursement requirement was enshrined in the constitution to provide local entities with the assurance that state mandates would not place additional burdens on their increasingly limited revenue resources.
article xiii b,section provides a whenever the legislature or any state agency mandates a new program or higher level of service on any local government,the state shall provide a subvention of funds to reimburse that local government for the costs of the program or increased level of service,except that the legislature may,but need not,provide such a subvention of funds for the following mandates.legislative mandates requested by the local agency affected.legislation defining a new crime or changing an existing definition of a crime.legislative mandates enacted prior to january,or executive orders or regulations initially implementing legislation enacted prior to january.
subvention generally means a grant of financial aid or assistance,or a subsidy.citation.as used in connection with costs,the basic legal requirements of subvention can be easily stated it is in the application of the rule that difficulties arise.
essentially,the constitutional rule of state subvention provides that the state is required to pay for any new governmental programs,or for higher levels of service under existing programs,that it imposes upon local governmental agencies.citation.this does not mean that the state is required to reimburse local agencies for any incidental cost that may result from the enactment of a state law rather,the subvention requirement is restricted to governmental services which the local agency is required by state law to provide to its residents.citation.the subvention requirement is intended to prevent the state from transferring the costs of government from itself to local agencies.citation.reimbursement is required when the state freely chooses to impose on local agencies any peculiarly governmental cost which they were not previously required to absorb.citation.hayes commission on state mandates th,at,d.
the subvention requirement of article xiii b,section is triggered if the legislature or any state agency mandates a new program or higher level of service.art.xiii b.such requirement is inapplicable where the additional costs on local governments are imposed by a federal mandate,the federal government.article xiii b,section,subdivision b,defines federally mandated appropriations as those required to comply with mandates of the courts or the federal government which,without discretion,require an expenditure for additional services or which unavoidably make the provision of existing services more costly.italics added.
existence of state mandate matter for the commission 
whether a particular cost incurred by a local government arises from carrying out a state mandate for which subvention is required under article xiii b,section,is a matter for the commission to determine in the first instance.
a local government initiates the process for subvention under article xiii b,section by filing a claim with the commission,county of san diego state of california cal th,d,futility exception to exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine applicable to failure to file claim before commission.the initial claim is referred to as a test claim.
the legislature enacted government code sections through to implement article xiii b,section.county of fresno state of california,supra,cal d at.the provisions of government code sections et provide the sole and exclusive procedure by which a local agency may claim reimbursement for costs mandated by the state as required by article xiii b,section.

regional water board order not executive order 
section defines,in pertinent part,an e xecutive order as any order,plan,requirement,rule,or regulation issued by a ny agency of state government,except an e xecutive order does not include any order,plan,requirement,rule,or regulation issued by the state water board or by any regional water board pursuant to division commencing with section of the water code.added by stats,ch.
in light of the above definition,the subject permit issued by an order of the la regional water board can not constitute an executive order implementing any statute,which mandates a new program or higher level of service of an existing program within the meaning of the article xiii b,section requirement of subvention of funds to local governments for carrying out a state mandate.
procedural posture 
la regional water board issued order,which adopted npdes permit no.permit.this permit imposed two obligations on for the purpose of regulating municipal stormwater and urban runoff discharges in los angeles county.the first required to inspect industrial,commercial and construction sites to ensure compliance with the law,and the other required to install and maintain trash receptacles at transit stops.
filed four test claims,test claims,and,seeking reimbursement of costs for carrying out these obligations.the executive director rejected these test claims as excluded from subvention pursuant to section.
in the administrative appeals,the commission found it was bound by section,upheld its executive director decision,and denied the appeals.
in their amended and consolidated petitions and complaints,sought,among other things an order requiring the state to reimburse them for the new programs or higher level of service under the permit or,alternatively,to allow them to offset payment of permit and other fees or moneys owed or to be transferred to the state against their costs an order enjoining state from refusing to reimburse them in the future or,alternatively,a preemptory writ of mandate directing the commission to accept their test claims and find they are entitled to reimbursement a declaration that section is unconstitutional a preemptory writ of mandate directing la regional water board either to delete or not enforce the subject obligations under the permit and a stay of the challenged portions of the permit.
the commission and filed for judgment on the pleadings.the trial court granted the commission motion as to the second cause of action for declaratory relief.the court explained the only actual controversy between and commission is whether claims should be deemed reimbursable.the sole and exclusive procedure by which to adjudicate this controversy is a mandate action under code of civil procedure section.government code s ections.the only pertinent relief under section is a finding that the commission has not proceeded in the manner required by law.declaratory relief is not available.
after construing the motion addressed to the third cause of action as a motion to strike improper requested relief,the court granted the motion and struck that part of the third cause of action requesting an order directing the commission to find their claims to be reimbursable on the ground t he court has no power at this time to do so.citations.
turning to motion for judgment on the pleadings,the trial court granted the motion as to the third cause of action for extraordinary writ relief,except as to the stricken request for improper relief 
the court found that to the extent section excepted the orders of regional water boards from the definition of executive orders,section was unconstitutional in that it expressly contravened article xiii b,section.the court ordered the commission to set aside its order affirming its executive director rejections of the four test claims and to consider these claims on the merits.
in granting in part petitions for a writ of mandate,the trial court found the commission,though it proceeded as required by statutory law,as it was constrained to do,has not proceeded as required by superior constitutional law.code civ,subd.a.the question whether state valid claims for reimbursement must be remanded to c ommission,which is ordered to consider these claims on their merits.citations.
a peremptory writ of mandate was issued on may.judgment was entered the same date.this appeal and followed.
standard of review 
the standard for reviewing a judgment on the pleadings is settled a motion for judgment on the pleadings is the equivalent of a general demurrer but is made after the time for demurrer has expired.the rules governing demurrers apply.citation.the grounds for a motion for judgment on the pleadings must appear on the face of the challenged complaint or be based on facts which the court may judicially notice.citations.on review we must determine if the complaint states a cause of action as a matter of law.citation.we review the complaint de novo to determine whether it alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any legal theory.citation.citation.mccormick travelers ins.th,d.
in reviewing the trial court ruling on a writ of mandate,the appellate court is ordinarily confined to an inquiry as to whether the findings and judgment of the trial court are supported by substantial evidence.evans unemployment ins.appeals bd.cal d.however,where the facts are undisputed and the issues present questions of law,the appellate court is not bound by the trial court decision but may make its own determination.ibid.connell superior court th,d.
discussion 
defense of statute of limitations forfeited 
on appeal for the first time,the commission asserts the challenge of to the constitutionality of section is barred by the limitation period of section of the code of civil procedure,which governs the timeliness of actions challenging the constitutionality of state funding for municipalities,school districts,special districts,and local agencies.
code of civil procedure section provides notwithstanding any other provision of law,any action or proceeding in which a county,city,city and county,school district,special district,or any other local agency is a plaintiff or petitioner,that is brought against the state of california challenging the constitutionality of any statute relating to state funding for counties,cities,cities and counties,school districts,special districts,or other local agencies,shall be commenced within days of the effective date of the statute at issue in the action.for purposes of this section,state of california means the state of california itself,or any of its agencies,departments,commissions,boards,or public officials.added by stats,ch.assem.bill,eff.july,amended by stats,ch.bill,eff.july.
the commission argues the constitutional challenge to section is,because government code section et,including section,relates to state funding for counties and cities relative to local programs s ection was enacted in and became effective january.the petition in this case challenging section as unconstitutional was filed april,which was more than days after the effective date of section.
the of a statute of limitations may be raised by demurrer w here the complaint discloses on its face that the statute of limitations has run on the causes of action stated in the complaint,for the reason that it fails to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action.citation.abf capital berglass th,d.forfeiture of a defense transpires by the failure to raise the applicable statute of limitations in the answer.see,minton cavaney cal d,davies krasna cal d,mitchell county sanitation district of los angeles county d,see also,code civ.
as the commission concedes,it did not raise code of civil procedure section as an affirmative defense in its pleadings in the trial court.this omission signifies that the commission therefore has forfeited any right it may have had to assert section to bar,as untimely,the claims of to the constitutionality of section.
for a contrary conclusion,the commission argues the statute of limitations to challenge an administrative action is jurisdictional and should not be considered waived.united farm workers of america agricultural labor relations board d.tielsch city of anaheim d.donnellan city of novato th,d.if a time limit in a mandamus proceeding is held to be jurisdictional,estoppel or waiver can not extend the time.hollister convalescent,rico cal d.
the commission position is that this court should exercise its discretion to determine the applicability of the,because this issue is a question of law rather than of fact and t his matter affects the public interest since are seeking reimbursement from the state for costs incurred to comply with a permit issued by the la regional water board.in other words,taxpayers statewide could unjustly suffer the consequences of funding a local program if code of civil procedure section is not considered and section is held to be unconstitutional.as authority,the commission relies primarily on city of sacramento state of california cal d at pages,where issue of law rather than fact raised,exception governs over collateral estoppel bar and connell superior court,supra,th at pages,d public interest exception applicable to allow review of question of law as to whether recycled waste water regulation constituted reimbursable state mandate.
neither of the commission positions is successful.in the first instance,the of section of the code of civil procedure applies to a challenge to the constitutionality of any statute relating to state funding for counties and other local governmental entities,not to a challenge to an action by an administrative agency.as for the second,neither city of sacramento nor connell stand for the proposition that the bar of the applicable statute of limitations may be raised for the first time on appeal.
additionally,the commission characterization of the public interest to be served is a non sequitur.if section were in fact unconstitutional,it does not follow that taxpayers statewide could unjustly suffer the consequences of funding a local program.italics added.how could such funding result in injustice when any requirement of reimbursement to local governments would be under the constitutional compulsion of article xiii b,section 
existence of federal or state mandate issue for the commission 
it is undisputed that a federal mandate is not subject to the subvention requirement of article xiii b,section for a state mandate.accordingly,if the permit,including the subject two obligations thereunder,constitutes a federal mandate,the constitutionality of section is not implicated,and thus,no issue as to its constitutionality is before this court to address on the merits.see people ex rel.lynch superior court cal d,the rendering of advisory opinions falls within neither the functions nor the jurisdiction of this court.
in its amicus curiae brief,la regional water board takes the position that,as a matter of law,section is consistent with article xiii b,section and thus not unconstitutional to the extent division,chapter commencing with water code section simply implements federal mandates under the clean water act b.the water boards,the state water board and its regional water boards,implement the federal permit program under chapter,which the california legislature enacted to administration of such program directly by the federal environmental protection agency.
la regional water board takes the further position that the federal mandate nature of its npdes permits remains constant although it exercises discretion to control the discharge of pollutants through municipal stormwater programs not appearing in federal regulations.specifically,la regional water board argues when a state regional water board issues an npdes permit requiring municipalities to inspect facilities as a means of controlling their discharge of pollutants,this is not shifting state responsibilities onto local agencies,because f ederal law imposes inspection requirements upon municipal permittees.
as for the trash receptacle obligation,la regional water board points out the clean water act allows the use of programs to control discharge of pollutants in connection with a municipal stormwater permit and argues one such program under the permit is the ability of municipalities to employ best management practices bmps to attain water quality standards.it identifies t he permit trash receptacle requirement as one such bmp.
it further argues that the trash receptacle obligation can not be deemed a program,because it is not an absolute requirement.any permittee may petition the regional water board to substitute another equally effective bmp for one included within the permit.for instance,i f a permittee demonstrates that a program or level of service will be equally effective in controlling pollution,it may seek to substitute that program.
we are not convinced that the obligations imposed by a permit issued by a regional water board necessarily constitute federal mandates under all circumstances.as explained ante,the existence of a federal,as contrasted with a state,mandate is not easily ascertainable.
by letter,we invited the parties and la regional water board to address whether an obligation under an npdes permit by a regional water board can qualify as a state mandate within the meaning of article xiii b,section,assuming an npdes permit itself qualified as a federal mandate,and if so,why each of the subject two obligations does or does not constitute a state mandate.we have received their responses.
npdes permits issued by regional water boards 
california cases have repeatedly explained the complicated web of federal and state laws and regulations concerning water pollution,especially storm sewer discharge into the public waterways.city of burbank state water resources control bd.cal th,d,burbank building industry of san diego county state water resources control board th,d communities for a better environment state water resources control bd.th,d waterkeepers northern california state water resources control bd.th,d.
for purposes of this case,the important point is described by the california supreme court in burbank part of the federal clean water act et is the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes,t he primary means for enforcing effluent limitations and standards under the clean water act.arkansas oklahoma,d.the npdes sets out the conditions under which the federal epa or a state with an approved water quality control program can issue permits for the discharge of pollutants in wastewater.a b.in california,wastewater discharge requirements established by the regional water boards are the equivalent of the npdes permits required by federal law.burbank,supra,cal th at,d.

potential federal and state components of npdes permit 
as expected,la regional water board contends that as in the case of npdes permits as a whole,the individual conditions of an npdes permit are federally required to meet the mandates of the clean water act.it argues the permit is federally required.the conditions within it are federally required to implement the clean water act mandates.the two can not be separated into a federal permit with state conditions.citation.
respond,contrariwise,that a n npdes permit can contain both federal and non federal requirements.as case authority,they rely primarily on burbank,supra,cal th,d.our supreme court concluded that under the supremacy clause of the federal constitution,a regional water board must comply with the federal clean water act in issuing an npdes permit.id.at,d.nonetheless,u nder the federal clean water act,each state is free to enforce its own water quality laws so long as its effluent limitations are not less stringent than those set out in the clean water act citation.id.at,d.the court thus acknowledged in burbank that an npdes permit may contain terms federally mandated and terms exceeding federal law.see also,burbank,supra,at,d.also point out that the potential for mandated components of an npdes permit is acknowledged under both federal law and state law 
additionally,argue that an obligation imposed on a municipality arises as a result of a federal law or program does not,in and of itself,render that obligation a federal mandate.rather,they assert that to qualify as a federal mandate,federal law itself must impose the obligation upon the municipality.they point out government code section provides that costs flowing from a federal mandate may be subject to subvention if such costs exceed such mandate they also cite two cases in support of their position.
in san diego unified school dist.commission on state mandates cal th,d,our supreme court concluded the costs incurred by school districts in holding mandatory expulsion hearings under education code section were state mandates subject to subvention under article xiii b,section.the court explained that expulsion was mandated under the education code,rather than federal law,and thus,the fact the costs were incurred to comport with federal due process,a federal mandate,was not controlling.san diego unified school dist.commission on state mandates,supra,at,d.
in the other case,hayes commission on state mandates,supra,th,d,the appellate court concluded that the finding a mandate was federal turned on whether the state freely chose to impose the costs upon the local agency as a means of implementing a federal program and that under these circumstances,the costs are the result of a reimbursable state mandate regardless whether the costs were imposed upon the state by the federal government.id.at,d.
existence of state mandates matter for the commission 
a review of the pleadings and the matters that may be judicially noticed,leads to the inescapable conclusion that whether the two obligations in question constitute federal or state mandates presents factual issues which must be addressed in the first instance by the commission if section were found to be unconstitutional.resolution of the federal or state nature of these obligations therefore is premature and,thus,not properly before this court.
in its response,the commission argues that if this court determines section is unconstitutional,the subject test claims should be remanded to commission to decide in the first instance whether a local agency is entitled to reimbursement under article xiii b,section.lucia mar unified school district honig,supra,cal d.
the commission stated that on such remand,it would apply the following cases in determining whether state mandates exist city of sacramento state of california,supra,cal d,which sets forth various factors and criteria for determining whether the federal program imposes a mandate on the state hayes commission on state mandates,supra,th,d,which it contends provides guidance on whether the state,in turn,has mandated a federal program on the local governments long beach unified sch.dist.state of california,supra,d,which analyzes whether the activities exceed federal requirements and san diego unified school dist.commission on state mandates,supra,cal th,d,which also provides guidance on this same issue.
executive order under revenue and taxation code not probative 
the commission contends the exclusion of orders of the regional water boards from the definition of executive order in section does not contravene article xiii b,section,because section derives from the definition of executive order in revenue and taxation code section of which the voters were presumed to have known to exist when they adopted proposition,art.xiii b,in,and thus,proposition intended to endorse and continue such exclusion from the definition of executive order which was later carried over to section.we disagree.
we further disagree with the commission reliance on a presumption that when the voters adopted proposition in november,they knew of,and thus,necessarily approved of section exclusion of orders of regional water boards from the definition of executive order.
our focus,instead,must be on the import of article xiii b,section,not on the scheme for subvention of funds to local agencies of which section of the revenue and taxation code was part.as our supreme court instructs in construing the meaning of the constitutional provision,article xiii b,section,our inquiry is not focused on what the legislature intended in adopting the former statutory reimbursement scheme,but rather on what the voters meant when they adopted article xiii b in.to determine this intent,we must look to the language of the provision itself.citation.county of los angeles california,supra,cal d,at.
the subvention requirement of article xiii b,section applies w henever the legislature or any state agency mandates a new program or higher level of service the any state agency language defeats any perceived presumption that the electorate intended to incorporate into article xiii b,section the exclusion of a particular state agency,the regional water board,from its subvention requirement.
section unconstitutional as to regional water boards 
la regional water board argues in its amicus brief that section is constitutional for the additional reason that its exemption from the subvention requirem
