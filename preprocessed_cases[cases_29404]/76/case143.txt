the panel affirmed the district court dismissal for lack of standing and ripeness of a complaint brought by the desert water agency dwa,a political subdivision of the state of california,against the united states department of the interior and its bureau of indian affairs,challenging a federal regulation that dwa believed might preempt certain taxes and fees dwa assessed against who leased lands within an indian reservation.

the panel held that did not purport to change existing law,and therefore,did not itself operate to preempt dwa charges,and did not command dwa to modify its behavior by doing or refraining from doing anything.the panel concluded that dwa lacked standing because it had not suffered a cognizable injury at the hands of the department of the interior.finally,the panel held that it lacked jurisdiction to issue a declaratory judgment that dwa charges would survive a preemption challenge under white mountain apache tribe bracker,because the dispute between dwa and the department of the interior was over.
circuit judge 
we must decide whether a political subdivision of the state of california has standing to challenge a federal regulation it believes might preempt certain taxes and fees it assesses against who have leased lands within an indian reservation.
the desert water agency dwa is a political subdivision of the state of california dwa provides water supplies and water services to businesses and residences in riverside county.dwa charges those parties a variety of fees and taxes in order to recoup its costs and expenses.parties subject to dwa charges include who lease lands from the agua caliente band of cahuilla indians the tribe within the agua caliente indian reservation.the lessees have erected a variety of permanent establishments within the reservation,including homes and businesses such as hotels,restaurants,and stores.dwa imposes its charges on the lessees themselves,and not on the tribe or its members.
the united states department of the interior interior is an executive department charged,among other duties,with managing and administering the lands of indian reservations.the bureau of indian affairs bia is an agency within interior that oversees programs,activities,and operations relating to indian lands and affairs.
one of interior responsibilities is to approve the leasing of indian land to third parties.see,id.a.interior has promulgated a host of regulations governing the administration of such leases,codified at part.beginning in,interior overhauled such regulations through notice and comment rulemaking the new rules became effective january.see residential,business,and wind and solar resource leases on indian land,fed.reg,codified at pt.
among the new regulations is,entitled what taxes apply to leases approved under this part the relevant subsection states that,s ubject only to applicable federal law,the leasehold or possessory interest is not subject to any fee,tax,assessment,levy,or other charge imposed by any state or political subdivision of a state.leasehold or possessory interests may be subject to taxation by the indian tribe with jurisdiction.c.subsection a applies the same language to permanent improvements on the leased land,while subsection b does likewise for activities under a lease conducted on the leased premises.a b.
concerned by the possibility that interior had just attempted to preempt its charges,dwa promptly brought suit in federal district court under the administrative procedure act,naming interior and the bia as defendants.
before describing the substance of dwa complaint,it will be helpful to summarize the law that has long governed indian preemption claims.
for many decades courts have struggled to determine whether and when states may regulate the conduct of engaged in activities on tribal lands.in white mountain apache tribe bracker,the supreme court held that courts must undertake a balancing test in order to decide whether federal law preempts any particular state effort to regulate conduct on tribal lands.bracker explains that t his inquiry is not dependent on mechanical or absolute conceptions of state or tribal sovereignty,but has called for a particularized inquiry into the nature of the state,federal,and tribal interests at stake,an inquiry designed to determine whether,in the specific context,the exercise of state authority would violate federal law.id.at.
dwa complaint advances two different theories,each premised on a different interpretation of.dwa first claim is that reference to applicable federal law incorporates the bracker test and other existing federal statutes,such that does not effect any substantive change in federal indian preemption law.if we agree with such interpretation,dwa asks for a declaratory judgment stating that does not apply to and preclude the application of dwa charges upon lessees of lands within the agua caliente indian reservation,because dwa charges fall within the exception provided in the regulation for taxes and other charges authorized under applicable federal law.in other words,dwa is asking us not only to say that bracker is still the law of the land,but also to declare that,under bracker,all of dwa charges are enforceable and definitively not preempted.
dwa alternative claim is that if does not incorporate bracker and related statutory law in other words,if purports to displace existing law and to preempt dwa charges immediately,of its own force then must be declared invalid on the theory that interior had no authority to issue legislative rules preempting dwa charges.
despite its apprehensions about,dwa complaint does not allege that it has changed its behavior in any way for example,by ceasing to assess charges.nor does its complaint allege that interior or the bia has threatened to take any enforcement action against dwa in response to its decision to continue assessing charges.and the complaint does not allege that any leaseholders have withheld payment or objected to paying dwa charges 
the district court dismissed dwa complaint for lack of standing.the district court emphasized that dwa complaint never alleged that any leaseholder had refused to pay charges never alleged that interior or the bia had threatened or planned any enforcement proceeding against it and never alleged that dwa had done anything to change its behavior in response to.hence,the district court concluded that there is no evidence that dwa had suffered or immediately would suffer injury of any sort due to the regulation.
the district court also held that dwa suit is not prudentially ripe.the district court reasoned that even if the regulation purports to change existing law by operating to preempt state taxes on applicable leases,it is not yet clear whether any of dwa charges would be affected,because the regulation also has a grandfather clause stating that it does not apply to certain leases approved before january.the district court also reasoned that dwa has not shown any hardship,again for the reason that dwa has not alleged that it has changed its behavior or that any lessees have refused to pay.
dwa timely appealed.
we review the district court standing and ripeness determinations de novo.la asociacion de trabajadores de lake forest city of lake forest,cir.the parties on appeal have largely collapsed their discussion of the two concepts into a discussion of standing.we will do the same.
the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing consists of three elements the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact that was caused by the defendant challenged conduct and that would be redressed by the remedy the plaintiff seeks.lujan defs.of wildlife.
in order to determine whether dwa has standing to challenge,we must first decide what exactly purports to do that is,in what way,if any,it purports to change the authority states like california currently enjoy to tax lessees on tribal lands.the parties disagree sharply about how best to understand.but only by first determining what that regulation means can we determine how if at all it injures dwa,and to what extent if any such injury would be redressed by the declaratory judgment dwa seeks 
on appeal,dwa argues that it has standing to bring this lawsuit because,it claims,purports to preempt its laws directly and immediately.that is,dwa believes that the agency meant to displace the bracker balancing test and to command dwa to change its behavior immediately by ceasing to charge leaseholders on tribal lands.dwa briefing is devoted overwhelmingly almost exclusively to the proposition that a state has standing to challenge a federal statute or regulation that preempts its laws.
interior view is the polar opposite.according to interior,dwa fundamentally misunderstands.interior says that,so far as preemption is concerned,has no legal effect at all it does not purport to preempt any specific state taxes including dwa or to alter the and balancing test that has governed indian preemption cases since at least,when the supreme court decided bracker.the only thing does,according to interior,is to state publicly the agency interpretation of existing law namely,bracker,and to clarify its opinion that under bracker,the federal and tribal interests at stake are strong enough to have a preemptive effect in the generality of cases.but on the ultimate question of whether any specific state tax or charge is preempted under bracker,interior is agnostic courts must answer such questions in the same way they always have,by applying the bracker test de novo.interior views as set out in may well influence courts when they gauge the federal and tribal interests under bracker,but interior does not contend that has any independent legal effect.interior has consistently advanced this interpretation of the regulation in its briefs in this case,in an amicus brief filed in an unrelated lawsuit brought by the tribe against riverside county,and at oral argument here.
we read as interior does.the regulation does not purport to change existing law,and therefore it does not operate to preempt dwa charges.we adopt this reading for several reasons.
first,it is consistent with the text of.as interior emphasizes,begins with a caveat s ubject only to applicable federal law,the leasehold or possessory interest is not subject to any fee,tax,assessment,levy,or other charge imposed by any state or political subdivision of a state.c emphasis added.interior construes the italicized language as a sort of savings clause,asserting that the bracker test is subsumed within the phrase applicable federal law.indeed,interior claims that it could have rephrased to state simply that taxes may be assessed if permitted by applicable law on land,improvements,and activities,as one commenter had proposed doing with respect to a related regulation.see on indian land,fed.reg,codified at pt.consistent with that understanding,the preamble to notice of proposed rulemaking says that the regulation simply c larif ies the agency view that improvements on trust or restricted land are not taxable by states or localities.residential,business,and wind and solar resource leases on indian land,fed.reg,to be codified at pt.emphasis added.clarifying the agency understanding of how existing law applies in general is very different from attempting to change existing law.
to be sure,there is other language mostly in the preamble to the final rule that arguably supports dwa interpretation.in particular,the preamble states that t he federal statutes and regulations governing leasing on indian lands occupy and preempt the field of indian leasing.the federal statutory scheme for indian leasing is comprehensive,and accordingly precludes state taxation.fed.reg.at.but that statement comes immediately after the preamble which implies that the bracker regime remains controlling law.id.federal courts apply a balancing test to determine whether state taxation of engaging in activity or owning property on the reservation is preempted.white mountain apache tribe bracker.the bracker balancing test requires a particularized examination of the relevant state,federal,and tribal interests.in the case of leasing on indian lands,the federal and tribal interests are very strong.
even if a purely textual analysis might present a close call,we ultimately conclude that the language tips in favor of interior view.as noted,the language of the regulation itself as distinct from the preamble is perfectly consistent with the agency view that leaves bracker in place while merely setting forth the agency interpretation of how bracker should apply over the generality of cases,without operating to preempt any specific state law.indeed,recall that dwa own complaint asserted that does not change the current legal regime,precisely because bracker is an applicable federal law within the meaning of the federal regulation.that,of course,is exactly interior position.and while dwa is not bound by an argument it made in the alternative,the fact that dwa made it at all attests to its plausibility.
to the extent that the language in the regulation is ambiguous,we defer to interior interpretation.auer robbins.here,as in auer,we have no reason to suspect that the interpretation does not reflect the agency fair and considered judgment on the matter in question,and the regulation more than comfortably bears interior reading,id.at 
furthermore,the reading of the regulation we adopt today is consistent with the interpretation made by the eleventh circuit,as well as with comments we have previously made about the regulation,albeit in dicta.
first,the eleventh circuit recently decided a lawsuit brought by the seminole tribe of florida against florida department of revenue.seminole tribe of stranburg,cir.the tribe alleged that two florida taxes were preempted by federal law,id.at,and they relied on to support their case,id.at.the eleventh circuit agreed with the tribe in part,id.at,but importantly for our purposes,the court effectively construed as interior construes it here the court conducted a de novo bracker analysis,declin ing to accord the regulations deference on the question whether the specific florida taxes were preempted,id.at.like interior does here,the eleventh circuit read to do no more than outline the bracker balancing test and appl y it generally,rather than to express a view on its application to any specific tax or charge.id.at.hence,while the court acknowledged that the regulation might serve as evidence of the federal and tribal interests involved,the court concluded that did not examine florida interests in imposing this particular rental tax,and so it could do no more than inform the bracker balancing inquiry which courts must undertake themselves.id.at.the court therefore conducted a bracker inquiry just as it would have done had never been promulgated.
the eleventh circuit analysis aligns with interior representation that it took no position in this case regarding the validity of any particular charge imposed by dwa,precisely b ecause the issue had not been presented to interior during the administrative process.
similarly,we recently declared that merely clarifies and confirms what existing law already conveys.confederated tribes of chehalis reservation thurston cty.bd.of equalization,cir.quoting watters wachovia bank.
thus,both the eleventh circuit in a thorough analysis and a panel of our court in dicta have construed in a way that is incompatible with dwa assertion that the regulation must be read to preempt its charges directly and immediately.rather,those cases echo the position we reach today that does not displace or modify bracker or otherwise change existing law and therefore it does not of its own force operate to preempt any specific state tax 
once we conclude that does not preempt dwa charges,or otherwise require or forbid dwa to change its behavior in any way,it follows that dwa lacks standing to challenge the regulation.as we noted above,dwa arguments are devoted almost entirely to the
