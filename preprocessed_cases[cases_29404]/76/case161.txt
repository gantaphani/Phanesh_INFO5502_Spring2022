in,oregon resources corporation orc applied for various state permits to mine valuable mineral sands from an area near coos bay,oregon.orc also applied for a permit from the army corps of engineers corps under section of the clean water act cwa,because the project required filling in several acres of wetland.the corps was required to comply with the requirements of the national environmental policy act nepa,et,as part of the permitting process.the corps therefore prepared an environmental assessment ea,and issued a finding of no significant impact fonsi in lieu of preparing a full environmental impact statement eis,before ultimately issuing the requested section permit orc section permit.
the bandon woodlands community association and other plaintiffs collectively woodlands challenge several aspects of the ea and fonsi.specifically,woodlands claim that the ea was deficient because it did not adequately examine the risks associated with the potential generation of toxic hexavalent chromium cr as a result of the proposed mining the fonsi was arbitrary and capricious because of significant uncertainty surrounding the likelihood and impact of cr generation and the grant of the orc section permit was arbitrary and capricious because the corps did not conduct an adequate alternatives analysis.we find woodlands arguments without merit and affirm the district court grant of summary judgement to the corps.
factual background and prior proceedings 
orc mining project 
orc project involves mining chromite,garnet,and zircon sands from four sites near coos bay,oregon.the chromite and zircon sands are marketed to foundries for use in casting metal parts,while the garnet sands are sold for use in the water jet cutting industry.the orc section permit covers four sites,called the south seven devils,north seven devils,west bohemia,and west section sites.these sites cover approximately acres and are located on timberlands 
orc uses standard excavation equipment to remove topsoil covering the mineral sands.topsoil is then stockpiled along the margins of the mining area,while mineral sands are loaded into trucks and transported to orc refining plant in coos bay.the refining plant uses a gravimetric process to separate out the marketable sand,which makes up roughly percent of the sand transported from the mining sites.the remaining percent of the sand is returned to the mine site.
as part of orc reclamation plan,each area is backfilled with the sands returned from the processing plant,in addition to other material removed in the mining process.each excavated area is then graded and replanted with trees.the reclamation process also involves the creation of new wetland areas pursuant to a mitigation plan.mining has already been in process for several years,and the project will be completed in roughly three to six years.
b.the permitting process 
orc submitted a section permit application to the corps on may.the corps decision to grant a section permit is subject to the requirements of both the nepa and the endangered species act esa,et,the latter of which requires the corps to consult with the national marine fisheries service nmfs.additionally,orc was required to obtain approvals from a number of state agencies,including the oregon department of geology and minerals industry dogami,the oregon department of state lands,and the oregon department of environmental quality deq.deq has jurisdiction over state water quality standards pursuant to section of the cwa.the state and federal agencies coordinated the permitting process in this case and provided technical support to one another.
shortly after orc filed its permit application,the corps contacted nmfs to begin informal consultation under the cwa.over the next two years,the corps and nmfs gathered information about the project and its potential impacts.the corps and nmfs conducted site visits,held public and private meetings,evaluated information provided by stakeholders,including woodlands,and coordinated with state agencies.
eventually,the corps issued an ea discussing the potential environmental impacts of orc mining project.the ea concluded that the project would not have a significant effect on the human environment,and,accordingly,the corps issued a fonsi.because it issued a fonsi,the corps did not prepare an eis.the nmfs issued a letter of concurrence with the ea,and orc received all necessary state permits,including a section water quality certification from the deq.
hexavalent chromium generation 
in its nepa analysis,the corps considered the potential for increased cr generation from the proposed mining.woodlands public comments on the permit application noted that the chromite sands orc planned to mine contained benign trivalent chromium cr,which can oxidize into toxic cr in the presence of manganese oxide,which is also present at the sites.woodlands was concerned that orc mining project could lead to increased cr generation,which could,in turn,contaminate ground and surface water.woodlands submitted expert reports that recommended,among other things,ongoing monitoring during the mining process to ensure that the amount of cr did not increase.
orc responded to woodlands comments and expert reports in a biological assessment ba.the ba suggested that the risk of cr generation was minimal,because 
the geology of the mining area did not indicate that chromite sands would react with manganese oxide to form cr.groundwater sampling demonstrated that the existing levels of cr in groundwater at the mining sites was significantly below safe drinking limits.
eh and ph levels at the sites were not conducive to the oxidization of either chromium or manganese,which is necessary for the formation of cr.
the mining sites contained naturally occurring substances that would facilitate conversion of cr back into cr cr attenuation.
mining would remove the chromite sands necessary to form cr and would facilitate reactions with other substances likely to result in cr attenuation.
orc planned monitoring regime could detect any increased concentration of cr,allowing orc and the deq to respond.
in addition,the corps and nmfs requested independent technical support from william mason,a registered geologist with the deq.mason examined the information provided by orc and woodlands,along with academic literature regarding cr generation,and summarized his findings in a memorandum mason memorandum.the mason memorandum noted that the conditions at the mining sites favored cr attenuation rather than generation.the mason memorandum also noted that conditions at orc proposed mining sites were similar to those present in some academic studies that found significant cr attenuation,but that the findings of such studies are not necessarily applicable to sites not considered by those studies due to the complex nature of subsurface geochemical reactions.the mason memorandum concluded that it is possible that cr could be generated in a environment,but it appears unlikely given the aquifer apparent potential for cr attenuation.finally,the mason memorandum offered a number of recommendations related to ongoing monitoring after mining commenced.
as a result of these recommendations,dogami notified the corps that it would require ongoing cr monitoring as part of orc permit from that agency,and explained that it would require suspension of mining other measures if the monitoring showed an increase in cr levels.the orc section permit issued by the corps required orc to comply with all conditions of the deq and dogami permits.based on this information from the deq and dogami,the corps concluded that the risks associated with the generation of cr would not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment.
cumulative impact analysis 
in addition to examining the potential for cr generation,the corps considered the possibility that orc would engage in future mining beyond the sites included in the section permit application,noting that orc had suggested that it intended to mine for mineral sands along the oregon coast from cape arago to port orford.the ea also noted that orc had removed from the section permit application two sites that had already been surveyed,one of which,section,had already been granted a mining permit by dogami.
the record also reflects,however,significant challenges to developing any of the mining sites that had been identified by orc.specifically 
the section site would require the construction of a costly access road across private property that itself would have involved potentially insurmountable permitting and leasing challenges.
the shepard site also would have required construction of an additional haul road or the reversal of a prior coos county land use decision barring the use of an existing road.
the westbrook site was not owned by orc and was encumbered by a mineral reservation in favor of another company.
accordingly,the corps declined to examine the cumulative impact of mineral sands mining along the oregon coast,noting that it would consider the impacts of future projects if permits were sought for them.
analysis of practicable alternatives 
the corps also considered whether there were practical alternatives to the orc proposed sites that would have less impact on the aquatic environment.orc initially provided an alternatives analysis as part of its permit application.the corps requested additional information regarding the alternative sites or project designs that orc provided.orc also provided information on its overall project purpose and the absence of alternative sites outside oregon.after a meeting with the corps,orc submitted an additional detailed analysis regarding the unique nature of the chromite sands at the proposed mining sites,as well as the reasons orc had included those sites in its proposal.the corps pressed orc regarding its decision not to use the shepard,section,or westbrook sites,and orc responded with a number of reasons for the decision,including the existence of significant logistical hurdles at each of those sites.
ultimately,the corps considered a no build alternative do not mine,a subsurface alternative that would conduct mining beneath the wetlands,only mine areas that do not contain wetlands mine uplands and to mine all proposed areas and provide compensatory mitigation for wetland impacts.additionally,the corps considered smaller project designs,consisting of some combination of sites other than the north seven devils location.the corps rejected these smaller designs because a project of a smaller scale than the four proposed mine sites,although it may be practicable,will not provide the required quantity of chromite necessary to achieve the overall purpose.the corps also considered and rejected larger project designs,different project designs,other sites available to the applicant,and other sites not available to the applicant.
prior proceedings 
woodlands filed this action in the western district of washington on october.the case was transferred to the district of oregon on december.woodlands sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction,both of which the district court denied.woodlands then unsuccessfully sought an emergency injunction pending its appeal of the district court denial of the preliminary injunction.after our rejection of the emergency injunction,woodlands withdrew its appeal of the preliminary injunction and the parties filed joint motions for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment to the corps,finding that it had complied with all of its statutory obligations.woodlands timely appealed.

discussion 
regulatory framework 
woodlands challenges the corps decision to issue the orc section permit under two environmental statutes,the cwa and nepa.
clean water act 
the cwa prohibits unauthorized discharge of any pollutant into waters of the united states.section of the cwa authorizes the corps to issue permits for discharge of dredged or fill material into navigable waters.a.the section b guidelines,developed by the epa,govern the section permit process in conjunction with regulations issued by the corps.et the guidelines et corps regulations.
generally,the corps is prohibited from permitting discharges under section where there is a practicable alternative to the proposed discharge which would have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem,so long as the alternative does not have other significant adverse environmental consequences.a.practicable alternatives must be available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost,existing technology,and logistics in light of overall project purpose.a.
the cwa provides for a shared enforcement regime between federal and state agencies.pud of jefferson cnty.dep t of ecology,t he clean water act establishes distinct roles for the federal and state governments.states with approved programs take over responsibility for enforcing water quality standards within their borders.a.in addition to these primary enforcement responsibilities,of the act requires states to provide a water quality certification before a federal license or permit can be issued for activities that may result in any discharge into intrastate navigable waters.pud,at citing.a state certification of compliance under section is conclusive with respect to water quality considerations,unless the epa advises otherwise.bering strait citizens for responsible res.develop.army corps of eng rs,cir.oregon has had an approved state program since.july,boise cascade epa,cir.
national environmental policy act 
nepa provides the necessary process to ensure that federal agencies take a hard look at the environmental consequences of their actions.neighbors of cuddy mountain alexander,cir citations omitted.nepa requires that agencies prepare an eis for any proposed agency action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.the council on environmental quality ceq has promulgated regulations to guide federal agencies in determining what actions are subject to that statutory requirement.see.the ceq regulations allow an agency to prepare a more limited document,an environmental assessment,or ea.the ea is a concise public document that b riefly provide s sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an eis.a.if an ea determines that agency actions will not have a significant effect on the human environment,the agency must issue a fonsi.see e.where the effects on the human environment are highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown risks,however,the agency must prepare an eis.b.
if the corps failed to comply with nepa,woodlands may be entitled to an injunction blocking any future mining pending satisfactory nepa review,even though the project is underway.see west sec y of dep t of,cir a lthough stage of the interchange project is complete,and the new interchange is carrying traffic,upon finding that defendants failed to comply with nepa,our remedial powers would include remanding for additional environmental review and,conceivably,ordering the interchange closed or taken down.blue mountains biodiversity project blackwood,cir the injunction issued by this court on november,enjoining future logging,road building,or other ground disturbing activities in the permit area shall remain in full force and effect until the forest service satisfies its nepa obligations.
