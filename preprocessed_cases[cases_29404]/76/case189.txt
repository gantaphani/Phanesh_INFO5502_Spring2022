northwest environmental defense center nedc brings suit against the oregon state forester and members of the oregon board of forestry in their official capacities collectively,state defendants and against various timber companies timber defendants,and collectively with state defendants,defendants.nedc contends that defendants have violated the clean water act cwa and its implementing regulations by not obtaining permits from the environmental protection agency epa for that flows from logging roads into systems of ditches,culverts,and channels and is then discharged into forest streams and rivers.nedc contends that these discharges are from point sources within the meaning of the cwa and that they therefore require permits under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes.
the district court concluded that the discharges are exempted from the npdes permitting process by the silvicultural rule,promulgated under the cwa to regulate discharges associated with silvicultural activity.the district court did not reach the question whether the discharges are exempted by amendments to the cwa made in.we reach both questions and conclude that the discharges require npdes permits.
background 
nedc contends that discharges from systems of ditches,culverts,and channels that receive stormwater runoff from two logging roads in the tillamook state forest in oregon are point source discharges under the cwa.the roads are the trask river road,which runs parallel to the south fork trask river,and the sam downs road,which runs parallel to the little south fork of the kilchis river.the roads are owned by the oregon department of forestry and the oregon board of forestry.they are primarily used by the timber defendants to gain access to logging sites and to haul timber out of the forest.the timber defendants use the roads pursuant to timber sales contracts with the state of oregon.these contracts designate specific routes for timber hauling and require that the timber defendants maintain the roads and their associated stormwater collection systems.
both of the logging roads were designed and constructed with systems of ditches,culverts,and channels that collect and convey stormwater runoff.for most of their length,the roads are graded so that water runs off the road into ditches on the uphill side of the roads.there are several ways these ditches then deliver water into the adjacent rivers.at intervals,the ditches empty into culverts that cross under the roads.where the roads are close to the rivers,these culverts deliver the collected stormwater into the rivers.where the roads are at some distance from the rivers,the roadside ditches connect to culverts under the roads that deliver the collected stormwater into channels,and these channels then discharge the stormwater into the rivers.when tributary streams cross under the roads,the roadside ditches deliver the collected stormwater into these streams.these streams then carry the collected stormwater to the rivers.
the stormwater runoff that flows off the roads and through these collection systems deposits large amounts of sediment into streams and rivers.this sediment adversely affects particular,salmon and smothering eggs,reducing oxygen levels,interfering with feeding,and burying insects that provide food.
timber hauling on the logging roads is a major source of the sediment that flows through the stormwater collection systems.logging trucks passing over the roads grind up the gravel and dirt on the surface of the road.small rocks,sand,and dirt are then washed into the collection system and discharged directly into the streams and rivers.nedc alleged in its complaint that it sampled stormwater discharges at six points along the trask river road and five points along the sam downs road where the defendants use ditches,culverts,and channels to collect and then discharge stormwater runoff.each sample contained significant amounts of sediment.
none of the defendants has sought or received npdes permits for these discharges into the streams and rivers.nedc brought suit under the citizen suit provision of the cwa,a,which provides that any citizen may commence a civil action on his own behalf against any person alleged to be in violation of the cwa.nedc claims that defendants have violated the cwa by not obtaining npdes permits.on march,the district court dismissed nedc complaint with prejudice under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim.nedc has timely appealed.

iii.discussion 
nedc contends that stormwater runoff from logging roads that is collected in a system of ditches,culverts,and channels,and is then delivered into streams and rivers,is a point source discharge subject to npdes permitting under the cwa.defendants,however,contend that the silvicultural rule exempts such runoff from the definition of point source discharge,and thus exempts it from the npdes permitting process.alternatively,defendants contend that the amendments to the cwa and regulations implementing those amendments exempt such runoff from the definition of point source discharge and from the permitting process.we discuss,in turn,the definition of point source discharge,the silvicultural rule,and the amendments to the cwa.
definition of point source discharge 
in,in the federal water pollution control act fwpca,congress substantially revised federal law governing clean water,stat.in,the statute was renamed the clean water act cwa,stat.congress enacted the fwpca to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters by replacing water quality standards with point source effluent limitations.a or.natural desert ass dombeck,cir.section a of the act provides that,subject to certain exceptions,the discharge of any pollutant by any person shall be unlawful.a.one of these exceptions is a point source discharge authorized by a permit granted pursuant to the npdes system under of the act.the combined effect of a and is that t he cwa prohibits the discharge of any pollutant from a point source into navigable waters of the united states without an npdes permit.plains res.council fid.exploration dev,cir see also nw.envtl.advocates epa,cir.pollutants include rock and sand.defendants do not contest that sediment discharges from logging roads constitute pollutants within the meaning of the cwa.
it is well settled that the starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself.gwaltney of smithfield,chesapeake bay.section of the act defines point source as 
any discernible,confined and discrete conveyance,including but not limited to any pipe,ditch,channel,tunnel,conduit,well,discrete fissure,container,rolling stock,concentrated animal feeding operation,or vessel or other floating craft,from which pollutants are or may be discharged.this term does not include agricultural stormwater discharges and return flows from irrigated agriculture.
emphasis added.the term nonpoint source is left undefined.
stormwater that is not collected or channeled and then discharged,but rather runs off and dissipates in a natural and unimpeded manner,is not a discharge from a point source as defined by.as we wrote in league of wilderness mountains biodiversity project forsgren,cir 
although nonpoint source pollution is not statutorily defined,it is widely understood to be the type of pollution that arises from many dispersed activities over large areas,and is not traceable to any single discrete source.because it arises in such a diffuse way,it is very difficult to regulate through individual permits.the most common example of nonpoint source pollution is the residue left on roadways by automobiles.small amounts of rubber are worn off of the tires of millions of cars and deposited as a thin film on highways minute particles of copper dust from brake linings are spread across roads and parking lots each time a driver applies the brakes drips and drabs of oil and gas ubiquitously stain driveways and streets.when it rains,the rubber particles and copper dust and gas and oil wash off of the streets and are carried along by runoff in a polluted soup,winding up in creeks,rivers,bays,and the ocean.
however,when stormwater runoff is collected in a system of ditches,culverts,and channels and is then discharged into a stream or river,there is a discernable,confined and discrete conveyance of pollutants,and there is therefore a discharge from a point source.in other words,runoff is not inherently a nonpoint or point source of pollution.rather,it is a nonpoint or point source under depending on whether it is allowed to run off naturally and is thus a nonpoint source or is collected,channeled,and discharged through a system of ditches,culverts,channels,and similar conveyances and is thus a point source discharge.
our caselaw has consistently recognized the distinction between nonpoint and point source runoff.in natural resources defense council california department of transportation,cir,we were asked to enforce an npdes permit requiring a state agency using storm drains to control polluted stormwater runoff from roadways and maintenance yards.in natural resources defense council epa nrdc epa,cir,we wrote,this case involves runoff from diffuse sources that eventually passes through storm sewer systems and is thus subject to the npdes permit program.in trustees for alaska epa,cir,we explicitly agreed with a decision of the tenth circuit,united states earth sciences,cir.we wrote 
the tenth circuit observed that congress had classified nonpoint source pollution as runoff caused primarily by rainfall around activities that employ or create pollutants.such runoff could not be traced to any identifiable point of discharge.the court concluded that point and nonpoint sources are not distinguished by the kind of pollution they create or by the activity causing the pollution,but rather by whether the pollution reaches the water through a confined,discrete conveyance.thus,when mining activities release pollutants from a discernible conveyance,they are subject to npdes regulation,as are all point sources.
at emphasis added internal citation omitted.finally,in environmental defense center epa,cir,we wrote storm sewers are established point sources subject to npdes permitting requirements diffuse runoff,such as rainwater that is not channeled through a point source,is considered nonpoint source pollution and is not subject to federal regulation.id.at,emphasis added internal citations omitted.
the clarity of the text of,as well as our caselaw,would ordinarily make recourse to legislative history unnecessary.the unambiguously expressed intent of congress controls.chevron,at.however,because epa relied on the legislative history of the fwpca in promulgating the silvicultural rule at issue in this case,we recount some of that history as background to our analysis of the rule.
the fwpca established distinctly different methods to control pollution released from point sources and that traceable to nonpoint sources.pronsolino nastri,cir.the senate committee elected to impose stringent permitting requirements only on point sources because t here is no effective way as yet,other than land use control,by which you can intercept nonpoint runoff and control it in the way that you do a point source.we have not yet developed technology to deal with that kind of a problem.cong.rec,statement of muskie.
the house and senate committees made clear that the term point source was not to be interpreted narrowly.by the use of the term discharge of pollutants this provision covers any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source,at.the senate committee report instructed that 
the epa administrator should not ignore discharges resulting from point sources other than pipelines or similar conduits there are many other forms of periodic,though frequent,discharges of pollutants into the water through point sources such as barges,vessels,feedlots,trucks and other conveyances.
at.senator dole explained his understanding of the distinction as it related to the problem of agricultural pollution 
most of the problems of agricultural pollution deal with sources.very simply,a source of pollution is one that does not confine its pollution discharge to one fairly specific outlet,such as a sewer pipe,a drainage ditch or a conduit thus,a would be considered to be a source as would pesticides and fertilizers.
at supplemental views of dole.
congress did not provide the epa administrator with discretion to define the statutory terms.senator randolph,the chairman of the senate committee,explained,we have written into law precise standards and definite guidelines on how the environment should be protected.we have done more than just provide broad directives for administrators to follow.cong.rec.senator muskie,another major proponent of the legislation,clarified that epa would provide g uidance with respect to the identification of point sources and nonpoint sources.cong.rec.however,i f a drainage,ditch,flushing system or other such device is involved and if measurable waste results and is discharged into water,it is considered a point source.id.
congress also sought to require permits for any activity that met the legal definition of point source,regardless of feasibility concerns.for example,congressman roncalio of wyoming proposed an amendment to exempt irrigated agriculture from the npdes permit program because it was virtually impossible to trace pollutants to specific irrigation lands,making these pollutants a nonpoint source in most cases.cong.rec.opponents objected that the amendment would exclude large point source polluters simply because the channeled water originally derived from irrigated agriculture.congressman waldie explained 
in california there is a vast irrigation basin that collects all the waste resident of irrigation water in the central valley and places it in a san luis transport s it several hundreds of miles and then dumps it into the san joaquin river which flows into the estuary and then into san francisco bay.it is highly polluted water that is being dumped in waters already jeopardized by pollution.
will the gentleman amendment establish that as a nonpoint source pollution or will it come under the point source solution discharge 
id.congressman roncalio responded that his amendment would not require permitting for this type of is,that it would redefine these agricultural point sources as nonpoint source pollution.his amendment was then rejected on the house floor.see id.
congress eventually adopted a statutory exemption for agricultural irrigation in,five years after the passage of the fwcpa.see cwa l,l the administrator shall not require a permit under this section for discharges composed entirely of return flows from irrigated agriculture,nor shall the administrator directly or indirectly,require any state to require such a permit.cwa,this term does not include return flows from irrigated agriculture.congress did so to alleviate epa burden in having to issue permits for every agricultural point source.the problems of permitting every discrete source or conduit returning water to the streams from irrigated lands is simply too burdensome to place on the resources of epa.cong.rec,statement of roberts.congress did not,however,grant epa the discretion to exempt agricultural discharges from the general statutory definition of point source discharges.rather,congress exempted such discharges by amending the statute.congress has never granted a similar statutory exemption for silvicultural discharges from the general definition of point source discharges.
despite the foregoing,defendants contend that stormwater runoff from logging roads that is collected in a system of ditches,culverts,and channels,and is then discharged into streams and rivers,is a nonpoint source discharge.defendants contend that the silvicultural rule exempts such discharges from the definition of point source discharge contained in,and therefore from the npdes permitting system.alternatively,defendants contend that the amendments to the cwa exempted such discharges from the permitting system.we discuss defendants two contentions in turn.
b.the silvicultural rule 
adoption of the rule 
in,one year after the passage of the fwpca,epa promulgated regulations categorically exempting several kinds of discharges from the npdes permit program.exempted discharges included discharges from storm sewers composed entirely of storm runoff uncontaminated by industrial or commercial activity,discharges from relatively small animal confinement facilities,discharges from silvicultural activities,and irrigation return flow from point sources where the flow was from less than acres.the exemption for discharges from silvicultural activities provided 
the following do not require an npdes permit 
j discharges of pollutants from agricultural and silvicultural activities,including irrigation return flow and runoff from orchards,cultivated crops,pastures,rangelands,and forest lands,except that this exclusion shall not apply to the following 
discharges from any agricultural or silvicultural activity which have been identified by the regional administrator of the director of the state water pollution control agency or interstate agency as a significant contributor of pollution.
the natural resources defense council challenged the regulations as inconsistent with the statute.see natural res.def.council train.
epa defended the challenged regulations on the ground that the exempted categories of sources are ones which fall within the definition of point source but which are for inclusion in a permit program.id.at.the district court wrote that epa has authority to clarify by regulation the definition of nonpoint and point source discharges,but only so long as its regulations comply with the statutory text.id.at.in the court view,the challenged regulations categorically exempted entire classes of point sources from the npdes permit requirements.id.at.the court therefore held that the regulations were fatally inconsistent with the definition contained in,writing that the administrator of the epa can not lawfully exempt point sources discharging pollutants from regulation under npdes.id.at.
epa appealed to the circuit.while the appeal was pending,epa grudgingly promulgated revised regulations.for example,in soliciting public comment on a proposal for a system for separate agricultural and silvicultural storm sewers rule in december,epa wrote 
in promulgating the earlier regulations epa stated its belief that while some point sources within the excluded categories may be significant contributors of pollution which should be regulated consistent with the purposes of the fwpca,it would be administratively difficult if not impossible,given federal and state resource levels,to issue individual permits to all such point sources essentially,these earlier regulations providing for exemptions were based on epa view a view which it continues to maintain is correct that most sources within the exempted categories present problems not susceptible to the conventional npdes permit program including effluent limitations.epa position was and continues to be that most rainfall runoff is more properly regulated under the section of the fwpca which does not require npdes permits,whether or not the rainfall happens to collect before flowing into navigable waters.agricultural and silvicultural runoff,as well as runoff from city streets,frequently flows into ditches or is collected in pipes before discharging into streams.epa contends that most of these sources are nonpoint in nature and should not be covered by the npdes permit program.
emphasis added.two months later,in february,epa proposed a revised silvicultural rule and solicited public comment.epa wrote,
t he agency has carefully examined the relationship between the npdes permit program which is designed to control and eliminate discharges of pollutants from discrete point sources and water pollution from silvicultural activities which tends to result from precipitation events.it has been determined that most water pollution related to silvicultural activities is nonpoint in nature.
epa continued 
those silvicultural activities which are specified in the regulations rock crushing,gravel washing,log sorting and log storage facilities,and are thus point sources,are subject to the npdes permit program.only those silvicultural activities that,as a result of controlled water used by a person,discharge pollutants through a discernible,confined and discrete conveyance into navigable waters are required to obtain a pollution discharge permit.
id.this passage provides epa central criterion for distinguishing between silvicultural point and nonpoint sources.epa proposed to characterize discharges of pollutants through a discernible,confined and discrete conveyance as point source discharges only when they were a result of controlled water used by a person.under this criterion,the proposed rule named as point source discharges only those related to rock crushing,gravel washing,log sorting,and log storage facilities.id.proposed rule,final rule.any other silvicultural discharge of pollutants,even if made through a discernible,confined and discrete conveyance,was considered a nonpoint source of pollutants.in effect,this meant that any natural runoff containing pollutants was not a point source,even if the runoff was channeled and controlled through a discernible,confined and discrete conveyance and then discharged into navigable waters.
in its response to comments accompanying the final version,epa provided more general criteria by which to distinguish nonpoint from point sources of pollution.it wrote 
basically,nonpoint sources of water pollution are identified by three characteristics 
i the pollutants discharged are induced by natural processes,including precipitation,seepage,percollation sic,and runoff 
ii the pollutants discharged are not traceable to any discrete or identifiable facility and 
iii the pollutants discharged are better controlled through the utilization of best management practices,including process and planning techniques.
in contrast to these criteria identifying nonpoint sources,point sources of water pollution are generally characterized by discrete and confined conveyances from which discharges of pollutants into navigable waters can be controlled by effluent limitations.it is these point sources in the silviculture category which are most amenable to control through the npdes permit program.
epa specifically noted that the single criterion for point from controlled water used by a person was underinclusive.epa pointed out that some point source discharges take place regardless of any prior contact with water,such as discharges of wood chips and bark directly into navigable water.id.
however,the actual text of the final version of the silvicultural rule was little changed from the version proposed in february.see.the revised rule provided in pertinent part 
silvicultural activities.
a definitions.for the purpose of this section 
the term silvicultural point source means any discernible,confined and discrete conveyance related to rock crushing,gravel washing,log sorting,or log storage facilities which are operated in connection with silvicultural activities and from which pollutants are discharged into navigable waters of the united states.
comment this term does not include nonpoint source activities inherent to silviculture such as nursery operations,site preparation,reforestation and subsequent cultural treatment,thinning,prescribed burning,pest and fire control,harvesting operations,surface drainage,and road construction and maintenance from which runoff results from precipitation events.
even though there was no longer a single criterion for identifying point source discharges,the same four activities were specified as producing point source crushing,gravel washing,log sorting and log storage.id.and even though there were now three general criteria for identifying nonpoint sources,the effect of the rule was to treat all natural runoff as nonpoint pollution,even if channeled and discharged through a discernible,confined and discrete conveyance.
in comments accompanying the proposed silvicultural rule in february,epa provided,in concise form,its justification for the rule.it wrote 
technically,a point source is defined as a discernible,confined and discrete conveyance,including but not limited to any pipe,ditch or channel of the fwpca and includes all such conveyances.however,a proper interpretation of the fwpca as explained in the legislative history and supported by the district court in nrdc train is that not every ditch,water bar or culvert is means sic to be a point source under the act fwcpa.it is evident,therefore,that ditches,pipes and drains that serve only to channel,direct,and convey nonpoint runoff from precipitation are not meant to be subject to the permit program.
a analysis shows the weakness of epa justification.
in the first sentence,epa wrote that t echnically,a point source is defined as a confined and discrete conveyance,including but not limited to any pipe,ditch,or channel.the words quoted by epa in this sentence were a direct though partial quotation of the statutory definition of point source contained in of the fwpca.epa choice of the word technically is somewhat odd and even misleading perhaps epa hoped that the word would diminish the force of the statutory definition.but whatever its motive,epa would have been more accurate if it had written textually instead of technically.
in the second sentence,epa wrote that a proper interpretation of the fwcpa as explained in the legislative history and supported by the court in nrdc train is that not every ditch,water bar or culvert is mean t to be a point source under the act fwcpa.epa was putting words into the district court mouth.the district court did not hold that not every ditch,water bar or culvert is meant to be a point source.rather,the court wrote only that the plaintiff in the case,nrdc,had not made that argument.see train.at nrdc does not contend that every farm ditch,water bar,or culvert on a logging road is properly meant to be a point source under the act.further,and more important,everyone understands that a ditch,water bar or culvert that does not discharge into navigable waters is not a point source.but the regulation does not exempt only such ditches,water bars or culverts.instead,it categorically exempts collected runoff from silviculture,whether or not there is a discharge into navigable waters.
finally,in the last sentence epa wrote,it is evident,therefore,that ditches,pipes and drains that serve only to channel,direct,and convey nonpoint runoff from precipitation are not meant to be subject to the permit program.the text of,quoted in the first sentence of the paragraph,is flatly inconsistent with this statement.under,a pollutant comes from a point source if it is collected and discharged through ditches,pipes,channels,and similar conveyances.section says nothing,either explicitly or implicitly,about the source of the water contained in the discharge.further,even though not every ditch,water bar,or culvert is a point source within the meaning of the statute,it hardly follows that a system of ditches,pipes and channels that collects controlled water used by a person and discharges it into a river is a point source,while an identical system that collects and discharges natural precipitation is not.
after epa promulgated the revised silvicultural rule,the court of appeals for the circuit affirmed the district court disapproval of the regulations,including the original silvicultural rule.natural res.def.council costle.the court did not review the revised silvicultural rule promulgated in.the court held that epa did not have the authority categorically to exempt point source discharges.it wrote 
under the epa interpretation the administrator would have broad discretion to exempt large classes of point sources from any or all requirements of the fwcpa.this is a result that the legislators did not intend.rather they stressed that the fwcpa was a tough law that relied on explicit mandates to a degree uncommon in legislation of this type.
the court responded to epa argument that a literal interpretation of the fwcpa definition of point source would place unmanageable burdens on the epa 
there are innumerable references in the legislative history to the effect that the act is founded on the basic premise that a discharge of pollutants without a permit is unlawful and that discharges not in compliance with the limitations and conditions for a permit are unlawful.even when infeasibility arguments were squarely raised,the legislature declined to abandon the permit requirement.
id.at emphasis added.the court concluded 
the wording of the statute,legislative history,and precedents are clear the epa administrator does not have authority to exempt categories of point sources from the permit requirements of.courts may not manufacture for an agency a revisory power inconsistent with the clear intent of the relevant statute.
although the circuit did not address the revised silvicultural rule in its opinion,its reasoning is no less applicable to the new version of the rule.the court concluded that epa does not have the authority to exempt categories of point sources from the permitting requirements of.this is so even if epa contends that the literal terms of the statute would place unmanageable burdens on the agency.the fwcpa was a tough law that epa was not at liberty to ignore.
the revised silvicultural rule 
the current text of the revised version of the silvicultural rule is different in only minor respects from the version promulgated in.in pertinent part,the current version provides 
b definitions.silvicultural point source means any discernible,confined and discrete conveyance related to rock crushing,gravel washing,log sorting,or log storage facilities which are operated in connection with silvicultural activities and from which pollutants are discharged into waters of the united states.the term does not include nonpoint source silvicultural activities such as nursery operations,site preparation,reforestation and subsequent cultural treatment,thinning,prescribed burning,pest and fire control,harvesting operations,surface drainage,or road construction and maintenance from which there is natural runoff.
the text of the cwa distinguishes between point and nonpoint sources depending on whether the pollutant is channeled and controlled through a discernible,confined and discrete conveyance.cwa.the silvicultural rule,by contrast,categorically distinguishes between the two types of discharges depending on the source of the pollutant.under the rule,silvicultural point source discharges are those discharged through discernible,confined and discrete conveyance s,but only when they are direct discharges of wood chips,bark,and the like,or discharges resulting from controlled water used by a person.see.all other discharges of natural runoff are nonpoint sources of pollution,even if such discharges are channeled and controlled through a discernible,confined and discrete conveyance.
a nonexhaustive list of silvicultural point source discharges under the rule includes discharges related to rock crushing,gravel washing,log sorting,and log storage facilities.a nonexhaustive list of silvicultural nonpoint sources of pollution under the rule includes silvicultural activities such as nursery operations,site preparation,reforestation and subsequent cultural treatment,thinning,prescribed burning,pest and fire control,harvesting operations,surface drainage,or road construction and maintenance.
the original silvicultural rule,which was struck down by the district court in train and on appeal in costle,categorically exempted all discharges from silvicultural activities.the current rule categorically exempts all discharges from silvicultural activities resulting from natural runoff.the categorical exemption in the current rule is somewhat smaller than the exemption in the original rule,but it is a categorical exemption nonetheless.indeed,in a later rulemaking proposal epa specifically characterized it as a categorical exemption.see,currently,runoff from the list of source silvicultural activities is categorically excluded from the npdes program.the question before us is whether the categorical exemption from the npdes permit program in the current rule is based on a permissible interpretation of.
we have dealt with the silvicultural rule once before.in league of wilderness mountain diversity project forsgren forsgren,cir,several environmental groups sued to enjoin unpermitted aerial spraying of insecticide to combat the douglas fir tussock moth.some of the insecticide was sprayed onto the surface of streams.plaintiffs contended that the aerial spraying was a discharge from a point source requiring an npdes permit.relying on the silvicultural rule and on two letters and a guidance document from epa,the forest service took the position that the spraying was not a point source discharge,and that a permit was therefore not required.we disagreed with epa and the forest service.
the core of the epa and forest service argument was that pest control was one of the activities listed in the silvicultural rule as not constituting a point source discharge.we wrote 
the forest service argument fails because the statute itself is clear and unambiguous.the statutory definition of point source,any discernible,confined and discrete conveyance,including but not limited to any vessel,clearly encompasses an aircraft equipped with tanks spraying pesticide from mechanical sprayers directly over covered waters.the forest service can not contravene the will of congress through its reading of administrative regulations.
forsgren,at.
we pointed out that the rule characterized a pest control discharge as nonpoint only when it was silvicultural pest control from which there is natural runoff.id.at emphasis in original.if pest control activity resulted in natural runoff,that runoff was not a point source discharge under.but it was undisputed in forsgren that aerial spraying of pesticide into streams was not natural runoff.we had no occasion to rule on,and did not discuss,whether silvicultural activities from which there is natural runoff that is channeled,controlled,and discharged through a discernible,confined and discrete conveyance is a point source under.
we emphatically reject ed the forest service argument that the epa has the authority to refine the definitions of point source and nonpoint source pollution in a way that contravenes the clear intent of congress as expressed in the statute.id.at.we wrote 
we agree with the circuit that the epa has some power to define point source and nonpoint source pollution where there is room for reasonable interpretation of the statutory definition.however,the epa may not exempt from npdes permit requirements that which clearly meets the statutory definition of a point source by defining it as a nonpoint source.allowing the epa to contravene the intent of congress,by simply substituting the word define for the word exempt,would turn costle on its head.
id.we now reach the question not reached or discussed in discharge of natural runoff becomes a point source discharge when it is channeled and controlled through a discernible,confined and discrete conveyance in a system of ditches,culverts,and channels.we conclude that it does.
in our view,the answer to the question before us is as clear as the answer to the questions presented in costle and in forsgren.the cwa prohibits the discharge of any pollutant by any person without an npdes permit.a.the term discharge of a pollutant means any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.a emphasis added.a point source is 
any discernible,confined and discrete conveyance,including but not limited to any pipe,ditch,channel,tunnel,conduit,well,discrete fissure,container,rolling stock,concentrated animal feeding operation,or vessel or other floating craft,from which pollutants are or may be discharged.
the definition in no way depends on the manner in which the pollutant arrives at the discernible,confined and discrete conveyance.that is,it makes no difference whether the pollutant arrives as the result of controlled water used by a person or through natural runoff.
we agree with the analysis of the district court in environmental protection information center pacific lumber epic,wl.relying on forsgren,judge patel concluded that stormwater runoff from logging roads that was collected in a system of ditches,culverts,and channels,and then discharged into protected water,was a point source discharge requiring an npdes permit.after an extensive analysis,the district court wrote 
the water runoff system this action addresses is an elaborate and extensive one.blending a variety of drainage methods,the system covers a substantial amount of land and addresses a significant amount of water.where this runoff system involves surface drainage or road construction from which there is natural runoff,section the silvicultural rule may control.but where the system utilizes the kind of conduits and channels embraced by section,section does not control it can not control,for one,because section of the cwa trumps section operation,as epa may not alter the definition of an existing point source.and it can not control,for another,because section own terms are unsatisfied once runoff enters a conduit like those listed in section,the runoff ceases to be the kind of natural runoff section expressly targets.in this latter context,section does silvicultural businesses of cwa point source requirements.
id.at internal citations omitted.
as pointed out by the district court in epic,there are two possible readings of the silvicultural rule.the first reading reflects the intent of epa in adopting the rule.under this reading,the rule exempts all natural runoff from silvicultural activities such as nursery operations,site preparation,and the other listed activities from the definition of point source,irrespective of whether,and the manner in which,the runoff is collected,channeled,and discharged into protected water.if the rule is read in this fashion,it is inconsistent with and is,to that extent,invalid.
the second reading does not reflect the intent of epa,but would allow us to construe the rule to be consistent with the statute.under this reading,the rule exempts natural runoff from silvicultural activities such as those listed,but only as long as the natural runoff remains natural.that is,the exemption ceases to exist as soon as the natural runoff is channeled and controlled in some systematic way through a discernible,confined and discrete conveyance and discharged into the waters of the united states.
under either reading,we hold that the silvicultural rule does not exempt from the definition of point source discharge under stormwater runoff from logging roads that is collected and channeled in a system of ditches,culverts,and conduits before being discharged into streams and rivers.
amendments to the cwa 
defendants contend in the alternative that even if the discharges from a system of ditches,culverts,and channels are point source discharges within the meaning of,and even if the silvicultural rule does not exempt such discharges from,the discharges are nonetheless exempt from the permitting process because of the amendments to the cwa.defendants made this contention in the district court,but that court did not decide the question.
we can affirm the decision of the district court on any ground supported by the record,even one not relied on by that court.thompson paul,cir.defendants urge us,if we hold that the silvicultural rule does not exempt the discharges,to affirm the district court based on the amendments.no factual development is necessary given that the district court dismissed under rule b.the parties have briefed the question in this court.we therefore reach the question.
congressional approval or acquiescence 
as a threshold matter,we consider whether,in adopting the amendments to the cwa,congress sub silentio approved of,or acquiesced in,the silvicultural rule.we conclude that congress did not.
in some instances,congressional of statutes can be persuasive evidence of approval of longstanding administrative regulations promulgated under that statute.in nlrb bell aerospace,the court wrote,a court may accord great weight to the longstanding interpretation placed on a statute by an agency charged with its administration.this is especially so where congress has the statute without pertinent change.in these circumstances,congressional failure to revise or repeal the agency interpretation is persuasive evidence that the interpretation is the one intended by congress.see also commodity futures trading comm schor,quoting and paraphrasing bell aerospace.but this case is very different from bell aerospace and schor.first,in both bell aerospace and schor,the legislative histories made clear that when congress the statutes at issue it was well aware of the existing administrative interpretation of the statutes.here,by contrast,there is no indication that congress was aware of the silvicultural rule when it adopted the amendments.there is no mention of,or even allusion to,the rule anywhere in the legislative history of the amendments.second,in both bell aerospace and schor,the relevant portions of the statutes at issue were reenacted essentially without change.here,as we explain below,the amendments fundamentally changed the statutory treatment of stormwater discharges.third,the language of the original and the statutes in both bell aerospace and schor was readily susceptible to the administrative interpretations of those statutes.here,by contrast,the relevant statutory language is flatly inconsistent with the silvicultural rule.
in other instances,congressional action or inaction can constitute acquiescence in an existing regulation.the supreme court has cautioned strongly against finding congressional acquiescence.in solid waste agency of northern cook county army corps of engineers,it wrote,although we have recognized congressional acquiescence to administrative interpretations of a statute in some circumstances,we have done so with extreme care.after discussing a case in which there had been congressional hearings on the precise issue,and in which thirteen bills had been introduced in unsuccessful attempts to overturn the regulation,the court wrote,absent such overwhelming evidence of acquiescence,we are loath to replace the plain text and original understanding of a statute with an amended agency interpretation.id.at.here,there is no evidence whatsoever of congressional acquiescence in the silvicultural rule,let alone overwhelming evidence.
the stormwater amendments 
congress amended the cwa in to deal specifically with stormwater discharges,stat.congress added p to the cwa,establishing a phased and tiered approach to npdes permitting of stormwater discharges.see,describing p.section p fundamentally redesigned the cwa approach to stormwater discharges.
under the framework created by the fwcpa in,epa was required to establish a permitting system for all point source discharges of stormwater.senator durenberger explained that the conference bill that would become the amendment focused on stormwater point sources.
the fwpca of required all point sources,including stormwater dischargers,to apply for npdes permits within days of enactment by.despite this clear directive,epa has failed to require most stormwater point sources to apply for permits which would control the pollutants in their discharge.
cong.rec.senator stafford,the chairman of the committee on environment and public works reiterated,epa should have developed this stormwater program long ago.unfortunately,it did not.cong.rec.
congress recognized that epa difficulties stemmed in part from the large number of stormwater sources falling within the definition of a point source.see,cong.rec,statement of rowland under existing law,the epa must require npdes permits for anyone who has stormwater runoff on their property.what we are talking about is potentially thousands of permits for churches,schools,residential property,runoff that poses no environmental threat.cong.rec,statement of wallop epa regulations can be interpreted to require everyone who has a device to divert,gather,or collect stormwater runoff and snowmelt to get a permit from epa as a point source requiring a permit for these kinds of stormwater runoff conveyance systems would be an administrative nightmare.
in p,adopted as part of the amendments,congress required npdes permits for the most significant sources of stormwater pollution under phase i regulations.see cong.rec,statement of roe section p establishes an orderly procedure which will enable the major contributors of pollutants to be addressed first,and all discharges to be ultimately addressed in a manner which will not completely overwhelm epa capabilities.section p lists five categories of stormwater discharges,including discharges associated with industrial activity,that are covered in phase p b.npdes permits are required for all five categories of discharges.id.p.such discharges were required to apply for a permit by.id.p a.
all remaining stormwater discharges are to be covered by phase ii regulations.during phase ii,epa is to study stormwater discharges not covered by phase i and to issue regulations based on its study.id.p.in,epa promulgated a phase ii regulation requiring npdes permits for discharges from small municipal storm systems and small construction sites.we upheld most of that regulation in environmental defense center epa,cir,and remanded for further proceedings.epa has not yet responded to the remand.
stormwater discharges from churches,schools and residential properties,through rain gutters or otherwise,and from other relatively de minimus sources,are covered under phase ii rather than phase i.it is within the discretion of epa to promulgate phase ii regulations requiring,or not requiring,permits for such discharges.
phase i stormwater regulations 
in,epa promulgated phase i regulations for the storm water discharges specified in p.for discharges associated with industrial activity,which require npdes permits,epa regulations provide 
storm water discharge associated with industrial activity means the discharge from any conveyance that is used for collecting and conveying storm water and that is directly related to manufacturing,processing or raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant.the term does not include discharges from facilities or activities excluded from the npdes program under this part.
b.the last sentence of this regulation refers to the silvicultural rule,thereby purporting to exempt from the definition of discharges associated with industrial activity any activity that is defined as a nonpoint source in the silvicultural rule.see id.
the preamble to the phase i regulations makes clear epa intent to exempt nonpoint sources as defined in the silvicultural rule from the permitting program mandated by p.the preamble provides 
the definition of discharge associated with industrial activity does not include activities or facilities that are currently exempt from permitting under npdes.epa does not intend to change the scope of cfr in this rulemaking.accordingly,the definition of storm water discharge associated with industrial activity does not include sources which are excluded under cfr.
in the amendments,congress exempted many stormwater discha
