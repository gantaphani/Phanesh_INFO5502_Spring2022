factual background 
stormwater runoff in los angeles county 
stormwater runoff is surface water generated by precipitation events,such as rainstorms,which flows over streets,parking lots,commercial sites,and other developed parcels of land.when stormwater courses over urban environs,it frequently becomes polluted with contaminants,such as suspended metals,sediments,nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus,floatable trash,used motor oil,raw sewage,and pesticides.envtl.def,epa,cir.this polluted stormwater often makes its way into storm drains and sewers,which generally channel collected runoff into federally protected water bodies,such as rivers and oceans.consequently,stormwater runoff has been recognized as one of the most significant sources of water pollution in the nation,at times comparable to,if not greater than,contamination from industrial and sewage sources.id.citation omitted.
los angeles county the county is home to more than million people and covers a sprawling amalgam of populous incorporated cities and significant swaths of unincorporated land.the los angeles county flood control district the district is a public entity governed by the los angeles county board of supervisors and the los angeles county department of public works.the district comprises cities and some unincorporated areas of the county.the county and the district are separate legal entities.
each city in the district operates a municipal separate storm sewer system that is composed of gutters,catch basins,storm drains,and pipes that collect and convey stormwater.the county also operates its own that primarily collects and conveys stormwater runoff in the unincorporated areas of the county.each of these connects to the district substantially larger,an extensive and infrastructure consisting of approximately miles of open channels and miles of storm drains.because a comprehensive map of the county defendants storm sewer system does not exist,no one knows the exact size of the la or the locations of all of its storm drain connections and outfalls but while the number and location of storm drains and outfalls are too numerous to catalog,it is undisputed that the la collects and channels stormwater runoff from across the county.it is similarly undisputed that untreated stormwater is discharged from la outfalls into various watercourses,including the los angeles and san gabriel rivers these rivers,in turn,drain into several coastal waters,including,among others,the santa monica bay and the pacific ocean.
ii.the county defendants npdes permit 
section a of the cwa prohibits the discharge of any pollutant from any point source into navigable waters unless the discharge complies with certain other sections of the cwa see a.one of those sections is section,which provides for the issuance of npdes permits.u.in nearly all cases,an npdes permit is required before anyone may lawfully discharge a pollutant from a point source into the navigable waters of the united states.see arkansas oklahoma,environmental law handbook thomas sullivan,st ed.
congress has empowered the epa administrator to delegate npdes permitting authority to state agencies.b.pursuant to this authority,the epa has authorized the state of california to develop water quality standards and issue npdes permits.pursuant to the portercologne water quality control act,california state law designates the state water resources control board and nine regional boards as the principal state agencies charged with enforcing federal and state water pollution laws and issuing npdes permits.see cal.water code et.the entity responsible for issuing permits in the los angeles area is the california state water resources control board for the los angeles region the regional board.
on june,the regional board first issued an npdes permit the permit regulating stormwater discharges by the county,the district,and the incorporated municipalities in the district collectively,the permittees.the permit has subsequently been renewed or amended several times,and the version of the permit at issue in this litigation came into force on december,the permit covers all relevant discharges that occur within the boundaries of the permittee municipalities over which the municipalities have regulatory jurisdiction as well as unincorporated areas in los angeles county within the jurisdiction of the regional board.
the permit runs to pages and contains a myriad of rules,regulations,and conditions regarding the permittees operation of the la.however,only two sets of the permit provisions are particularly relevant to this appeal those contained in part,titled receiving water limitations,and those contained in the section titled monitoring and reporting program.
part places limits on the type and amount of pollutants the permittees may lawfully discharge from the la.specifically,part prohibits discharges from the la that cause or contribute to the violation of the water quality standards or water quality objectives.the permit defines water quality standards and water quality objectives as water quality criteria contained in the basin plan,the california ocean plan,the national toxics rule,the california toxics rule,and other state or federal approved surface water quality plans.succinctly put,the permit incorporates the pollution standards promulgated in other agency documents such as the basin plan,and prohibits stormwater discharges that cause or contribute to the violation of those incorporated standards.the permit further provides that the permittees shall comply with the la discharge prohibitions outlined in part through timely implementation of control measures and other actions to reduce pollutants in the ir la discharges 
the monitoring and reporting program complements part.under that program,the permittees are required to monitor the impacts of their la discharges on water quality and to publish the results of all pollution monitoring at least annually.the primary objectives of the monitoring program include assessing compliance with the permit,measuring and improving the effectiveness of the los angeles countywide stormwater quality management program sqmp and assessing the environmental impact of urban runoff on the receiving waters in the county.
one of the principal ways the permittees are required to monitor their la discharges is through monitoring.monitoring measures all constituents present in water,and the readings give a cumulative picture of the pollutant load in a waterbody.the permit requires the district,as principal permittee,to conduct monitoring at seven enumerated monitoring stations located throughout the county.the district is also responsible for analyzing the resulting data and submitting a comprehensive report of its findings according to the permit,the purpose of monitoring is to estimate the mass emissions from the la assess trends in the mass emissions over time and determine if the la is contributing to exceedances of water quality standards by comparing the monitoring results to the applicable pollution standards promulgated in the basin plan and similar documents.
the permittees sited a monitoring station in both the los angeles and san gabriel rivers collectively,the monitoring stations.the los angeles river monitoring station is located in a channelized portion of the los angeles river that runs through the city of long beach the san gabriel river monitoring station is located in a channelized portion of the san gabriel river that runs through the city of pico rivera.the monitoring stations are located downstream of numerous la outfalls controlled by the county defendants and various other permittees.
between and,when this case was filed,the district published annual monitoring reports that contain the data that the district collected at the monitoring stations.according to those reports,the monitoring stations identified separate exceedances of the permit water quality standards,including excessive levels of aluminum,copper,cyanide,zinc,and fecal coliform bacteria in both the los angeles and san gabriel rivers.the county defendants do not dispute the accuracy of the monitoring data.
procedural background 
using the monitoring data by the district,plaintiffs cataloged the water quality exceedances measured in various receiving waters in the county.beginning on may,plaintiffs sent a series of notice letters to the county defendants informing them that plaintiffs believed that they were violating the terms of the permit specifically,plaintiffs contended that the water quality exceedances documented in the district monitoring reports demonstrated liability under the cwa.dissatisfied with the county defendants response to these letters,plaintiffs brought this action on march.after the district court dismissed certain elements of the plaintiffs initial complaint because notice of the permit violations was defective,plaintiffs sent the county defendants an adequate notice letter on july.
plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint on september.in the complaint,plaintiffs asserted six causes of action under the cwa.four of the plaintiffs claims,which the district court designated the watershed claims,were initially before us on appeal.the first three watershed claims allege that,beginning in or,the county defendants caused or contributed to exceedances of water quality standards in the santa clara river claim,the los angeles river claim,and the san gabriel river claim,in violation of a,p.the fourth watershed claim alleges that,beginning in,county defendants caused or contributed to exceedances of the water quality standards and violated the total maximum daily load limits in malibu creek.all of the watershed claims rest on the same premise the permit incorporates limits for each receiving water body massemissions monitoring stations have recorded pollutant loads in the receiving water bodies that exceed those permitted under the relevant standards an exceedance constitutes with the permit and,thereby,the clean water act and county defendants,as holders of the permit and joint operators of the la,are liable for these exceedances under the act.
early in the litigation,the district court bifurcated liability and remedy,and all proceedings related to remedy were stayed until liability was determined.on march,the district court denied all parties for summary judgment with regard to liability.nrdc cnty.of,no.cv ahm,wl,amended on other grounds,wl.although the district court accepted plaintiffs arguments that the permit clearly prohibits discharges from the la that cause or contribute to the violation of water quality standards or water quality objectives,wl,at,and that massmonitoring stations are the proper monitoring locations to determine if the la is contributing to exceedances of the water quality standards or water quality objectives,the district court held that plaintiffs were improperly attempting to use the district monitoring data to establish liability without presenting evidence that any individual defendant was discharging pollutants that cause d or contribute d to the violation of the water quality standards.id.the district court observed that although the district is responsible for the pollutants in the la at the time they pass the monitoring stations,that does not necessarily determine the question of whether the water passing by these points is a discharge within the meaning of the permit and the clean water act.id.at.unable to determine whether any of the county defendants upstream la outflows were contributing polluted stormwater to navigable waters,the district court stated that plaintiffs would need to present some evidence monitoring data or an admission that some amount of a standardsexceeding pollutant is being discharged through at least one district outlet.id.at.
following supplemental briefing,the district court again determined that plaintiffs failed to present evidence that the pollutants passed through the defendants la outflows at or near the time the exceedances were observed.nor did plaintiffs provide any evidence that the mass emissions stations themselves are located at or near a defendant outflow.the district court thus entered summary judgment for the county defendants on the watershed claims.
on june,the district court entered a partial final judgment on the watershed claims under.b.the court reasoned that an interlocutory appeal was appropriate because the watershed claims are factually and legally severable from the plaintiffs other claims and t he parties and the court would benefit from appellate resolution of the central legal question underlying the watershed claims what level of proof is necessary to establish defendants liability.the plaintiffs timely appealed.
on appeal,the plaintiffs pressed the same legal argument they advanced in the district court that the data published in the county defendants annual monitoring reports data which shows undisputed pollution exceedances at the massemissions monitoring stations conclusively establishes the county defendants liability for permit violations as a matter of law.like the district court,we rejected this contention and held that the plaintiffs must submit at least some additional proof of the county defendants individual contributions to the measured permit violations.see natural res.def.council,at noting that the clean water act does not prohibit undisputed exceedances it prohibits discharges that are not in compliance with the act while it may be undisputed that exceedances have been detected,responsibility for those exceedances requires proof that some entity discharged a pollutant.
nonetheless,we held the district liable for cwa violations in the los angeles and san gabriel rivers because we concluded that the monitoring stations for each river are located in a section of the la owned and operated by the district and that when pollutants were detected,they had not yet exited the point source into navigable waters.id.at.we further clarified that t he relevant discharge from a point source occurred when the stormwater flowed out of the concrete channels where the monitoring stations are located,through an outfall,and into the navigable waterways.we agree with plaintiffs that the precise location of each outfall is ultimately irrelevant because there is no dispute that the la eventually adds stormwater to the los angeles and san gabriel rivers downstream from the monitoring stations.id.at.
on october,the district filed a petition for writ of certiorari,wl,which was granted in part on june.cnty.flood control dist.natural res.def.council.the supreme court granted review in order to answer a single question under the cwa,does a discharge of pollutants occur when polluted water flows from one portion of a river that is navigable water of the united states,through a concrete channel or other engineered improvement in the river,and then into a lower portion of the same river cnty.flood control.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court answered in the negative,and its holding in.water mgmt.dist.miccosukee tribe of indians,that pumping polluted water from one part of a water body into another part of the same body is not a discharge of pollutants under the cwa.cnty.flood control.at.the court did not address any other basis for the district potential liability for permit violations and instead reversed our prior judgment and remanded this case to us for additional proceedings.id.at.

discussion 
plaintiffs return from the supreme court with the same argument they have consistently advanced throughout this litigation that the county defendants monitoring data establishes their liability for permit violations as a matter of law.we previously rejected this argument,see natural res.def.council,at,and the supreme court explicitly declined to address it 
on remand,the county defendants argue that we may not reconsider our earlier decision because it has become final,and because reconsideration of appellants monitoring argument would fly in the face of the finality given to decisions of this court after denial of rehearing or expiration of the time in which to seek such further review.alternatively,the county defendants argue that our earlier disposition should be left undisturbed because it has become the law of the case.the county defendants are mistaken on both counts.
no opinion of this circuit becomes final until the mandate issues.carver lehman,cir see also fed.c,comm.note a court of appeals judgment or order is not final until issuance of the mandate.thus,we have explained that a court of appeals may modify or revoke its judgment at any time prior to issuance of the mandate,sua sponte or by motion of the parties.united states foumai,cir.the mandate in this case has not issued.consequently,our earlier judgment is not final.carver,at.nor can it be considered the law of the case.see id.at u ntil the mandate issues,an opinion is not fixed as settled ninth circuit law,and reliance on the opinion is a gamble.citation omitted see also key enters.of,venice,cir b ecause the panel mandate had not issued,the panel decision was never the law of the case.put simply,we are free to reconsider the merits of plaintiffs argument,and we now do so.
where a permittee discharges pollutants in compliance with the terms of its npdes permit,the permit acts to shield the permittee from liability under the cwa.k.the permit shield is a major benefit to a permittee because it protects the permittee from any obligation to meet more stringent limitations promulgated by the epa unless and until the permit expires.see piney run ass cnty.comm rs.of carroll,cir see also the clean water act handbook mark ryan,ed.of course,with every benefit comes a cost a permittee violates the cwa when it discharges pollutants in excess of the levels specified in the permit,or where the permittee otherwise violates the permit terms.see russian river watershed prot.comm.city of santa rosa,cir see also a any permit noncompliance constitutes a violation of the clean water act and is grounds for an enforcement action nw.envtl.advocates city of portland,cir noting that t he plain language of the cwa citizen suit provision authorizes citizens to enforce all permit conditions environmental law handbook the primary purpose of npdes permits is to establish enforceable effluent limitations.
plaintiffs allege that the county defendants are violating the terms of the permit by discharging pollutants into the los angeles and san gabriel rivers in excess of the permitted levels.county defendants do not dispute that they are discharging pollutants from the la into these rivers.nor can the county defendants dispute that their own monitoring reports demonstrate that pollution levels recorded at the monitoring stations are in excess of those allowed under the permit.rather,the county defendants focus on their perception of the evidentiary burden plaintiffs must satisfy in order to hold any individual defendant liable for these pollution exceedances.plaintiffs contend that they may rely exclusively on the district monitoring reports to establish liability.county defendants,however,argue that they can not be held liable for permit violations based solely on the data published in the district monitoring reports because the monitoring required under the permit was neither designed nor intended to measure the compliance of any permittee and the monitoring data can not parse out precisely whose discharge s contributed to any given exceedance because the monitoring stations sample pollution levels downstream from a legion of discharge points,la outfalls controlled by various permittees and other entities,as opposed to at the discharge points themselves.
to resolve the parties contentions,we must interpret the language of the permit.although the npdes permitting scheme can be complex,a court task in interpreting and enforcing an npdes permit is not npdes permits are treated like any other contract.see nw.envtl.advocates,at we review the district court interpretation of the permit as we would the interpretation of a contract or other legal document.if the language of the permit,considered in light of the structure of the permit as a whole,is plain and capable of legal construction,the language alone must determine the permit meaning.piney run ass,at citation omitted.if,however,the permit language is ambiguous,we may turn to extrinsic evidence to interpret its terms.id.our sole task at this point of the case is to determine what plaintiffs are required to show in order to establish liability under the terms of this particular npdes permit 
a.the plain language of the permit 
npdes permit terms are to be given their ordinary meaning,and when the terms of a permit are clear,the intent of the parties must be ascertained from the permit itself.klamath water users protective ass patterson,cir.plaintiffs argue that the text of the county defendants permit is clear,and provides that the district monitoring data will be used to assess the county defendants compliance with the permit,and particularly part,which prohibits discharges from the la that cause or contribute to the violation of water quality standards or water quality objectives.the county defendants dispute this notion,and first claim that the district monitoring is intended to serve only a hortatory purpose.as county defendants state,the mass emission monitoring program neither measures nor was designed to measure any individual permittee compliance with the permit.this argument is clearly belied by the text of the permit and is rejected.
the permit establishes a monitoring and reporting program with the stated objectives of both characterizing stormwater discharges and assessing compliance with waterquality standards.the permit language could not be more explicit in this regard,stating that a ssessing compliance with this permit is one of the primary objectives of the monitoring program.the fact that the parties dispute a permit meaning does not establish that the permit is ambiguous it is only ambiguous if reasonable people could find its terms susceptible to more than one interpretation.klamath water users protective ass,at.no reasonable person could find even the slightest ambiguity in the phrase t he primary objectives of the monitoring program include,but are not limited to assessing compliance with this permit.consequently,we decline to embrace the county defendants initial argument that the monitoring stations,as a matter of fact,do not assess the compliance of any permittee with the permit 
county defendants alternative argument,while more facially appealing,fares no better.specifically,the county defendants point to certain permit language they claim shows that the regional board did not intend for the monitoring data to be used to establish liability for permit violations.for instance,the county defendants note that the permit provides that e ach permittee is responsible only for a discharge for which it is the operator.county defendants also cite language in part that reads discharges from the la of storm water,or water,for which a permittee is responsible for sic,shall not cause or contribute to a condition of nuisance.the county defendants read this language as precluding a finding of liability against them or any other permittee without independent monitoring data establishing that discharges from a particular entity outfalls exceeded standards.
a court must give effect to every word or term in an npdes permit and reject none as meaningless or surplussage in re crystal,cir quotations omitted see also restatement second of contracts a a n interpretation which gives a reasonable,lawful,and effective meaning to all the terms is preferred to an interpretation which leaves a part unreasonable,unlawful,or of no effect.therefore,we must interpret the permit in a manner that gives full meaning and effect to all of the permit provisions and avoid a construction of the permit that focuses only on a few isolated provisions.in re crystal,at.
the county defendants interpretation of the permit ultimately must be rejected because it would create an unreasonable result.reading the clause that e ach permittee is responsible only for a discharge for which it is the operator to preclude use of the monitoring data to assess compliance with this permit would render the monitoring provisions of the permit largely meaningless.under the county defendants reading of the permit,individual permittees could discharge an unlimited amount of pollutants from the la but never be held liable for those discharges based on the results of the monitoring,even though that monitoring is explicitly intended to assess whether permittees are in compliance with part discharge limitations.we are unwilling to accept such a strained interpretation.see mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton,holding that courts should be guided by the cardinal principle of contract construction that a document should be read to give effect to all of its provisions and to render them consistent with each other.a better reading of the permit putatively conflicting provisions,therefore,is the one proposed by plaintiffs.limiting a permittee responsibility to discharge s for which it is the operator applies to the appropriate remedy for permit violations,not to liability for those violations.indeed,plaintiffs reading is consistent with the remedial scheme of the permit itself.if the la is found to be contributing to water quality violations,each permittee must take appropriate remedial measures with respect to its own discharges thus,a finding of liability against the county defendants would not,as defendants argue,hold any county defendant responsible for discharges for which they are not the operator.
in sum,and contrary to the county defendants contentions,the language of the permit is clear the data collected at the monitoring stations is intended to determine whether the permittees are in compliance with the permit.if the district monitoring data shows that the level of pollutants in federally protected water bodies exceeds those allowed under the permit,then,as a matter of permit construction,the monitoring data conclusively demonstrate that the county defendants are not in compliance with the permit conditions.thus,the county defendants are liable for permit violations.
extrinsic considerations 
although we believe the plain language of the permit clearly contemplates that the county defendants monitoring data will be used to assess permit compliance,establish liability for cwa violations,we note that numerous extrinsic considerations also undercut the county defendants position.
first and foremost,the clean water act requires every npdes permittee to monitor its discharges into the navigable waters of the united states in a manner sufficient to determine whether it is in compliance with the relevant npdes permit.a i e ach npdes permit shall include conditions meeting the following monitoring requirements to assure compliance with permit limitations.that is,an npdes permit is unlawful if a permittee is not required to effectively monitor its permit compliance.see d i f permit applications for discharges from large and medium municipal storm sewers shall include monitoring procedures necessary to determine compliance and noncompliance with permit conditions.as previously noted,the county defendants contend that the monitoring program neither measures nor was designed to measure any individual permittee compliance with the permit.but if the county defendants are correct,the permit would be unlawful under the cwa.we must interpret the provisions of the permit like any other contract and reject an interpretation that would render the permit unenforceable.see walsh schlecht,noting that contracts should not be interpreted to render them illegal and unenforceable where the wording lends itself to a logically acceptable construction that renders them legal and enforceable see also nw.envtl.advocates,at restatement second of contracts.
second,the county defendants position has been explicitly rejected by the regional board,the entity that issued the permit.this is important because one of our obligations in interpreting an npdes permit is to determine the intent of the permitting authority piney run ass n,at.thus,we give significant weight to any extrinsic evidence that evinces the permitting authority interpretation of the relevant permit.see nw.envtl.advocates,at relying on significant evidence from the state permitting agency,the permit author,to determine the proper scope of an npdes permit.
here,the record contains an amicus brief filed by the regional board in a lawsuit nearly identical to this one in that suit,these same plaintiffs sued the city of malibu,one of the county defendants,for violating the npdes permit at issue in this case.in its brief,the regional board stated its position that 
the permit recognizes that the interconnected nature of the system means that it may be difficult to determine exactly where pollutants originated within the la.this does not mean,however,that the permit assumes only one permittee may be responsible.instead,it recognizes that in such an integrated storm sewer system,one or more permittees may have caused or contributed to violations having constructed a joint sewer system that,by design,the permittees discharges,they can not avoid enforcement because one can not determine the original source of pollutants in the waste stream.
the regional board also noted that the monitoring program that the permittees requested and were granted does not readily generate the outfall data that the county defendants would require as a precondition to enforcement.as a result,the regional board disagreed with any construction of the permit that would require individualized proof of a permittees discharges in order to establish liability.simply put,the regional board indicated that it does not agree that the burden of proving permit violations rests upon the enforcing entity.although we do not defer to the regional board interpretation of the permit,see orthopaedic hosp.belshe,cir,its rejection of the county defendants position is clearly instructive.
finally,the county defendants arguments run counter to the purposes of the cwa,and ignore the inherent complexity of ensuring an compliance with an npdes permit that covers thousands of different point sources and outfalls.as we have previously recognized,t he npdes program fundamentally relies on.sierra club union oil of,cir,vacated and remanded on other grounds,and reinstated and amended by cir.congress
