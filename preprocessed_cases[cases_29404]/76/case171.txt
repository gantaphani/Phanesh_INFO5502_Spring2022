factual and procedural background 
on june,erf sent a letter to pg e stating that it intended to file a citizen suit under the cwa and rcra.the letter alleged that pg e had violated these statutes by releasing into the environment wood preservative from pg e utility poles in alameda,contra costa,marin,and san francisco counties.the letter contended that wood preservative is and contains toxic chemicals,including pcp and various forms of dioxin.the letter included a list of utility poles in dispute and the dates of the alleged violations.
on august,erf filed a complaint against pg e asserting cwa claims.thirty days later,erf filed a first amended complaint adding a rcra claim and attaching the june notice letter.erf sent two more notice letters dated october,and january.the october notice added alleged responsible parties but was otherwise identical to the june notice.the january notice added pacific bell,among other parties,and discussed poles treated with any chemical preservative,not just pcp.
on june,erf filed a second amended complaint,the operative complaint in this appeal.the complaint added pacific bell as a defendant and alleged that pg e and pacific bell had violated and were violating the cwa,a,by discharging pollutantbearing storm water runoff from their utility poles into waters of the united states without an npdes permit the cwa,id.a,by failing to obtain an npdes permit,regardless of any discharges and rcra,a b,by contributing to the past and present handling,storage,treatment,transportation and disposal of solid waste,which may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.
pg e and pacific bell filed motions to dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim.the district court granted the defendants motions.ecological rights found.pac.gas,d.the court dismissed the cwa claim on the ground that stormwater runoff contaminated by wood preservative from the defendants utility poles is not a point source discharge requiring an npdes permit.id.at.the court dismissed the rcra claim on the ground that wood preservative that escapes from the defendants utility poles is not a solid waste under rcra.id.at.the court dismissed the second amended complaint without leave to amend because erf theory of liability under the cwa and rcra can not be rectified by further amendment to the pleadings.id.at 
erf appeals only the dismissal of its first cwa claim discharge without an npdes permit and rcra claim erf does not appeal the dismissal of its second cwa claim failure to obtain an npdes permit regardless of any discharge.

discussion 
dismissal under rule b.cwaa.point source discharges 
the cwa defines point source as any discernible,confined and discrete conveyance,including but not limited to any pipe,ditch,channel,tunnel,conduit,well,discrete fissure,container,rolling stock,concentrated animal feeding operation,or vessel or other floating craft,from which pollutants are or may be discharged.the cwa does not define nonpoint source,but we have explained that 
it is widely understood to be the type of pollution that arises from many dispersed activities over large areas,and is not traceable to any single discrete source.because it arises in such a diffuse way,it is very difficult to regulate through individual permits.the most common example of nonpoint source pollution is the residue left on roadways by automobiles.small amounts of rubber are worn off of the tires of millions of cars and deposited as a thin film on highways minute particles of copper dust from brake linings are spread across roads and parking lots each time a driver applies the brakes drips and drabs of oil and gas ubiquitously stain driveways and streets.when it rains,the rubber particles and copper dust and gas and oil wash off of the streets and are carried along by runoff in a polluted soup,winding up in creeks,rivers,bays,and the ocean.
league of wilderness defenders,at see also or.natural desert ass forest,cir discussing regulation,or lack thereof,of nonpoint sources.
stormwater runoff is a nonpoint or point source depending on whether it is allowed to run off naturally and is thus a nonpoint source or is collected,channeled,and discharged through a system of ditches,culverts,channels,and similar conveyances and is thus a point source discharge.brown,at see also greater yellowstone coal.lewis,cir,as amended,the text of the cwa and the case law are clear that some type of collection or channeling is required to classify an activity as a point source.envtl.def,at diffuse runoff,such as rainwater that is not channeled through a point source,is considered nonpoint source pollution and is not subject to federal regulation.trustees for alaska epa,cir p oint and nonpoint sources are not distinguished by the kind of pollution they create or by the activity causing the pollution,but rather by whether the pollution reaches the water through a confined,discrete conveyance.decker,wl,at scalia,concurring in part and dissenting in part explaining that stormwater runoff from logging roads came from point sources,because they flowed out of artificial pipe s,ditch es,and channel s,and were thus not natural runoff.
erf alleges that rain falls on and around the defendants utility poles and becomes contaminated with wood preservative.as a result,the preservative is carried by storm water runoff discharged from the poles to san francisco bay,its tributaries and adjacent wetlands.such allegations of generalized stormwater runoff do not establish a point source discharge absent an allegation that the stormwater is discretely collected and conveyed to waters of the united states.see greater yellowstone,at holding that stormwater that seeps through a mining pit cover is nonpoint source pollution because there is no confinement or containment of the water trustees for alaska,at n onpoint source pollution i s runoff caused primarily by rainfall around activities that employ or create pollutants.
erf two counterarguments give it no purchase.first,erf contends that the district court and by extension,we have read into its complaint an allegation it does not contain that the stormwater runoff reaches regulated waters through natural means.however,given the longstanding distinction in our case law between natural and conveyed stormwater under the cwa,the district court reading is reasonable absent any allegation that the runoff reaches regulated waters via some other method.see sierra club abston constr,cir explaining that point source conveyances are the means by which pollutants are ultimately deposited into a navigable body of water.
to get around the absence of a conveyed stormwater allegation in its complaint,erf next contends that the defendants utility poles are themselves conveyances.in other words,erf contends that point sources are not just ditches,culverts,and similar channels,but any tangible,identifiable thing.because the cwa is ambiguous on this issue,we would normally defer to epa.see chevron,nrdc,d.but epa has not yet determined whether utility poles are point sources until epa addresses that question,we look to cases for guidance.see garfias rodriguez holder,cir en banc granting chevron deference to agency interpretation issued after contrary circuit cases managed pharmacy care sebelius,cir holding that the ninth circuit was not bound by a prior opinion rendered without the benefit of the agency statutory interpretation or participation in the litigation.
the case law does not support erf attempt to characterize the poles as point sources.the cases erf cites involved things that the cwa specifically identifies as point sources were constructed for the express purpose of storing pollutants or moving them from one place to another or no one disputed were point sources solid wood utility poles are none of these things.recognizing the lack of clarity in the cwa,we conclude that,in the absence of any guidance from epa,utility poles simply are not discernible,confined and discrete conveyance s that channel and control stormwater.brown,at see also.water mgmt.dist.miccosukee tribe of indians,d emphasizing that point source refers to things that transport pollutants united states plaza health,cir explaining that point sources are physical structures and instrumentalities that systematically act as a means of conveying pollutants from an industrial source to navigable waterways.for these reasons,erf has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under the cwa.
additional allegations 
erf argues that its second amended complaint is not limited to the allegation that contaminated stormwater runoff flows from the utility poles directly into waters of the united states.according to erf,its complaint also alleges that the defendants utility poles discharge directly into waters of the united states through preservative dripping into marshes in which the poles are located,and the stormwater runoff from the poles is collected in unidentified ditches,channels,and other conveyances which then discharge into waters of the united states.
erf never made this argument in the extensive motion proceedings in the district court,and therefore waived it.see ruiz affinity logistics,cir a n issue will generally be deemed waived on appeal if the argument was not raised sufficiently for the trial court to rule on it.quotation marks omitted.as erf conceded at oral argument,erf opposed the defendants motions to dismiss on the theory that utility poles are themselves point sources of generalized stormwater runoff,not on the theory that the poles discharged directly into waters of the united states or that the runoff was collected and conveyed into such waters.
erf failure to urge these theories below is facially consistent with the second amended complaint.the complaint only allegation regarding how the utility poles contaminate waters of the united states is through the generalized discharge of stormwater,with no mention of the direct discharge of wood preservative or the collection and conveyance of contaminated stormwater via channels.although erf points to words and phrases such as leak ing,drip ping,and contaminat ion of surface waters in its complaint,these isolated fragments can not bear the weight erf places upon them.see iqbal,at t he federal rules do not require courts to credit a complaint conclusory statements without reference to its factual context.bell atl.twombly,d explaining that a complaint must possess enough heft to show a plausible claim for relief ex rel.hernandez cnty.of tulare,cir a llegations in a complaint or counterclaim must contain sufficient allegations of underlying facts to give fair notice and to enable the opposing party to defend itself effectively.quotation marks omitted.
perhaps recognizing the absence of a direct discharge or collected runoff theory in its complaint,erf urges us to read the complaint together with its cwa notice letters.under the incorporation by reference doctrine,e ven if a document is not attached to a complaint,it may be incorporated by reference into a complaint if the plaintiff refers extensively to the document or the document forms the basis of the plaintiff claim.united states ritchie,cir see also davis hsbc bank,cir.whether a document is central to a complaint turns on whether the complaint necessarily relies on that document.see daniels hall educ.ass n,cir.erf notice letters,however,contain no direct discharge allegations.because a notice letter is a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit,erf can not pursue allegations its notice letter does not contain.see supra at.trout mccain foods,cir.erf notice letters do contain allegations about collected and conveyed runoff,but erf did not refer extensively to those notices and they were not integral to erf complaint.see coto settlement eisenberg,cir t he mere mention of the existence of a document is insufficient to incorporate the contents of a document.
in short,erf second amended complaint does not allege that stormwater runoff from the poles is collected in channels and then conveyed to waters of the united states,or that the utility poles discharge directly into waters of the united states.erf may not try to amend its complaint through its arguments on appeal.riggs prober raphael,cir citing forbush penney,cir t he court will not allow a party to raise an issue for the first time on appeal merely because a party believes that he might prevail if given the opportunity to try a case again on a different theory.citation omitted.
discharge associated with industrial activity 
dismissal of erf cwa claim was proper for another,independent reason.as discussed above,epa requires npdes permits for only certain categories of stormwater discharges.the only category erf argues applies in this case is discharge s associated with industrial activity.p b.we conclude that stormwater runoff from the defendants utility poles is not associated with industrial activity,for at least four reasons.
first,stormwater runoff from the defendants utility poles does not fit within epa definition of discharge associated with industrial activity,which is the discharge from any conveyance that is used for collecting and conveying storm water and that is directly related to manufacturing,processing or raw materials storage at an industrial plant b.a utility pole is not a conveyance used for collecting and conveying storm water,nor is it directly related to manufacturing,processing or raw materials storage at an industrial plant.nor is a utility pole a plant yard,access road,prior industrial area,material handling,storage,or treatment site,or any of the other types of industrial facilities specifically identified in b i xi.
the supreme court recent decision in decker,supra,supports our analysis.there,the court held that discharges of channeled stormwater runoff from logging roads were not associated with industrial activity.decker,wl,at.the court explained that,among other things,epa reasonably could conclude that b extends only to traditional industrial buildings such as factories and associated sites,as well as other relatively fixed facilities,not to temporary logging roads that lack a closer connection to traditional industrial sites.id.at.utility poles may or may not be more permanent than logging roads,but,like stormwater runoff from such roads,runoff from utility poles is not directly related to manufacturing,processing or raw materials storage at an industrial plant.id.quoting b 
the second reason why stormwater runoff from the defendants utility poles is not associated with industrial activity has to do with standard industrial classification sic codes,the classification system b uses to define the industrial activities it covers.see b ii iii,vi,viii,xi see also decker,wl,at.no sic code cited in b covers utility poles erf argues that the regulation listing of sic codes and corresponding facilities is illustrative,not exclusive,but the regulation and our case law suggest otherwise.see b the following categories of facilities are considered to be engaging in industrial activity envtl.def,at epa used sic codes in defining the universe of regulated industrial activities.
third,epa included steam electric power generating facilities in the definition of industrial activity,but rejected including major electrical powerline corridors in the regulation.see b vii npdes application regulations for storm water discharges,proposed,epa prefers that storm water discharges from major powerline corridors not be classified as storm water discharges associated with industrial activity,but rather be part of the class of discharges for which storm water permits are required under phase ii.at final rule adopting that approach.if epa has rejected including major powerline corridors in the definition of industrial activity,it is reasonable to conclude that epa did not intend to include individual residential and commercial wooden utility poles in that definition,either.
fourth,a conclusion that stormwater runoff from the defendants utility poles is a discharge associated with industrial activity could require epa or the states to regulate stormwater runoff from many other things.if the defendants utility poles are conveyances that are both used for collecting and conveying storm water and directly related to manufacturing,processing or raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant,then arguably so are playground equipment,bike racks,mailboxes,traffic lights,billboards,and street,anything that might contaminate stormwater.absent guidance from epa that says otherwise,regulation of stormwater runoff from such commonplace things would seem to run counter to epa measured regulation of stormwater discharges under p and b,and to our practice of reading statutes to avoid absurd results.united states tatoyan,cir.
erf nonetheless contends that we should read b expansively to include activities analogous to those listed in the regulation.for example,erf analogizes pg e power grid including utility poles to steam electric power generating facilities,and its electricity transmission to natural gas transmission.see b iii,vii identifying steam power plants and certain oil and gas transmission facilities as associated with industrial activity.however,power plants are plainly industrial plants,id.b,while power grids are not,especially given epa decision to exempt major electrical powerline corridors from stormwater regulation,id.b vii.if epa exempts high voltage transmission lines and associated towers from npdes permits,it makes even less sense to require them for neighborhood utility poles.as for likening facilities that transmit electricity to those that convey natural gas,b suggests that it is the substance being transported petroleum products that gives rise to the regulation.see id.b iii covering only oil and gas transmission facilities that discharge storm water contaminated by contact with or that has come into contact with,any overburden,raw material,intermediate products,finished products,byproducts or waste products located on the site of such operations.the same contamination concerns do not apply to electricity transmission.
perhaps recognizing how much it asks us to stretch epa regulation,erf alternatively contends that we should find the regulation invalid as applied to the defendants utility poles.even assuming erf can bring such a claim in a citizen suit filed under a,see decker,wl,discussing limits imposed by b,erf offers no reasons to invalidate the regulation beyond those it offers to apply the regulation to the defendants utility poles.as discussed above,those reasons lack merit.
finally,erf contends that the cwa requires epa to regulate stormwater runoff from the defendants utility poles even if it is not a discharge associated with industrial activity.in other words,epa must require npdes permits for all stormwater discharges.in support,erf cites nrdc costle,in which the circuit stated that congress intended the npdes permit to be the only means by which a discharger from a point source may escape the total prohibition of a.
it is impossible,however,to square erf view with the language of the statute,which congress amended ten years after costle.section a bars the discharge of pollutants e xcept as in compliance with,among other sections.section p,in turn,identifies specific discharges for regulation in phase i and then leaves to epa the task of promulgating phase ii regulations which designate stormwater discharges,other than those discharges described in paragraph,to be regulated to protect water quality.p.we have repeatedly explained that this language gives epa the discretion to decide which additional stormwater discharges to regulate.see brown,at envtl.def,at am.mining cong.epa,cir see also conservation law found.hannaford,d,squarely rejecting argument that epa is required to regulate all stormwater discharges,aff.cir.in short,because epa has chosen not to regulate stormwater runoff from the defendants utility poles,that runoff is in compliance with the cwa,even if it is discharged without an npdes permit.
a plaintiff must establish three things in an imminent and substantial endangerment citizen suit under rcra the defendant has been or is a generator or transporter of solid or hazardous waste,or is or has been an operator of a solid or hazardous waste treatment,storage or disposal facility the defendant has contributed or is contributing to the handling,storage,treatment,transportation,or disposal of solid or hazardous waste and,the solid or hazardous waste in question may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.a b prisco v.a d carting,cir.
erf alleges that an imminent and substantial endangerment is caused by wood preservative that leak s,spill s,and drip s from the defendants utility poles,and from d ust impregnated with the preservative that is blown into the air during dry seasons.because erf does not allege that the preservative is hazardous waste,the crux of the case turns on the issue of whether that preservative is solid waste within the meaning of rcra.safe air for everyone meyer,cir.we conclude that it is not.
we begin with rcra definition of solid waste,which is garbage,refuse,sludge from a waste treatment plant,water supply treatment plant,or air pollution control facility and other discarded material resulting from industrial,commercial,mining and agricultural operations,and from community activities see also a referring to scrap,discarded,and waste materials.the plain meaning of discard is to cast aside reject abandon give up.safe air for everyone,at quoting the new shorter oxford english dictionary ed see also am.mining cong.epa,defining discarded as disposed of,thrown away or abandoned citation omitted.rcra definition of disposal,in turn,is the discharge,deposit,injection,dumping,spilling,leaking,or placing of any solid waste or hazardous waste into or on any land or water.these ambiguous provisions,however,provide little help in deciding whether solid waste includes wood preservative that escapes from utility poles.see.coastal fishermen ass remington arms,cir lamenting that solid waste plainly means one thing in one part of rcra and something entirely different in another part of the same statute.
because the statute is ambiguous,we look to rcra legislative history.see james city of costa mesa,cir.congress enacted rcra to eliminate the last remaining loophole in environmental law by regulating the disposal of discarded materials and hazardous wastes.i,at,reprinted in.rcra was specifically designed to address the waste disposal problem,am.mining,at,which was,at base,the high volume of waste being generated and the capacity to dispose of that waste in the traditional manner.i,at.accordingly,rcra covers waste of the nation manufacturing processes,as well as manufactured products 
themselves once they have served their intended purposes and are no longer wanted by the consumer.for these reasons the term discarded materials is used to identify collectively those substances often referred to as industrial,municipal or waste refuse,trash,garbage and sludge.
id.at.the key to whether a manufactured product is a solid waste,then,is whether that product ha s served its intended purpose and is no longer wanted by the consumer.see also no spray,city of new york,cir m aterial is not discarded until after it has served its intended purpose.
in this case,erf is concerned not with wood preservative that is in or on the defendants utility poles which clearly is being put to its intended use as a general biocide but with wood preservative that leaks,spills,or otherwise escapes from the poles.but such escaping preservative is neither a manufacturing waste nor a material that the consumer in this case,pg e or pacific bell no longer wants and has disposed of or thrown away.thus,we conclude that wood preservative that escapes from treated utility poles through normal wear and tear,while those poles are in use,is not automatically a rcra solid waste.
our conclusion finds support in the case law,epa treatment of pcp and other materials under rcra,and common sense.first,in no spray coalition,supra,the second circuit held that pesticides are not being discarded when sprayed into the air with the design of effecting their intended purpose reaching and killing mosquitoes and their larvae.at c ii providing that certain commercial chemical products are not solid wastes if they are applied to the land and that is their ordinary manner of use.like the pesticides in no spray coalition,wood preservative that has been applied to utility poles to preserve them is being used for its intended purpose,and is not a rcra solid waste.
erf,of course,argues that wood preservative that escapes from utility poles is no longer serving its intended use.but the same can be said of airborne pesticide that drifts beyond its intended target after killing insects.whatever other liability the pesticide sprayer may have in such a circumstance,we would not ordinarily consider the pesticide as having been discarded.indeed,like pesticide applied to a field,preservative that falls to the base of a utility pole still serves its intended purpose by inhibiting the growth of vegetation,fungi,and other organisms.thus,like other nonhazardous materials,wood preservative that is washed or blown away from utility poles by natural means,as an expected consequence of the preservative intended use,has not been discarded.
second,epa treats spent munitions under rcra in the same way as not having been discarded through their normal use 
epa disagrees that munitions are a solid waste when they hit the ground because they have no further function,unlike pesticides,which continue to have a function on the ground.epa interpretation focuses on whether a product was used as it was intended to be used,not on whether the purpose of the product is to perform some function once on the ground.for example,the use of explosives,dynamite for road clearing,construction,or mining does not trigger rcra regulation,even though any residuals on the ground serve no further func
