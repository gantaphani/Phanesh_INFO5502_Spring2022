introduction 
in,plaintiffs richard and lilia aaron aarons purchased real property adjoining the property owned by defendants dallas and patricia dunham dunhams.although the aarons new property was served by a steep driveway,use of that driveway had long since been discontinued by previous owners because more convenient access to the property existed via a private road across the dunham property.this road had been built by an oil company to provide access to gas wells on neighboring property.for nearly years,occupants of the aaron property had made unimpeded use of this road.not long before the aarons purchase,however,the dunhams had begun to limit use of the road.
the aarons filed this lawsuit to establish their right to a prescriptive easement across the dunham property,based on their predecessors use of the road.the evidence demonstrated that express permission to use the road had been granted to the owners of the aaron property in,when the road was built,but that two other sets of occupants had used the road since then without asking or receiving permission.on the basis of this evidence,the jury found that adverse,open,and uninterrupted use of the road had been made at least from to.although the lessee oil company had posted signs on the road pursuant to civil code section,which would ordinarily prevent the acquisition of a prescriptive easement,the trial court ruled that the signs were not effective because they were not erected by the owner of the property,as required by the statute,and granted the aarons a prescriptive easement.we affirm.
ii.background 
the aarons purchased the property at tompkins hill road tompkins hill property in fortuna in june.the only access to public roads over their property is a steep driveway.the driveway presents difficult passage,particularly in inclement weather.further,because of its precarious location,maintaining the driveway is a labor of sisyphus.for these reasons,regular use of the driveway had been discontinued some years before the aarons purchase because more convenient access was available over a paved private road,known as the texaco road,that crossed the adjoining property at graham way graham way property.
the graham way property is owned by the dunhams.dunham first acquired an ownership interest in the property through inheritance in.prior to that,the property had been owned by her stepmother,thelma ettline,and ettline brother,william graham,who lived there from his birth in until his death in.after graham death,his widow continued living on the property into the early.the dunhams did not take up residence on the graham way property until.
the texaco road was cut and paved in by texaco texaco in order to service natural gas wells.texaco operated the wells pursuant to an oil and gas lease it executed in with a few landowners in the area,including a predecessor in interest of the dunhams.the lease provided texaco the right to prospect for and produce oil and natural gas on the subject properties,including the graham way property,and to construct the wells,pipelines,roads,and other structures necessary to support such production.the texaco road begins at graham way,a public road,meanders over the graham way property,cuts briefly across a corner of the tompkins hill property,and comes to a dead end at the gas wells,which are located on a third property while the road provides a convenient way for residents of the tompkins hill property to reach their home,they must pass over the graham way property to get there.on the other hand,because the texaco road does not pass near the homestead on the graham way property and is maintained by texaco,this use imposes little burden on residents of the graham way property.
just prior to construction of the texaco road,the tompkins hill property had been purchased by ezbon and susan jen jens.discussing the proposed road with officials from texaco,jen recognized that it would provide ready access to his new home.because an official told jen that texaco did not own the land underlying the portion of the road on the graham way property,jen asked the grahams for permission to use it.graham,then in his and retired,and his wife,then in her,readily gave the jens permission to use the road for as long as jen wanted or something to that effect.having gotten the grahams oral permission to use the road,jen felt it he testified,insulting and not the decent thing to do to ask for written confirmation or a formal easement.jen thereafter used the texaco road exclusively,allowing his long driveway to fall into disrepair.
after about three years,in november,the jens moved out and rented the tompkins hill property to the bush family,who occupied the home and used the texaco road for at least two years.no member of the bush family testified regarding the circumstances under which they had used the road.in particular,there is no evidence that the bushes ever spoke with graham or ettline,the,about their use of the road.
after the bushes moved out,the jens sold the property to gail and stanley fullerton fullertons in.like the jens,the fullertons preferred to use the texaco road to access their home.over time,however,fullerton reopened the old driveway,and they used it on occasion.the fullertons testified that they never requested permission to use the texaco road from anyone.
sometime between and,texaco posted on the graham way property at least one,and possibly more,permission to pass signs under the authority of section.section states,in general terms,that an owner of property can protect against the acquisition of a prescriptive easement by posting signs reading substantially as follows right to pass by permission,and subject to control,of owner section,civil code.the texaco sign or signs contained exactly this text,along with the legend texaco exploration and production at the top.there is no evidence to explain why texaco,which was not the owner of the property,posted these signs.several years after the dunhams came into ownership of the graham way property,in,they posted their own signs pursuant to section.
in december,the dunhams learned that the fullertons had listed the tompkins hill property for sale,stating in the listing that there were two modes of access to the property.in response,the dunhams retained an attorney to write a letter to the fullertons revoking permission to use the texaco road by the fullertons and any purchaser of the tompkins hill property.when showing their home,the fullertons brought all prospects in by way of the old driveway.accordingly,the aarons were well aware of this dispute before they purchased the tompkins hill property.
barely a month after moving in,the aarons filed this declaratory relief action against the dunhams.although their complaint articulates no specific legal theory,the prayer seeks a declaration that plaintiffs have an easement over the texaco road.the dunhams to quiet title.following presentation of the evidence to a jury,the trial court restricted plaintiffs to a claim of prescriptive easement,effectively granting nonsuit on the vague claims for oral easement and estoppel they had articulated during trial completing a detailed special verdict form,the jury then found jen use of texaco road was by permission bush use of the road was adverse,open and notorious,and continuous the fullertons use of the road was adverse,open and notorious,and continuous continuous,uninterrupted,nonpermissive use of the road had occurred at least from to section signs were first posted by texaco in and section signs were first posted by the dunhams in.after considering submissions from the parties and conducting further factual hearings,the trial court concluded that the jury verdict required a finding that the aarons had acquired a prescriptive easement and entered judgment accordingly.
iii.discussion 
the dunhams contend that the trial court erred in concluding that the sign posted by texaco pursuant to section did not preclude the acquisition of prescriptive rights as a result of the fullertons use and that the jury conclusion that the bushes and fullertons use of the texaco road was adverse was not supported by the evidence.
