several of plaintiff relatives signed an agreement obligating each of them to make a will leaving the family home to plaintiff father.if all of the signatories had honored the agreement,plaintiff would have received the property by way of his father will.instead,plaintiff grandmother changed her will shortly before her death,which had the effect of leaving the property to plaintiff aunt.the home was sold,and the proceeds were placed in a bank account.
plaintiff filed this action against his aunt,alleging a cause of action for performance,seeking to impose a constructive trust on the proceeds from the sale of the home.the trial court found in plaintiff favor.
we conclude that plaintiff can not maintain this action,which seeks an equitable remedy,because he had an adequate remedy at law,namely,a claim based on his grandmother breach of the written agreement to leave the property to his father.accordingly,we reverse.
background 
in march,plaintiff grandparents,father,and aunt signed an agreement providing that the father would purchase the aunt interest in the grandparents home for.the agreement also stated that plaintiff grandparents would bequeath the home to plaintiff father and his issue.by express provision,the agreement was binding on the signatories heirs,successors in interest,and personal representatives.
on march,plaintiff grandparents executed wills in conformity with the written agreement hereafter the march agreement.plaintiff father paid plaintiff aunt for her interest in the home.plaintiff father also executed a will,leaving all of his property,personal and real,to his issue.
one week after signing the documents,plaintiff grandfather died.in october,plaintiff father died,leaving plaintiff as his only heir.plaintiff father had a life insurance policy designating plaintiff grandmother as the primary beneficiary and plaintiff as the secondary beneficiary.in late,the grandmother assigned the insurance proceeds to plaintiff.in january,plaintiff received under the policy.
on january,plaintiff grandmother revoked her will and executed a holographic will,leaving all of her property,including the family home,to plaintiff aunt.
in february,plaintiff grandmother decided to sell the home and put it on the market.in early march,she contracted to sell the property to a third party for and opened escrow.on march,she died,with escrow still pending.
on april,plaintiff and his aunt,by agreement,were appointed administrators of his grandmother estate for the sole purpose of completing the sale of the property.the sale was concluded and the proceeds were placed in a bank account held by the estate.
on april,plaintiff aunt filed a notice of petition to administer the estate of his grandmother.the notice,which was served on plaintiff,stated if you are a creditor or a contingent creditor of the deceased you must file your claim with the court and mail a copy to the personal representative appointed by the court within four months from the date of first issuance of letters plaintiff filed written objections to the petition and his aunt appointment as administrator.
on september,the will of january,march,admitted to probate,and plaintiff aunt was appointed administrator with will annexed.letters of administration with will annexed were issued to the aunt.
in december,plaintiff filed a creditor claim in the probate proceeding,seeking for monthly payments he had made to his grandmother for her support and maintenance.he did not file a claim with regard to his grandmother alleged breach of the march agreement.
on march,plaintiff filed this action against his aunt hereafter defendant,in her individual capacity and as administrator of his grandmother estate,alleging causes of action for performance to impose a constructive trust on estate assets,breach of the march agreement,and revocation of his grandmother second will due to mistake and duress.defendant responded with a demurrer.as to the cause of action for breach of the march agreement,defendant argued that plaintiff was not entitled to relief because he had not filed a creditor claim in the probate proceeding alleging such liability.
in response to the demurrer,plaintiff filed an amended complaint.see code civ.this time,he named defendant in her individual capacity only.in the body of the amended complaint,he alleged that defendant was the administrator of his grandmother estate.the complaint contained a single cause of action for performance,seeking to impose a constructive trust on the proceeds from the sale of the real property.plaintiff also alleged that unless defendant is restrained from expending or otherwise disbursing the proceeds from the sale of the property,she will expend said monies which properly belong to plaintiff 
the case was tried to the court on june.after closing arguments,the matter was taken under submission.by minute order the following day,the trial court announced its intended decision to enter judgment for plaintiff.as instructed by the order,plaintiff counsel submitted a proposed judgment.it consisted of two parts.under the first part,the trial court imposed a constructive trust upon the proceeds from the sale of the real property,directing defendant in her individual capacity to retain the money for plaintiff benefit.under part two,defendant was instructed as the administrator of the estate to deliver the proceeds to plaintiff.
the trial court entered judgment on july.defendant filed a timely appeal.

as to the facts,defendant states in her opening brief that u ndisputed testimony at trial reflected that plaintiff grandmother made the assignment of life insurance proceeds to plaintiff in lieu of any interest in the real property.that statement,however,is not correct.
although defendant and another relative testified that the insurance proceeds were a substitute for the real property,plaintiff testified that he had no such agreement with his grandmother and that she had never suggested it.on,plaintiff testified that he had not asked for the insurance proceeds,nor had he ever said he was entitled to them.he testified that his grandmother decided to give him the money.the trial court chose to believe plaintiff.as stated,we defer to the trial court resolution of conflicting evidence and its determinations as to credibility.
with that factual issue resolved,the material facts are not in dispute,and we proceed to decide legal issues independently of the trial court.at the heart of the case is plaintiff assertion that the trial court properly enforced the march agreement,which required his grandmother to make a will leaving the family home to his father and his father issue.an action of the type involved here has been called one for performance of the contract to make a will since the making of a will can not be compelled,there can be no specific performance of such a contract in the strict sense,but under certain circumstances equity will give relief equivalent to specific performance by impressing a constructive trust upon the property which decedent had promised to leave to plaintiff.ludwicki guerin cal d.
defendant presents a argument in opposing performance.first,performance is equitable in nature,and plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law,namely,a civil action for damages caused by the breach of the march agreement.second,plaintiff can not maintain an action for breach of the agreement because he did not file the requisite creditor claim in his grandmother probate proceeding.we agree on both counts.
these issues were resolved by our supreme court more than years ago in morrison land cal,morrison.there,the complaint alleged as follows.the defendant owned a hotel in sacramento for a period of about years.throughout that time,the plaintiff served as the hotel chief clerk,accountant,and bookkeeper.he assisted the defendant in the management and operation of the hotel and acted as the assistant manager when the defendant was not present.over the years,the plaintiff received offers of employment from other hotels willing to pay him higher compensation.
to keep the plaintiff in his employ,the defendant agreed the words of the complaint if he,said plaintiff,would remain with the defendant and thereafter attend to,render and perform at defendant said western hotel,such services as he,plaintiff,was then performing for defendant,so long as defendant owned and conducted said western hotel,that he,defendant,would by his last will and testament devise and bequeath to plaintiff the sum of fifty thousand dollars.morrison,supra,cal.at.in reliance on the defendant promise,the plaintiff remained at the hotel until the defendant retired.ibid.
upon the defendant death,his will was admitted to probate.the will left nothing to the plaintiff,who filed a civil action against the executors,executrix,devises,and legatees,seeking performance of the defendant agreement to leave him.the complaint did not allege that the plaintiff had submitted a claim for payment to the executors and executrix.the trial court sustained demurrers to the complaint and dismissed the action on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
on appeal,the supreme court affirmed,explaining there is no dissent in the authorities from the proposition that one may make a valid contract with another to devise or bequeath property by his last will in a certain specified way.it is clear that in the event of a breach of such a contract the party damaged has an action at law for the damage caused by such breach of the promisor,and in some cases this,by reason of the circumstances,may be his only remedy,for a resort to any equitable remedy can be had only where the circumstances are such as to make the case one within the principles relative to the proper exercise of equitable jurisdiction.
where the party damaged is restricted to his remedy at law for the breach,he must necessarily proceed upon the theory that he is a creditor of the deceased,having a claim against the estate arising upon contract,within the meaning of those words as used in our probate law,and he is subject to the provisions of our statutes requiring presentation of claims to the executor or administrator and judge.code civ,et now,et.in the absence of such presentation,such a claim,by express provision of the statute,is forever barred.see,subd.b venturi taylor th,d.while,owing to the nature of the contract before us,a final breach can not be regarded as occurring until the death of the deceased,the breach was committed by the deceased,and the liability on account thereof is his i t is essential to an action for breach of contract to compensate one for services by making provision in such person favor in a will,that a claim against the estate be presented,that no claim could exist against the estate in such case except one founded upon the fact that such services were performed and no provision made in the will for compensation,and that the particulars of the claim should be stated.it is well settled that where presentation of a claim against the estate is essential,a complaint which does not aver that the claim has been presented fails to state a cause of action.morrison,supra,cal.at.
the court continued,emphasizing the distinction between equitable and legal remedies c ourts of equity,to use the language of pomeroy,will under special circumstances,enforce a contract to make a will,or to make a certain testamentary disposition,not by ordering a will to be made,but by regarding the property in the hands of the heirs,devisees,assignees,or representatives of the deceased promisor,as impressed with a trust in favor of the plaintiff,and by compelling defendant,who must,of course,belong to some one of these classes of persons,to make such a disposition of the property as will carry out the intent of the agreement.
i t is elementary that where,as here,the primary right of a party is legal in its nature,as distinguished from equitable,and one for which the law affords some remedy,as here damages by way of compensation for breach of contract,a proper exercise of the equitable jurisdiction will not give equitable relief in any case where the legal remedy is full and adequate and does complete justice.no principle of equitable jurisprudence is more firmly established than this for instance,the exclusive jurisdiction of equity to grant relief by way of specific performance of a contract will be exercised only in those cases where the legal remedy of compensatory damages is insufficient under the circumstances of the case,in the opinion of the court,to do complete justice between the parties.morrison,supra,cal.at,italics added and omitted.
the court in morrison recognized that the legal remedy of damages is generally inadequate in real property disputes c ourts of equity have established the rule that in general the legal remedy of damages is inadequate in all agreements for the sale or letting of land morrison,supra,cal.at.other authorities are in accord.see,porporato devincenzi d.remmers ciciliot d,see also.
in addition to cases involving real property,courts will grant performance of an agreement to make a will where a plaintiff has rendered service of extraordinary and exceptional character,such service as in contemplation of the parties,was not to be compensated for in money,and,as in contemplation of law,can not be compensated for in money therefore by no action at law could a plaintiff be restored to his original position these cases usually arise where the service is of some extraordinary nature which can not be,and in the contemplation of the parties was never expected to be,paid for in money,as where home ties are broken,morrison,supra,cal.at,italics omitted see porporato devincenzi,supra,d at fn.discussing cases where plaintiff rendition of personal services to defendant justified performance of defendant promise to leave property to plaintiff.
the morrison court concluded surely there can be no doubt upon the question whether plaintiff had a full and adequate remedy at law t here was nothing extraordinary or peculiar in the nature of the service to be rendered by plaintiff for deceased.at best,he was the assistant manager of the hotel business of deceased conducted at the western hotel in sacramento,and was a faithful and efficient employee of deceased,having his absolute confidence.the services that he was rendering were services that could be,and in the contemplation of the parties were to be,compensated in money he was to receive fifty thousand dollars in money from the estate of deceased if the latter performed his contract.an ordinary action at law for breach of the contract would bring him the very thing to which he is entitled under the allegations of his him full and adequate relief.in such an action the measure of damages would have been the value of the property agreed to be bequeathed,for that was the amount in which he was damaged by the breach 
it thus appears that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to entitle plaintiff to any relief,legal or equitable.it fails to show him entitled to any equitable relief for the reason we have just discussed.it fails to show him entitled to recover at law,in view of the want of an allegation showing presentation of his claim to the executors and judge for allowance.morrison,supra,cal.at.
morrison has withstood the test of time.in zellner wassman cal,zellner,the supreme court explained agreements to leave property by will often consist of promises to devise real property in return for peculiar personal services,or other consideration the fact remains,however,that,in actions upon these agreements,as in other actions upon contracts,inadequacy of the legal remedy to compensate for the breach is the keystone of equitable jurisdiction.since plaintiff relies upon an alleged contract to bequeath a specified sum of money,the case falls within the decision of this court in morrison land,cal,where it was said an ordinary action at law for breach of the contract would bring him the very thing to which he is entitled under the allegations of his complaint zellner,supra,cal.at.
in shive barrow d,division three of this district discussed the enforceability of contracts to make a will if there is a valid agreement to make a will and the agreement is fair and reasonable and adequately supported by consideration,equity will grant a sort of performance by making the party who receives the estate a constructive trustee for the intended beneficiary in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
though the estate may be probated and the property distributed accordingly,if there is a valid agreement to make a will which is certain and definite,and founded upon an adequate consideration,the court,in an action by the promisee,will impose a constructive trust upon any particular property in the hands of the individual distributee 
there is a long line of decisions in this state to the effect that the law gives plaintiffs an adequate remedy for breach of the agreement,or for the money advanced and for compensation for the services rendered,and that equity will not grant performance of the agreement when such remedies are available equity follows the law and,when the law determines the rights of the respective parties,a court of equity is without power to decree relief which the law denies where the law gives a party an adequate remedy by way of an action in damages for breach of contract,or for compensation for the services rendered under it,a court of equity may not grant specific performance of such a contract.shive barrow,supra,d at,citations omitted,citing morrison,supra,cal.at,accord,chahon schneider d,discussing morrison,supra,cal.
in thayer plymouth center,chrysler motors d,the court reversed a preliminary injunction,in part because an adequate remedy at be recovered in an action for breach of contract.id.at,citing morrison,supra,cal.at.in friedman friedman th,d,the court reached the same conclusion.id.at,d,citing morrison,supra,cal.at.and in the words of one court,the question in morrison was whether the plaintiff had to show inadequacy of the legal remedy in order to obtain specific performance.the answer was yes.walton walton th,d.
with the foregoing principles in mind,we turn to the facts of this case.we conclude that plaintiff had an adequate legal claim for he lost by failing to file a creditor claim in his grandmother probate proceeding.and because plaintiff had an adequate legal remedy,albeit not properly pursued,he can not obtain equitable relief in the form of performance of the march agreement.last,we discuss a line of cases that,according to plaintiff,permits performance even if an adequate legal remedy exists.we do not read the case law to say any such thing.
adequate legal remedy 
plaintiff case is predicated on his grandmother alleged breach of the march agreement,which required her to leave the family home to plaintiff father and his issue.plaintiff alleges that his grandmother breached the agreement by changing her will in january,leaving the property to his aunt.in,plaintiff and his aunt served as administrators for the purpose of selling the property,a transaction that plaintiff grandmother had started before her death.the property was sold and the proceeds were placed in a bank account.
as in morrison,supra,cal,a n ordinary action at law for breach of the contract would bring plaintiff the very thing to which he is entitled under the allegations of his complaint and would afford him full and adequate relief.id.at.the plaintiff in morrison sought based on the decedent alleged breach of a contract to bequeath that amount.here,plaintiff seeks a larger sum.but the bequest is money nonetheless.as in morrison,s urely there can be no doubt upon the question whether plaintiff had a full and adequate remedy at law.morrison,supra,cal.at,accord,zellner,supra,cal.at.consequently,we can not say that the legal remedy,an action for damages,is inadequate.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.equity.
creditor claim 
in an action at law for damages,the plaintiff is a creditor and must file his claim against the estate of the deceased promisor or be forever barred.chahon schneider,supra,d at.that includes an action for breach of contract based on an agreement to make a specific bequest in a will.see,et witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,wills and probate.
a party with a remedy at law against a decedent for breach of contract must proceed upon the theory that he or she is a creditor of the deceased,having a claim against the estate,and is subject to the provisions of the probate code requiring the presentation of claims to the executor or administrator.see,et morrison,supra,cal.at.in the absence of such presentation,an action on the contract is barred.see,subd.b morrison,supra,cal.at,venturi taylor,supra,th at,d.
p robate statutes generally require the filing of claims within a short time known as the nonclaim period.the purpose of the requirement is to give the representative an opportunity to ascertain speedily the obligations against the estate and the method of payment timely presentation is necessary before the representative is obligated or entitled to pay,and failure in this regard is an absolute bar to enforcement of the claim.witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,wills and probate,italics omitted.this rule is so fundamental that it applies at the pleading stage e ven if the complaint state s facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action at law for damages,it would still be insufficient because it does not allege that plaintiff presented a claim for damages against the estate of the deceased.chahon schneider,supra,d at.
although plaintiff filed a claim in the probate proceeding to recover sums he had paid his grandmother for her support and maintenance,he did not file a claim alleging breach of the march agreement.as a result,he can not maintain a civil action on the latter claim 
equitable remedy 
w here,as here,the primary right of a party is legal in its nature,as distinguished from equitable,and one for which the law affords some remedy,as here damages by way of compensation for breach of contract,a proper exercise of the equitable jurisdiction will not give equitable relief in any case where the legal remedy is full and adequate and does complete justice.morrison,supra,cal.at,italics in original accord,walton walton,supra,th at,d witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading.
e quity will not grant performance of an agreement when adequate legal remedies are available where the law gives a party an adequate remedy by way of an action in damages for breach of contract,a court of equity may not grant specific performance of such a contract.shive barrow,supra,d at,accord,chahon schneider,supra,d at.
i f the plaintiff cause of action is one for which the legal remedy of damages is generally deemed adequate,it does not become inadequate and justify a decree of specific performance merely because the legal remedy has been lost through neglect.witkin,cal.procedure,supra,pleading.it follows that the trial court erred in granting performance of the march agreement.
defendant representative capacity 
plaintiff argues that this action has merit because,unlike the breach of contract claim in the original complaint,which was brought against defendant in two capacities,as an individual and as administrator of the estate,the performance claim in the amended pleading was brought against defendant as an individual only.we do not see a meaningful distinction.neither did the trial court.
the judgment,though rendered on the basis of the amended complaint,expressly recognized defendant in both capacities.it directed her as an individual to hold in trust the proceeds from the sale of the real property.it directed her as administrator of the estate to deliver the proceeds to plaintiff in the separate probate proceeding estate
