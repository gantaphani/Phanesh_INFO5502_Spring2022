the plaintiff,nancy parker,appeals the district court order granting judgment as a matter of law under rule b to the defendant,general extrusions,on the plaintiff claim for punitive damages in relation to her title vii gender discrimination suit,which she brought pursuant to.the jury found for the plaintiff on her hostile working environment claim and,along with compensatory damages,awarded parker punitive damages.on motion of the defendant,however,the district court struck down the punitive damages award,holding that punitive damages were not available pursuant to a b because only one of the employees who discriminated against parker was a managerial agent of the defendant,this single employee did not act with the requisite malice or reckless indifference to justify punitive damages,and in any event,the defendant had made a good faith effort to comply with title vii,thereby insulating itself from punitive damages liability.the plaintiff appeals this ruling on all three grounds.for the reasons stated below,we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
from august until february,parker was employed by general extrusions as a shop worker on the night shift in the defendant fabrication department,which was responsible for creating aluminum parts by extruding,cutting to size or punching such products out of metal.the fabrication department was predominately male,with an average of five females employed in a department of approximately people.according to witnesses,a loose atmosphere pervaded the night shift in the fabrication department there was a tremendous amount of horseplay the workers as well as the management spoke freely in shop talk or locker room talk,meaning they used profanity including crude and vulgar terms and the male employees made sexual comments about and to female employees.
the plaintiff established that while working within this environment,she was subjected to pervasive sexual harassment from several.although she reported a number of these incidents of sexual harassment to her immediate supervisors,including foremen rob greenway,john alexander and steve kopkash,and,on occasion,to the human resources manager,terry maloney,the record demonstrates that her complaints were not adequately addressed.
for example,one of parker,justin,called parker a fucking whore and made vulgar comments about her sexual activities,implying that she was promiscuous.the plaintiff reported this incident to her supervisor,foreman steve kopkash,who replied that the comment could be considered a compliment.he did not report the incident to the human resources manager,terry maloney,in violation of the company sexual harassment policy.
the most severe and pervasive harassment came from another,eric rendes,who repeatedly referred to parker in derogatory terms such as whore,bitch,slut,and crybaby.these comments were at times made even in the presence of the foremen on duty,but rendes was not disciplined.on one occasion rendes typed fuck you on parker output card,and he repeatedly used vulgar language to tell the plaintiff,or tell others while the plaintiff was in earshot,about the sexual acts that he was going to perform on his girlfriend after work.on at least one occasion rendes made unsolicited comments to parker regarding sexual acts parker should perform in order to keep her husband.when the plaintiff asked rendes to stop this behavior,he told her that he liked to harass women and that he had been fired from a previous job for harassing women.
parker complained verbally to at least one foreman about rendes behavior,specifically about his vulgar language.rendes was subsequently called into the foreman office,told that parker was complaining about his language,and informed that parker was going to be reassigned so that she no longer worked with him.rendes did not,however,receive any discipline for his actions,and none of the foremen reported the incident to the human resources manager,terry maloney,again in violation of the company sexual harassment policy.in fact,rendes testified that the foremen generally hushed it up and tried to keep it in house when these kinds of complaints were brought to their attention.
even after she was reassigned,parker continued to have problems with rendes.he played tricks on her,such as hiding her work equipment.at one point,rendes purposefully blew metal saw chips in her direction and,on another occasion,threw large pieces of metal that she had to dodge in order to avoid being hit.one of the foremen,john alexander,observed the incident but did not discipline rendes for it.instead,he laughed and walked away.
the plaintiff testified that because she had not received an adequate response following her complaints to the foremen in her department,she went to terry maloney to discuss the situation.according to the plaintiff,she started to describe rendes reprehensible behavior toward her and indicated what rendes had told her about being fired from a previous job for harassing women.maloney allegedly cut her off,saying,that hearsay and i do want to hear it.as a result,parker felt that maloney had taken rendes side without hearing her out.she became upset,began crying,and asked for a shift change.it is unclear from the record before this court whether her request was honored.
at a later point,the plaintiff again had cause to complain about rendes,who had used the intercom system to make heavy breathing sounds obviously intended to be sexual in nature.the plaintiff felt that this behavior was directed at her,and she made a written complaint about it to terry maloney.as a result of this incident,rendes was called into a meeting with terry maloney,foremen steve kopkash and rob greenway,and a union representative.he was told that parker had accused him of sexual harassment and he replied that he would rather jack off than touch her.maloney reportedly chuckled at this comment,did not express disapproval of it,and then began discussing what action to take in response to the intercom incident.the discussion led to rendes being given a verbal warning for horseplay,but he was not disciplined for sexual harassment.when rendes later testified about this meeting,he expressed his view that the company wanted to get rid of both him and parker him because of his sexual harassment,and her because she complained about things,including sexual harassment.he also testified that there was some speculation during the meeting that parker was complaining in an effort to extort money from the company.
parker testified that the result of this meeting was humiliating for her,explaining that although she was led to believe that maloney would keep her complaint as confidential as possible,he loudly told her about the result of the meeting in a public work area where all her could hear it.moreover,soon after this incident,parker was assigned to work on a deburring machine,a job which was considered less desirable than most other jobs in the fabrication department.
at this point,parker also ran into trouble with another,eli rodriguez,who teased her by unplugging a fan she was using.when parker asked him to plug the fan back in,he screamed various derogatory terms at her,calling her,for example,a bitch.parker reported this incident to foreman kopkash and,because she was upset,apparently left work early.kopkash sent an to terry maloney indicating that rodriguez and parker had gotten into a fight,that he thought parker was just looking for a reason to go home early,and that he would make sure she was disciplined for absenteeism.rodriguez was not disciplined for the incident,even though he admitted using the language at issue he asserted that parker used similar language,which she denied.meanwhile,parker took sick leave necessitated by the stress created by the harassment.during this time,maloney assistant attempted to contact parker regarding the fan incident,but the assistant was rude and demanding in the messages she left,and parker did not reply because she did not feel mentally and emotionally able to do so.
by july,parker had contacted an attorney,who wrote a letter to the chairman of the board of general extrusions,herb schuler,outlining the harassment recounted above,as well as a number of other incidents.in response to the letter,a meeting was held in which parker,her attorney,board chairman schuler,and the company attorney were present.at the meeting schuler agreed that parker could report any further sexual harassment to him.after the meeting,terry maloney was instructed to and did investigate a number of the allegations made in the letter,although the company attorney instructed him to forgo at least one claim that a had put a frozen water bottle between parker legs.according to the defendant,other allegations were not investigated because specific names were not given or because the individual named was no longer employed at general extrusions.finally,the allegations concerning maloney failure to take parker complaints seriously were never investigated,apparently because no one other than maloney was assigned to oversee the investigation.
the final incident of harassment occurred sometime after this meeting and after the plaintiff returned from sick leave.while working on a machine that had a slow oil leak,parker asked a,bob montwori,to help her hang a cup on the machine to catch the oil.montwori response to the request was something to the effect of you want me to hang it on my cock a few days after this incident,parker presented to the foreman on duty,russell green,a written complaint detailing what had happened and asked him to sign it.harvey toy,a union representative,went with parker to present her written complaint to green.green told parker that he did not know how to deal with a sexual harassment claim,and green,parker and toy went to find maloney in his office,but he had already left for the day.at some point later that night,maloney became aware of the complaint through another,phoned in to the office,and spoke with green,montwori and toy.although montwori denied making the comment,toy told maloney that montwori had already admitted to him privately that he had made the comment.maloney instructed green to sign the complaint and said that he would return the next day,a saturday,to investigate further.
parker reported to work next day,but as the day proceeded maloney did not show up.eventually green phoned maloney to ask whether he was coming in,and maloney told green that he had car trouble and could not make it in that day.maloney later testified that he did not actually have car trouble but,upon reflection,thought it best to discuss the situation with the company attorney before proceeding further and therefore decided to wait until monday to take any action.when parker learned that maloney was not coming in to investigate she became distraught,ended up going on sick leave again,and finally decided to quit when her sick leave was over.
harvey toy,the union representative who had helped parker with the montwori complaint,testified on parker behalf at trial that at various times he had assisted parker in putting forward other complaints of sexual harassment at work.he also testified that at some point he spoke with maloney about parker complaints and that maloney had said,this is a environment.if she does like it here,she can go get a job somewhere else.toy added that at least one foreman had expressed a similar sentiment.he said that most of the time those to whom parker reported the harassment thought it was a joke.he also testified that his foreman whom he did not specifically name had told him to be careful in what he said and did in relation to his testimony in parker case and threatened to fire him as the result of any cooperation with the plaintiff litigation.
that litigation produced a jury verdict in the plaintiff favor,awarding in compensatory damages and in punitive damages.based on the defendant motion filed pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,the district court set aside the latter award,holding first,that the plaintiff allegations are insufficient to warrant an award of punitive damages because none of the employees who harassed parker was a managerial agent second,that the only managerial agent involved,maloney,may not have engaged in a fully effective investigation of parker complaints of harassment but that he took harassment complaints seriously and did not exhibit malice or reckless indifference to the plaintiff rights and,finally,that the company made a good faith effort to comply with title vii.
discussion 
without regard to the accuracy of the district court call on the first ground for overturning punitive damages,we think the legal analysis on the second and third bases is simply not supported by the evidence,as reflected in the jury verdict.it is for this reason that we have found it necessary to set out the facts at some length,although the summary in this opinion does nothing more than provide an idea of the abuse to which parker was subjected on the of the more salacious allegations have been omitted from our narrative.it is sufficient to note that the harassment was sufficiently continuous and serious enough to force parker to take two separate medical leaves of absence and,significantly,that it was still going on at the time she finally left the company for good,despite what the district court described as the defendant good faith effort to comply with title vii.we conclude that this sorry state of affairs must be laid at the feet of terry maloney,who managerial agent of general extrusions.
in reaching this conclusion,we recognize that we review de novo the district court grant of a rule b motion for judgement as a matter of law.in a federal question case,the standard of review for a rule motion based on sufficiency of the evidence is identical to that used by the district court.the evidence should not be weighed,and the credibility of the witnesses should not be questioned.the judgment of this court should not be substituted for that of the jury instead,the evidence should be viewed in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made,and that party given the benefit of all reasonable inferences.tisdale fed.express,cir.the rule b motion should be granted only if reasonable minds could not come to a conclusion other than one favoring the movant.id.
a title vii claimant is entitled to recover punitive damages only when she can demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer engaged in a discriminatory practice with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual.b.in kolstad american dental association,d,the court laid out a inquiry into determining whether punitive damages are proper under this standard.first,the plaintiff must show that the individuals perpetrating the discrimination acted with malice or reckless disregard as to whether the plaintiff federally protected rights were being violated.kolstad,at.to meet this standard,those individuals must at least discriminate in the face of a perceived risk that its actions will violate federal law.id.
