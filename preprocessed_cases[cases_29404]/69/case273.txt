appellants produced two copyrighted albums of music,each of which was composed of ten songs.appellee media right productions,media right gave the albums to appellee orchard enterprises,orchard,who copied and sold them without authorization.the court awarded appellants one statutory damage award for each album infringed by each appellee,a total of four awards,rather than one statutory damage award for each of the songs on the albums which would have totaled forty awards,as appellants had sought.the court also found that appellants had not proven that the infringement was willful,that orchard had proven that its infringement was innocent,and that profits from infringing sales were low the court thus awarded a total of only in damages.we conclude that the district court correctly awarded statutory damages for each album infringed did not commit clear error in finding that appellants had failed to prove willfulness and that orchard had proven its innocence and correctly calculated damages.we also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying attorneys fees.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
appellants anne bryant and ellen bernfeld are songwriters who own a record label,appellant gloryvision ltd collectively with bryant and bernfeld,appellants.in the late,appellants created and produced two albums,songs for dogs and songs for cats the albums.they registered the albums with the united states copyright office.they also separately registered at least some of the twenty songs on the albums.
on february,appellants entered into an agreement with media right media right agreement,which authorized media right to market the albums in exchange for twenty percent of the proceeds from any sales.the agreement did not grant media right permission to make copies of the albums.if media right needed more copies of the albums,appellants would provide them.
the media right agreement resulted from conversations between appellant ellen bernfeld bernfeld and appellee douglas maxwell maxwell,president of media right,during which maxwell told bernfeld that media right would be distributing music through orchard,a music wholesaler.
media right entered into an agreement with orchard on february,orchard agreement.the orchard agreement authorized orchard to distribute on media right behalf eleven albums listed in the agreement,two of which were the albums apparently in anticipation of the media right agreement.the orchard agreement provided,in relevant part,that 
media right grant s orchard rights to sell,distribute and otherwise exploit media right albums by any and all means and media whether now known or existing in the future,including throughout including those via the internet,as well as all digital storage,download and transmission rights,whether now known or existing in the future.
in the orchard agreement,media right warranted that orchard use of the albums would not infringe any copyrights.maxwell gave orchard physical copies of the albums,which bore copyright notices stating that the copyrights for the albums were held by appellants.
when media right entered into the orchard agreement in,orchard sold only physical copies of recordings.in about april,however,orchard began making digital copies of the albums to sell through music retailers such as itunes.internet customers were able to purchase and download digital copies of the albums and individual songs on the albums.orchard did not inform media right or appellants that it was selling digital copies of the albums and individual songs on the albums.
from april,to april,orchard generated in revenues from sales of physical copies of the albums,and from downloads of digital copies of the albums and of individual songs.media right share of these revenues was,of which should have been forwarded to appellants pursuant to the media right agreement.because the was aggregated with other monies orchard paid to media right,media right overlooked that it owed a portion of the payments to appellants.media right,therefore,did not pay appellants the to which they were entitled.
in,appellants discovered that digital copies of the albums were available online.on april,appellants filed a complaint against appellees in the southern district of new york,alleging direct and contributory copyright infringement,and seeking statutory damages.
in,appellants and appellees both moved for summary judgment in the case.they agreed to permit the district court to treat the motions as a case stated.the court conducted two evidentiary hearings before issuing its order.the court held,in relevant part,that appellees had committed direct copyright infringement by making and selling digital copies of the albums and the individual songs on the albums.
the court awarded appellants statutory damages in the total amount of,pursuant to section of the copyright act of the act.c.the act provides that a court can award statutory damages of not less than or more than,as the court considers just,for all infringements with respect to one work,and that all parts of a compilation constitute one work.c.if the infringer proves that his infringement was innocent,the court may reduce damages to an amount not less than.c.if the copyright holder proves that infringement was willful,the court may increase the award to no more than.id.
the district court made the following three rulings regarding damages,all of which appellants contest on appeal.
first,the court held that the albums were compilations,and thus that each appellee was liable for only one award of statutory damages per album,rather than one award per song,as appellants had sought.bryant europadisk,civ.wgy,wl.
second,the court found that orchard had proven that its infringement was innocent,and thus ordered orchard to pay only minimal statutory damages of per album,for a total of.id.at.
third,the court found that maxwell and media right had failed to prove that their infringement was innocent,but that appellants had failed to prove that maxwell and media right infringement was willful.id.the court found that because neither side had met its burden of proof,and because appellees revenues from the albums were very low,media right and maxwell were jointly and severally liable for an award of only per album,for a total of.id.
the court did not award appellants attorneys fees.dist.order,may.accordingly,the total award to appellants was.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
appellants argue that we should vacate the district court statutory damage award,contending that the court erred in refusing to grant a separate statutory damage award for each song on the albums the court erred in its findings on intent and the court erred in determining the amount of damages.appellants also argue that the court abused its discretion by refusing to award them attorneys fees.we address each of these arguments in turn 
a.the district court decision to award statutory damages on a basis 
appellants contend that the district court erred in holding that the albums were compilations,and thus limiting statutory damages to one award for each album.appellants argue that each song on the albums qualifies as a separate work because,according to appellants,each song is separately copyrighted and because orchard sold the songs individually.
the question of whether a work constitutes a compilation for the purposes of statutory damages pursuant to section c of the copyright act is a mixed question of law and fact.see gamma audio video,cir.we thus review de novo the district court decision that the albums are compilations.see apl.ptf blue water shipping,cir.we conclude that the district court ruling was correct.
the copyright act allows only one award of statutory damages for any work infringed.c.it states that all the parts of a compilation constitute one work.id.c.it defines a compilation as a work formed by the collection and assembling of preexisting materials or of data that are selected,coor
