in,the state of california established the supportive services ihss program to provide assistance and care to elderly and disabled persons who otherwise would be unable to remain safely in their homes.see cal.welf,a putative class comprised of recipients of the state ihss program and the unions who represent ihss providers,seek to enjoin state legislation that reduces the state contribution to wages paid to ihss providers because it is preempted by section a of the medicaid act.the district court issued a preliminary injunction.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
under title xix of the social security act the medicaid act,et,the federal government grants states funds to use towards programs that provide medical assistance to low income individuals to receive federal funds,states must administer their programs in compliance with individual state plans for medical assistance,which require approval by the federal secretary of health and human services.the california department of health care services department is designated the single state agency established or designated to administer or supervise the administration of the state plan.b.
ihss is one of the programs for which california receives federal funding under its version of medicaid,known as.operates via a prospective reimbursement system,whereby the state sets reimbursement rates for specific services,regardless of where those services are performed.orthopaedic,at.ihss recipients receive a host of supportive services,which make it possible for the recipient to establish and maintain an independent living arrangement.cal.welf.b.these services,which are provided in the beneficiary home,include assistance with ambulation,bathing,oral hygiene,grooming,dressing,bowel and bladder care,feeding,and of medications.id.b d.there are over ihss providers serving individuals in california percent of ihss recipients receive care from an ihss provider who is also a relative.in many cases,supportive services are provided by a parent,who is eligible to receive payment for caring for his or her child only upon leaving employment or if the parent is unable to obtain employment because no other suitable provider is available and the child would be left with inadequate care.see cal.welf.e.
the ihss program is paid for and administered through a combination of federal,state,and county funds.the state has authorized counties to provide for the delivery of ihss services by one of two methods first,a county may hire ihss providers directly or second,a county may contract with a nonprofit consortium npc or establish a public authority pa an entity separate from the county that performs public and essential governmental functions necessary to deliver ihss services.see cal.welf,a b.of the state counties have established a npc or.npcs and pas are considered employers of ihss providers for purposes of collective bargaining over wages,hours,and other terms and conditions of employment,although ihss recipients retain the right to hire,fire,and supervise the work of their individual ihss provider.id.c.
in counties that have established a npc or pa,wages and benefits are established through collective bargaining between the npc or pa and the providers union.cal.welf.c.before any increase in wages or benefits may take effect,it must be approved by the department,which determines whether the increase is consistent with federal law and ensures that federal financial participation is available.id.a.
for the ihss program,the california legislature has directed the department to establish a provider reimbursement rate methodology that is consistent with the functions and duties of npcs and pas m akes any additional expenditure of state general funds subject to appropriation in the annual budget act and p ermits funds to draw down federal financial participation consistent with federal law.id.j a i iii.in establishing its methodology,the department is also authorized to d eem the market rate for like work in each county to be the cap for increases in payment rates for individual practitioner services,and p rovide for consideration of county input concerning the rate necessary to ensure access to services in that county.id.j c.
following the passage of the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra,the federal government contributes approximately percent of the overall cost of the ihss program of the remaining share,the state contributes percent while the county contributes percent.cal.welf.b.however,the state contribution is subject to a statutory cap.prior to implementation of the statute at issue in this case,california welfare institutions code d effective july,the state contributed percent of the share up to per hour.id.c d.that statutory cap has increased over time,beginning at per hour in and reaching by way of four statutory increases.see id.d.
however,on february,the governor signed d into law.scheduled to take effect july,d reduces the statutory maximum for which the state would contribute its proportionate share for ihss wages and benefits from per hour to per hour.in other words,the state maximum contribution to wages and benefits would be reduced from percent of the share of an hourly rate up to to percent of the share of an hourly rate up to.
the new law does not require counties to reduce wages and benefits paid to ihss service providers.counties are permitted to make up the difference between the state current contribution and any reduction that may result from the state decreased contribution.currently,of the npcs and pas pay ihss providers per hour or less in wages and benefits,so there would be no reduction in the state contribution in any of those counties,including los angeles county in which percent of all ihss services are provided.counties are,however,directly affected by the rate change.according to plaintiffs,in response to d,fourteen of those counties that were paying wages and benefits of more than per hour have thus far submitted rate change requests to the department of social services dss,seeking to reduce wages effective july,all of these rate change requests were approved by dss and the department.
on may,plaintiffs brought this action challenging d under the supremacy clause,claiming that in enacting and implementing d,the state failed to comply with the procedural and substantive requirements of a a hereafter a after noting that the state conceded that the legislature did not consider the a factors prior to adopting d,the district court granted the preliminary injunction.defendants appealed.

likelihood of success on the merits 
section a provides that a state plan must provide such methods and procedures relating to the payment for care and services as may be necessary to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care.a a hereafter a.in orthopaedic,we held that a requires 
the director to set hospital outpatient reimbursement rates that bear a reasonable relationship to efficient and economical hospitals costs of providing quality services,unless the department shows some justification for rates that substantially deviate from such costs.to do this,the department must rely on responsible cost studies,its own or others,that provide reliable data as a basis for its rate setting.
at.the principal issue in this appeal is whether the district court erred in holding that orthopaedic applies to the state enactment of california welfare institutions code d.
as we will explain,both the legislature and the department recognize that reimbursement is,providers wages and directly correlated to ensuring that services are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care,and sufficient to ensure access to services under the ihss program.following passage of d,counties,unsurprisingly,reduced the hourly wage paid to ihss providers.as we explained in orthopaedic,payments for services must be consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care,and those payments must be sufficient to enlist enough providers to provide access to medicaid recipients.at.because section d directly affects what providers are paid for providing services,it falls within a.thus,we hold that before enacting legislation that has the effect of lowering payments to,d the state must study the impact of that decision on the statutory factors set forth in a.see california pharmacists ii,slip op.at.
a.the application of a to cal.welf.d 
the state argues that orthopaedic does not apply to d because that section does not set medical reimbursement rates.according to the state,orthopaedic is concerned with ensuring that the state follows adequate procedures to assure that reimbursement rates are consistent with the statutory factors set forth in a efficiency,economy,access,and quality of care.however,d neither sets rates,nor changes the procedure in place,the collective bargaining process,to ensure that wages and benefits paid to ihss providers are consistent with those statutory factors.rather,d merely lowers the state contribution toward wages and benefits set by the counties pursuant to collective bargaining.
we are not persuaded by the state attempt to distinguish its rate of reimbursement to providers from its contribution to the amount counties pay providers in the ihss context.the state claims that it has removed itself from the process and left it up to the counties and providers to negotiate rates through collective bargaining.however,by limiting its contribution to its portion of the share,the state injects itself into the collective bargaining process.indeed,the statutory cap that the state sets on its contribution provides a powerful bargaining chip to both providers and npcs or pas during negotiations over wages and benefits.prior to d,providers could seek hourly wages and benefits up to knowing that counties would have to contribute just percent of their share.after the passage of the current d,providers confront the reality that any hourly wage above would be borne entirely by the county.
similarly,the state argues that the collective bargaining process is an adequate procedure under orthopaedic to assure that rates are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care,and sufficient to ensure access.that may be true,though we note that nothing in the record demonstrates that the department has conducted any analysis or study regarding the effect of the collectively bargained rates on the statutory factors.but,in any event,plaintiffs are not challenging those collectively bargained rates,nor are they challenging the collective bargaining process as a method of establishing rates.rather,they are challenging the procedural adequacy of the legislature decision to decrease its funding of those rates.as we have explained,decreasing the amount the state contributes to those rates is as integral to the collective bargaining process as the negotiations themselves,because it directly impacts the amount at which rates will ultimately be set.
the record proves the point in this case.approximately fourteen counties submitted rate change requests after receiving notice of d.at least two of those rate change requests expressly state that the decision to reduce the hourly wage for ihss providers is due to the change in the state participation rate,effective july.these changes demonstrate that the amount the state determines it will contribute to ihss providers wages and benefits alters the amount counties are willing to pay ihss providers for their that the state itself recognized as impacting ihss recipients access to services.see cal.welf.j c 
the department itself has acknowledged the relationship between reimbursement rates and access to supportive services.in the state plan,the department has articulated its policy that reimbursement rates for personal care services shall not be less than levels necessary to achieve adequate access to these services,but shall not exceed the lesser of specified limits,consistent with the requirements of a.the state plan also provides that t o the extent that the department finds that sufficient access to services is available,any rate increases granted under this program shall be no greater than the funds appropriated by the legislature for such purpose.emphasis added.the department has thus recognized that rate increases are subject to the availability of state funds and has expressly conditioned its approval over such increases on a finding that sufficient access to services is otherwise available.the corollary must also be true.that is,the same oversight exists for any decrease in rates brought about by the availability of state funds.the department is thus well aware that prior to approving reimbursement rates established through collective bargaining,it must determine whether sufficient access to services is available.orthopaedic,at rejecting the state argument that it does not have to pay the costs associated with quality of care because hospitals are required to provide such care as a result of contractual obligations and licensing requirements.
likewise,the department has recognized the direct link between the state change in contribution rate and the resulting change in reimbursement rates.in april,the department sent the united states department of health and human services hhs an analysis of d,providing its arguments as to why d did not violate newly enacted requirements of arra.that analysis explained the reduction in the state contribution under d,including that funding has been reduced so that the maximum wage participation level will be per hour starting july.as a result,the state conditional approvals of the pa rates are no longer effective and each of the counties in question will need to request the state approval of another pa rate if in connection with that a county then chooses to negotiate different wages in excess of the maximum wage participation level,it will be doing so voluntarily and not because of any state requirements.thus,the state explicitly invalidated its prior approval of pa rates,previously negotiated via collective bargaining,as a result of d.
in any event,the state obligation to consider whether providers payments are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care,a,is independent of whatever wages and benefits are set pursuant to collective bargaining.notably,in concluding that d did not render the state ineligible for increased funding under arra,hhs advised the state that if the department were to approve provider wage rates at a level less than that recommended by the county,the state would
