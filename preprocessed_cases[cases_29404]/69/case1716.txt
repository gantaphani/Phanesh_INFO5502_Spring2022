introduction 
attorneys for a consumer served on a company a notice required for damages under the consumer legal remedies act,civil code section et.clra,setting forth alleged violations of the clra and demanding action.the company then brought a declaratory relief action against the consumer and her attorneys seeking a declaration that it had not violated the clra.the consumer and the attorneys moved to strike the complaint under code of civil procedure section statute,which motions the trial court granted.in affirming,we hold that the declaratory relief action is subject to the statute as it arose out of protected activity provided by that statute,and that the trial court properly granted the special motions to strike because the company declaratory relief action had no probability of success.in this connection,we hold that under the reasoning of filarsky superior court cal th filarsky,a potential defendant in a clra damages action after receiving the statutory notice may not maintain a declaratory relief action to establish that there was no violation of the clra.we therefore affirm the order striking the complaint.we also affirm the award of attorney fees.
factual and procedural background 
laura nunez nunez retained two law firms,newport trial group newport and wasserman,comden,casselman esensten,lpp wasserman to represent her in an anticipated consumer class action under the clra.newport served lunada biomedical plaintiff with a one page notice and demand,pursuant to civil code section of the clra clra notice,via certified mail,return receipt requested,contending that plaintiff dietary supplement,amberen,was being marketed falsely and misleadingly as a natural remedy for menopausal symptom relief,in violation of the clra.the clra notice was served on behalf of an unnamed californian individual and a class of similarly situated persons.it requested that plaintiff irrevocably stop all false,misleading,unsubstantiated advertising and labeling claims,and provide all consumers who have purchased amberen with a full refund.plaintiff counsel responded by letter to the clra notice,denying its contentions,and claiming in detail that scientific evidence supported plaintiff advertising claims concerning amberen.
thereafter,plaintiff counsel sent an to wasserman confirming their telephone conversation that occurred a few days previously,stating that he disagreed with wasserman claims for the reasons set forth in plaintiff earlier reply letter,and stating,a s i mentioned,i almost always consider settlement issues before litigation,so i asked you to propose a settlement offer there no rush,we can talk whenever you are ready.later that afternoon,an attorney from wasserman sent an to plaintiff counsel,stating,given the upcoming holidays,i have not had a chance to talk to all interested parties,much less put together a settlement offer.the also stated that wasserman needed information regarding the sale of amberen before it could propose a settlement demand,but that it would provide plaintiff counsel with an outline of the injunctive relief concerning labeling and advertising changes that we would demand as part of any settlement.
a little over a month later,the attorney from wasserman sent an page letter to plaintiff counsel via and united states mail thanking him for responding to our clra notice on behalf of our client,nunez regarding her potential class action claims related to amberen the letter stated,in accordance with our november telephone conversation and subsequent email communications,this letter will discuss possible ways to resolve the current dispute concerning our client false and misleading advertising claims against plaintiff.i will not attempt to further address the merits of nunez claims in this letter.instead,i will simply outline briefly potential settlement approaches and structures.it set forth possible alternative settlement structures,and detailed matters subject to injunctive relief consisting of proposed advertising and marketing modifications.the proposed advertising and marketing modifications were matters that,according to wasserman,plaintiff should permanently cease from representing to current and potential purchasers of amberen,delete from all amberen advertising and labeling,and include in all future amberen advertising and labeling.
within two weeks,plaintiff filed a complaint alleging a single cause of action for declaratory relief against defendants.plaintiff sought a determination regarding the accuracy and legality of plaintiff advertising of amberen.plaintiff alleged in its complaint that t his action is being filed because defendants threaten to file a lawsuit claiming that plaintiff advertising violates california consumer protection statutes,including the clra.however,defendants threatened suit lacks any basis plaintiff alleged in the complaint that t his dispute was originally raised in a clra notice claiming that plaintiff advertising for amberen supposedly violated the clra plaintiff also referred to in the complaint various additional communications the parties had regarding settlement,including wasserman letter.plaintiff also included in the complaint responses to the matters contained in wasserman letter.
nunez and newport filed an motion,in which wasserman joined.the motions were made on the grounds that plaintiff claim arose from protected activity defendants clra n otice regarding plaintiff deceptive advertising claims about its product amberen,and related settlement communications and plaintiff could not establish a probability of prevailing on its claim.
plaintiff opposed defendants motions.in support of that opposition,plaintiff provided substantial evidence in support of its contention that its advertising of amberen was not false and misleading.specifically,plaintiff submitted declarations attaching plaintiff counsel letter setting forth scientific evidence that supported plaintiff advertising claims concerning amberen and declarations of a professor in biology from the department of life sciences at santa monica college and of a deputy director and head of the laboratory of the institute of theoretical and experimental biophysics of the russian academy of science,both of which declarations asserted in detail that scientific evidence supported plaintiff advertising claims concerning amberen.defendants objected to plaintiff evidence 
the trial court issued a tentative ruling granting the special motions to strike the complaint,finding that defendants met their burden that plaintiff claim arose from protected activity plaintiff could not establish a probability of prevailing on its declaratory relief claim because defendants notification letter were absolutely privileged by the litigation privilege of civil code section and in the absence of the notification letter,plaintiff has no evidence that an actual controversy exists between it and defendants at the conclusion of the hearing on defendants motions,the trial court adopted its tentative ruling as its final ruling.
defendants filed motions to recover their attorney fees under section,subdivision c.the trial court awarded in attorney fees to nunez and newport,and in attorney fees to wasserman.plaintiff appeals from the orders granting the special motions to strike and awarding attorney fees,asserting that the statute did not apply to its declaratory relief claim and challenging the amount of the attorney fees award.
discussion 
anti slapp motion.legal principlesa anti slapp statute and standard of review 
section provides that a cause of action arising from a defendant conduct in furtherance of constitutionally protected rights of free speech or petitioning may be stricken unless the plaintiff has a probability of prevailing on the merits,subd.b.in ruling on a special motion to strike under section,the trial court employs a analysis.initially,under the first prong,the trial court determines whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity if the court finds such a showing has been made,it then determines under the second prong whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.citation.jarrow formulas,lamarche cal th.
to satisfy the second prong the probability of prevailing the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is legally sufficient and supported by a prima facie showing of facts to support a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is accepted.the trial court considers the pleadings and evidentiary submissions of both the plaintiff and the defendant.although the court does not weigh the credibility or comparative probative strength of competing evidence,it should grant the motion if,as a matter of law,the defendant evidence supporting the motion defeats the plaintiff attempt to establish evidentiary support for the claim.citation.wilson parker,covert chidester cal th,d,superseded by statute on other grounds as noted in hutton hafif th,d.cole patricia meyer associates,apc th,cole.the standard for determining the merits of a defendant special motion to strike a complaint is similar to that for determining the merits of a defendant motion for summary judgment.both seek to determine whether a prima facie case has been presented by the plaintiff in opposing the motions.bergman drum th,see weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group,ii the probability of prevailing is tested by the same standard governing a motion for summary judgment,nonsuit,or directed verdict.if a plaintiff sets forth a prima facie case in opposition to such motions,the motions must be denied.

the clra purposes are to protect consumers against unfair and deceptive business practices and to provide efficient and economical procedures to secure such protection.civil code section,subdivision a of the clra states that a ny consumer who suffers any damage as a result of the use or employment by any person of a method,act,or practice declared to be unlawful by section may bring an action against that person to recover or obtain any of the following actual damages,but in no case shall the total award of damages in a class action be less than one thousand dollars.an order enjoining the methods,acts,or practices.restitution of property.punitive damages.any other relief that the court deems proper.a consumer is defined in civil code section,subdivision d,part of the clra,as an individual who seeks or acquires,by purchase or lease,any goods or services for personal,family,or household purposes.the court shall award court costs and attorney fees to a prevailing plaintiff in litigation filed pursuant to this section.reasonable attorney fees may be awarded to a prevailing defendant upon a finding by the court that the plaintiff prosecution of the action was not in good faith,subd.e.civil code section provides that the consumer may maintain a class action under the clra.
civil code section,subdivision a of the clra,states,inter alia,that t he following unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices undertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer are unlawful representing that goods or services have characteristics,uses,or benefits which they do not have representing that goods or services are of a particular standard,quality,or grade,or that goods are of a particular style or model,if they are of another.advertising goods or services with intent not to sell them as advertised.
civil code section,subdivision a of the clra requires a notice and demand as a prerequisite for a legal action for damages.that section provides,thirty days or more prior to the commencement of an action for damages pursuant to this title,the consumer shall do the following notify the person alleged to have employed or committed methods,acts,or practices declared unlawful by section of the particular alleged violations of section.demand that the person correct,repair,replace,or otherwise rectify the goods or services alleged to be in violation of section.the notice shall be in writing and shall be sent by certified or registered mail,return receipt requested,to the place where the transaction occurred or to the person principal place of business within california.damages are not awardable under the clra if the defendant proves its violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error despite reasonable procedures to avoid such an error,and remedies the violating goods or services.
civil code section of the clra provides,the provisions of this title are not exclusive.the remedies provided herein for violation of any section of this title or for conduct proscribed by any section of this title shall be in addition to any other procedures or remedies for any violation or conduct provided for in any other law.the clra is a nonexclusive statutory remedy for unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices undertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer citation.citation.wang massey chevrolet th.civil code section of the clra provides,any waiver by a consumer of the provisions of this title is contrary to public policy and shall be unenforceable and void.
a arising from protected activity under the anti slapp statute 
plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in granting defendants special motions to strike its declaratory relief claim because it did not arise from a protected activity,the clra notice and correspondence,but rather from a dispute as to whether plaintiff violated the clra.according to plaintiff,the clra notice and correspondence were just evidence of the dispute.we disagree.
plaintiff declaratory relief action refers extensively to the clra notice and wasserman letter.section defines an act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue and includes statements or writings made in judicial proceedings or made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a judicial body,subd.b see,subd.e.correspondence made in anticipation of litigation contemplated in good faith and under serious consideration can be a petitioning activity protected by the statute.neville chudacoff th.thus,statements,writings,and pleadings in connection with civil litigation or in contemplation of civil litigation are covered by the statute,and that statute does not require any showing that the litigated matter concerns a matter of public interest.rohde wolf th.
the parties do not dispute that the clra notice and wasserman letter are protected activities and therefore subject to an motion.prelitigation letters demanding that a party cease from doing certain acts or be subject to a lawsuit based on that conduct are in preparation or anticipation of litigation and fall within the protection of section,subdivision e as written or oral statement s or writing s made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a judicial body gotterba travolta,supra,th at.for example,s ervice of a notice to quit is a protected activity within the meaning of section because service of the notice is legally required to file an unlawful detainer action.copenbarger morris cerullo world evangelism th,see feldman park lane associates th.
it is true that even when a party activities constitute act s in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech,it does not follow that any claims associated with those activities are subject to the statute.kolar donahue,mcintosh hammerton th.t he mere fact that an action was filed after protected activity took place does not mean the action arose from that activity for the purposes of the statute.citation.moreover,that a cause of action arguably may have been triggered by protected activity does not entail that it is one arising from such.citation.episcopal church cases cal th,see copenbarger morris cerullo world evangelism,supra,th at t he pivotal distinction is whether an actual or contemplated unlawful detainer action by a landlord unquestionably a protected petitioning activity merely preceded or triggered the tenant lawsuit,or whether it was instead the basis or cause of that suit.
in general,whether a cause of action is subject to a motion to strike under the slapp statute turns on whether the gravamen of the cause of action targets protected activity.citation.where a cause of action is based on both protected activity and unprotected activity,it is subject to section unless the protected conduct is merely incidental to the unprotected conduct.citations.haight ashbury free clinics,happening house venture s th.
here,the correspondence clearly arose in connection with the litigation that was contemplated or under serious consideration.indeed,the clra notice was required under the clra before an action for damages could be filed and thus is part of the litigation process.but for the clra notice and demand letters,there would be no dispute.in order to satisfy the first prong,the challenged action must arise from the protected activity.equilon enterprises,llc consumer cause,supra,cal th at.in construing the statute broadly,as we must do id.at,fn,we believe that the clra notice and correspondence not only preceded and triggered the declaratory relief action,but they were also the basis of the cause of the action.the declaratory relief action therefore arose out of those communications,which are protected activities.
in cke restaurants,moore th,the plaintiff commenced its declaratory relief action in response to a notice that the defendant had served on it pursuant to proposition.id.at.in the defendant proposition notice,she claimed that the plaintiff served french fries that contained naphthalene,which is known to cause cancer and reproductive toxicity.id.at,fn.in its opposition to the defendant motion,the plaintiff claimed that its lawsuit did not arise from the sending of the notices,but from the underlying issues raised in the defendant letters namely the rights and obligations of cke regarding its french fries and other food products under proposition id.at.
the court in cke restaurants,moore,supra,th,rejected plaintiff contention that the lawsuit did not arise from the sending of the proposition notice.id.at.in upholding the trial court order granting the defendant motion,the court stated,in its complaint,the plaintiff directly challenged the merits of the day notice by referring to and quoting from the day notice.the plaintiff requested a judicial determination that its food products complied with proposition.instead of using the day period to avoid litigation,the plaintiff used it to commence litigation.moreover,the plaintiff threatened to sue the defendants unless they withdrew their notice.the plaintiff actions arose entirely from the filing of the proposition notice.the trial court recognized this,stating,without the notice,there would have been no actual,present controversy,and no controversy at all.id.at.
although here the record does not provide that plaintiff threatened to sue defendants unless they withdrew the clra notice,plaintiff alleged in its complaint,this action is being filed because defendants threaten to file a lawsuit claiming that plaintiff advertising violates california consumer protection statutes,including the clra.plaintiff referred to the clra notice in the complaint,alleging,this dispute was originally raised in clra notice claiming that plaintiff advertising for amberen supposedly violated the clra in its complaint,plaintiff also referred to various additional communications the parties had regarding settlement,including wasserman letter,and in the complaint plaintiff responded specifically to numerous matters contained in wasserman letter.therefore,the declaratory relief action arose from defendants protected activities,without which there would have been no dispute.
in country side villas homeowners ivie th,a member of a homeowners association criticized the association management for its handling of maintenance issues,suggested that its board be recalled,and requested copies of its income and expense reports.id.at.the homeowners association filed an action for declaratory relief against the association member,seeking among other things,a determination that its allocation of funds was consistent with the association governing documents.id.at.
in affirming the trial court grant of the motion of the association member,the court held that the declaratory relief action arose from a protected activity,stating,t he action in this case was filed after the homeowners association counsel threatened to sue the association member if she continued to request the financial documents and refuse to sign the confidentiality agreement.the association member did refuse to sign the agreement,and continued to speak out against the homeowners association.in response,the homeowners association filed suit against her seeking declaratory relief and attorney fees.it is clear from the evidence that the action in this case arose from the association member exercise of her right of free speech in criticizing and speaking out against the action of the homeowners association board.country side villas homeowners ivie,supra,th at.
here,similar to side villas homeowners ivie,supra,th,defendants notified plaintiff that it was engaging in conduct that the defendants believed violated the clra.in response,plaintiff filed an action against the defendants for declaratory relief.plaintiff complaint requested attorney fees against defendants,and plaintiff alleged,this action is being filed because defendants threaten to file a lawsuit claiming that plaintiff advertising violates the clra.
plaintiff relies on city of cotati cashman cal th in contending that its declaratory relief action did not arise from defendants protected activities,but that case is distinguishable.there,owners of mobile home parks brought a declaratory relief action against the city in federal court seeking a judicial determination that the city rent control ordinance constituted an unconstitutional taking.id.at.in response,the city sued the park owners in state court,requesting a declaration the rent control ordinance was constitutional,valid,and enforceable.id.at.the city concede d that its purpose in filing the state court action was to gain a more favorable forum in which to litigate the constitutionality of its mobilehome park rent stabilization ordinance,and that in filing the state court action it intended subsequently to seek to persuade the federal court to abstain from hearing the mobile home park owners suit.id.at.
the supreme court rejected the argument that the filing of the state court action arose from the mobile home park owners filing of their earlier federal action and,therefore,fell within the ambit of the statute.city of cotati cashman,supra,cal th at.the supreme court explained that although i t is indisputably true the c ity action was filed shortly after the mobile home park owners filed their claim in federal court,the mere fact an action was filed after protected activity took place does not mean it arose from that activity.id.at.instead,because the fundamental basis for the city request for relief was the underlying controversy respecting the rental control ordinance,the city lawsuit therefore was not one arising from the mobile home park owners federal suit and was not subject to a special motion to strike.id.at.
although plaintiff declaratory relief action here filed after defendant protected activities does not necessarily establish that the lawsuit arose out of the protected activities,that is not the only factor.as noted above,the complaint refers extensively to the protected activities.and,unlike in city of cotati cashman,supra,cal th,in which the protected activity amounted only to a prior lawsuit,the protected activities here included a clra notice,without which there would be no controversy.cke restaurants,moore,supra,th at.unlike the state court declaratory relief complaint in city of cotati cashman,supra,cal th,the declaratory relief complaint arose from defendants protected activities.
in gotterba travolta,supra,th,the court held,as plaintiff argues here,that a declaratory relief complaint did not arise out of the defendant protected activities,but the protected activities were merely evidence of the parties dispute.in that case,the defendants counsel sent to the plaintiff a letter demanding that he stop making statements that were allegedly in breach of a confidentiality agreement.the letter stated that the statements subjected the plaintiff to enormous liability and entitle d my client to seek tens of millions of dollars in compensatory and punitive damages,and that the plaintiff was to proceed at his peril.id.at.the plaintiff filed an action for declaratory relief,seeking a declaration that the confidentially agreement was unenforceable.the plaintiff alleged that a judicial declaration is necessary so that he may determine his rights and duties under the agreement and because the defendants ha d repeatedly threatened legal action against him based upon alleged violations and prospective violations of the purported confidentiality agreement.gotterba travolta,supra,th at.the defendants filed an motion to strike the declaratory relief action,asserting that the plaintiff filed this action to prevent the defendants from exercising their right to send prelitigation demand letters suing to enforce the terms of a prior agreement.id.at.
in affirming the trial court order denying the motion,the court stated,contrary to the defendants position and arguments,the plaintiff complaint is not based upon the defendants demand letters.the complaint seeks declaratory relief regarding the validity of the asserted termination agreements and not the propriety of the defendants demand letters.the demand letters do not form the actual controversy upon which to base the claim for declaratory relief,but are merely evidence that a controversy between the parties exists.citation.that protected activity may lurk in the background and may explain why the rift between the parties arose in the first place does not transform a contract dispute into a slapp suit.citation.the lawsuit also does not seek to curtail the defendants right to send demand letters.gotterba travolta,supra,th at.
here,the protected activities include defendants sending of the clra notice.it is not merely evidence of the dispute.the usual demand letters involving liability are not a prerequisite to filing a lawsuit seeking damages.by contrast,the clra notice here was required to be sent by the consumer before the consumer could file a lawsuit for damages under the clra.unlike a demand letter,therefore,the clra notice was part of the litigation process.indeed,without the clra notice,there would have been no actual,present controversy,and no controversy at all.cke restaurants,moore,supra,th at.
in copenbarger morris cerullo world evangelism,supra,th,a sublessee of a real property lease filed a lawsuit for,inter alia,declaratory relief against the sublessor after the sublessor served on the sublessee a day notice to cure certain maintenance and other related defaults under the related lease agreements,and a notice required for an unlawful detainer action.id.at.the sublessee alleged that a controversy existed among the parties concerning their respective rights and duties arising under the lease agreements and a quitclaim deed,that it had no duty to repair the improvements to the property,that the day notice and the notice were premature and did not comply with the lease agreements,and that it was the owner of the improvements to the property.id.at.in reversing the trial court order granting the sublessor motion,the court held that,while the notice might have triggered the declaratory relief complaint,the evidence in the record demonstrates the complaint was based on an underlying dispute over sublessee repair and maintenance obligations under the sublease and other unprotected activities.id.at.in reaching its conclusion,the court emphasized that,t he mere fact that an action was filed after protected activity took place does not mean the action arose from that activity for the purposes of the statute.citation.id.at.the court concluded that the day notice and the sublessee letter in response constituted evidence that there was a dispute between the parties.id.at.
copenbarger morris cerullo world evangelism,supra,th is distinguishable.in that case,presumably the dispute between the parties arose before the day notice.here,the clra notice created the disputes between the parties.also,unlike in that case,plaintiff here specifically alleged in the declaratory relief action that it was being filed because defendants threatened to file a lawsuit claiming that plaintiff advertising violates california consumer protection statutes,including the clra.and,as noted above,the complaint extensively refers to the protected activities the clra notice and related correspondence.thus,the declaratory relief action arose from the protected activities 
as to the law firm defendants,the conclusion that the declaratory relief action arose from defendants protected activities is even more compelling than it is for nunez.an attorney has standing to bring a special motion to strike a cause of action arising from petitioning activity undertaken on behalf of the attorney client.rusheen cohen cal th,neville chudacoff,supra,th at,fn.the declaratory relief complaint here alleged that a dispute existed because defendants wrongfully asserted that plaintiff advertising was in violation of the clra.because the law firm defendants are not consumers under the clra,they are unable to sue under the clra.there is,therefore,no actual controversy between them and plaintiff concerning any alleged violations of the clra.any argument by plaintiff that the clra notice and wasserman letter would be evidence that a controversy exists between it and the law firm defendants is unavailing.
b probability of plaintiff prevailing on the declaratory relief claim 
plaintiff contends that it demonstrated a probability of prevailing on its declaratory relief claim.we disagree.
to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the merits,the plaintiff must show that the complaint is legally sufficient and must present a prima facie showing of facts that,if believed by the trier of fact,would support a judgment in the plaintiff favor.citations.the plaintiff showing of facts must consist of evidence that would be admissible at trial.citation.hall time warner,th,see college hospital,superior court cal th,fn.contacts,steinberg th.
as noted,a n motion may lie against a complaint for declaratory relief citation citation.moreover,the mere existence of a controversy is insufficient to overcome an motion against a claim for declaratory relief.to defeat an motion,the plaintiff must also make a prima facie evidentiary showing to sustain a judgment in the plaintiff favor.citation.in other words,for a declaratory relief action to survive an motion,the plaintiff must introduce substantial evidence that would support a judgment of relief made in the plaintiff favor.citations.mission springs water dist.verjil,supra,th at.
defendants contend,and the trial court found,that the litigation privilege precludes plaintiff claim for declaratory relief.that privilege does not.
the litigation privilege is set forth in civil code section,subdivision b,which section provides,in pertinent part a privileged publication or broadcast is one made b in any legislative proceeding,judicial proceeding,in any other official proceeding authorized by law,or in the initiation or course of any other proceeding authorized by law and reviewable pursuant to chapter commencing with section of title of part of the code of civil procedure,the litigation privilege applies to bar tort actions based on privileged communications,excepting only the tort of malicious prosecution.citation.mcclintock west th,italics added see hagberg california federal bank cal th.t he litigation privilege shields a person from liability based on the communication.buchanan maxfield enterprises,th,citing williams taylor d,italics added.plaintiff complaint for declaratory relief does not seek to hold defendants liable for a tort based on the clra notice or any other communication.plaintiff instead seeks a declaration regarding the accuracy and legality of plaintiff advertising of amberen.thus,the litigation privilege does not apply.
we can decide a matter on grounds different than that invoked by the trial court.a reviewing court will uphold a judgment if it is correct for any reason regardless of the correctness of its grounds citation.it is judicial action and not judicial reasoning which is the subject of review citation.people ex rel.gallo acuna cal th,fn.plaintiff can not demonstrate a probability of prevailing on its declaratory relief claim because it may not sue for declaratory relief regarding a claim for damages under the clra.
defendants rely on filarsky,supra,cal th,in which a city,after refusing to disclose to a requesting citizen certain documents under the california public records act,et,sought declaratory relief as to the propriety of its refusal.filarsky,supra,cal th at.in directing the court of appeal to issue a writ of mandate compelling the trial court to vacate its order granting declaratory relief and to enter an order sustaining the citizen demurrer to the complaint,the supreme court stated,t here are at least four important distinctions between proceedings arising under the california public records act and ordinary declaratory relief actions.first,under the california public records act,only a person seeking disclosure not the public agency in possession of the records may seek a judicial declaration regarding the agency obligation to disclose a document.in an ordinary declaratory relief action,however,either party to a controversy may initiate the action.second,in a proceeding under the california public records act,the court must schedule the filing of responsive pleadings and hearings in order to reach a decision as soon as possible.such a requirement is not imposed upon courts in an ordinary declaratory relief action.third,if a person initiates a proceeding under the california public records act,he or she must be awarded attorney fees and costs if he or she prevails,and the defendant public agency can not recover fees or costs unless the proceeding is frivolous.in contrast,in a declaratory relief action,a member of the public seeking disclosure can not recover attorney fees if he or she prevails,and a prevailing public agency may recover costs even if the individual request for disclosure is not frivolous.fourth,appellate review of the superior court ruling in a proceeding under the california public records act must be by a petition for writ of mandate filed no more than days after notice of the ruling.on the other hand,a public agency may appeal from a declaratory judgment requiring disclosure of the records,thus delaying disclosure for a significant period of time.these distinctions establish that permitting a public agency to file a preemptive declaratory relief action to determine its obligation to disclose records to a member of the public would eliminate important incentives and protections for individuals requesting public records.members of the public could be discouraged from requesting records,because a simple request for disclosure and a denial by the public agency could require the individual to defend a civil action in which he or she would be liable for costs if the agency prevailed,and in which the individual would not recoup attorney fees if he or she succeeded.id.at.
plaintiff cites baxter healthcare denton th baxter,which concerned the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of proposition health and,through.in that case,the plaintiff manufactured medical devices that contained a chemical compound that caused liver cancer in rats and mice and was on proposition list of chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.baxter,supra,th at.the office of environmental health hazard assessment oehha,the lead agency charged with implementing proposition,denied the plaintiff administrative petition for a declaration that the plaintiff did not have to provide the consumers with warnings under proposition regarding its medical devices.id.at.the plaintiff filed a complaint against the oehha stating a single cause of action for declaratory relief,in which complaint the plaintiff sought a determination that the chemical compound posed no significant risk of cancer to humans,and therefore no cancer warning was required under proposition.id.at.the trial court granted declaratory relief in the plaintiff favor.id.at.
in affirming the judgment,the court in baxter,supra,th at page held that oehha has failed to establish that proposition does not allow a business to bring a declaratory relief action under code of civil procedure section for the purpose of determining whether the business is exempted from the warning requirement of proposition.the court reasoned that the provisions of proposition do not share the characteristics of the provisions of the california public records act involved in filarsky,supra,cal th,in which the court found to be persuasive indicators of a legislative intent to exclude declaratory relief actions under section.baxter,supra,th at.the court in baxter stated that,unlike the california public records act,proposition did not contain specific statutory mechanisms for seeking declaratory relief,nor did it have any procedural protections for the public that would be circumvented if persons were permitted to seek preemptive declaratory relief under section.ibid.the court also stated that the only way for a business to obtain a binding preenforcement determination regarding proposition was pursuant to a declaratory relief judgment from the superior court.id.at.the court held that the oehha failed adequately to support its contention that a preemptive declaratory relief would eliminate many of the incentives and protections in proposition enforcement provision and would thwart its purposes id.at.
the court in baxter,supra,th at page also held that there was an actual controversy between oehha and the plaintiff and,therefore,the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting declaratory relief.an irreconcilable controversy existed between oehha and the plaintiff over the oehha placing the chemical compound contained in the medical devices on proposition list of chemicals that cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.id.at.because of that irreconcilable difference,the plaintiff was compelled either to provide a stigmatizing warning regarding its products even though it could show the chemical compound in its product does not cause cancer in humans,or risk being subjected to an enforcement action and costly civil penalty if its theory is rejected in an enforcement action.declaratory relief was necessary and proper to prevent the plaintiff from having to make this hobson choice citation and to enable the plaintiff to obtain a declaration of its rights and obligations under the act.ibid.
plaintiff also relies on american meat institute leeman th american meat,in which the defendant sent required notices under proposition to,inter alia,eight different meat processors and retailers.id.at.the notices stated that the meat processors and retailers were selling either ground beef or liver products that contained chemicals identified by the state as being carcinogens and reproductive toxins,without supplying the warnings required by proposition.ibid.the eight alleged violators were represented by trade associations.id.at.the trade associations filed a declaratory relief action against the defendant seeking declaratory relief on behalf of all of the trade associations members that as applied to meat and meat products,the warning requirement of proposition was preempted by the federal meat inspection act et.id.at.
the trial court overruled the defendant demurrer on the ground that sufficient facts had been pled to establish an actual controversy.american meat,supra,th at.subsequently,the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the trade associations,concluding that under the circumstances,the federal meat inspection act preempted the warning requirements of proposition.id.at.
in affirming the trial court orders,the court in american meat,supra,th at page stated that the notices gave rise to an actual controversy between the defendant and the trade associations members.the court stated that because proposition provided daily penalties,it was clearly in the interest of the trade associations to take action as soon as possible to determine what,if any,obligations were imposed on their members by proposition.ibid.

there are various aspects of filarsky,supra,cal th,baxter,supra,th,and american meat,supra,th,that both support and undermine the conclusion that a declaratory relief action may not be maintained by a potential defendant in a clra damages action to establish that there was no violation of the clra.for example,filarsky,supra,cal th,in which the supreme court directed the court of appeal to issue a writ of mandate compelling the trial court to enter an order sustaining the citizen demurrer to the declaratory relief complaint,concerned the california public records act.the clra,the statutory scheme involved here,provides for award of attorney fees and costs if the complaining party prevails,subd.e a provision similar to that provided in the california public records act.and as the california public records act,the clra has a provision to expedite lawsuits brought under its provisions.under civil code section,subdivision c,the consumer who brings the lawsuit as a class action,as plaintiff has done here,can on days notice request the trial court to hold a hearing to determine,among other things,whether t he action is without merit or there is a defense to the action.on the other hand,unlike the california public records act,which provides that trial court ruling is subject to expedited appellate review,and therefore a direct claim under that statutory scheme would be undermined by the filing of a declaratory relief action,appellate review of a judgment entered pursuant to the clra is not reviewed on an expedited basis it is reviewed on appeal.
american meat,supra,th,and baxter,supra,th,both concerned proposition.in american meat,the court affirmed the trial court order overruling the defendant demurrer to the declaratory relief complaint.american meat,supra,th at.in baxter,the court affirmed the judgment following the trial court order granting declaratory relief in the plaintiff favor.baxter,supra,th at.
as in proposition,in which the statutory scheme provides for daily penalties that can be imposed on a person who violates proposition,so too would a party expose itself to greater or additional damages claims for violating the clra the longer the matter is unresolved.similar to the plaintiff in baxter,supra,th,plaintiff here was subject to a hobson choice absent the filing of a declaratory relief action,plaintiff either had to revise its advertising despite believing that it was supported by scientific evidence,or wait to be sued by defendants or other consumers.on the other hand,there is a mandatory attorney fees provision in the clra,subd.e there is not a similar provision in proposition.
the court in filarsky,supra,cal th emphasized that circumventing a person mandatory right under a statute to recover attorney fees if he or she prevails in an action under that statutory scheme is an important consideration in determining if a declaratory relief action undermines the statue.id.at.plaintiff declaratory relief action here eliminates an important incentive afforded by the clra,mandatory attorneys fees,and would thwart the clra purpose.as noted above,the purposes of the clra are to protect consumers against unfair and deceptive business practices and to provide efficient and economical procedures to secure such protection.also,a critical procedure under the clra is the notice provision that allows the prospective defendant to remedy any violations of the statute in order to avoid a lawsuit seeking damages.
as noted above,the clra,like the california public records act,has a provision to expedite lawsuits brought under its provisions.moreover,only a consumer may maintain an action under the clra.in addition,the declaratory relief action is against one consumer nunez thereby eliminating the class action rights of the consumers who would have been joined in the clra class action.also,under civil code section of the clra,it is a defense to a claim for damages if the violation of the clra was not intentional,but a declaratory relief action would not address or resolve that issue.under the clra,injunctive relief may be awarded,but injunctive relief is not available in a declaratory relief action under section.it is true that a can invoke these remedies.but then,there is no reason for declaratory relief.once a for damages under the clra is filed,the declaratory relief action would be rendered unnecessary because the presumably would include the issue of whether the plaintiff,the was violating the clra.
it is inequitable for a consumer to be forced to defend a declaratory relief action,divorced of the incentives and rights under the clra,merely because the consumer sent a clra notice,and regardless of whether that consumer decided ultimately to file a lawsuit under the clra.indeed,the consumer may review responses to the clra notice and decide not to bring an action.a preemptive request for a declaration of rights would compel the parties to litigate the matter.thus,consumers would be deterred from making claims under the clra.
the test set forth in filarsky,supra,cal th is whether the declaratory relief action undermines the statute in question.in view of the factors to which we point,we believe it does in this case.because,as a matter of law,plaintiff was precluded from filing a declaratory relief claim,it can not demonstrate a probability of prevailing on that claim.
as to the law firm defendants,plaintiff can not establish that it had a probability of prevailing on its declaratory relief claim against them because there is no actual controversy between them and plaintiff.the fundamental basis of declaratory relief is the existence of an actual,present controversy over a proper subject.citation.city of cotati cashman,supra,cal th at.section states that a ny person who desires a declaration of his or her rights or duties with respect to another may,in cases of actual controversy relating to the legal rights and duties of the respective parties,bring an original action for a declaration of his or her rights and duties
