this case involves claims of race discrimination at the public library system afpls brought by appellees,seven caucasian female librarians,against appellants,members of the afpls board of trustees and the director of the afpls.appellees the librarians claim appellants transferred them from their jobs at central library to jobs at branch libraries because of their race.appellants,however,claimed the transfers were part of a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reorganization plan.the jury found for the librarians.after motions,judgment was entered in favor of the librarians for a total of approximately million in compensatory and punitive damages.on appeal,appellants argue the district court erred by not granting their motion for judgment as a matter of law on the grounds of qualified immunity not giving their requested jury instruction and interrogatory on a defense admitting documents into evidence that were protected by the privilege sustaining approximately million in compensatory damages for emotional distress and sustaining approximately million in punitive damages.
the afpls consists of central library central,the main public library in downtown atlanta,and more than branch libraries.the afpls is governed by a board of trustees the board.the board sets library policy,but is not responsible for the management of the library system.instead,the board hires a director who serves as the administrative head of the library system.
at the time of the transfers at issue in this case,appellant william mcclure was chairman of the board.appellant benjamin jenkins was a member of the board and chairman of the board personnel committee.appellant mary jamerson ward was a member of the board and a member of the personnel committee.appellant mary hooker was director of afpls.
when hooker was hired as director in,she began planning a reorganization.hooker testified that,after she was hired,she visited branch libraries,talked to library personnel,reviewed workload reports,analyzed the staffing needs at the libraries,and concluded that the branch libraries needed additional professional librarians.hooker testified that new technologies would create staffing redundancies at central while increasing the need for services at the branch libraries.hooker planned to reorganize the local branch libraries into geographic clusters to serve local needs more effectively.although hooker never developed a written,comprehensive reorganization plan,she testified she had a plan or vision for how the library was going to be reorganized,she occasionally discussed her ideas with the board,and the board generally approved reorganizing to provide more services through the branch libraries.
another reoccurring issue for appellant board members was the low number of managers at central.for example,ward stated the white dominated administration at central was a problem and told fellow board member nancy puckett there were too many white faces working at central and it was not welcoming to black folks to see so many white faces in central management.former assistant director of public services paulette testified mcclure asked her what she planned to do about the fact that there was only one manager at central and mcclure idea was to move people from central out to the branches and maybe do a swap and bring some black managers into central.
on more than one occasion,appellant board members asked for data on the race of managers at central.in a january board meeting,hooker presented to the board,in response to their request,a document entitled branch unit management by race which contained the names,race,gender,location,and classification of all afpls managers.after the board members discussed this document,mcclure concluded that the number of managers at central was an issue the board was going to have to address and directed the personnel committee to place the issue high on their agenda.
in an april,meeting of the personnel committee,hooker recommended transferring employees from their jobs at central to jobs at the branch libraries.hooker noted that,based on her analysis of the library system,many branch libraries were understaffed while central library was overstaffed.some of the board members expressed concern over reassigning employees before a more complete reorganization plan was developed.hooker responded that more analysis was needed,but given the need for service in the branches she recommended moving forward with the reassignments.mcclure also encouraged the committee to move forward with the reassignments.in the course of this discussion,board member blake stated,as people are moved or promoted,it gives us a marvelous opportunity for us to look at fairness and representation of ethnic groups wherever they are needed.we have mentioned,from time to time,how many people are at central in top level positions that are.after more discussion on the proposed transfers,the personnel committee tabled the issue and decided to meet again on april to continue their discussion.
in the meantime,hooker sought advice from the fulton county personnel department.personnel manager paris brown testified she told hooker some of the proposed transfers did not appear to conform to fulton county policy regarding job responsibilities for employment classification.personnel director robert brandes,however,testified he was not aware of any problems and he simply told hooker to be cognizant of the fact when you move people or transfer people,you have to be sure that their duties and responsibilities will not have a potential negative effect on the job classification.
on april,hooker wrote a memo to mcclure regarding the proposed transfers.she stated,because the potential for significant problems was identified by the fulton county personnel department,i recommend that the personnel committee of the board of trustees refrain from advancing the until each transfer and is reviewed and evaluated.significant legal ramifications could be present hooker specifically mentioned certain staff members must maintain the same level of responsibility in their new assignments as at their previous assignments.hooker also stated,the objectivity of the selection process for the staff to be has not been determined.according to fulton county,transfers are customarily done laterally.this would not be the case in this because levels of responsibility would not remain the same.
on the same day,hooker sent to the board members newspaper articles about several recent discrimination cases brought by caucasian employees against fulton county.one article described an eleventh circuit decision upholding a jury finding that the fulton county sheriff and her department engaged in racial discrimination,but reducing the damages the jury awarded the caucasian deputies.another article described the settlement of a lawsuit against fulton county involving allegations that an employee was passed over for a salary increase because he was caucasian while another worker,who was,received a pay hike.a third article described fulton county settlement of an employment discrimination lawsuit filed by a caucasian firefighter.according to hooker,she sent these articles to the board in response to an anonymous email asking her to share the information with the board,and it was not connected to the proposed transfers.
on april,hooker talked to june green of the fulton county attorney office about whether the proposed transfers would violate fulton county personnel policies.on april,green wrote a memorandum to hooker,with copies to mcclure,stating 
in our conversation you advised me that you had spoken to bob brandes of the fulton county personnel department,and he advised you that the reorganization that has been proposed by the library board of trustees will likely violate fulton county personnel policies and procedures.you specifically mentioned race,age and gender discrimination and unfair demotion.although you asked for some legal guidance,i advised you that it would be hard to give legal advice in a vacuum and that you should put your concerns in writing and attach a copy of the proposed reorganization.
of course,i would expect to be able to review the proposal before its implementation so that any legal advice that i have may be useful.
on the same day,mcclure sent a letter to hooker,with copies to the board,brandes,green,and the board secretary,stating 
after reviewing your memorandum of april,which recommended not advancing the plans for reorganization,i am requesting that you proceed with the development of the comprehensive reorganization plan,in accordance with the timeline you established of april.your memo clearly establishes that we are not currently able to determine if a potential for significant problems exist,since you have not defined the new duties and responsibilities for any potential position to be reassigned.however,no clear determination can be made until you have developed a comprehensive plan and defined the position responsibilities.therefore,the prudent course of action would be to develop a comprehensive reorganization plan,complete the requisite position description work,review it with the county personnel department to remedy any potential policy conflicts,and submit the plan to the personnel committee of the board of trustees for review and approval 
hooker,it is important to recognize that improved service and equity strongly dictate that reorganization is necessary,as you have also agreed.i hope that we can move ahead with this process in an expeditious manner.
on april,the personnel committee met again to discuss the proposed reassignments.hooker presented the committee with a document entitled strategic service equity i team concept.this document recognized the need to restructure the library system and flatten the organization by deploying high level librarians into the branch teams.at the meeting,hooker proposed reassigning positions.first,however,she recommended that the proposals be reviewed by the county legal department and fulton county personnel department as a precautionary measure.the personnel committee agreed and directed hooker to proceed and work with the county personnel director to resolve any conflict with county policies and classifications.
on may,the personnel committee met again to discuss the proposed transfers.hooker informed the personnel committee that,for the most part,the transfer issues had been resolved.a document distributed at that meeting stated 
on monday,may,the library system director met with the fulton county personnel department classification and pay chief to discuss and review the library positions,classifications,titles and essential duties.as a result of this meeting,there were no findings that would prohibit the library system from reassigning its staff based on the need to restructure and its services in accordance with the fulton county personnel regulations.
after discussing the proposed transfers,the personnel committee voted to approve reassignments as well as several new hires and one promotion.
the next day,may,hooker wrote a letter to fulton county attorney june green stating,the personnel and staffing reassignments meet all the requirements and are appropriate as they relate to the essential duties,service delivery and reorganization plan within the library system.hooker asked green for a written response.on may,green responded 
although you ask me to provide a written response,you provide me nothing to which a response is required or to which a response could be made if you have any questions about these personnel transactions,your memorandum does not ask them.the new hires and one promotion are probably not problematic.you should look closely at the reassignments,however.your memorandum does not compare old job duties to new job duties in the reassignments.are salaries,position titles or classifications changing if so,you should review those changes closely with the personnel director to make sure that no personnel rules and regulations are being violated.can i safely assume that none of the reassignments amount to demotions if not,then you should also review those with the personnel director.if the personnel director has reviewed and cleared all of these personnel transactions then you are probably on safe legal ground.as stated above,however,you have not asked me any questions nor have you provided me with enough information to answer any.
on may,jenkins presented to the board the proposed new hires,promotion,and transfers.jenkins twice referred to the vote as one on new hires only.the board unanimously voted to approve the personnel actions.board member puckett entered the board meeting just after the vote.she asked jenkins what had happened on the vote,and he told her the board had only voted on the new hires and not the proposed reassignments,although apparently the board had approved all of the reassignments as well as the new hires and promotion.
the following morning,may,hooker held a staff meeting at which she passed out the reassignment list.this was the first the employees or their supervisors knew of the reassignments.hooker offered no job descriptions for the transferees,did not explain how they would fit into their new positions or what their job duties would include,and responded to their questions with vague,noncommittal answers.at trial,hooker testified she made the reassignment decisions without input from the staff because she had lost confidence in their advice.
of the employees who were transferred,were and were caucasians,including the seven librarians in this action.none of the seven librarians experienced a decrease in pay,classification,or benefits however,they all claim to have suffered significant demotion in their job duties and responsibilities.the librarians presented evidence that all but two of the on the transfer list received lateral transfers or promotions,and that the two who did not receive lateral transfers or promotions had been critical of the board in the past.
the librarians testified to the emotional and mental pain they suffered as a result of their transfers.the librarians testified about their meaningful and exciting managerial positions at central,their decades of experience as professional librarians,and the years of training and education invested in their careers.for example,nancy powers had years of experience with afpls,and janet bogle,who wanted to be a librarian since the fourth grade,had a masters degree in library science and years of professional library experience.the librarians claimed appellants destroyed their careers by transferring them to jobs at the branch libraries where they did menial,nonmanagerial tasks such as shelve books,clean refrigerators and computers,dust furniture,and photocopy documents the librarians testified the transfers caused them significant emotional harm and made them feel embarrassed,humiliated,stunned,confused,angry,frightened,discouraged,and betrayed.for example,jo lynn burge testified i ca begin to tell you what a toll it has taken on me.to be an active and producing person and then to suddenly be just put on the shelf and made to sit there through no purpose of my own or no doing of my own,i could not help that i was hurt.
appellants testified that their concern over the low number of managers at central had nothing to do with the librarians transfers,and that the transfers,instead,were the first part of a reorganization plan designed to provide more services in the branch libraries.the librarians,on the other hand,argued the transfers were based on race and the reorganization plan was a sham or.
evidently rejecting appellants defense that the librarians were transferred as part of a reorganization,the jury found for the librarians and awarded approximately million in compensatory and punitive damages.the district court denied appellants renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and motion for a new trial.the district court,however,granted in part appellants motion with regard to damages and remitted the total award to approximately million.this appeal followed.
qualified immunity 
qualified immunity offers complete protection for government officials sued in their individual capacity if their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.the supreme court has set forth a test for qualified immunity.first,the court must ask whether the plaintiff allegations,if true,establish the violation of a constitutional or statutory right.hope pelzer,d saucier katz,d.if a constitutional or statutory right would have been violated under the plaintiff version of the facts,the next step is to ask whether the right was clearly established.hope,at.at.
viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the librarians,see fdic stahl,cir,appellants violated the librarians constitutional rights by transferring them on the basis of their race.moreover,there is no doubt that in may,when the librarians were transferred,it was clearly established that intentional discrimination in the workplace on account of race violated federal law.see alexander fulton county,cir.
appellants,however,argue they are entitled to qualified immunity under foy holston,cir in foy we noted that,in a case involving mixed motives,the presence of a jury issue about a defendant improper intent does not necessarily preclude qualified immunity.id.at.where the facts assumed for summary judgment purposes in a case involving qualified immunity show mixed motives lawful and unlawful motivations and law does not dictate that the merits of the case must be decided in plaintiff favor,the defendant is entitled to immunity.in stanley city of dalton,cir,we explained that a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity under the foy rationale only where,among other things,the record indisputably establishes that the defendant in fact was motivated,at least in part,by lawful considerations.id.at first emphasis added see also johnson city of lauderdale,cir.
appellants argue the transfers were part of a,reorganization in which resources and personnel were being moved from overstaffed central library to understaffed branch or cluster libraries.however,given the librarians evidence suggesting the reorganization plan was a sham designed to cover up the transfers,a reasonable jury had reason to doubt appellants asserted nondiscriminatory reason for the transfers.viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the librarians,the record evidence does not undisputably indicate that appellants were in fact motivated,at least in part,by objectively valid reasons.therefore,appellants were not entitled to qualified immunity under foy 
jury instruction and interrogatory 
appellants argue it was error for the district court to refuse to give their requested jury instruction and interrogatory on their defense.the proposed instruction stated 
even if you find that the plaintiffs race and sex played a role in the defendants decision to include them in the may,reorganization,defendants can not be held liable if they show that the same decision would have been made even in the absence of the impermissible criterion.thus,if you find that the defendants would have included plaintiffs in the may,reorganization,without any consideration of their race or sex,then the defendants can not be held liable.
appellants proposed interrogatory asked the jury whether the plaintiffs would have been included in the may,reorganization even in the absence of the defendant consideration of the plaintiffs race 
a refusal to give a requested jury instruction is erroneous only if the requested instruction correctly stated the law,the instruction dealt with an issue properly before the jury,and the failure to give the instruction resulted in prejudicial harm to the requesting party.roberts schaefer hardaway,cir see also wood president and trustees of spring hill,cir in considering the failure of the district court to give a requested instruction,the omission is error only if the requested instruction is correct,not adequately covered by the charge given,and involves a point so important that failure to give the instruction seriously impaired the party ability to present an effective case.we have recently explained 
this court applies a deferential standard of review to a trial court jury instructions.if the trial judge instructions accurately reflect the law,he or she is given wide discretion as to the style and wording employed in its instruction.further,under this standard,we examine whether the jury charges,considered as a whole,sufficiently instructed the jury so that the jurors understood the issues and were not misled.
mccormick aderholt,cir quotation marks and citations omitted.
we employ the same deferential standard of review to the district court special interrogatory verdict form.see johnson breeden,cir.with regard to omitted jury interrogatories,we have stated 
f ailure to give requested jury interrogatories may not be error,or if error may be harmless,where the jury verdict itself,viewed in the light of the jury instructions,and any interrogatories that were answered by the jury,indicate without doubt what the answers to the refused interrogatories would have been,or make the answers to the refused interrogatories irrelevant 
the librarians offer several reasons why the district court properly rejected appellants proposed jury instruction and interrogatory the librarians also argue the district court proximate cause instruction and interrogatory cured any potential error in not giving the requested instruction and interrogatory.
the district court proximate cause instruction stated the librarians must prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that appellants acts of discrimination were the proximate or legal cause of damages sustained by the librarians.the instructions explained,for damages to be the proximate or legal result of wrongful conduct,it must be shown that,except for such conduct,the damages would not have occurred.the district court special interrogatory asked the jurors whether each appellant acts were the proximate or legal cause of damages sustained by each librarian.the jury answered yes to this question as to each appellant and each librarian.
the jury answer to the proximate cause interrogatory in effect means that,except for discrimination,the librarians would not have been transferred.this finding precludes appellants defense,which rests on the jury finding,irrespective of discrimination,the librarians would have been transferred for reasons.the proximate cause instruction adequately instructed the jury not to find for the librarians if they believed the librarians would have been transferred irrespective of race.if the jury had believed this,they would have answered the proximate cause interrogatory in the negative.however,the jury affirmative answer to the proximate cause interrogatory indicates,without doubt,what the answer to the interrogatory would have been.thus,there was no error in refusing to give appellants instruction and interrogatory,or if there were error,it would be harmless.see johnson,at 
appellants argue the district court improperly admitted two memoranda the green memoranda written by fulton county attorney june green to hooker because the memoranda were protected by the privilege.
the party invoking the privilege has the burden of proving that an relationship existed and that the particular communications were confidential.united states schaltenbrand,cir.to determine if a particular communication is confidential and protected by the privilege,the privilege holder must prove the communication was intended to remain confidential and under the circumstances was reasonably expected and understood to be confidential.united states bell,cir.we review the district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.judd rodman,cir.
the green memoranda were authored by june green,counsel for fulton county,and were addressed to hooker,with copies sent to mcclure.the memos provided legal advice regarding the proposed personnel reorganization,but were not designated either privileged or confidential.appellants did not present evidence regarding who,if anyone,received the memoranda other than hooker and mcclure,what hooker or mcclure did with the memoranda once received,or whether hooker,mcclure,or green understood the memoranda to be confidential additionally,it was not reasonable under the circumstances to expect the memoranda to be confidential because the memoranda might have been public records under the georgia open records act.see,e therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the green memoranda.
compensatory damages for emotional harm 
at trial,the librarians testified to the emotional and mental pain they suffered as a result of being transferred from meaningful,supervisory positions to,nonmanagerial jobs.the librarians testified the transfers effectively destroyed their careers,and some testified the transfers caused them to resign or go on worker compensation.when describing their emotional harm,the librarians testified the transfers upset,embarrassed,humiliated,and ashamed them.some librarians testified the transfers caused them to become depressed and one even became suicidal.other than their own testimony,the librarians presented no independent medical evidence of mental or physical harm.
the jury awarded each librarian million for emotional harm to be divided among appellants as follows against mcclure against both hooker and ward and against jenkins.the district court granted in part appellants motion for remittitur,reducing the compensatory damages for emotional distress to per librarian to be divided among appellants as follows against mcclure,hooker,and ward and against jenkins.appellants argue the evidence does not support an award of per librarian for emotional distress.
although compensatory damages must be proven,general compensatory damages,as opposed to special damages,need not be proved with a high degree of specificity and may be inferred from the circumstances.ferrill parker group,cir.a plaintiff may be compensated for intangible,psychological injuries as well as financial,property,or physical harms.id.humiliation and insult are recognized,recoverable harms,and a plaintiff own testimony of embarrassment and humiliation can be sufficient to support an award for compensatory damages.id.citing marable walker,cir.
we review the district court decision to sustain compensatory damages for clear abuse of discretion.middlebrooks hillcrest foods,cir.after a trial court has reviewed and remitted a jury award to a specific amount,the district court decision is accorded a presumption of validity.ferrill,at.the standard of review for awards of compensatory damages for intangible,emotional harm is deferential to the fact finder because the harm is subjective and evaluating it depends considerably on the demeanor of the witnesses.patterson healthcare,cir quotation marks omitted.
after reviewing the record,we discern no reason to substitute our judgment for that of the jury or the district court as to the amount of damages necessary to compensate the librarians for their emotional pain and suffering.see farley nationwide mut.ins,cir.therefore,we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining awards of per librarian for emotional harm.
punitive damages 
the jury awarded each librarian million in punitive damages,divided among appellants as follows against mcclure against hooker against ward and against jenkins.this resulted in a total punitive damage award of million against mcclure million against hooker million against ward and against jenkins.the district court upheld the punitive awards against mcclure,hooker,and ward,but remitted the punitive award against jenkins from per plaintiff to no award at all.appellants argue the district court erred in sustaining these punitive damages.
first,appellants argue against imposing any punitive damages at all because they did not discriminate in the face of a perceived risk that their actions will violate federal law as required by kolstad american dental ass n,d.at trial,however,appellants counsel admitted that appellants knew it was a violation of federal law to transfer people on the basis of race.this admission is not surprising considering that,at the time of the transfers,it was clearly established intentional discrimination in the workplace on account of race violated federal law.see alexander,at.furthermore,there was evidence at trial that appellants were warned by fulton county attorney green,the personnel department,and even hooker herself about significant legal problems with the transfers.thus,there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to award punitive damages.see lambert fulton county,cir holding that defendant knowledge that it is illegal to treat employees differently on account of race,coupled with credible evidence that defendant intentionally did so,is sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that the kolstad standard for punitive damages has been satisfied alexander,at same.
second,appellants argue,even if punitive damages in some amount could be justified,the awards in this case were excessive.the supreme court has recognized constitutional principles of due process prohibit the imposition of grossly excessive or arbitrary punishments on a tortfeasor.bmw of,gore,d.in gore,the supreme court instructed courts reviewing punitive damages to consider three guideposts the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant misconduct the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award and the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.gore,at.at.we conduct a de novo review of the trial court application of the gore guideposts to the jury punitive damage award.cooper,leatherman tool group,d.
recently,in state farm mut.auto.ins.campbell,d,the supreme court reiterated the importance of the gore guideposts and mandated exacting appellant review of a trial court application of them to the jury award to ensure that an award of punitive damages is based on an application of the law,rather than a decisionmaker caprice.id.at.addressing each guidepost from gore in some detail,the campbell court concluded the jury punitive award of million was neither reasonable nor proportionate to the wrong committed,and it was an irrational and arbitrary deprivation of the property of the defendant.id.at.unlike campbell,an application of the gore guideposts to the facts of this case demonstrates that the punitive damages award was not a violation of due process.
the supreme court has described the first gore degree of reprehensibility of the defendant be the most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award.id.at.quoting gore,at.at.in campbell,the supreme court explained 
we have instructed courts to determine the reprehensibility of a defendant by considering whether the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident and the harm was the result of intentional malice,trickery,or deceit,or mere accident.the existence of any one of these factors weighing in favor of a plaintiff may not be sufficient to sustain a punitive damages award and the absence of all of them renders any award suspect.it should be presumed a plaintiff has been made whole for his injuries by compensatory damages,so punitive damages should only be awarded if the defendant culpability,after having paid compensatory damages,is so reprehensible as to warrant the imposition of further sanctions to achieve punishment or deterrence.
id.citations omitted.
appellants wrongdoing was more than mere accident.there was evidence that,in the face of repeated warnings,appellants intentionally discriminated against the librarians on the basis of race and used trickery and deceit to cover it up under the guise of a reorganization.furthermore,appellants intentionally discriminated against the librarians with full knowledge of recent cases of employment discrimination brought by caucasian employees against other fulton county officials which resulted in jury verdicts for the plaintiffs or settlements.a reasonable jury could have concluded from the evidence that appellants knew that transferring the libr
