the united states appeals the october,order and judgment of the united states court of federal claims awarding in overtime compensation,liquidated damages,and attorneys fees and costs under the fair labor standards act,as amended,flsa,to six canine enforcement officers currently or formerly employed by the customs and border protection service within the department of homeland security we affirm.
a primary responsibility of the customs and border protection service customs is to intercept illegal drugs flowing into the united states through this country many ports of entry poe.customs carries out this responsibility,in part,with the help of detector dogs trained by canine enforcement officers ceos to find drugs hidden in incoming containers.training these dogs is not a event,but rather,it is an process that continues throughout the dog career.one training exercise the dogs repeat regularly is the detection of terry cloth towels scented with narcotics and hidden in training aid containers of varying complexity.when a dog successfully locates a training towel,his ceo rewards him with some play time using either the training towel or a clean,unscented towel.because neither the training aid containers nor the scented towels are available for purchase at the local pet store,the ceos are tasked with constructing and maintaining the training aid containers,as well as laundering the towels as needed.both of these tasks are vital to effective dog training.and although they may not be unduly onerous,they are time consuming nevertheless most important,these duties are work that ceos must perform,under pain of penalty for nonperformance.in spite of that,customs required the ceos to do this work on their own time and without compensation.approximately sixty ceos eventually became so dissatisfied with this state of affairs that they filed suit against the united states in the united states district court for the western district of texas,seeking overtime pay pursuant to flsa.the case was subsequently transferred to the court of federal claims on january.
in june of,during the pendency of this suit in the court below,robert jacksta,customs executive director of border security and facilitation at the office of field operations,issued a directive via a memorandum to all poes changing this historical practice of requiring uncompensated overtime.jacksta memorandum read in relevant part 
the first policy treated herein concerns the care and maintenance of reward towels used in detector dog training.as outlined in the detector dog training manual section,pg.and the canine handbook cis hb dated august,chapter,paragraph,the type of reward a legacy customs detector dog receives for responding to an odor for the detection of which he has been trained is a retrieving towel constructed of a terry cloth material.after each use,the retrieving towel must be properly cleaned,and the officer must use caution to ensure that the retrieving towel is not contaminated with the odor s of cleaning detergents.for this reason,it is required that the retrieving towel be washed in plain hot water and rinsed in cold water.further,paragraph of the canine handbook states that the port management will ensure that only clean towels are utilized.in order to guarantee that this procedure is properly implemented,each director,field operations shall take the necessary measures to fulfill the requirement to maintain clean retrieving towels used in training of our detector dogs.necessary measures could include the immediate purchase and setup of a washer and dryer or the use of contract services.if necessary,on a rotating basis,canine officers may be directed to spend all or part of a normal duty shift washing and drying training towels consistent with the handbook requirements,through whatever means are made available by management.
secondly,each port director is to provide direction to the office of field operations canine officers,reminding them that supervisory approval is required before performing any overtime work,either on or off the work site and that the performance of any tasks,including,but not limited to,the construction of detector dog training aids,will be accomplished only during the officer normal duty hours.for example,during those times that the detector dog is resting,the canine officer can construct training aids or roll and tape towels.port directors and supervisors will ensure that during all periods of downtime,while the detector dog is resting or during any spare time at the beginning or end of shifts,all canine officers are engaged in performing official duties.supervisors will also advise the office of field operations canine officers who construct training aids outside their normal duty hours that they will not be compensated for the time spent performing such tasks.
joint app.at.
then,on august,the government moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c,arguing that the plaintiffs claims should be dismissed because the customs officer pay reform act copra or the act,enacted in,is the exclusive pay system for ceos,excluding them from coverage under flsa.bull united states,footnote omitted bull i.the court denied the motion,at.the court held that copra,as correctly interpreted,only covers overtime compensation for officially assigned overtime work.the court concluded that the work at issue in this case,while required,was not officially assigned.the ceos were pain of discipline or construct and maintain training aid containers and to launder towels on their own time without compensation simply because customs did not officially assign those tasks.see digital audio recording oral argument in case,at,oral argument the court concluded that assigned overtime work is properly compensated under the terms of flsa.bull i,at.
in addition,due to the large number of plaintiffs,the court sought to simplify the upcoming bench trial by directing each side to select three trial plaintiffs to proceed.the parties complied,and a trial commenced on may.shortly thereafter,the parties submitted briefs for the court consideration.on september,the court issued its written opinion explaining its conclusions that customs had violated flsa willfully,and that all six plaintiffs are entitled to compensation for hours per week for laundering and processing training towels,and hours per week for c onstructing training aids.bull united states,bull ii.no damages were awarded for any overtime work performed after the distribution of the jacksta memorandum,at.
the court then ordered the parties to jointly calculate and present to the court the amount of compensation to which each representative plaintiff is entitled in accordance with the hours of overtime found by the court,at.the parties were unable to reach an agreement,however,because certain plaintiffs had originally sought less than the amount of overtime awarded by the court.thus,according to the government,the court award should have been interpreted as a maximum that would not create a windfall for such plaintiffs.the court disagreed,explaining that the reasonable time which the court is charged to determine will be more than the approximated time some plaintiffs have claimed and less than the approximated time others have claimed.bull united states,slip op.at,bull iii.having lost that dispute,the government subsequently agreed to an appropriate amount of compensation due to each plaintiff.the amount was then doubled pursuant to the court award of liquidated damages based on its finding that customs had not acted in good faith by denying overtime pay.a final judgment in the amount of was entered against the united states on october.this appeal followed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
in reviewing decisions of the court of federal claims,we apply a de novo standard to legal conclusions and a standard to factual findings.adams united states.
before we resolve the issues disputed on appeal,it is first helpful to explain a few evolutionary aspects of the statutory and regulatory framework that governs the compensation of customs inspectors in this country.beginning at least as early as,the owner of a vessel entering a port of the united states was responsible for paying for the cost of the inspectional services he received.act of,stat.thus,it was historically the private the bore the burden of paying the compensation of the customs inspectors.but because transportation in the early days of our nation history was rather unpredictable,vessels would arrive at any time of the day on any day of the week.as a consequence,customs inspectors faced uncertain work schedules.from to,congress passed various bills intended to ameliorate this situation by directing the secretary of the treasury to prescribe regulations to provide additional compensation at the vessel owner expense for nighttime inspectional services.see act of,stat,act of june,stat,act of june,stat,act of,stat.thus,if the owner of an incoming vessel desired the services of customs inspectors in the middle of the night,he could obtain them by paying a higher price than he would during the daytime hours.
in,congress replaced the prior legislation with a more comprehensive statutory scheme that,among other things,directed the secretary of the treasury to fix a reasonable rate of extra compensation,which shall not exceed an amount equal to double the rate of compensation allowed to each such officer or employee for like services rendered by day for inspections at night,on sundays,and on holidays.act of,stat.in,congress amended the act by directing the secretary of the treasury to 
fix a reasonable rate of extra compensation for overtime services of inspectors,storekeepers,weighers,and other customs officers and employees who may be required to remain on duty between the hours of and,or on sundays or holidays,to perform services in connection with the lading or unlading of cargo,or,or examination of passengers baggage,such rates to be fixed on the basis of day additional pay for each two hours or fraction thereof of at least one hour that the overtime extends beyond but not to exceed two and days pay for the full period from to,and two additional days pay for sunday or holiday duty.
act of,stat.thus,under the generous terms of the amended act,a customs inspector could receive four hours pay day pay by working one additional hour beyond,and sixteen hours pay two days pay by working only a few minutes on a sunday or holiday.
the compensation system became even more generous under subsequent treasury department regulations which calculated overtime hours on a basis that had little to do with the amount of time actually worked.for example,if a customs inspector having a typical to schedule was called back to perform a assignment at night,he could depending on the time of night receive credit for up to five hours of overtime,g as enacted on,which corresponded to three overtime units,twelve hours pay,under the act,see stat,providing day additional pay for each two hours or fraction thereof of at least one hour.notably,however,the act,for all its generosity,failed to provide compensation for overtime work performed either during customary working hours or during the first hour after.in other words,if a customs inspector began an inspection at,say,and concluded that inspection at,he would not qualify for thirty minutes of overtime under the act.instead,he was supposed to be compensated at least in later years pursuant to the overtime provisions of flsa or the federal employees pay act of,fepa.gao report,customs service act governing overtime is outdated,at gao act report overtime work from to is not compensable under the act thus,for example,overtime work within these hours on an inspector day off including saturdays is compensated under fepa or the fair labor standards act,et,instead,available at see also gao report,premium pay for federal inspectors at,at gao premium pay report,available at.pdf.under fepa,customs inspectors were entitled to receive subject to certain limitations one and times pay for hours of work officially ordered or approved in excess of hours in an administrative workweek.a emphasis added.coverage under the flsa,which was made applicable to federal employees in,was broader.customs inspectors were entitled to one and times their normal pay if they were employ ed for more than forty hours in a workweek,a the statutory definition of employ included to suffer or permit to work,g.thus,for work outside the time periods covered by the act,customs inspectors were eligible for fepa overtime if the work was officially ordered and flsa overtime even if the work was merely suffered or permitted.
customs operated under this lucrative regime for many years,largely at the expense of the passengers and vessels paying for the inspectional services they received.see gao premium pay report,at.this changed in when congress shifted the financial responsibility for overtime charges incurred on sundays and holidays to the federal government.see airport and airway dev.act amendments of,e,stat,codified at repealed.shortly thereafter,congress became concerned with the financial burden being caused by the act.according to a report by the house committee on appropriations,in fiscal year,customs inspectors received over in overtime pay,customs inspectors received over in overtime pay,and three customs inspectors received over in overtime pay,at.the committee expressed concern not only about the high dollar amounts,but also about the well known fact that such excessive overtime is injurious to a person health as well as being the cause of serious family disruptions.id.at.
these concerns prompted the committee to propose an annual cap to limit the amount of overtime pay a customs employee could receive.id.at.in so doing,the committee recognized that the reduction in overtime will result in the need for additional manpower because of course,customs employees may not be required to work such overtime without pay.id.at.thus,the proposal also included funds in the accompanying bill for additional inspectional personnel.id.a report from the senate committee on appropriations expressed similar views,at,and it was agreed at conference that the cap should be set at per year,at.the cap was enacted into law on september,treasury dep t appropriations act of,stat,n one of the funds made available by this act shall be available for administrative expenses to pay any employee of the united states customs service overtime pay in an amount in excess of,and it was maintained at that level until it was raised to for fiscal year,see trade and tariff act of,stat,codified at d no part of any sum that is appropriated under subsection b for fiscal years after september,may be used for administrative expenses to pay any employee of the united states customs service overtime pay in an amount exceeding.although the cap was immediately successful in preventing the customs inspectors identified in the committee report from again receiving over in overtime pay,a substantial number of inspectors were still receiving significant overtime pay.
the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of cobra,stat,codified at,brought about another significant change in the overtime system.with the passage of cobra,customs was directed to collect user fees from virtually every passenger and vessel entering the united states for deposit into a reimbursement account to cover expenses incurred by the secretary of the treasury in providing overtime customs inspectional services.cobra f a.though relatively nominal in amount,these fees were more than sufficient in the aggregate to pay for inspectional overtime expenses.see gao report,customs service information on user fees,at gao user fees report,available at.and although reimbursement from the user fee account was technically an appropriation from congress,it was not subject to the same office of management and budget controls as other appropriations.see,at gao user fees report,at customs service abuse of overtime compensation hearing before the subcomm.on oversight of the comm.on ways and means,cong.hereinafter abuse hearing testimony of lowell dodge,director,administration of justice issues,general accounting office.nevertheless,congress maintained an interest in the disposition of these funds because some of the account surplus could be used to offset the federal budget deficit.see gao user fees report,at f c iii.
both a general accounting office gao investigation and an internal study performed by customs found that inspection managers were treating the user fee account as a bottomless pit,and further that inspectional overtime was being monitored only to the extent necessary to ensure that employees were not exceeding the annual cap.gao act report,at.for example,gao analyzed customs worktickets,which were the time and attendance records for customs inspectional overtime system,id.at,and found worktickets that were not certified by a supervisor,were approved by the person who worked the overtime,were improperly completed or altered,and showed incorrect start and stop times for assignments,id.at.flaws in the workticket system allowed some employees to receive duplicate payments for a given overtime period.id.at.gao investigators even found an instance where an inspector had received two overtime payments in addition to his regular pay for a single period.id.at abuse hearing,at testimony of director dodge.it was also discovered that the workticket system was allowing act payments for overtime that should have been paid at fepa or flsa rates,overtime work performed either during customary working hours or during the first hour after gao act reports,at.similarly,employees,secretaries and aides,were sometimes being paid for overtime at act rates instead of fepa or flsa rates.id.at.these latter practices drove up costs because fepa and flsa generally provide only overtime pay.see fepa flsa.moreover,under office of personnel management regulations,fepa and flsa overtime is paid in increments,a fepa,flsa,as opposed to the act increments.gao act report,at.
the results of the gao was done at the behest of the subcommittees on trade and oversight within the house ways and means the reformatory legislation at issue in this case.customs officer pay reform act copra,stat.that legislation was written to provide pay rates for officially assigned work in excess of forty hours per week or eight hours in a day,see a,and to replace the act increments for night work and increments for work with premium pay rates,see b.it was congress intent that this new regime,coupled with the promulgation of treasury department regulations designed to prevent abuse of the overtime system,would mirror fepa and flsa in the sense that payments would reflect the amount of time actually worked.see d c g,at cong.rec,extension of remarks by pickle.
in fact,both the gao and the congressional research service,in reports that provided the factual basis for the enactment of copra,noted the possibility of eliminating the act and paying overtime to customs inspectors primarily under fepa and its time and half rate.gao act report,at abuse hearing,at congressional research service report.however,concerns were expressed that the rate appropriately reflected both the nature of customs inspectors work and the comparable pay in the private sector.see gao act report,at comments of national treasury employees union house report,at statement of robert tobias,president,national treasury employees union.accordingly congress amended the act to mirror fepa while retaining the rate.see cong.rec,extension of remarks by pickle t he customs service overtime pay be modified to mirror the federal employees pay act fepa rules which generally apply to federal government workers.cong.rec,statement of rangel the committee came to recognize that the law needed revision,but that it did not want to reduce the overall compensation of customs inspectors.of particular relevance,copra contained a similar provision to fepa work officially ordered or approved limitation which limited copra to officially assigned work.see a a.
congress also limited eligibility for these increased hourly rates to customs inspector s and canine enforcement officer s,e,and included an exclusivity provision which states 
a customs officer who receives overtime pay under subsection a or premium pay under subsection b for time worked may not receive pay or other compensation for that work under any other provision of law.
c.in addition,paragraph c of copra,though duplicative of the broader cap prohibiting any customs employee from receiving more than in annual overtime explicitly capped copra overtime payments at the same amount,c.the legislative history reveals that congress was fully aware that paragraph c would be duplicative of prior law,see,at noting that customs inspectors may receive up to in overtime pay,annually,a fact that is not surprising given the instances of overtime abuse by customs.
the primary question presented in this appeal is whether copra is the exclusive source of overtime pay for ceos,and thus is an absolute bar to compensation under flsa for overtime work not officially assigned but nonetheless required to be performed by ceos.the government contends that such assigned but required work must be performed for free.the plaintiffs argue that such overtime work,never officially assigned until the jacksta memorandum required it to be done during regular work hours,is work suffer ed or permit ted under flsa,see g,and must be reimbursed under flsa overtime provisions.
as the court below correctly stated,t he starting point for statutory interpretation is the language of the statute.bull i,at citing hughes aircraft jacobson,d.w here the statutory language provides a clear answer to the question at issue,it ends there as well.hughes aircraft,at.beyond the statute text,the traditional tools of statutory construction include the statute structure,canons of statutory construction,and legislative history.timex united states,quoting chevron,natural res.def.council,d.if a court,employing traditional tools of statutory construction,ascertains that congress had an intention on the precise question at issue,that intention is the law and must be given effect,chevron,at,and an agency alternative interpretation of the statute is not entitled to deference under either chevron or skidmore swift.dynamics land cline,d w e neither defer nor settle on any degree of deference owed to the eeoc under either chevron or skidmore because the commission is clearly wrong.
the relevant portions of the statute provide 
in general.subject to paragraph and subsection c,a customs officer who is officially assigned to perform work in excess of hours in the administrative workweek of the officer or in excess of hours in a day shall be compensated for that work at an hourly rate of pay that is equal to times the hourly rate of the basic pay of the officer.
a emphasis added.
exclusivity of pay under this section.a customs officer who receives overtime pay under subsection a or premium pay under subsection b for time worked may not receive pay or other compensation for that work under any other provision of law.
c emphasis added.thus,copra provides double time for officially assigned overtime work,a,and precludes additional pay that might otherwise be obtained for that work through sources,c.in other words,if a ceo receives overtime pay under subsection a,for officially assigned overtime work,he or she may not receive pay or other compensation for that work under any other provision of law.nothing in the language of these provisions precludes a ceo who does not receive overtime pay under subsection a for overtime work that was not officially assigned from receiv ing pay or other compensation for that work under any other provision of law.therefore,the plain language of the statute clearly indicates that copra is not the exclusive source of overtime pay for ceos.
in support of its argument to the contrary,the government proposes a tortured reading of section by contending that t he phrase that work within the context of copra broadly refers to all overtime and premium work performed by customs officers.appellant br.at.we disagree.the antecedent basis for that work in paragraph c is work for which a ceo receives overtime pay under subsection a or premium pay under subsection b.and since only officially assigned work can entitle a ceo to overtim
