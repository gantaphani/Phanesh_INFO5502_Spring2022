after about an hour,mascarenas decided that they should go back to the first house to continue socializing.crowder went back to the porch,while mascarenas and defendant walked away from the group to talk.crowder noticed the voices becoming louder.he heard gunshots,stood up,and saw mascarenas fall to the ground.he observed that the shooter was a man known by the street name of mossey,later identified as antoine saucer.while fleeing the scene,saucer turned around and met defendant,who was opening the gate at a nearby apartment complex.as defendant opened the gate,saucer handed him the gun and ran into the apartment complex

standard of review 
we review the trial court restitution order for abuse of discretion.people giordano cal th,d.a restitution order that is based on a demonstrable error of law constitutes an abuse of the trial court discretion.people jennings th,d.
ii.the restitution award is improper 
defendant claims that he may not lawfully be ordered to pay victim restitution for economic losses stemming from the murder because he was not convicted of murder,but only of being an accessory after the fact.at the restitution hearing,defendant counsel argued that there was no nexus between defendant criminal act and the losses incurred by mascarenas family.in particular,he noted that defendant had not been convicted as a coconspirator or as an aider and abettor to the murder.the trial court ordered defendant to pay full restitution,based on the premise that the constitution is unequivocal regarding victim restitution.
while it is true that crime victims in california have a right to restitution,the right to recover from any given defendant is not unlimited.our constitution provides that it is the unequivocal intention of the people of the state of california that all persons who suffer losses as a result of criminal activity shall have the right to restitution from the persons convicted of the crimes for losses they suffer.cal,art.i,subd.b.the legislature has affirmed this intent,providing in penal code section,subdivision a,that a victim of crime who incurs any economic loss as a result of the commission of a crime shall receive restitution directly from any defendant convicted of that crime.
courts have interpreted section as limiting restitution awards to those losses arising out of the criminal activity that formed the basis of the conviction.subdivision a b of section requires the court to order the defendant meaning the defendant described in subdivision a,who was convicted of that crime resulting in the pay r estitution to the victim or victims,if any,in accordance with subdivision f.subdivision f of section provides that in every case in which a victim has suffered economic loss as a result of the defendant criminal conduct,the court shall require that the defendant make restitution to the victim or victims in an amount established by court order,based on the amount of loss claimed by the victim or victims or any other showing to the court.italics added.construed in light of subdivision a and b,the term criminal conduct as used in subdivision f means the criminal conduct for which the defendant has been convicted.people lai th,d lai.
this limitation does not apply in the context of grants of probation.california courts have long interpreted the trial courts discretion to encompass the ordering of restitution as a condition of probation even when the loss was not necessarily caused by the criminal conduct underlying the conviction.under certain circumstances,restitution has been found proper where the loss was caused by related conduct not resulting in a conviction citation,by conduct underlying dismissed and uncharged counts citation,and by conduct resulting in an acquittal citation.people carbajal cal th,d,carbajal.however,when a court imposes a prison sentence following trial,section limits the scope of victim restitution to losses caused by the criminal conduct for which the defendant sustained the conviction.
for example,in people percelle th,d percelle,the trial court ordered restitution to the victim of a theft of which the defendant was acquitted focusing on the language of penal code section,subdivision a,the appellate court held the restitution order was unauthorized because the defendant had not been convicted of that crime.percelle,supra,at,d.additionally,there was no evidence the unauthorized charges to the victim credit card were the result of any crime of which the defendant had been convicted.accordingly,the restitution award was improper.id.at,d.
similarly,in lai,a case involving welfare fraud,the court invalidated that portion of the restitution order of lai sentence attributable to fraudulently obtained aid before the charged period.lai,supra,th,d.
the attorney general argues that the restitution award in this case is proper under the rationale of carbajal.we disagree.carbajal was a case wherein the defendant was granted probation and,as noted in lai,the court in carbajal relied on the trial court broad discretion to set probationary terms under section,subdivision j,and specific statutory language in section,subdivision g that declared the legislative intent not to abrogate the trial court broad discretion to fashion conditions of probation.lai,supra,th,d.the court in lai concluded that this rationale is inapplicable to a nonprobationary sentence,in which the broad discretion to impose probationary conditions does not exist.ibid.
in a case factually similar to the present one,in re th,d,we affirmed an order requiring a juvenile offender to pay,as a condition of probation,in restitution to cover the expenses for the victim funeral where the allegation was sustained that the defendant acted as an accessory after the fact to murder.while we observed that no statute mandates restitution in cases such as this,where some other person was the immediate cause of economic loss to the victim or the victim family,and the defendant criminal liability was based on conduct taking place only after the loss was sustained,id.at,d,we found the restitution order was proper.citing to carbajal,we concluded that section confers broad power on the courts to impose conditions to foster rehabilitation and to protect public safety.citation.this power includes ordering restitution,if such a condition is reasonably related to the crime of which the defendant was convicted or to future criminality.in re,supra,at,d.
in the present case,however,defendant was not granted probation but was sentenced to state prison.thus,like the court in lai,we believe the rationale followed in carbajal and in re is not applicable to the case before us.
the attorney general argues that imposing an dichotomy between restitution awards made when the defendant is sent to prison and those made when the
