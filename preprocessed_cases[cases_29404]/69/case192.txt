what is the meaning of the phrase shall be construed liberally just as the recipe instruction to apply liberally has bedeviled many an amateur chef,the new york city council directive that courts shall construe the city human rights law nychrl liberally presents its own interpretive challenge.we confront a seemingly straightforward but surprisingly vexing question what is the standard for a punitive damages award for unlawful discriminatory acts in violation of the nychrl is it the same as the standard for awarding punitive damages under title vii if not,what standard should courts apply as we explain,we think this question would be more appropriately answered by the new york court of appeals.
in the city council,concerned that the nychrl had been interpreted too narrowly by courts in the past often by drawing on corresponding federal standards amended the new york city administrative code to ensure that t he provisions of the nychrl shall be construed liberally regardless of whether related federal or new york state civil and human rights laws have been so construed.local civil rights restoration act of,local law of,admin.code restoration act.we have since recognized that courts must analyze nychrl claims separately and independently from any federal and state law claims.mihalik credit agricole cheuvreux,cir.this task is not always uncomplicated,however.the restoration act identifies a handful of code provisions that had been interpreted too narrowly by courts,but it otherwise provides no specific guidance concerning how the nychrl should be construed liberally and independently of state and federal law in its particular applications.
this brings us to the case at hand,which involves a dispute over the standard for establishing liability for punitive damages under the nychrl.veronika chauca prevailed in a jury trial against jamil abraham,ann marie garriques,and park management systems,llc park health center on her claim of pregnancy discrimination in violation of federal,state,and city law.before the case was submitted to the jury,however,the district court denied chauca request to provide a jury instruction on punitive damages under the nychrl.the court declined to do so because it found that chauca had put forward no evidence that her employer intentionally discriminated against her with malice or reckless indifference for her protected rights the standard for an award of punitive damages under the corresponding pregnancy discrimination provisions of federal law contained in title vii.chauca appeals that decision,arguing that the district court failed to construe the nychrl standard for punitive damages liability liberally and to analyze it independently of federal law.the question before this court,then,is whether the standard for punitive damages is the same under both title vii and the nychrl,or if a liberally construed nychrl might set forth a broader standard for liability.because we conclude that the restoration act,the relevant sections of the nychrl,and new york case law do not resolve this question,as we noted above,we certify the question to the new york court of appeals.see comp.codes regs.tit.
background 
factual and procedural history 
veronika chauca began working for park management systems the center in as a physical therapy aid.in july,she informed her supervisors,jamil abraham and office supervisor ann marie garriques,that she was pregnant and would be taking maternity leave with a scheduled return in late november,which they approved.during her time away,another aide,debra mahearwanlal,handled chauca duties.shortly before chauca was scheduled to return to work,she contacted the office to remind them of her return.she claims she got the runaround sheila ramasre,the center payroll manager,told her she needed to discuss the details of her return with abraham abraham stated that she actually needed to speak to garriques and garriques was on vacation.when chauca ultimately did reach garriques,garriques told her that we no longer need your services and then hung up the phone.see joint app.at.chauca attempted to contact the center to learn why she would not be allowed to return,but whenever she called,the center either would not answer or would place her on hold indefinitely.later,both abraham and garriques claimed that chauca was not brought back because of a slowdown of business and changes following healthcare reform.at trial,garriques testified that she had told chauca at the time that they have started reducing the hours of the staff and possibl y will be laying off some of the staff and that if there any changes,they will give her a call.joint app.at.plaintiff suspected this explanation was pretextual,because no other employees had been laid off,and mahearwanlal only briefly worked on a reduced schedule,returning to a workweek within a month.chauca also alleged that at least three other pregnant women had been unlawfully terminated after becoming pregnant or after going on maternity leave.
in response,in december chauca filed a charge with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc alleging pregnancy discrimination.even as business picked back up and chauca continued to contact the center about returning to work in january and february of,abraham explained that chauca was not invited back to work because by that point she decide d to sue me,referring to her eeoc charge of unlawful discrimination.see joint app.at.after receiving a notice of right to sue from the eeoc,chauca subsequently filed suit in november in the eastern district of new york against the center and against abraham and garriques individually,alleging,inter alia,sex and pregnancy discrimination in violation of the pregnancy discrimination act,k,a,which is part of title vii of the civil rights act of,as well as in violation of her rights as guaranteed by both the new york state human rights law nyshrl,exec.law a,and the nychrl,admin.code a.among the relief chauca sought was compensatory and punitive damages,the latter of which is the focus of the present dispute.
at summary judgment,the district court concluded that chauca had established a prima facie case of pregnancy discrimination and denied defendants motion for summary judgment on all claims with respect to the center and on chauca state and city law claims with respect to abraham and garriques the case then went to trial and,during the charging conference,the district court declined to provide a punitive damages instruction to the jury over plaintiff objection.while recognizing that the nychrl calls for a liberal construction of its provisions,the district court found that chauca had put forward no evidence that the employer had intentionally discriminated with malice or with reckless indifference to her protected rights,impliedly applying the standard under title vii.the jury returned a verdict in chauca favor,awarding in lost compensation and for pain and suffering.chauca now appeals the denial of a jury instruction on punitive damages.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review challenges to a district court jury instructions de novo.a jury instruction is erroneous if it misleads the jury as to the correct legal standard or does not adequately inform the jury on the law.cameron city of new york,cir.citation omitted quoting lnc,first fidelity bank,cir.
ii.punitive damages under the nychrl 
the question before us is what the standard is to be found liable for punitive damages for unlawful discriminatory acts in violation of the nychrl and whether it is the same as the standard for a punitive damages award under title vii.as discussed below,we think the new york court of appeals is the appropriate court to answer this question.
we begin by briefly reviewing the relevant sections of the city nychrl as codified in its administrative code.under city law,it is an unlawful discriminatory practice for an employer or their employee to refuse to hire or to discharge from employment any person because of her pregnancy see admin.code a.the law establishes the availability of both compensatory and punitive damages awards against employers and employees found directly liable for discriminatory practices.id.a.in addition to setting forth liability for an employer own discriminatory practices,the law also creates an interrelated set of provisions to govern an employer liability for an employee unlawful discriminatory conduct in the workplace.zakrzewska new,emphasis added.
as to this imputed liability,employers can be held vicariously liable for the acts of their employees in the following circumstances where the offending employee exercised managerial or supervisory responsibility where the employer knew of the offending employee unlawful discriminatory conduct and acquiesced in it or failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action and where the employer should have known of the offending employee unlawful discriminatory conduct yet failed to exercise reasonable diligence to prevent it.id.quoting admin.code b.implicitly recognizing that an employer can not control all actions of its employees,the law also enables an employer liable for the conduct of an employee to mitigate punitive damages liability or avoid liability altogether in certain circumstances where the employer can prove it has put into place policies and procedures to educate employees,to prevent and detect unlawful discrimination,and to investigate and effectively resolve complaints of such conduct.see admin.code d e.
regardless of whether an employer can mitigate or avoid imputed liability for such damages,however,the nychrl does not articulate a standard for a finding of employer or employee liability for punitive damages in the first place,leaving courts to determine the appropriate standard.
farias and the federal punitive damages standard 
this is not the first time this court has been asked to shed light on the question of a punitive damages standard under the nychrl.indeed,in farias instructional systems,cir,we observed that because discrimination claims brought under the administrative code are generally analyzed within the same framework as title vii claims,and as t he administrative code does not provide a standard to use in assessing whether punitive damages are warranted,the federal title vii standard applies to claims for punitive damages under the administrative code.id.at quoting weissman dawn joy fashions,cir.under the title vii standard,p unitive damages are limited to cases in which the employer has engaged in intentional discrimination and has done so with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual.kolstad am.dental ass n,quoting b.as of,then,the standard in the second circuit for liability for punitive damages under the nychrl required a showing that the defendant had engaged in intentional discrimination and had done so with malice or with reckless indifference to the protected rights of the aggrieved individual.
restoration act of 
this standard has subsequently been called into question,however.believing that the general substitution of federal standards had led to the nychrl being construed too narrowly to ensure protection of the civil rights of all persons covered by the law,restoration act,the new york city council has twice legislatively clarified the uniquely broad and remedial purposes of the nychrl.see admin.code a.as part of the restoration act of,the city council instructed that t he provisions of the nychrl shall be construed liberally regardless of whether federal or new york state civil and human rights laws,including those laws with provisions to provisions of the nychrl,have been so construed.restoration act codified at admin.code a.in light of this amendment,we have subsequently concluded that courts must analyze nychrl claims separately and independently from any federal and state law claims.mihalik,at.
chauca argues that as a result of the restoration act,farias is no longer good law the matter is not as straightforward as she suggests,however.to begin,the legislative history of the restoration act makes clear that it sought to override legislatively several judicial decisions that the council thought had too narrowly construed the nychrl or that had established a federal standard more narrow than that intended under the nychrl.indeed,it identified those decisions by name as ones the restoration act was intended to override.see the council report of the governmental affairs division,committee on general welfare,on prop.int.at.this suggests that the council was well aware of the specific cases it thought had misconstrued its human rights law,and importantly,farias was not among the decisions expressly identified by the council.
the text of the restoration act also makes no mention of punitive damages,and the only reference to punitive damages in the act legislative history is found in the testimony of the act principal drafter,craig gurian,who stated 
among other areas that will be able to be addressed anew in view of the statute and by way of illustration only are w here a discriminator recklessly disregards the possibility that his conduct may cause harm,that discriminator ought to be subject to punitive damages the current imported federal standard restricting these damages to circumstances where the reckless disregard is of the specific risk that the human rights law is being violated is unduly restrictive it gives discriminators an incentive to plead ignorance of the law and should be examined.
testimony of craig gurian regarding intro,the local civil rights restoration act,committee on general welfare at,available at.whether the city council agreed with gurian that the federal standard is unduly restrictive is unclear,and his suggestion that the standard should be examined sheds little light on what the appropriate standard is.
nor do more recent amendments to the nychrl provide definitive guidance as to the standard.earlier this year,the city council amended the nychrl once again to signal further to courts the need to conduct an independent and liberal construction of the nychrl.in the legislative findings and intent provision of local law of,the city council explained 
following the passage of local law number for the year,known as the local civil rights restoration act,some judicial decisions have correctly understood and analyzed the requirement of section of the administrative code of the city of new york that all provisions of the new york city human rights law be liberally and independently construed.the purpose of this local law is to provide additional guidance for the development of an independent body of jurisprudence for the nychrl that is maximally protective of civil rights in all circumstances.
local law of,codified at admin.code act.consistent with this statement of intent,section was amended to read in part 
a.the provisions of this title shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the uniquely broad and remedial purposes thereof,regardless of whether federal or new york state civil and human rights laws worded comparably to provisions of this title have been so construed.
cases that have correctly understood and analyzed the liberal construction requirement of subdivision a of this section and that have developed legal doctrines accordingly that reflect the broad and remedial purposes of this title include albunio city of new york,bennett health management systems,dep t,and the majority opinion in williams new york city housing authority,dep t.
admin.code.neither the act nor its legislative history discusses punitive damages,and none of the cases cited approvingly in the act concerns the availability of punitive damages.given the lack of clarity concerning the appropriate standard for punitive damages and the importance of this issue to state and city law,we believe the prudent course of action is to certify this question to the new york court of appeals.
