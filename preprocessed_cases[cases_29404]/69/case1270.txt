the city of san diego bans contributions exceeding to any committee supporting or opposing a candidate for city council office.san diego municipal code sdmc this limit applies to recall efforts because the term candidate includes a city officeholder who becomes the subject of a recall election.id.
in this case,citizens for clean government citizens argues that the contribution limit is unconstitutional as applied to the phase of a recall election.san diego asserts its ordinance is valid under buckley valeo,d,and the district court agreed.it denied citizens request for preliminary injunctive relief,and this court affirmed.the parties then stipulated to a final judgment against citizens.we now vacate and remand.
the recall election of a city councilman in san diego the city proceeds in two phases.in the first phase,recall proponents must gather the signatures of at least percent of the voters in the council district.sdmc.they may begin collecting signatures days after they publish a notice of intent to circulate a recall petition,id,and must collect the required number of signatures within days of the notice.id.in total,recall proponents have days to collect the signatures required to file the recall petition.in the second phase of a recall,which occurs only after the requisite number of signatures has been collected and each signature verified,the city calls a special election in which voters choose whether to recall their councilman and select a replacement from a slate of successors.id.
in,citizens was formed as an unincorporated association to recall scott peters,the city councilman for district.to succeed at obtaining a special election,citizens had to collect over signatures on its recall petition,and it planned to do so by employing paid petition circulators.citizens ultimately failed to collect the required number of signatures in time.the following year,scott peters was in the city general election.
citizens filed this lawsuit for declaratory and injunctive relief on june,the day after it published its notice of intent to circulate a recall petition.it alleged that the city campaign contribution limit,then codified at sdmc,violated its right to freedom of speech and freedom of association under the first amendment of the united states constitution.
on july,the district court denied citizens request for preliminary injunctive relief.citizens,it held,had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its claim that the city ordinance was unconstitutional under buckley,the supreme court seminal campaign finance decision.on november,this court affirmed.the parties stipulated to a final judgment against citizens on october,and citizens timely filed this appeal on november.
because the recall campaign against scott peters did not obtain enough signatures to reach the ballot,and councilman peters was ultimately in,we must address the question of whether this case is moot.the supreme court has held that the following two factors may preclude a finding of mootness the challenged action was in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration,and there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subjected to the same action again.first bank of boston bellotti,d quoting weinstein bradford,d alteration in original.in short,the question is whether the alleged injury is capable of repetition,yet evading review.pac.terminal icc.we have previously noted that election cases tend to fall within this exception.see alaska right to life comm.miles,cir cal.council,getman,cir.
indeed,both factors are present here.first,unless a recall campaign succeeds in reaching the ballot,the contribution limitation is relevant for only those days between the publication of a notice of intent and the deadline for collecting the requisite number of signatures.this amount of time is too short to litigate a challenge to the ordinance to finality in court.second,if citizens attempts a recall again,it will be subject to the same contribution limits.see moore ogilvie,d rejecting mootness argument in voting rights case despite occurrence of election.citizens claim,accordingly,is not moot.
because this appeal relates to a permanent injunction,we are not constrained by the more limited standard of review that applied at the preliminary injunction phase of this litigation.see walczak epl prolong,cir.while we review the district court decision to deny permanent injunctive relief for abuse of discretion,we review de novo any legal conclusions underlying that decision.see jones city of,cir.though the district court correctly chose to apply buckley reduced scrutiny,we hold that it erred by deciding,apparently as a matter of law,that the city had a sufficient interest justifying the application of its contribution limits to the phase of a recall election.we hold that the city must provide evidence demonstrating a sufficiently important government interest,such as the risk of corruption,in this context.
limits on contributions to political campaigns are permissible under the first amendment as long as the government demonstrates that the limits are closely drawn to match a sufficiently important government interest.randall sorrell,d plurality opinion quoting buckley,at.this standard is sometimes referred to as less rigorous scrutiny.mcconnell fec,d.
under this test,the supreme court and this circuit have tended to uphold limits on contributions to candidate campaigns.see,nixon shrink.gov t pac,d.right to life ass eddleman,cir.but see randall.at striking down state contribution caps as too stringent.by contrast,neither the supreme court nor this court has found an interest sufficiently important to justify limits on contributions to ballot measure campaigns.see,citizens against rent for fair housing city of berkeley,d bellotti,at.
citizens,which likens recall petitions to ballot measure petitions,argues that the berkeley case implicitly establishes a strict scrutiny standard for contribution limits in ballot measure campaigns.the cases provide no conclusive support for this reading,and we decline to adopt that interpretation here.first,in berkeley,the court avoided any direct statement regarding the standard of review.and,to the extent the standard can be inferred,the court seemed to apply the level of scrutiny described in buckley.see berkeley,at.it is clear,therefore,that the ordinance does not advance a legitimate governmental interest significant enough to justify its infringement of first amendment rights.emphasis added.two concurrences in berkeley also suggest that buckley less rigorous scrutiny applies.id.at.i must assume that the court is following our consistent position that this type of governmental action is subjected to less rigorous scrutiny than a direct restriction on expenditures.marshall,concurring id.at.berkeley must demonstrate that its ordinance advances a sufficiently important governmental interest and employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of first amendment freedoms.blackmun,and o connor,concurring quoting buckley,at.internal punctuation omitted.
as both the supreme court and this court have recently suggested,the act of contribution,rather than the context in which contribution occurs,determines the standard of review.in a case addressing limits on corporate campaign contributions,the court stated that 
the level of scrutiny is based on the importance of the political activity at issue to effective speech or political association r estrictions on political contributions have been treated as merely marginal speech restrictions subject to relatively complaisant review under the first amendment,because contributions lie closer to the edges than to the core of political expression.
fec beaumont,d citations omitted.the court reiterated that lesser scrutiny is appropriate because the transformation of contributions into political debate involves speech by someone other than the contributor.id.at.quoting buckley,at.punctuation omitted.
similarly,this court has read buckley to stand for the principle that c ontribution limits do not significantly burden speech because the communicative
