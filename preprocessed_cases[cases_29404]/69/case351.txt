opinion of the court 
the filing of a bankruptcy petition operates as an automatic stay of debt collection activities outside of bankruptcy proceedings.a.if an individual is injured by any willful violation of the stay,that individual shall recover actual damages,including costs and attorneys fees,and,in appropriate circumstances,may recover punitive damages.id.k.in the present case,frank zokaites committed several willful violations of the automatic stay arising from garth and deborah lansaw bankruptcy petition.because of these violations,the bankruptcy court awarded the lansaws damages as well as punitive damages under k.the district court affirmed the awards,and zokaites now appeals.we conclude that k authorizes the award of damages and that the lansaws presented sufficient evidence to support such an award.we also conclude that the lansaws were properly awarded punitive damages.accordingly,we will affirm.
the lansaws operated a daycare in a space leased from zokaites over the course of several years,the relationship between the lansaws and zokaites devolved into various disputes.the present dispute arose after the lansaws entered into a new lease with a different landlord,but before they vacated zokaites property.when zokaites learned of the new lease,he served the lansaws with a notice for distraint,claiming a lien against the lansaws personal property for unpaid rent.the following day,august,the lansaws filed for bankruptcy thereby triggering the automatic stay under a.zokaites attorney was notified of the bankruptcy filing by a letter dated august.
zokaites,nevertheless,violated the automatic stay in three separate incidents.first,on august,zokaites and his attorney visited the lansaws daycare during business hours to take photographs of the lansaws personal property.although lansaw initially denied zokaites entry,zokaites entered the daycare by following a daycare parent inside.zokaites then entered lansaw office and backed her against the wall,getting so close that she could feel his breath.during the incident,zokaites asked lansaw three times in quick succession,do you want to hit me 
second,on sunday,august,zokaites visited the daycare after business hours and,this time,used his key to enter the building.he observed that the lansaws had removed some personal property and plumbing fixtures from the space.zokaites then padlocked and chained the doors.lansaw mother,who had arrived to clean the daycare,attempted to stop zokaites and called the police.a police officer,as well as the lansaws,arrived at the daycare shortly thereafter.zokaites suggested that lansaw inform the daycare parents that the daycare would not be open the next day.at the request of a police officer,he allowed lansaw to reenter the daycare and obtain the parents contact information.zokaites,however,insisted that lansaw be escorted in and out of the property by the officer.
after the lansaws returned home,they received a call from their attorney informing them that zokaites had left a proposed interim standstill agreement in the door of the daycare.it stated that zokaites would not unchain the daycare doors unless lansaw mother agreed that she had not been assaulted by zokaites,the lansaws reaffirmed their lease with zokaites,and the lansaws ceased removing property from the daycare.the lansaws informed their attorney that the agreement was not acceptable.they then returned to the daycare,removed the chains themselves,and decided to sleep in the building to prevent zokaites from chaining the door again.later that night,zokaites also returned to the daycare.before the lansaws could reach the door,zokaites removed lansaw keys that had been hanging from the inside keyhole and locked the door from the outside.zokaites left with the keys,which included personal keys in addition to the daycare keys,and returned to his vehicle.the lansaws called the police once more.
finally,on august,zokaites directed his attorney to send a letter to the lansaws new landlord.the letter demanded that the new landlord terminate the lansaws new lease and stated that,if the lease was not terminated,zokaites would file a complaint.a draft of that complaint was included with the letter.zokaites attorney also admitted having multiple phone calls with the new landlord in an attempt to have the new lease terminated.
for reasons that are unclear,the procedural history of the present action is somewhat complex and spans two separate adversary proceedings.the lansaws first initiated an adversary proceeding in august to enjoin zokaites from committing further violations of the stay.in the same proceeding,they also sought punitive damages,attorney fees,and other relief.after a trial,the bankruptcy court entered a december order finding that zokaites had violated the stay and granting the lansaws request for an injunction.although the bankruptcy court heard testimony related to emotional distress,it did not make a ruling on damages or attorney fees in its memorandum opinion.see lansaw zokaites in re lansaw lansaw i,bankr.
the lansaws again raised the issue of damages before the bankruptcy court in february.this time,they did so in a counterclaim to zokaites proof of claim in the main bankruptcy case.this counterclaim for damages,however,also went unresolved.approximately five years later,in december,the main bankruptcy case was reassigned to the honorable thomas agresti.after a status conference revealed that the counterclaim for damages was yet to be settled,the bankruptcy court determined that the best way to resolve the issue was to initiate a new adversary proceeding 
the new adversary proceeding,now before us in the present case,was tried in august.at the outset of the trial,the bankruptcy court noted it was building on what the previous judge had already found in,namely,that zokaites had willfully violated the automatic stay.lansaw ii,wl,at.the previous judge,however,had not made definitive findings with regard to certain details of those violations,so the bankruptcy court again heard testimony regarding the violations.id.at.
the lansaws also presented evidence of emotional distress,which the bankruptcy court summarized as follows 
the only evidence that the lansaws presented as to emotional stress was their own testimony,though that was often compelling.lansaw testified that she continues to have nightmares about zokaites entering the building and taking her business away.after these experiences she sometimes wakes up screaming and crying.she stated that when she is out in public and happens to see someone who looks like zokaites she can experience moments of sheer fear.she testified that she has lost trust in others and this has affected her relationship with friends.she is taking prescription medication for depression and an ulcer,conditions which she attributes to stress from zokaites,beginning with an incident prior to the stay violations and continuing thereafter.she felt physically threatened when zokaites entered her office on august,and backed her up to a wall.lansaw acknowledged that she has not sought psychological counseling,but said she is considering doing so.
lansaw testified about the effects on his wife that he has observed.he said that she has changed markedly since the incidents involving zokaites.she just goes to work and comes home,rarely going out in public,avoiding human contact,and not enjoying life.he testified to similar effects on himself,stating that he has become very withdrawn and has a fear of making new friendships.he testified that he has only one friend who understands what he has gone through and he has no one else to talk to about it.
id.at citations omitted.the bankruptcy court found this testimony credible and also noted that it was consistent with the previous judge decision.the decision states that lansaw was in tears in her various appearances before the court and during her testimony.lansaw i,at.
the bankruptcy court found that zokaites stay violations caused the lansaws at least some emotional distress.in so finding,the bankruptcy court considered the lansaws credible testimony,the egregious nature of zokaites violations,and the trial notes made and docketed by the previous judge.the bankruptcy court,however,acknowledged that factors other than zokaites stay violations also contributed to the lansaws emotional distress.as a result,the bankruptcy court discounted the actual damages award,lansaw ii,wl,at,ultimately awarding the lansaws for their emotional distress and in attorney fees.the bankruptcy court also awarded the lansaws in punitive damages.
zokaites appealed to the district court,which affirmed.zokaites filed this timely appeal.

zokaites argues that the lansaws introduced insufficient evidence to support an award of damages under k.that statute provides,with an exception not applicable here,that an individual injured by any willful violation of a stay provided by this section shall recover actual damages,including costs and attorneys fees,and,in appropriate circumstances,may recover punitive damages.k emphasis added accordingly,as a threshold matter,we must first determine whether the term actual damages under k authorizes recovery for emotional distress.we conclude that it does,as discussed below.we then turn to whether the lansaws presented sufficient evidence to support damages.
because the term actual damages has a quality,we can not rely on any definition but must consider the particular context in which the term appears.faa cooper.the term has been interpreted in some contexts to include damages for emotional distress and,in others,to only authorize damages for financial harm.id.at collecting cases.this court has not yet had occasion to address whether,in the context of k,the term actual damages includes damages.
we do not,however,write upon a blank slate zokaites cites to numerous decisions by other courts considering the issue.three circuits have expressly concluded that,under k damages are available for willful violations of the automatic stay.see lodge kondaur capital,cir.dawson washington mut.bank,in re dawson,cir,abrogation on other grounds recognized in gugliuzza ftc in re gugliuzza,wl,at cir,fleet mortg,kaneb,cir.two circuits have left open the possibility that damages may be available in some circumstances.see young repine in re repine,cir.aiello providian fin,cir.and one district court has rejected the notion that damages are available as actual damages under the statute.see united states harchar,ohio.we consider three representative decisions in turn.
in harchar,the northern district of ohio noted that k is indisputably an ambiguous statute with a dearth of legislative history.id.the court further noted that k was not enacted with the automatic stay in rather,t he act provided no mechanism for enforcement of the automatic stay perhaps due to congress expectation that enforcement would continue via procedures for contempt of court.id.at.indeed,prior to the automatic stay codification in,contempt was the accepted procedure for enforcement of stay violations.id.
the harchar court noted,however,that questions surrounded the propriety of bankruptcy judges enforcing the automatic stay now a creature of statute and not court order through contempt procedures.id.at r eliance on contempt power to remedy violations of had been widely criticized.quoting pertuso ford motor credit,cir.further,the court noted that the constitutional authority of bankruptcy judges to use contempt procedures was cast into doubt after the supreme court decision in northern pipeline construction marathon pipe line.harchar,at.the court inferred that these circumstances informed congress decision to enact k because the provision was enacted as part of the bankruptcy amendments and federal judgeship act of id.the court therefore concluded,t here can be little doubt that when k was enacted in,congress was concerned not with providing debtors compensation for emotional harms,but with providing explicit statutory authorization for the only previously available remedy for a stay violation contempt.id.quoting in re bivens,bankr.ohio.additionally,the court stated,there is little indication that awarding damages for emotional harm was commonplace under the bankruptcy court traditional contempt procedures.id.
given this history of the contempt remedy,congress demonstrated ability to clearly authorize damages,and congress waiver of sovereign immunity under the statute,the harchar court held that damages were not available under k.id.at.in so doing,the court acknowledged congress intended,at least in part,that the automatic stay protect against psychological harm.id.at.but,the court reasoned,k provisions authorizing punitive damages and attorneys fees would effectively address congress concerns about emotional harm and that it was incumbent upon congress to explicit ly reference emotional pain or mental anguish if it intended to authorize damages as compensatory damages.id.at.
in aiello,the seventh circuit was skeptical of a bankruptcy court ability to award damages,but it left open the possibility that such damages might be available under k.the court noted that the automatic stay is a recent codification of the power of courts to stay collection efforts a power that originated long before the courts grew more confident of their ability to sift and value claims of emotional distress.aiello,at.according to that court,the automatic stay protection is financial in character it is not protection of peace of mind.id.at.the court further reasoned,there is no indication that congress meant to change the fundamental character of bankruptcy remedies by enacting k.id.at.and,the court noted,nothing prohibits a debtor from bringing a suit under state tort law for emotional injury.see id.at.the court therefore concluded that t he office of k is not to redress tort violations but to protect the rights conferred by the automatic stay.id.
nevertheless,the seventh circuit theorized that considerations of judicial economy might permit an award for emotional distress under k where the plaintiff is already seeking damages for financial injury.id.noting that no such financial injury was alleged in the case before it,the court held that the plaintiff in aiello was not entitled to damages for the defendant willful violation of the automatic stay.id.
the ninth circuit came to yet a different conclusion in dawson.there,the court concluded that pecuniary loss is not required in order to claim emotional distress damages under the statute.dawson,at emphasis added.in coming to this conclusion,the court found it necessary to turn to the legislative history behind the provision.see id.at.quoting extensively from the house report for the bankruptcy reform act of,the court emphasized that congress enacted the automatic stay not only to provide creditors financial protection,but also to provide the debtor a breathing spell from his creditors.it stops all collection efforts,all harassment,and all foreclosure actions.it permits the debtor to attempt a repayment or reorganization plan,or simply to be relieved of the financial pressures that drove him into bankruptcy.id.at emphasis added quoting,at,as reprinted in,see also.med.ctr.sullivan in re.med.ctr,cir.quoting the same language.
the ninth circuit further noted congress concern with creditor collection tactics,which can take the form of abusive phone calls at all hours,including at work,threats of court action,attacks on the debtor reputation,and so on.the automatic stay at the commencement of the case takes the pressure off the debtor.dawson,at quoting,at.accordingly,the court reasoned 
reading the legislative history as a whole,we are convinced that congress was concerned not only with financial loss,but also at least in part with the emotional and psychological toll that a violation of a stay can exact from an individual.because congress meant for the automatic stay to protect more than financial interests,it makes sense to conclude that harm done to those interests by a violation are cognizable as actual damages.we conclude,then,that the actual damages that may be recovered by an individual who is injured by a willful violation of the automatic stay include damages for emotional distress.
id.at citation and footnote omitted.
we find dawson to be the better approach.as the harchar court noted,k is indisputably an ambiguous statute with a dearth of legislative history.at.the best way to resolve this dilemma is not to make inferences from the doubts surrounding the general authority of bankruptcy courts in,see id.at,but rather to look to the specific interests that congress intended to protect when it enacted the provision just a few years earlier,see dawson,at.we conclude,like the dawson and harchar courts,that congress intended the automatic stay to protect both financial and interests.and,with those interests in mind,we join a growing number of circuits by expressly concluding that actual damages under k include damages for emotional distress resulting from a willful violation of the automatic stay see dawson,at lodge,at fleet,at.
of course,we acknowledge that the legislative history for the automatic stay,enacted in,does not directly address k,which was enacted in.nonetheless,the automatic stay legislative history remains instructive if the automatic stay was meant to protect against emotional harm,it is only logical that congress would intend to include damages resulting from that harm when it introduced the award of actual damages as the enforcement mechanism six years later.for the same reason,we disagree with the harchar and aiello courts that there is no indication congress intended to break from past bankruptcy practice.by seeking to protect against emotional harm with the automatic stay and by enacting the actual damages enforcement provision soon thereafter,congress sufficiently indicated a departure from any prior practice that may have neglected emotional harms resulting from stay violations.see hamilton lanning,w e will not read the bankruptcy code to erode past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indication that congress intended such a departure.quoting travelers cas.surety of am.pac.gas.further,while the harchar court concluded that congress concerns about harms would be effectively addressed through the provision for punitive damages and attorneys fees,see at,we see no reason to infer that congress intended to distinguish between the pecuniary and injuries when it adopted a system of compensatory damages as a means of enforcing stay violations.
finally,we need not and do not decide whether financial injury is a necessary predicate to recovery for emotional distress under the statute.unlike the plaintiff in aiello,the lansaws incurred financial injury in the form of attorneys fees when they sought to enjoin further violations of the stay by zokaites.see aiello,at see also k a n individual injured by any willful violation of a stay shall recover actual damages,including costs and attorneys fees emphasis added 
having determined that k authorizes the award of damages,we consider what evidence is required to support such an award.zokaites argues that the lansaws should have been required to provide medical documentation or expert medical testimony to support their claims of emotional distress.according to zokaites,this medical evidence was necessary to corroborate the lansaws testimony that they experienced emotional distress and that this distress was in fact caused by zokaites stay violations.zokaites further argues that,given the lack of this evidence,the bankruptcy court award was too speculative.
depending on the circumstances of each individual case,corroborating medical evidence may be required to prove emotional harm and causation.but we decline to adopt a rule requiring such evidence to prove damages under k.as we have concluded in the context of other federal statutes,we see no reason to require that a specific type of evidence be introduced to demonstrate injury in the form of emotional distress.bolden se.transp,cir.considering the evidence required to prove emotional distress in cases see also cortez trans union,llc,cir.declining,in the context of the fair credit reporting act,to adopt a standard requiring a degree of specificity which may include corroborating testimony or medical or psychological evidence in support of the damage award for emotional distress quoting cousin trans union,cir.and we agree with the bankruptcy court that,at least where a stay violation is patently egregious,a claimant credible testimony alone can be sufficient to support an award of damages.see dawson,at.we are confident that courts can ensure that plaintiffs recover only for actual injury even in the absence of expert medical testimony in such cases.bolden,at.
we conclude,moreover,that the lansaws presented sufficient evidence of emotional distress to support the bankruptcy court award.testimony at trial demonstrated that zokaites willfully and egregiously violated the automatic stay.on one occasion,zokaites arrived at the lansaws business a daycare during business hours and,after he was initially denied entry,entered the daycare,backed lansaw against the wall,and asked her three times whether she wanted to hit him.on another occasion,zokaites chained the doors to the daycare albeit on a weekend and refused to unchain the doors unless the lansaws reaffirmed their lease with zokaites.and,on yet another occasion,zokaites attempted to have the lansaws lease with their new landlord terminated.
in short,zokaites did not violate the stay with a mere collections call rather,he repeatedly at times,physically and in the presence of children entrusted to the lansaws care attempted to intimidate the lansaws.the bankruptcy court found the lansaws testimony on these incidents credible and dismissed zokaites testimony as attempting to downplay or mitigate the seriousness of his misconduct.lansaw ii,wl,at.we can not,as a result,say that the bankruptcy court clearly erred in finding that zokaites violations were so egregious that a reasonable person in the position of the lansaws would be expected to suffer some psychological harm as a result of what happened.id.at.
neither can we say that the bankruptcy court clearly erred in finding zokaites stay violations did in fact cause emotional harm.zokaites lists numerous stressors,a carbon monoxide poisoning incident,legal problems with a child,zokaites conduct,and the inherent stress of bankruptcy that may have caused the lansaws emotional distress.he argues that,absent extrinsic evidence linking the stay violations to the lansaws emotional distress,the bankruptcy court could not make a determination that his stay violations,rather than the stressors,caused the distress.emotional distress,however,need not be so thinly sliced.lansaw was not required,as a matter of causation,to establish with absolute precision what degree her depression was caused by the stay violations.as the bankruptcy court acknowledged,numerous stressors contributed to the lansaws emotional distress and linking the stay violations to specific manifestations of that distress was likely impossible.it is sufficient that zokaites stay violations were so egregious that a reasonable person could be expected to suffer some emotional harm and that the lansaws credibly testified that the violations did cause such harm.
of course,as a matter of damages,plaintiffs like the lansaws will be more successful when they can link the stay violations to the entirety of their distress.in the present case,for example,the bankruptcy court found it necessar
