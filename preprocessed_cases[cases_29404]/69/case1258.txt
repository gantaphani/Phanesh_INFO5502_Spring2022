abercrombie fitch interlocutorily appeals the district court denial of abercrombie motion for a preliminary injunction enjoining moose creek,from using newly designed moose marks pending the resolution of abercrombie suit alleging trademark infringement and other causes of action under federal and state law.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
background 
this is the second time in four years that trademark litigation between these parties has reached this forum.the first litigation began in,when moose creek filed a trademark infringement action alleging that abercrombie silhouette moose logo was confusingly similar to moose creek moose marks.moose creek sought but was denied a preliminary injunction against abercrombie use of its logo.see moose creek,abercrombie fitch,d.we affirmed.moose creek,abercrombie fitch.cir.
in,during the pendency of the action,abercrombie developed and began using a new mark,the outline moose logo,in addition to its silhouette moose logo.since then,abercrombie has often used these two logos as the only outwardly visible indicator of origin on a large share of its apparel.
the parties settled moose creek suit in august.the settlement agreement included provisions that the parties would retain the rights to use their respective moose marks,that they would not use each other marks,and that moose creek would no longer use its moose creek polo moose mark or any colorable imitation thereof.
in august,abercrombie became aware of moose creek use of two new logos,a moose silhouette and a moose outline.abercrombie filed suit against moose creek on september,alleging federal trademark infringement,unfair competition,and false designation of origin under the lanham act,et,and trademark infringement,unfair competition,unjust enrichment,and breach of contract under california common law.
abercrombie moved to enjoin moose creek use of its new marks pending resolution of the action.the district court found a number of abercrombie arguments to be contrary to its position in the prior litigation and thus barred by judicial estoppel.the court also found that the differences between the parties marks outweighed the similarities.concluding that abercrombie had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on either its trademark or breach of contract claims,the district court denied abercrombie motion for a preliminary injunction.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.brookfield commc ns,coast entm t,cir.under this standard,reversal is appropriate only if the district court based its decision on clearly erroneous findings of fact or erroneous legal principles.id.at.
to obtain a preliminary injunction in a trademark case,a plaintiff must demonstrate either a combination of probable success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury or the existence of serious questions going to the merits and that the balance of hardships tips sharply in his favor.id.irreparable injury is ordinarily presumed upon a showing of a likelihood of success.id.at.
the core element of trademark infringement is the likelihood of confusion,whether the similarity of the marks is likely to confuse customers about the source of the products.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.in amf sleekcraft boats,we listed eight factors relevant to determining the likelihood of confusion between related goods strength of the mark proximity of the goods similarity of the marks evidence of actual confusion marketing channels used type of goods and the degree of care likely to be exercised by the purchaser defendant intent in selecting the mark and likelihood of expansion of the product lines,cir,abrogation in part on other grounds recognized by mattel,walking mountain,cir.
judicial estoppel 
abercrombie challenges the district court application of judicial estoppel to abercrombie arguments regarding three of the sleekcraft factors and confusion.we review the district court application of judicial estoppel for abuse of discretion.see hamilton state farm fire cas,cir.
several factors typically inform a court decision whether to apply judicial estoppel.first,a party later position must be clearly inconsistent with its earlier position.new hampshire maine,d.second,courts often inquire whether the party achieved success in the prior proceeding,as judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the perception that either the first or the second court was misled.id.quoting edwards aetna life ins,cir.third,courts consider whether,if not estopped,the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the other party.id.at.
strength of the mark 
the district court barred abercrombie arguments regarding the strength of its mark,the first sleekcraft factor.in the prior litigation,abercrombie successfully persuaded the district court that moose creek mark,though arbitrary and thus presumptively strong,must nonetheless be classified as weak due to the crowded field of similar marks.moose creek,d at.the court therefore estopped abercrombie from arguing that the field was not crowded,finding abercrombie position that the competitive framework for the dispute and the competition that exists in the had changed to be entirely different from its previous position.
however,the district court failed to recognize that the relevant fields in the two litigations differ in both scope and size.previously,when moose creek was the senior mark holder,the field included competitors using both marks including moose images and marks including the word moose.as abercrombie is now the senior mark holder,however,the field includes only competitors whose marks incorporate moose images.in light of this reduction in scope of relevant competitors and marks,the corresponding field is less crowded.furthermore,abercrombie presented evidence that its trademark enforcement had resulted in several competitors abandoning their use of moose images.it was not clearly inconsistent for abercrombie to assert that the field is now less crowded.the district court contrary holding and estoppel of abercrombie arguments was an abuse of discretion.
marketing channels used,likelihood of expansion of the product lines 
the district court also estopped abercrombie arguments regarding the fifth and eighth sleekcraft factors,marketing channels used and the likelihood of expansion of the product lines.noting abercrombie prior position that it and moose creek focused on different customers,the court rejected abercrombie attempts to show that moose creek had since expanded its customer base to include.
abercrombie presents two pieces of evidence to distinguish its position on this issue from the prior litigation moose creek sale of products to penny and moose creek reorientation of its website as an apparent online store listing retail rather than wholesale prices.however,penny,like moose creek other customers,is a retailer,and at the time of the district court decision,moose creek website stated that its web store is currently under construction and for products demo only.emphasis added.these fail to rebut the determination of clear inconsistency.the application of judicial estoppel on this issue was not an abuse of discretion.
degree of care likely to be exercised by the purchaser 
abercrombie also appeals the court estoppel of abercrombie arguments regarding the degree of care likely to be exercised by the purchaser,part of the sixth sleekcraft factor.in the previous litigation,abercrombie argued that moose creek buyers were sophisticated and exercised a high degree of care,militating against the likelihood of confusion.moose creek,d at.on that basis,the district court estopped abercrombie from arguing that the relevant buyers exercise a lesser degree of care.this was an abuse of discretion.
different purchasers were relevant to each suit.in the prior litigation,the relevant purchasers were moose creek,who were professional commercial clothing buyers.id.at.here,the relevant purchasers are not professional buyers,but abercrombie ordinary customers the two gr
