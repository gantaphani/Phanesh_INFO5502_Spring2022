spectrum worldwide,spectrum worldwide,celebrity products direct,and celebrity products,collectively celebrity,spectrum worldwide president murray moss moss,ceo lisa tremain tremain,and cfo howard schwartz schwartz all of the defendants hereinafter referred to as spectrum asks this court to determine whether the first publication exclusion found in the united national insurance company united excess insurance policy applies to infringement claims.we hold that it does.additionally,because spectrum presents us with a legal position that is clearly inconsistent with the position it took and benefitted from in previous litigation,judicial estoppel prevents us from allowing spectrum to argue that it first published infringing material after purchasing its excess insurance coverage.further,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it held schwartz and tremain jointly and severally liable for repayment of united contribution.
in december,sunset health products,sunset hired spectrum to advertise and distribute the hollywood miracle diet drink miracle diet.soon thereafter,tremain and schwartz formed celebrity to market and sell a similar product,the original hollywood celebrity diet drink celebrity diet.spectrum then terminated its contract with sunset and began marketing celebrity diet.
in december,and again in march,sunset demanded that spectrum cease infringing on its miracle diet trademark.in october,sunset filed a trade dress infringement claim against spectrum,alleging that spectrum deliberately made celebrity diet packaging and labeling so similar to miracle diet that it confused consumers and damaged sunset reputation the sunset action.sunset applied for a temporary restraining order tro,wherein it asked district judge nora manella to compare sunset label to spectrum and labels to determine that spectrum label constituted an immediate harm to sunset.in,sunset miracle diet label prominently featured the word hollywood,contained the phrase lose up to lbs.in hours,and included palm trees,gold stars,and set on a background sunset label.spectrum initially sold celebrity diet under a label featuring very similar phrasing,but set against a black background with a large gold star spectrum label.in,spectrum changed celebrity diet label,sporting the same large gold star and phrasing,but switching to a background featuring searchlights spectrum label.in may,spectrum again altered celebrity diet label,changing the font and style of the word hollywood to look more like the hollywood hills sign,and modified the star and searchlights spectrum label.
judge manella granted the tro based on the dramatic change between spectrum and labels.in the subsequent preliminary injunction hearing,however,spectrum argued that it changed its label in,and that its label was so similar to its label that sunset was not in danger of experiencing immediate harm.judge manella accepted spectrum position,and denied sunset preliminary injunction action on this basis.spectrum therefore continued profiting from the sale of celebrity diet,while deepening potential insurers liability.
in,united also issued spectrum a one million dollar excess third party liability policy the united policy related to an underlying policy issued by monticello insurance company the monticello policy.united policy became effective on april,and is subject to definitions,terms,conditions,exclusions and limitations contained in the monticello policy,which indemnifies spectrum for damages resulting from advertising injury liability,meaning injury arising from 
oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person or organization goods,products,or services 
oral or written publication of material that violates a person right of privacy 
misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business 
infringement of copyright,title or slogan.
the united policy does not,however,apply to an advertising injury arising out of oral or written publication of material whose first publication took place before the beginning of the policy period.
after subsequent hearings on for summary judgment in the sunset action,the parties were left with sunset core infringement claim.spectrum and sunset then settled the sunset action for a total of paid to sunset,funded by spectrum insurers.united contributed to the settlement,pursuant to its obligations under the united policy.
united sought reimbursement of its settlement contribution through a complaint filed against spectrum on june.united moved for summary judgment,arguing that the united policy first publication exclusion eliminated its indemnification obligations.finding the first publication exclusion generally applicable to infringement claims,the district court nonetheless denied united motion on september,because triable issues of fact prevented the court from determining whether spectrum offending actions occurred prior to the united policy effective date.
united moved for reconsideration,based on its claim that sunset advertising injury had already been determined by judge manella in the sunset action.after reviewing judge manella findings,the district court reconsidered and granted united motion for summary judgment,holding that spectrum label formed the substance of sunset advertising injury,and therefore that the first publication exclusion eliminates united liability.the district court entered a judgment against spectrum worldwide,schwartz,and tremain in the amount of plus interest.spectrum moved for reconsideration,arguing first that the district court should not have relied upon judge manella previous findings,and second that schwartz and tremain should not have been included in the judgment.the district court denied spectrum motion on may.spectrum filed a notice of appeal on june,and satisfied the judgment.
we review de novo a district court decision to grant summary judgment.thomas city of beaverton,cir.we do not weigh the evidence or determine the truth of the matter,but only determine whether there is a genuine issue of fact for trial.see balint carson city,cir.we may affirm on any basis supported by the record,valdez rosenbaum,cir.
spectrum argues that the united policy first publication exclusion does not apply to sunset infringement claim,because first publication exclusions do not apply to infringement actions in california and even if the clause applies to infringement actions,summary judgment was not proper to determine whether spectrum first published infringing material before the united policy took effect.we find that the united policy unambiguously applies to infringement actions,and summary judgment is proper to determine the date of first publication in this case,because spectrum is judicially estopped from presenting and prevailing on inconsistent arguments before the district courts.
