defendants motion to dismiss and plaintiff response 
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint,arguing that plaintiff claims were barred by the economic loss doctrine.although they did not dispute that they were licensed professionals and that they provided professional services,they contended that,under vermont law,the professional services exception does not apply in the absence of contractual privity between a plaintiff and defendant.supp.

c.the economic loss rule 
applicable law 
vermont has adopted the economic loss rule,which prohibits recovery under tort for economic losses which are not also accompanied by tangible,physical harm.see breslauer fayston sch,citing prosser keeton on the law of torts,at ed.as the vermont supreme court has put it,n egligence law does not generally recognize a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid intangible economic loss to another unless one conduct has inflicted some accompanying physical harm.springfield hydroelectric,at internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original.the rule is intended to maintain the distinction between tort law and contract law,as c ontract principles are generally more appropriate for determining claims for consequential damage that parties have,or could have,addressed in their agreement.id.internal quotation marks omitted.t he rule serves to maintain the boundary between contract law,which is designed to enforce parties contractual expectations,and tort law,which is designed to protect citizens and their property by imposing a general duty of reasonable care.hamill pawtucket mut.ins.
vermont recognizes an exception to the economic loss rule where the parties have a special relationship,which creates a duty of care independent of contract obligations.ebws,at.in particular,the vermont supreme court has suggested,a special relationship may exist where one party has a professional duty to the other.id.this analysis,the state court has said,does not turn on whether one is licensed in a particular field rather,the determining factor is the type of relationship created between the parties.id.at.in an earlier case discussing but not then adopting the special relationship exception,vermont had noted that other courts require a special relationship sufficient to compel the conclusion that the tortfeasor had a duty to the particular plaintiff and that the injury complained of was clearly foreseeable to the tortfeasor this turns on whether there is a duty of care independent of any contractual obligations.springfield hydroelectric,at internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted.
