this appeal from the denial of a preliminary injunction stems from an business arrangement between direct merchants,dmsa and lillian santiago bauzá santiago to publish a bilingual newspaper in western massachusetts.certain of the facts are contested but what follows is the basic outline of events.
santiago through a corporation she formed with her husband and two other individuals published a bilingual newspaper,named diálogo bilingue,in western massachusetts from june to june.that paper operated at a loss,and in june of she and dmsa through its managing director,gerry pike entered into discussions and on june,signed agreements to form the joint venture diálogo,llc,also a in this law suit.diálogo,llc published a bilingual newspaper in massachusetts,el diálogo,beginning in july and superintended by santiago.
the first agreement between the parties,the venture agreement is a agreement that sets out in broad strokes the parties intention to form diálogo,llc.it appears from other documents that dmsa was intended to have a percent interest and santiago a percent interest in the new venture.the venture agreement provides that dmsa shall contribute the initial capital to launch the llc in an amount that dmsa deems appropriate.the venture agreement references the operating agreement,the other controlling document.
the operating agreement provides a detailed description of the functioning of the company,the parties duties,and,relevant to this dispute,includes a schedule a on which it details the parties capital contributions by santiago,and by dmsa.section i of the operating agreement states e ach member has contributed or is deemed to have contributed to the capital of the company the amount set forth opposite the member name on schedule a attached hereto.
in late february or march,santiago notified pike by letter that she was clos ing the business effective immediately.she then continued,and continues today,to publish el diálogo through a new business incorporated on march,diálogo,llc,also a in this lawsuit.both parties agree that the newspaper santiago is currently publishing is the same as the newspaper the parties published together beginning in july.
dmsa position,in the present law suit initiated in federal district court on march,is that santiago has absconded with their jointly owned business.dmsa amended complaint comprises sixteen counts including claims for trademark infringement,misappropriation of trade secrets,and breach of contract.in addition to other relief,dmsa sought a preliminary injunction preventing santiago from using the title el diálogo,disclosing any proprietary information,or using the physical assets of diálogo,llc.
for her part,santiago claims that dmsa breached the contract between the parties at some point prior to her letter dissolving the business,thus ending in her view her obligations to the business and under the agreements.she further claims that any trademark rights in el diálogo are rightfully hers based on her first use of the mark diálogo in june and the absence in her view of any transfer or assignment of the trademark to dmsa or diálogo,llc by the agreements or otherwise.
at the hearing on the motion for preliminary injunction,the district judge heard argument,considered the affidavits and depositions of the two main players,pike and santiago,and denied temporary relief.the judge ruled that dmsa had not met its burden of showing that the trademark el diálogo was rightfully its property,finding that santiago had been the first user of the diálogo mark.thus,said the judge,dmsa was not likely to succeed on the merits of its trademark claim.there was little discussion of the state law claims 
on this interlocutory appeal,permitted by statute,a,dmsa argument is that it was entitled to a preliminary injunction.although the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction is often said to be reviewed for abuse of discretion,of warwick,baccarat,cir,a more complete statement is that issues of law are reviewed de novo,factual findings for clear error,and most other,balancing of factors,even law varying degrees of deference depending upon the circumstances.langlois abington housing,cir pub.serv.of new hampshire patch,cir.
to obtain a preliminary injunction,the usual precondition is a showing by the movant of a probability that it will prevail on the merits when the case is tried,at.there are exceptions,but only in unusual circumstances not present here.see patch,at.even with a probability of success,the movant is also normally required to show irreparable injury absent an injunction,the preliminary injunction being an equitable remedy,see grupo mexicano de desarrollo,alliance bond fund,d and the court also weighs the equities and any public interest considerations for or against the injunction,at.
dmsa first aim is to show a likelihood of success on the merits.it says that it is likely to prevail first on its claims of misappropriation of the business breach of contract,theft of trade secrets,and violation of fiduciary duty,and second under the lanham act on an infringement claim because of santiago use of the name el diálogo.a.dmsa also advances a third claim based on.laws ch,which provides for multiple damages and attorneys fees for certain classes of aggravated commercial wrongdoing.
ordinarily a who walks off with the business,which may well be what happened in this case,is likely to be civilly liable but santiago main defense is that dmsa breached its own commitments by failing to make contributions required under the agreements already described.it might be debatable whether such a breach automatically entitles one side to seize the business,see donuts donuts,d,but instead dmsa present position is simply that it made all of the contributions required of it,through services and assets,even if not in cash.
the documents and background events are less easy to interpret than dmsa suggests but even if we assumed de novo review in the absence of any discussion of the state claims by the district court and further assumed dubitante that dmsa might well prevail,the misappropriation claims look like ones for which remedies at law would be sufficient.nor does dmsa explain why they would not be sufficient to address most of its claims its irreparable injury claims relate to the lanham act and chapter,which we will now address in turn.
dmsa lanham act claim is that diálogo,llc owns the trademark el diálogo and that santiago new company is misappropriating the mark for its newspaper.the district court found,at least on a preliminary basis,that santiago would likely prevail by showing that she had earlier used the name diálogo bilingue for her own newspaper she says that her earlier paper effectively utilized diálogo as its trademark and that she never assigned that name to the new view that the district court may have adopted again,on a preliminary basis.
dmsa says that conflation of the two marks violates a principle,little caesar,pizza caesar,cir,and that anyway santiago abandoned the earlier trademark.however,dmsa strongest argument is that,whatever the relationship between the two trademarks,santiago implicitly brought to the new venture whatever interest she had in the diálogo name the district court thought otherwise and provided an explanation.anyway,even if there were a likelihood of success on this issue,there does not appear to be irreparable injury.
although there is law to the effect that irreparable injury is presumed in infringement cases where the plaintiff shows a likelihood of success,american bd.of psychiatry neurology,cir,this case does not fit the mold.at least may be fairly likely where two businesses are vying for the same customers using the same trademark or two marks that can be confused with one another.there,every customer diverted to a defendant may be an undetectable loss,even a permanent one,to the plaintiff.thus,a presumption of irreparable injury makes some sense.
this case is quite different.here,from dmsa own version of events,santiago is conducting the diálogo,llc business under her new company name and dmsa is publishing no similar newspaper.dmsa does not claim that s
