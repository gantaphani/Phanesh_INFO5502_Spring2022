aero products international,aero products and robert chaffee collectively aero sued intex recreation intex,quality trading,quality trading,and stores,collectively defendants in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois for infringement of patent the patent and for infringement of aero registered trademark one touch.following a jury trial,the district court entered judgment of infringement and in favor of aero with respect to the asserted claims of the patent and with respect to aero trademark claim.based upon that judgment,the court awarded aero damages in the total amount of million.see aero prods.int l,intex rec,c,dist.lexis,order denying new damages trial.the total damages award was based on the jury finding that aero was entitled to recover million as patent infringement damages,which the district court doubled based upon the jury finding of willful infringement,aero prods.int l,intex rec,c,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.july,order awarding enhanced damages,and million as trademark infringement damages.see order denying new damages trial,dist.lexis,at.in addition,the district court entered a permanent injunction in favor of aero.aero prods.int l,intex rec,c,wl,dist.lexis,aero prods.int l,intex rec,c,wl,dist.lexis.
defendants now appeal from the court judgment.we see no error in the judgment of infringement and in favor of aero.we do conclude,however,that,in the circumstances of this case,the award of both patent infringement and trademark infringement damages in favor of aero represents an impermissible double recovery.accordingly,we vacate the award of million in trademark infringement damages in favor of aero.we thus,and remand to the district court for entry of a final judgment in favor of aero consistent with this opinion.
background 
the invention claimed in the patent relates to inflatable support systems,which may include air mattresses,and inflation and control thereof.patent.the aspect of the invention that is the focus of this appeal is the claimed valve assembly.it is by means of the valve assembly that the air mattress is inflated and remains inflated,to.
figure of the patent shows a of the valve assembly.
describing the operation of the valve assembly shown in figure,the specification states that i nflation is provided to the mattress by means of the inflation input having exterior threads,to.the specification further states that a ir pressure at the inflation input causes the downward displacement of diaphragm away from its valve seat,thereby permitting air flow through the first cylinder via the triangular passageways.after the mattress has been inflated to the desired extent and air pressure is removed from inflation input,the pressure of air in the mattress urges the diaphragm against valve seat and produces a positive seal against the exit of air from the mattress.thus,the valve assembly is described as dual,because it i controls the flow of air into the mattress and ii operates to keep air in the mattress once the mattress is inflated.
figure of the patent shows a of an alternative embodiment of the valve assembly.it includes a coupling labeled and an inflation input labeled.
the specification states that,in this embodiment,a circular coupling includes an open end that constitutes the inflation input.it also has a flared end that provides the valve seat in the form of a circular lip.the specification further states that i t can be seen that the diaphragm can be accessed by an individual directly from the inflation input and can be pushed axially into an open position.figure below shows a top view of the embodiment in figure,with the cover assembly in a closed position.the figure shows an inflation input labeled 
the specification explains that,as shown in figure,the inflation input may be provided with a bayonette mount or other means for affixing an inflation device.
five claims of the patent are at issue claim and claims through.claims and are independent claims.independent claim states 
an inflatable support system,comprising 
an inflatable body having an interior,an exterior,and inflation input for transfer of air between the interior and exterior and 
a valve,disposed between the interior and the inflation input,for controlling the transfer of air,providing a substantially hermetic seal under low pressure conditions,such valve including 
a passageway having a general circular cross section and a first end in communication with the interior and a second end in communication with the inflation input 
a circular lip,disposed peripherally in the passageway and protruding radially inward,having a first surface generally facing the interior,defining a valve seat 
a flexible circular diaphragm,having an interior surface generally facing the interior and an outer surface facing away from the interior mounted for axial movement in the passageway away from and against the valve seat in respectively open and closed positions of the valve,so that an outer annular region of the outer surface of the diaphragm engages against the valve seat in the closed position and 
a generally circular coupling defining the passageway,the coupling having an open end defining the inflation input and a flared end,contiguous therewith,providing the circular lip,so that the i the coupling at the open end has a smaller internal diameter than at the flared end and ii the diaphragm can be pushed axially to open the valve by reaching into the open end of the coupling.
to.independent claim of the patent states 
an inflatable body comprising 
an inflatable bladder having an interior and an inflation input 
a valve disposed between the interior and the inflation input providing a substantially hermetic seal under low pressure conditions,such valve including 
a passageway having a generally circular cross section and a first end in communication with the interior and a second end in communication with the inflation input 
a circular lip,disposed peripherally in the passageway and protruding radially inward,having a first surface generally facing the interior,defining a valve seat 
a flexible circular diaphragm,having an inner surface generally facing the interior and an outer surface facing away from the interior,mounted for axial movement in the passageway away from and against the valve seat in the respectively open and closed positions of the valve,so that i the act of inflation of the bladder under low pressure is sufficient to cause axial motion of the valve into the open position to permit the large influx of air and ii following inflation of the bladder,air pressure created in the interior of the bladder by inflation thereof causes an outer annular region of the outer surface of the diaphragm to be urged into engagement against the valve seat to provide a complete hermetic seal when the valve is in the closed position and 
stiffening means for reducing flexing of the diaphragm except in its outer annular region.
dependent claims depend on independent claim.
aero products sells inflatable air mattresses.in,chaffee licensed his technology to aero products.the patent number is marked on the mattress aero products sells,as well as on the product packaging,related documentation in the form of sell sheets,and instructions.to help market its products,aero products coined the term one touch.aero first used one touch in november of.it registered the trademark with the united states patent and trademark office in june of.trademark reg.the mark one touch appears on commercial embodiments of the invention of the patent.
intex also sells inflatable air mattresses.intex introduced its accused air mattresses in and sold them to retailers such as quality trading and,who in turn sold them to the public.intex used the term one touch on its website,and one touch was also used on quality trading website.
on april,aero sued defendants.aero claimed that the intex air mattress infringed the patent and that and quality trading sold the infringing air mattresses.it also claimed that defendants infringed aero products trademark one touch.after aero filed suit,intex sought an opinion of counsel regarding infringement.rod berman,the opining attorney,issued a noninfringement opinion on august.
as far as the alleged patent infringement was concerned,the dispute between the parties focused on whether intex air mattress met the limitations of claims and of the patent relating to the inflation and sealing of the claimed mattress.the part of the accused device that relates to inflation of the intex mattress is depicted below 
the relevant parts of the accused device are the pump,the cylinder,the exterior of the mattress,the interior of the mattress,the valve,the short inner cylinder,and the diaphragm.in the accused device,air enters the valve through the pump,which is on the exterior of the mattress.
on november,a markman hearing was held on the disputed meanings of inflation input in claim and complete hermetic seal in claim.aero prods.int l,intex rec,c,wl,dist.lexis,markman order.aero argued that inflation input meant the point at which air enters the passageway.according to aero,as used in claims and,the term passageway refers to a way that allows a passage of air to and from the interior of the bed.defendants position was that inflation input should be construed as the end of the coupling or passageway most distal from the interior of the air mattress.in advancing this construction,defendants argued that,as used in claims and,the term passageway refers to a path that runs along the entire length of the coupling.
aero argued that the complete hermetic seal in claim of the patent is a seal that does not require any additional parts to retain nearly or largely all of the air in the bed such that the bed maintains its desired firmness for the expected duration of use.defendants argued that the term complete hermetic seal should be construed to mean a seal that is impervious to air.defendants reasoned that because the parties agreed that a substantially hermetic seal is nearly or largely impervious to air,then a complete hermetic seal would be impervious to air.
on january,the district court rendered its claim construction.id.agreeing with aero construction of the term passageway,the court interpreted the term inflation input in claim to refer to where air enters the passageway.id.at,dist.lexis at.the court reasoned that based on the text of claim,the inflation input must be placed where the open end exists.id.at,dist.lexis at.the district court interpreted the term complete hermetic seal in claim to mean a seal that does not require any additional parts to retain nearly or largely all of the air in the bed.id.at,dist.lexis at.the district court reasoned that there was only one seal used in claim t hat seal can not be substantially hermetic,or allowing some air to leak through,while at the same time being complete,or allowing no air to leak through.this construction would be absurd and would render the construction of the term substantially hermetic seal illusory.id.at,dist.lexis at.
on february,the district court presided over a jury trial on the issues of patent and trademark infringement,patent validity,and patent and trademark damages.at trial,aero sought reasonable royalty damages of million for infringement of the patent based on sales of the accused intex air mattresses.for the alleged infringement of the one touch trademark,aero sought to recover damages in the amount of million,asserting that this figure represented intex profits based on sales of the accused intex air mattresses.
on february,the jury found intex liable for willful infringement of claim and claims through of the patent and intex and quality trading liable for trademark infringement of the one touch trademark.the jury found that claim and claims through of the patent were not invalid and awarded aero million for patent infringement damages and million as disgorgement of intex and quality trading profits for trademark infringement damages 
the district court then considered aero motion for enhanced patent damages and attorney fees.the court reviewed the details of defendants infringement and alleged litigation misconduct and doubled the patent damages pursuant to.order awarding enhanced damages,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the district court also found that the case was exceptional pursuant to and ordered intex to pay aero attorney fees.id.at,dist.lexis,at.the court based its decision to enhance damages and to award attorney fees on its findings that the case was not close,that intex copied aero commercial embodiment,that intex did not rely in good faith on the opinion of counsel noted above,that intex misbehaved during discovery and at trial,and that intex concealed its misconduct.id.at,dist.lexis,at.thus,the district court added million in enhanced damages and awarded attorney fees,resulting in a total award in favor of aero of million.see id.at,dist.lexis,at.
the district court also found that claim of the patent was not invalid by reason of indefiniteness.aero prods.int l,intex rec,c,wl,dist.lexis.july,indefiniteness opinion.prior to trial,the court granted aero motion in limine to exclude argument and evidence from the jury relating to indefiniteness.after trial,on march,aero moved for judgment that claim and claims through of the patent were not indefinite.defendants responded that the use of both substantially hermetic seal and complete hermetic seal in claim rendered the claim indefinite because the terms were ambiguous and inconsistent.aero countered that the requirement of both a substantially hermetic seal and a complete hermetic seal did not render the claim indefinite,as the second description of the seal addressed the mechanical completeness of the seal as opposed to the quality of the seal.the court noted that the issue of whether defendants defense of indefiniteness applies is a question of law reserved for the court determination.id.at,dist.lexis,at.the court pointed to the testimony of albert karvelis,aero technical expert.id.at,dist.lexis,at.karvelis testified that the terms substantially hermetic seal and complete hermetic seal would be understandable to a person of ordinary skill in the art.id.in view of its claim construction noted above,the court concluded that complete hermetic seal did not contradict substantially hermetic seal and thus rejected defendants argument that claim was indefinite.id.at,dist.lexis,at.
defendants also moved for judgment as a matter of law jmol,for remittitur,and for a new trial on damages.see order denying new damages trial,dist.lexis.defendants argued that aero had improperly recovered double damages because the exact same devices were accused of both trademark and patent infringement.they argued that,for this reason,they were entitled to either a new trial on damages or remittitur.in opposing defendants motion,aero argued that awarding patent and trademark damages did not constitute an impermissible double recovery because intex committed two distinct wrongful acts that were completely independent of each other.the district court agreed with aero,concluding that a patentee is entitled to recover the loss it suffered without regard to whether the infringer profited,whereas trademark infringement damages are premised on unjust enrichment and compensation theories.id.at.the court therefore denied defendants motions.id.based upon the jury verdict and its own rulings,the court entered judgment in favor of aero as outlined above.id.
the court then entered a permanent injunction against defendants precluding them from making,using,selling,or offering to sell in the united states or importing into the united states inflatable devices that infringe claim and claims through of the patent.aero prods.int l,intex rec,c,slip,wl.
defendants timely appealed the judgments against them.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
the first issue we consider is infringement.defendants argue that the jury verdict of infringement was based upon an incorrect claim construction and that,under the correct construction,the accused intex air mattress does not infringe.defendants do not argue that the mattress does not infringe under the district court claim construction.
claim construction is a question of law that we review de novo.cybor fas,en banc.the words of a claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning.phillips awh,en banc quoting vitronics conceptronic.the ordinary and customary meaning of a claim term is the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention,as of the effective filing date of the patent application.id.at.the claims themselves provide substantial guidance as to the meaning of claim terms.id.at.the claims must be read in light of the specification,the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.id.at quoting vitronics,at.a court should also consider the patent prosecution history,if in evidence.id.at.the prosecution history can often inform the meaning of the claim language by demonstrating how the inventor understood the invention and whether the inventor limited the invention in the course of prosecution,making the claim scope narrower than it would otherwise be.id.
as noted above,the district court interpreted the claim term inflation input to mean the point at which air enters the passageway.on appeal,as they did in the district court,defendants argue that,in addition to being the point at which air enters the passageway,the inflation input must be the end of the coupling that is most distal from the end of the inflatable body.they base this construction on the argument that claim and claim of the patent specify that the valve for controlling the transfer of air must be disposed between the interior of the inflatable body and the inflation input.as a result,defendants reason,the inflation input must be above or below,and not within,the valve.hence,according to defendants,this means that the inflation input must be the end of the coupling that is most distal from the end of the inflatable body aero responds that the district court construction of inflation input in claim is correct because the plain language of claim,as well as the supporting specification and drawings,teach that the inflation input is the place where air enters the passageway.
claim of the patent claims an inflatable support system that comprises an inflatable body having an interior,an exterior,and an inflation input for transfer of air between the interior and exterior.patent.claim states that the inflatable support system has a valve,disposed between the interior and the inflation input,for controlling the transfer of air and that the valve includes a passageway having a general circular cross section and a first end in communication with the interior and a second end in communication with the inflation input.the claim further states that the inflatable support system has a generally circular coupling defining the passageway,the coupling having an open end defining the inflation input and a flared end,contiguous therewith,providing the circular lip,so that i the coupling at the open end has a smaller internal diameter than at the flared end and ii the diaphragm can be pushed axially to open the valve by reaching into the open end of the coupling.this is most clearly illustrated in figure of the patent.claim of the patent claims a n inflatable body that comprises an inflatable bladder having an interior and an inflation input.claim further states that the inflatable body comprises a valve disposed between the interior and the inflation input,as well as a passageway having a generally circular cross section and a first end in communication with the interior and a second end in communication with the inflation input.we see nothing in the language of claims and that limits the term inflation input to anything other than where air enters the passageway.moreover there is certainly nothing in the claim language that limits the location of the inflation input to the end of the coupling that is most distal from the end of the inflatable body,as urged by defendants 
the specification further supports this conclusion.figures,and demonstrate possible embodiments with inflation inputs.these embodiments do not require a definition of inflation input that limits the location other than to where air enters the passageway.indeed,all three of the figures show the inflation input as a place where air enters the passageway.the rest of the specification also supports this interpretation,as it explains that i nflation is provided to the mattress by means of the inflation input,to.finally,there is nothing in the prosecution history that would alter this meaning.
in sum,the claim language,the specification,and the prosecution history support the district court construction of the term inflation input.accordingly,we will not disturb that construction 
on appeal,defendants also challenge the district court construction of the term complete hermetic seal in the limitation of claim relating to a flexible circular diaphragm.as seen,the court construed this term to mean a seal that does not require any additional parts to retain nearly or largely all of the air in the bed.markman order,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.defendants argue that the court construction of complete hermetic seal is inconsistent with the specification because the specification indicates that the language complete hermetic seal relates to the quality of the seal and not its mechanical completeness.they argue in addition that the prosecution history expressly indicates that the phrase complete hermetic seal refers to the degree of sealing,so a complete hermetic seal is one that is impervious to air.aero responds that the district court did not err in construing complete hermetic seal in claim to mean that the valve does not require any additional parts to form a seal.it urges that the court construction is not inconsistent with the specification and that the term complete hermetic seal was added during prosecution to distinguish prior art that required additional parts to form a seal,such as a lid.
in our view,the district court properly construed the term complete hermetic seal in claim.claim recites that the inflatable body of the invention comprises an inflatable bladder having an interior and an inflation input and a valve disposed between the interior and the inflation input providing a substantially hermetic seal under low pressure conditions.patent.the substantially hermetic seal is the only seal that is claimed.the claim goes on to explain that the valve includes a flexible circular diaphragm so that,following inflation of the bladder,air pressure created in the interior of the bladder causes an outer annular region of the outer surface of the diaphragm to be urged into engagement against the valve seat to provide a complete hermetic seal when the valve is in the closed position,emphasis added.we read the quoted claim language as doing two things.first,it tells the reader that the valve provides a substantially hermetic seal.second,it explains to the reader how that substantially hermetic seal comes about specifically,by air pressure causing a region of the outer surface of the diaphragm to become engaged against the valve seat.in other words,the claim language tells one of skill in the art the manner in which the claimed substantially hermetic seal is accomplished.while defendants argument would have been squarely foreclosed had the inventor referred to a completed hermetic seal,we are not prepared to hold that the inventor wording undermines the claim construction that emerges from the otherwise clear language of claim.we also think the district court was correct when it stated that interpreting the claimed seal as being a seal that does not allow any air to leak through would render the term substantially illusory.markman order,wl,at,dist.lexis,at see merck teva pharms.usa,a claim construction that gives meaning to all the terms of the claim is preferred over one that does not do so.in sum,the claim language supports the district court construction that complete hermetic seal means a seal that does not require any additional parts to retain nearly or largely all of the air in the bed.markman order,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
we are not persuaded by defendants argument that the district court claim construction is at odds with the specification and the prosecution history.the specification requires little discussion.referring to figure above,it simply states that,w hen air has been placed within the mattress under modest pressure,and air pressure is removed from inflation input,the pressure of air in the mattress urges the diaphragm against valve seat and produces a positive seal against the exit of air from the mattress.patent.this language does not,in any way,suggest that the seal of claim must be complete in terms of being.
turning to the prosecution history,the patent issued from patent application the application,which was filed on december,as a of patent application the application.as originally filed,independent claim of the application required a substantially hermetic seal 
an inflatable bed comprising 
an inflatable bed having an interior and an inflation input 
a valve disposed between the interior and the inflation input providing a substantially hermetic seal under low pressure conditions,such valve including 
a passageway having a generally circular cross section and a first end in communication with the interior and a second end in communication with the inflation input 
a circular lip,disposed peripherally in the passageway and protruding radially inward,having a first surface generally facing the interior,defining a valve seat and 
a flexible circular diaphragm,having an inner surface generally facing interior and an outer surface facing away from the interior,mounted for axial movement in the passageway away from and against the valve seat in respectively closed positions of the valve,so that an outer annular region of the outer surface of the diaphragm engages,against the valve seat when the valve is in the closed position.
emphasis added.claim and dependent claims through of the application were rejected under as being obvious in view of patent,which issued to heino arff the arff patent the examiner explained that it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art to use the check valve taught by the arff patent 
arff shows a filling and discharge valve used for an inflatable body that comprises an annular flange that includes a cylindrical portion upon which a cap can be screwed.a passage is defined through the flange which receives a spring loaded check valve that includes an annular diaphragm the diaphragm rests against an annular sealing face defined by annular sealing ring note that the lower end of the sealing ring is defined by an annular surface that faces down and into the inflatable body,the valve diaphragm rests against this face to form the seal.while the arff valve is used upon an inflatable boat,it is clear that its use is not so limited.since it is well known in the art to use a one way check valve similar to arff upon an air mattress,it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to use the specific check valve taught by arff upon an air mattress.
in response to this rejection,the inventor amended claim so that it reads,in its present form,as follows 
an inflatable bed body comprising 
an inflatable bladder having an interior and an inflation input 
a valve disposed between the interior and the inflation input providing a substantially hermetic seal under low pressure conditions,such valve including 
a passageway having a generally circular cross section and a first end in communication with the interior and a second end in communication with the inflation input 
a circular lip,disposed peripherally in the passageway and protruding radially inward,having a first surface generally facing the interior,defining a valve seat and 
a flexible circular diaphragm,having an inner surface generally facing the interior and an outer surface facing away from the interior,mounted for axial movement in the passageway away from and against the valve seat in the respectively open and closed positions of the valve,so that i the act of inflation of the bladder under low pressure is sufficient to cause axial motion of the valve into the open position to permit the large influx of air and ii following inflation of the bladder,air pressure created in the interior the bladder by inflation thereof causes an outer annular region of the outer surface of the diaphragm engages to be urged into engagement against the valve seat to provide a complete hermetic seal when the valve is in the closed position and 
stiffening means for reducing flexing of the diaphragm except in its outer annular region.
bracketed material removed,underlined material added.aero explained that claim had been amended to claim the subject matter of the invention more distinctly.it also explained that claim as amended now requires stiffening means for reducing flexing of the diaphragm except in its outer annular region.aero asserted that the amendment was supported by the specification.the examiner thereafter issued a notice of allowance.
as seen,the term complete hermetic seal was added to claim after a rejection based on the arff patent.however,the examiner did not cite the arff patent against claim because of the quality of the seal in claim.the inventor explained that claim was being amended,in light of the arff patent,to require a stiffening means.there is nothing in the prosecution history to suggest that claim was being modified to add a requirement for a completely hermetic seal.thus,contrary to defendants argument,the language complete hermetic seal was not added to distinguish the arff patent based on the limitation of a seal that is completely impervious to air,as defendants urge.in short,the prosecution history does not support defendants claim construction argument.
as noted,defendants argue that the jury infringement verdict is based on an incorrect claim construction and that they do not infringe under the correct claim construction.defendants do not argue that they do not infringe under the district court claim construction.because we affirm the district court claim construction,the judgment of infringement resulting from the jury verdict is affirmed.
as noted,after the jury trial the district court considered the legal issue of definiteness and held that claim of the patent was not invalid by reason of indefiniteness.indefiniteness opinion,wl,dist.lexis.on appeal,defendants raise again the argument that claim of the patent is invalid by reason of indefiniteness.
a patent is presumed valid,and the burden of establishing invalidity as to any claim of a patent rests upon the party asserting such invalidity.clear and convincing evidence is required to invalidate a patent.typeright keyboard microsoft.a determination of whether a claim recites the subject matter that the applicant regards as its invention and is sufficiently definite so as to satisfy the requirements of,is a legal conclusion that we review de novo.allen eng g bartell,personalized media commc ns,llc lnt l trade comm n.if a claim is not amenable to construction,the claim is invalid as indefinite under.novo,micro molds.if a claim is amenable to construction,even though the task may be formidable and the conclusion may be one over which reasonable persons will disagree,the claim is not indefinite.exxon res.eng g united states.
defendants contend that claim is indefinite and that the district court had to rewrite the claim to make it valid.they argue that while there is only one seal in claim,the claim simultaneously requires both a substantially hermetic seal under low pressure conditions and a complete hermetic seal when the valve is in the closed position.they assert that the addition of the second phrase during prosecution rendered the claim indefinite.aero responds that claim is not indefinite because it is capable of construction.
because,as just seen,claim is capable of being construed,it is not indefinite.the term complete hermetic seal refers to the mechanical completeness of the seal,while the term substantially hermetic seal refers to the quality of the seal.during trial,aero technical expert,karvelis,testified to his understanding of the claim terms.see indefiniteness opinion,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.as the district court recognized,t hese terms,when read in combination and in light of the specification of the patent,would be understandable to a person of ordinary skill in the art.id.we see no error in the district court determination that claim is not indefinite.
as noted,the district court denied defendants motion for remittitur and for a new trial on damages,rejecting the argument that awarding aero damages for both patent and trademark infringement constituted an impermissible double recovery.order denying new damages trial,dist.lexis.defendants raise the damages issue again on appeal.
we apply our own law with respect to issues of substantive patent law and also with respect to certain procedural issues pertaining to patent law we apply the law of the regional circuits on issues.see midwest,karavan trailers,en banc.this case presents the question of whether aero recovery of both patent and trademark infringement damages represents an impermissible double recovery.we believe that this question is properly determined under federal circuit law.that is because,although the question relates in part to trademark damages,it also involves a matter unique to patent law,damages for patent infringement.see fiskars,hunt,t he issue before a lost profits damages award should be set aside under rule b because sales data may show the acceptability of a alternative on a substantive area of patent law.because resolution of this issue necessarily requires an understanding of the distinctive characteristics of patent damages law,we apply federal circuit law in our review.
we review the denial of a motion for a new trial under the law of the regional circuit,in this case the seventh circuit.see koito.llc.in the seventh circuit,a trial court may grant a new trial where the verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence,while the court ruling on a motion for a new trial is reversed only where there is a clear abuse of discretion.trzcinski am.casualty,cir.under this standard,the court will not set aside a jury verdict if a reasonable basis exists in the record to support the verdict.id.likewise,the seventh circuit reviews a district court denial of a motion for remittitur for an abuse of discretion.lampley onyx acceptance,cir.
generally,the double recovery of damages is impermissible.see junker eddings,bowers baystate,catalina lighting,lamps plus,celeritas,rockwell int l,cpg,pegasus luggage.
in bowers,we recognized that double recovery for the same injury is inappropriate.at.we explained that t he law is clear that the jury may award separate damages for each claim,leaving it to the judge to make appropriate adjustments to avoid double recovery.id.quoting britton maloney,cir.we held in bowers that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the jury to award damages for copyright and contract claims for the same cause of action and then omitting the duplicative copyright damages.id.at in this case,the breach of contract damages arose from the same copying and included the same lost sales that form the basis for the copyright damages.the district court,therefore,did not abuse its discretion by omitting from the final damage award the duplicative copyright damages.
catalina lighting involved and,the latter of which deals with damages for infringement of a design patent.in catalina lighting,we were faced with the question of whether a patentee may recover both infringer profits and a reasonable royalty when both a design patent and utility patent have been infringed by the sale of a single product.id.at.we resolved the question by focusing on the conduct that had damaged the patentee the sale of catalina lighting infringing product.we stated 
lamps plus is entitled to damages for each infringement,but once it receives profits under for each sale,lamps plus is not entitled to a further recovery from the same sale because the award of infringer profits under also constitutes damages adequate to compensate for the infringement,but in no event less than a reasonable royalty for the use made of the invention by the infringer.
see junker,at furthermore,the dollar amount that junker now seeks as damages for breach of contract is identical to the dollar amount the jury awarded him for infringement.both claims arose out of the same set of operative facts regarding galt unauthorized use of the design junker had developed.the circumstances at least suggest that awarding junker the damages he seeks on his claim would constitute a double recovery.celeritas,at celeritas stipulated to accept the single highest award from the three causes of action consisting of patent infringement,trade secret misappropriation,and breach of contract in order to avoid complex jury instructions dealing with avoiding duplicative damages the purpose of the stipulation was to avoid an inquiry into the overlap in the damage awards arising from multiple related claims.cpg,at though the district court ordered accountings for damages resulting from patent infringement and from unfair competition,lark is not entitled to dual damages resulting from the same act.citing stewart stevenson,pickard,cir.bowers,catalina lighting,junker,celeritas,and cpg products teach that,in determining whether there has been an impermissible double recovery of damages,the inquiry focuses on whether the damages issue arose from the same set of operative facts.
relying upon bowers,catalina lighting,and cpg products,defendants challenge the award of damages in this case.they contend that the million aero received as compensation for patent infringement and the million it received as compensation for trademark damages amounted to an impermissible double recovery.aero responds that the district court properly awarded aero a reasonable royalty for intex patent infringement and a portion of intex profits for its trademark infringement because intex infringement of the patent and infringement of the one touch trademark constituted two separate wrongs.it distinguishes bowers,catalina lighting,and cpg products,asserting that the claims in those cases were based on a single wrongful act that caused a single harm.in addition,it relies on nintendo of america,dragon pacific international,cir,where the court allowed nintendo to recover trademark and copyright infringement damages arising from sales of the same video game cartridges.
patent infringement damages are meant to compensate the patentee for the infringement,and a patentee is entitled to at least reasonable royalties.see upon finding for the claimant the court shall award the claimant damages adequate to compensate for the infringement,but in no event less than a reasonable royalty for the use made of the invention by the infringer,together with interest and costs as fixed by the court.the trademark act of,stat.codified as amended in scattered portions of the lanham act,allows a trademark owner to recover its damages,the defendant profits,and the costs of the action,and the amount awarded shall constitute compensation and not a penalty.a.
as indicated,at trial aero sought patent infringement damages in the amount of million.this was based upon the testimony of aero damages expert,mark alan peterson,that aero was entitled to a reasonable royalty on million in sales of the accused intex mattress,which would amount to million.aero argued to the jury that it should award million dollars of that million dollars for patent infringement.aero asserted that this amount would compensate aero for the patent infringement at the same time,aero sought trademark infringement damages in the amount of million.this was based upon aero contention that defendants had made million in profits based on sales of the accused intex mattresses.defendants damages expert,roy weinstein,testified at trial that intex had sold million worth of accused intex mattresses,and intex profits were,so intex had made approximately million in profits in short,aero used defendants patent infringement damages calculations in support of its proposed amount of trademark damages.
the jury awarded aero million dollars for the patent a reasonable royalty as aero million in intex and quality trading profits for the trademark infringement.this was less than the damages that aero royalty damages of million for the patent infringement and disgorgement of in
