nova health systems nova challenges the district court denial of its motion to enjoin a state statute requiring parental notification before a minor may receive an abortion.specifically,nova argues that the statute fails to ensure that a minor petition for judicial approval of an abortion without notification to her parents will be decided with sufficient expedition.as the text of the statute plainly requires prompt and expedited decisions,and as nova points to no evidence that the state courts will not meet these mandates,we hold that nova has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its action.we therefore affirm the decision of the district court.
background 
oklahoma recently enacted the oklahoma act or act,a statute that,inter alia,requires parental notification before an abortion is performed on an unemancipated minor,reg.sess.codified at.stat.tit.specifically,the oklahoma act requires a physician to notify a parent or legal guardian at least hours before performing the abortion.stat.tit,a.the notice must be personally delivered or sent by certified mail to the parent or guardian usual place of abode.id.a.alternatively,the parent or guardian may certify in a notarized statement that he or she has been notified.id.a 
there are two ways to bypass this notice requirement.first,notice can be waived in a case of medical emergency or where the abortion is necessary to prevent the death of the minor.id.b.second,a court may authorize the abortion be performed without notice.id.it is this second bypass procedure judicial bypass that is the subject of the present appeal.
the oklahoma act provides,in relevant part,that 
i f a pregnant unemancipated minor elects not to allow the notification of her parent,any judge of a court of competent jurisdiction shall,upon petition or motion,and after an appropriate hearing,authorize a physician to perform the abortion if the judge determines that the pregnant unemancipated minor is mature and capable of giving informed consent to the proposed abortion.if the judge determines that the pregnant unemancipated minor is not mature,or if the pregnant unemancipated minor does not claim to be mature,the judge shall determine whether the performance of an abortion upon her without notification of her parent would be in her best interest and shall authorize a physician to perform the abortion without notification if the judge concludes that the pregnant unemancipated minor best interests would be served thereby.
id.a.the act does not set forth a definite time frame within which the decision on the bypass petition must be made,providing instead that 
p roceedings in the court shall be confidential and shall be given precedence over other pending matters so that the court may reach a decision promptly and without delay so as to serve the best interests of the pregnant unemancipated minor 
access to the trial court for the purpose of a petition or motion shall be afforded a pregnant unemancipated minor hours a day,seven days a week.
similarly,although the oklahoma act does not establish a concrete time frame for the appellate court to consider the minor appeal in the event she is denied relief in the trial court,the statute does provide that 
a n expedited confidential appeal shall be available to any pregnant unemancipated minor for whom the court denies an order authorizing an abortion without notification.an order authorizing an abortion without notification shall not be subject to appeal.no filing fees shall be required of any pregnant unemancipated minor at either the trial or the appellate level a ccess to the appellate courts for the purpose of making an appeal from the denial of same,shall be afforded a pregnant unemancipated minor hours a day,seven days a week.
on may,the day the oklahoma act took effect,nova filed suit to enjoin its enforcement.at the same time,it filed a motion for a preliminary injunction with a request for a temporary restraining order,arguing that the judicial bypass provisions were unconstitutional because they failed to specify a time frame within which minors bypass petitions must be decided.nova argues that the lack of time limits will increase the medical risks associated with abortion procedures.specifically,nova claims that the potentially unlimited delay a minor faces in receiving judicial approval of her request to proceed without notification could delay her abortion into the second trimester,in which case she would have to undergo a different procedure.the delay could also result in the pregnancy progressing past the point which nova provides abortions meaning that the minor would have to travel great distances to receive her abortion,further increasing the medical risks of the procedure 
after a hearing,the district court denied nova motion for a preliminary injunction,finding that nova had failed to demonstrate a need for emergency relief.nova timely appealed.
discussion 
standard of review 
a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy,and thus the right to relief must be clear and unequivocal.schrier of,cir quoting scfc ilc,visa usa,cir in order for a party to be entitled to a preliminary injunction,that party must show 
he or she will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction issues the threatened injury outweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party the injunction,if issued,would not be adverse to the public interest and there is a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.

ii.analysis 
the district court found that nova failed to show any of the four elements necessary for a preliminary injunction to issue.we agree with the district court that nova has failed to show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits,and thus we affirm the district court order on that ground without reaching the other three factors.see utah gospel mission salt lake city,cir affirming district court denial of preliminary injunction because plaintiffs failed to demonstrate likelihood of success on the merits.
in bellotti baird,d,the supreme court considered a statute that required the consent of both parents before an unmarried minor could obtain an abortion.id.at.in passing on the constitutionality of the statute,the court explained that the minor must be provided an alternative judicial procedure whereby authorization could be obtained,and that this proceeding must assure that a resolution of the issue,and any appeals that may follow,will be completed with anonymity and sufficient expedition to provide an effective opportunity for an abortion to be obtained.id.at.emphasis added 
as a threshold matter,appellees argue that bellotti involved a parental consent statute and that it is not clear that bellotti expeditious bypass requirement applies to a statute like the one at issue here,which only requires parental notification.the supreme court has not specifically resolved this question,see akron ctr.for reprod.health,at,and its decisions do not suggest a clear answer,compare planned parenthood of casey,d explaining that a spousal notice requirement will often be tantamount to the spousal consent requirement found unconstitutional in planned parenthood of cent.danforth,d because a spousal notice requirement enables the husband to wield an effective veto over his wife decision with hodgson minnesota,d opinion of stevens,although the court has held that parents may not exercise an absolute,and possibly arbitrary,veto over a minor decision to have an abortion,it has never challenged a state reasonable judgment that the decision should be made after notification to and consultation with a parent.
even so,as nova points out,several courts of appeals have applied bellotti expeditious bypass requirement in the context of a parental notice statute.planned parenthood,sioux falls clinic miller,cir p provisions,like provisions,are unconstitutional without a bypass.planned parenthood affiliates ass pearson,cir because parental involvement brought about by either consent or notification statutes may result in similar efforts by parents to block the abortion,we will apply the supreme court analysis with respect to consent bypass procedures in our consideration of the constitutional sufficiency of indiana notification bypass procedures.
we need not resolve this question today.because we conclude that the oklahoma act meets belloti expeditious bypass requirement,we assume without deciding that the requirement would apply to parental notification statutes.see akron ctr.for reprod.health,at.assuming,without deciding,that a notification statute must contain bypass procedures because,whether or not the fourteenth amendment requires notice statutes to contain bypass procedures,the statute in question meets the requirements 
we now turn to the heart of the present bellotti expeditious bypass requirement requires a concrete,definite time frame in which judicial action must be taken.nova argument that it does rests on the premise that a lthough time is always of the essence where abortion decisions are concerned,expedition is especially important to the judicial bypass process because the longer a minor has to wait to obtain an abortion,the more,more importantly,less procedure becomes.this is certainly correct.however,whether or not time is of the essence misses the point the question is whether,without a specified time frame,the oklahoma act assures that the judicial bypass process will be completed with sufficient expedition.bellotti,at.nova has not shown a substantial likelihood that a statute which requires bypass proceedings be given precedence over other pending matters so that the court may reach a decision promptly and without delay so as to serve the best interests of the pregnant unemancipated minor and provides for a n expedited confidential appeal fails,on its face,to satisfy bellotti 
two points are critical to our decision.first is the posture of this appeal.nova is challenging the oklahoma act on its face and has presented no evidence that there is,has been,or will be any impermissible delay as to bypass petitions.nova argues that b ecause the judicial bypass procedure does not contain any deadlines by which the court must rule,young women face potentially unlimited delays in obtaining their abortions.were this true,we would have serious concerns about the constitutionality of the bypass procedures.but nova points to no evidence to support this scenario.on the record before us,there is nothing to suggest that courts will act with anything other than prompt ness,without delay to serve the best interests of the pregnant unemancipated minor,and with expedit ion,as the statute requires.
second,and relatedly,in the absence of evidence to the contrary,we must presume that courts will follow the law.see akron ctr.for reprod.health,at.absent a demonstrated pattern of abuse or defiance,a state may expect that its judges will follow mandated procedural requirements.manning,at state judges are bound,just as federal judges are,to uphold the constitution of the united states and to follow the opinions of the united states supreme court.falcone stewart,cir a defendant can legitimately expect that the courts will follow the law,vacated on other grounds,d.the oklahoma act,on its face,complies with bellotti in that it requires oklahoma courts to issue prompt decisions and provide for expeditious appeals,all in accordance with the best interests of the pregnant unemancipated minor.we presume they will do just that 
we acknowledge that this decision conflicts with several of our sister circuits,who have held or suggested that parental involvement laws require specific time frames to satisfy bellotti standard.see planned parenthood of lawall,cir finding parental consent statute which provide s general time frames for expedited proceedings,but no specific time requirements unconstitutional because the trial court review of a minor application must be performed within specific,determinate time limits causeway med.suite ieyoub,cir finding parental consent statute that provided bypass petitions shall be heard in a summary manner plainly conflict s with bellotti because the juvenile court is not required to rule on the minor application within any specified time,overruled on other grounds okpalobi foster,cir zbaraz hartigan,cir enjoining parental notification statute,which provided that an expedited confidential appeal shall be available as the illinois supreme court provides by rule,until such rules were established because the general instructions to promulgate rules failed to provide the framework for a constitutionally sufficient means of expediting the appeal quotations,alterations omitted,aff,d am.coll.of obstetricians gynecologists thornburgh,cir enjoining parental consent statute until the supreme court of pennsylvania complied with the statutory mandate to promulgate rules assuring confidentiality and promptness of disposition,aff,d but see manning,at rejecting argument that statute which failed to adopt specific time frames for appellate court proceedings and decisions above state superior court failed to satisfy bellotti it is improper for a federal court to assume easily,without factual support of such findings,that state courts will not comply with the expedition mandates of the supreme court.
notwithstanding the concerns expressed by these courts,we conclude that the statutory mandates here for prompt and expeditious judicial review of a bypass request,conducted in the best interests of the unemancipated pregnant minor likely complies with the supreme court mandate for sufficient expedition.thus,at this preliminary injunction stage,where nova is making only a facial challenge with no evidence that unemancipated minors are not being given expeditious bypass review,we conclude that nova has failed to carry its burden of establishing a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its claim.
conclusion 
as the oklahoma act,on its face,satisfies the supreme court requirement for an expeditious decision on a judicial bypass petition,nova has not shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits sufficient to obtain a preliminary injunction.the decision of the district court is therefore affirmed.
oklahoma newly enacted statute governing the reproductive rights of unemancipated minors requires parental notification at least hours prior to the termination of a minor pregnancy.stat.tit.the statute contains a judicial bypass procedure that shall be confidential and shall be given precedence over other pending matters so that the court may reach a decision promptly and without delay so as to serve the best interests of the pregnant unemancipated minor.id.c.in those circumstances when the state trial court refuses to bypass the parental notification requirements,a n expedited confidential appeal shall be available.id.d.
