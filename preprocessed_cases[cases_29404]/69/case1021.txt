background 
in,triple five secured the land and rights to develop the mall of america.in,the simon family and teachers insurance and annuity association of america tiaa became involved with the mall project since triple five needed financing assistance.tiaa provided million in construction financing,and after construction,retained an equity investment in the mall for this amount.as of,the simons and triple five had formed mall of america associates moaa,a general partnership.each owned of moaa.in turn,moaa and tiaa had formed the mall of america company moac,limited partnership,which was owned by moaa and by tiaa.moac owns the mall.the same parties owned identical interests in minntertainment associates,a general partnership,the owner of the entertainment portions of the mall.through these business organizations,the simons and triple five each owned of the mall and minntertainment.
the moac agreement provided that because tiaa provided construction financing,it had a preference in any profits generated by the mall through a million partnership capital account.tiaa was guaranteed an annual return on this account,and any income over that amount would be split between tiaa and moaa.unfortunately,the mall has never generated enough income to cover tiaa income guarantee.but,moaa did receive income from the mall venture because it was the manager of the mall,and therefore annually received of the mall gross income.tiaa was also protected against loss from sale of the the mall ever sold for million or less,it would receive the entire purchase price.any amount over million would be shared by tiaa and moaa.additionally,the original moac partnership agreement provided that beginning in,tiaa could either force moaa to buy the mall at a price set by tiaa,or allow tiaa to sell the mall at a price set by tiaa.this is referred to by the parties as the shotgun provision.finally,the moac contract provided that at any time if the partners tiaa and moaa disagreed on a point material to the operation of the mall,tiaa could trigger the aforementioned provision,even prior to.
in early,tiaa decided to sell part of its share in the mall.the current dispute arose out of events leading up to and culminating in the sale of half of tiaa interest in moac to a real estate investment trust reit known as spg,the simon property group.spg is a publicly traded reit,and the simon family has a ownership interest in the entity.triple five apparently owned no part of spg.
tiaa contacted moaa regarding its intention to sell part of moac in march.herbert simon,a principal,responded with a sternly worded letter,noting that the rights of both and triple five should be considered when tiaa sold this interest in moac.simon blind copied this letter to triple five executives.spg was not mentioned in the communication.however,at about the same time,the evidence shows that another principal at,randolph foxworthy,had begun to generate emails detailing a plan for spg to purchase tiaa interest.in december,at an moac partnership meeting,tiaa again addressed moaa and asked for a joint proposal by triple five and to purchase half of tiaa portion of moac.
despite this request by tiaa for joint action between the moaa partners,in january,tiaa and simon family representatives met in indianapolis,without triple five knowledge.after this meeting,the simons and tiaa began negotiating in earnest spg proposed acquisition of the interest in moac.none of these negotiations were disclosed to triple five.triple five first found out about spg involvement in april when herbert simon,on letterhead,sent triple five a letter detailing the plan for spg to purchase tiaa interest.in the letter,he noted that we began to investigate avenues to satisfy tiaa plan to sell,and w e believe we have come up with a structure that satisfies tiaa desires.
upset at the news that this deal had taken place without their knowledge,triple five began to request information from both and spg with regard to the transaction details.at this point,relations between triple five and the simons began to turn ugly.when triple five began threatening to bring suit over the deal,spg made a series of offers to allow triple five to participate in the transaction.in some of these offers,which occurred after both the spg and tiaa boards of directors had already approved the original deal,triple five was asked to release the simons from liability for any breach of fiduciary duty.spg also refused to provide information that triple five thought was relevant to evaluate the offers.the deal between spg and tiaa closed in october.
generally speaking,the sale involved a complicated series of transactions.at the bottom line,however,moac and minntertainment placed a million mortgage on the mall with chase manhattan bank.tiaa was paid million in cash from the proceeds of this mortgage,and spg received a million fee out of the remainder.spg then paid tiaa million in cash and received the interest in return.
triple five brought this lawsuit on october,the district court bifurcated the legal and equitable claims,and tried the equitable issues in a bench trial following trial,the district court ruled that the simon defendants had breached a fiduciary duty owed to triple five by concealing the spg negotiations,by not disclosing the material terms of the transaction to triple five,and by usurping the partnership opportunity.the district court imposed a constructive trust in favor of triple five on spg interest purchased from tiaa and ordered spg to disgorge all profits,net of capital costs,received as a result of its ownership interest in the mall.finally,the district court amended the moaa partnership agreement by removing as the general managing partner,replacing it with triple five.this latter decision had the effect of making triple five the managing partner of moac because the moac partnership agreement provided that moaa was the managing partner of moac.
though the district court has not entered a final order in this case because the legal claims have not yet been tried,the simon defendants appeal interlocutorily,pursuant to a.also pending before us is triple five motion to limit our jurisdiction to the injunctive relief granted by the district defendants from conducting any mall affairs outside of the ordinary course of business without the written consent of triple five.triple five asserts that,pursuant to section a,the only two issues before us on appeal are whether the district court erred in granting the aforementioned injunctive relief and whether the simon defendants violated their fiduciary duty of disclosure,the basis upon which the injunctive relief was granted.triple five argues that the issue regarding the usurpation of the partnership opportunity and the remainder of the relief constructive trust remedy and the removal of as managing partner of not presently within our jurisdiction.
under section a,the simon defendants may appeal the injunctive portions of an interlocutory order,and any part of the order that is interdependent with the injunctive relief.fogie thorn americas,cir.we find that all of the theories and remedies are sufficiently interdependent to confer jurisdiction over the entire appeal.
ii.discussion 
having jurisdiction,we review whether the district court correctly analyzed the breach of fiduciary duty issue and the scope of equitable relief granted by the district court.whether one entity owes another a fiduciary duty is a legal issue reviewed de novo.advanced communication design,follett.whether a breach of fiduciary duty has actually occurred is a factual issue reviewed for clear error.miller miller,see also.a.we review the district court equitable remedies for an abuse of discretion.foy klapmeier,cir.
breach of fiduciary duty 
minnesota law imposes the highest duty of integrity and good faith on partners in their dealings with each other.venier forbes.persons burdened with such duties are fiduciaries by definition and fiduciaries may not usurp or divert for their own benefit business opportunities that properly belong to the partnership.see miller,at.thus,as the managing partner of moaa,clearly owed a fiduciary duty to triple five.as the district court pointed out,the remaining parties named in the breach of fiduciary duty count also owe triple five a fiduciary duty because of their relationships to either or moaa,and these defendants do not challenge this contention.spg,however,was not named in the fiduciary duty claim,and argues that this omission precludes the district court from imposing remedies that affects its interests.spg also argues that even if it had been named in the pleadings,as an independent and publicly traded,it does not owe triple five a fiduciary duty.
thus,the first issue which must be resolved is whether the breach of fiduciary duty claim against spg is properly before this court.pending with this appeal is triple five motion to amend the pleadings to conform to the evidence,which triple five first made to the district court pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.because triple five did not include spg as a defendant in its breach of fiduciary duty count,it now seeks to amend the pleadings to do so.although triple five made this motion to the district court,it did so after this court had acquired jurisdiction over the appeal.therefore,the district court declined to rule,but noted that if it had jurisdiction,it would grant the motion.under rule b,an issue not raised in the pleadings,but tried by express or implied consent of the parties,shall be treated as having been raised in the pleadings.b.this motion may be made at any time,even after judgment.baker john morrell,cir.after reviewing the record,we grant triple five motion because spg impliedly consented to litigation of this issue.see wright,miller kane,federal practice and procedure ed noting that courts of appeals may grant motions to amend pleadings to conform to the evidence and use rule b by analogy.we reject spg argument that it did not know or understand that it was defending triple five assertion that it and business dealings were intertwined enough to make spg equally liable for the breach of fiduciary duty claim.the trial record indicates otherwise.
triple five argues that spg and are so closely related that they should be considered the same entity for purposes of this case,and particularly for liability arising from the breach of a fiduciary duty.triple five asserts that even though spg is a separate party and a public company which would normally have no fiduciary relationship to triple five,the close connections between the simon family and spg impose upon spg the same duties as those owed by.the district court found that even though spg was not named in the fiduciary count,the named simon defendants were affiliated with spg so closely that their intertwined and interconnected conduct could not be separated.
the evidence established that the simon family formed spg in so that the family would have greater access to capital markets.the simon family owns of spg,and has effective control of the entity because it is guaranteed of seats on spg board of directors,and family members are prohibited from owning more than of spg stock,without board approval.the simon family also has veto power over major decisions.further,spg and share the same office space and melvin and herbert simon and randolph foxworthy,are all directors or officers for both entities.in numerous anecdotal incidents,these aforementioned directors and officers did not differentiate between and spg,especially for purposes of the tiaa transaction.for example,they sent letters detailing the spg portion of the transaction on letterhead and referred to the tiaa transaction negotiators as we,even when speaking as officers.
we are not unmindful of the difficulties faced by business people who are principals in related corporate entities.burg horn,cir noting that courts must consider that individuals often serve on several boards and are subject to competing fiduciary duties.however,we agree with the district court that this case presents the worst kind of and subterfuge.although spg is publicly traded,the connections between it and are far too close for comfort.even though spg is a public company with an independent board of directors,its decisions were being made by the same people who were at.spg officials used information gained in their capacities as directors and moaa operatives to profit individually through spg participation in this transaction.and,in the process they shirked their individual and partnership duties to triple five.indeed,if had not used subterfuge to their substantial advantage,the deal with tiaa would not have been fully negotiated before it was communicated to triple five.accordingly,we find that both and spg owe a duty of integrity and good faith to triple five in this particular transaction.because all of the simon defendants,including spg,have a fiduciary responsibility to triple five,we move on to examine the district court findings that they breached these responsibilities.
usurpation of partnership opportunity 
a partner may not appropriate a business opportunity which rightly belongs to the partnership.miller,at.the district court found that the opportunity to buy tiaa interest in moac was a partnership opportunity,and this finding is not clearly erroneous.an opportunity that is closely related to the entity existing or prospective line of business,would competitively advantage the partnership,and is one that the partnership has the financial ability,knowledge and experience to pursue is a partnership opportunity.id.at.the determination of whether an opportunity rightly belongs to the partnership is necessarily one of fact.id.
the simon defendants primarily argue that moaa did not have the financial ability to pursue the opportunity,and cite as an example the fact that moaa had never made capital contributions to the mall of america venture.and,they argue that when moaa was presented with the opportunity to by tiaa interest,it declined to do so.these arguments,especially the latter,ignore the fundamental fact that made this decision for the partnership in its capacity as managing partner of moaa.essentially argues that,this was not a partnership opportunity because they said it was not a partnership opportunity.while it may have been within the managing partner prerogative to make such a call,that same managing partner may not then divert its attention and partnership resources toward obtaining that partnership opportunity for itself,through use of an alter ego.see homeowners,radtke,holding that i t would be anomalous to permit the usurping partner to hide behind protestations of financial inability in light of the fact that the partner often has substantial control over such circumstances quoting ii alan bromberg larry ribstein,bromberg ribstein on partnership d at.in fact,a managing partner owes the highest possible fiduciary duty to his partners.welder green,holding that managing partners owe their partners the highest fiduciary duty recognized in the law saballus timke,d,noting that where one partner takes on role of manager or director his obligation to deal fairly and openly and disclose completely is heightened.thus,moaa refusal of tiaa invitation to buy does not affect the partnership opportunity analysis because moaa managing partner,is one of the entities charged with wrongdoing.moreover,if could finance the deal which it did,the partnership could probably also have done so.radtke,at quotation omitted.
the simons also argue that the district court wrongly focused on triple five ability to obtain financing for the transaction,as opposed to moaa financial ability.however the simon defendants did not raise this argument below,and the ability of triple five,a partner of moaa,to obtain financing is indicative of moaa eventual ability to do so.id.finally,fin
