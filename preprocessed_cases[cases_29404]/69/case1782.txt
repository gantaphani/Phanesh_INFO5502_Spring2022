carlos jones died in from diseases of the heart,liver and kidneys that his wife,ofelia jones,and surviving children the joneses attribute to his exposure to multiple chemical products with which worked during his employment by the goodyear tire and rubber company goodyear and the upjohn company upjohn.in the joneses sued of chemical products alleging each product identified in the complaint contained toxins that were a substantial factor in causing carlos illness and death.this appeal arises from the judgment of dismissal entered after the trial court sustained certain of the defendants demurrers to the first amended complaint which were principally grounded on the contention the joneses had failed to plead causation of carlos injuries with the specificity required by the supreme court in bockrath aldrich chemical,cal th bockrath.contrary to the contention of the defendants and the ruling of the trial court,at the pleading stage the joneses need not identify the specific toxin contained in each hazardous product to which carlos was exposed that was a substantial factor in causing his illness to state a viable products liability claim.accordingly,we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
on september,the joneses filed a complaint alleging causes of action for negligence,strict liability failure to warn,strict liability design defect,fraudulent concealment,breach of implied warranties and loss of consortium.two defendants demurred to the complaint on the ground it failed to comply with the requirements of bockrath.they contended that,by suing the makers of every chemical carlos had worked with during his employment by goodyear and upjohn and claiming all the products had caused his illnesses,the complaint failed to allege specific facts with respect to any one product and was thus defective.the court sustained the demurrers with leave to amend.
the joneses filed a first amended complaint on february,naming the identical defendants and products and asserting the same causes of action.with respect to causation,the amended complaint alleges carlos worked with and was exposed to these products,which contained significant concentrations of organic solvents and other cardiotoxic,hepatotoxic,nephrotoxic and other toxic chemicals.during the course of his employment,carlos was exposed to toxicologically significant levels of these chemicals.as a direct and proximate result of said exposure to said toxic chemical products,carlos sustained serious injuries to his internal organs,including chemically induced cirrhosis of the liver,chemically induced cardiomyopathy and chemically induced kidney failure carlos died of his injuries on april.
additionally,a s a result of carlos exposure to the foregoing toxic chemical products,toxins within said toxic chemicals entered carlos body.each of the foregoing toxic chemical products contain organic solvents and cardiotoxic,hepatotoxic,nephrotoxic and other toxic chemicals,which by and through their cardiotoxic,hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic nature,caused carlos chemically induced cirrhosis of the liver,chemically induced cardiomyopathy and chemically induced kidney failure and other injuries.each toxin that entered carlos body was a substantial factor in bringing about,prolonging,and aggravating carlos chemically induced cirrhosis of the liver,chemically induced cardiomyopathy and chemically induced kidney failure and other injuries.
to illustrate the toxic effects of one chemical to which carlos was exposed,dimethylformamide dmf,contained in a dow chemical product marketed under the name of polymide,the amended complaint cites pathology studies identifying the hepatotoxic,nephrotoxic and cardiotoxic effects of dmf.the amended complaint does not specifically address the purported toxic effects of any other chemical and alleges only that the toxicity of various organic solvents to the liver and kidney has long been recognized.
several of the defendants demurred to the amended complaint.at a hearing on april,the trial court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend on three grounds the cause of action for fraudulent concealment failed because none of the defendants owed carlos a fiduciary duty giving rise to a duty of disclosure,and the amended complaint failed to allege the circumstances of the alleged concealment with adequate specificity the amended complaint failed to establish privity between the joneses and defendants sufficient to support a breach of implied warranty cause of action and the amended complaint was not sufficiently specific to apprise defendants of the particular toxins and products that allegedly caused carlos illnesses.a judgment of dismissal was entered in favor of the demurring defendants on may.
contentions 
the joneses contend the amended complaint alleges sufficiently specific facts to establish causation for all their causes of action against defendants and properly pleaded the concealed facts and duty of disclosure necessary to support their cause of action for fraudulent concealment.in addition,they contend carlos was in privity with his employers goodyear and upjohn and they are therefore entitled to bring a claim for breach of implied warranties.

the allegations of causation are sufficient under bockrath 
the supreme court decision in bockrath,supra,cal th established the causation pleading threshold for a complaint alleging harmful exposure to multiple toxins under california law.in bockrath the plaintiff had contracted multiple myeloma while working at hughes aircraft company.id.at.he sued at least manufacturers of various chemical products and alleged his disease resulted from his exposure to harmful substances contained in those products.ibid.according to the second amended complaint,he and his fellow workers had used most,and perhaps all,of the products and had inhaled and had direct skin contact with most and perhaps all of them.ibid.any products he had not been directly exposed to had been used or improperly stored somewhere at the plant,thereby causing him to have inhaled or had direct skin contact with all of the named chemicals,all of which produce carcinogenic effects.ibid.the trial court sustained demurrers without leave to amend based on the failure of the complaint to differentiate among products and defendants in alleging causation,and the court of appeal affirmed.id.at.
the supreme court reversed and set forth explicit guidelines for plaintiffs attempting to allege injury resulting from exposure to toxic materials a plaintiff must allege that he was exposed to each of the toxic materials claimed to have caused a specific illness identify each product that allegedly caused the injury allege the toxins entered his body as a result of the exposure allege that he suffers from a specific illness,and that each toxin that entered his body was a substantial factor in bringing about,prolonging,or aggravating that illness and,finally,allege that each toxin he absorbed was manufactured or supplied by a named defendant.bockrath,supra,cal th at.as the court emphasized,in keeping with the rule that allegations of fact should be made in ordinary and concise language see code civ,plaintiffs may,and should,allege the foregoing facts succinctly,and may do so in a conclusory fashion if their knowledge of the precise cause of injury is limited.bockrath,at.
in so holding,the court rejected the argument advanced here by defendants that a complaint is unacceptably speculative if a plaintiff has not specifically identified which toxin contained in a particular product caused the alleged injury or has sued the manufacturers of multiple products,alleging all of them contained toxins that were substantial factors in causing his injury.nonetheless,the defendants contend that a closer reading of bockrath shows the term toxic materials used by the court in the first prong embraces both products and toxins,thus requiring a plaintiff identify not only the product,but also the specific toxin that was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff identified illness to state a viable cause of action.
this gloss on the holding of bockrath is simply not supported by the language of the opinion.as our colleagues in division four of this court explained nearly years ago when interpreting bockrath,the supreme court had been primarily concerned with plaintiffs who lack any real notion of the identity of the product that was a substantial factor in causing their injury rivas safety kleen th.answering the contention asserted by the plaintiff in that case that the statute of limitations does not accrue until the toxin and not just the product is identified,division four stated we do not see how that conclusion can be drawn from the bockrath court language.the court stated that the plaintiff must identify each product that allegedly caused the injury and that i t is insufficient to allege that the toxins in defendants products caused it.bockrath,supra,cal th at,italics added.once the product had been identified,plaintiff could allege that the toxins in the product entered his body and were a substantial factor in bringing about,prolonging,or aggravating his illness.ibid.as we read the opinion,the supreme court was referring to toxins in a general sense.it was not expressing a requirement that the plaintiff identify specific chemical compounds before he or she can assert a claim.rivas,at see also bockrath,at considering that expert medical and scientific evidence would be required to prove the plaintiff case,his lack of personal knowledge regarding the precise mechanism by which his injury occurred should not be viewed as an admission that he can not identify which specific products caused his injuries.
undeterred,the defendants argue this case exemplifies the concern expressed in bockrath about overbroad litigation the law can not tolerate lawsuits by prospecting plaintiffs who sue multiple defendants on speculation that their products may have caused harm over time through exposure to toxins in them,and who thereafter try to learn through discovery whether their speculation was.bockrath,supra,cal th at.
again,the defendants ignore the mandate of bockrath.the bockrath court recognized that plaintiffs may genuinely lack information about the specific cause of their injury and should not be barred from pursuing their claims.bockrath,supra,cal th at.the court instructed courts and litigants that the remedy for improperly speculative pleading is provided by subdivision b of section,which imposes an obligation on an attorney or unrepresented party to ensure factual allegations are made in good faith and have,or are likely to have,evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery,subd.b.a lawyer who is found to have deliberately filed a products liability suit without a belief in the truth of a particular allegation is subject to sanction see,subd.c or other disciplinary action.bockrath,at.indeed,the court strongly cautioned,i t is sharp practice to implead defendants in a products liability suit alleging exposure to multiple toxins unless,after a reasonable inquiry,the plaintiff actually believes that evidence has been or is likely to be found raising a reasonable medical probability that each defendant product was a substantial factor in causing the harm id.at,citing rutherford owens illinois,cal th.for instance,the court added,a plaintiff suing every manufacturer of an airborne substance found in the los angeles basin probably would be exposed to sanctions for the suit,even if certain defendants eventually were found to have made a product that was a substantial factor in the onset of the plaintiff cancer.we presume that plaintiff here was aware of his duty to pursue his suit in good faith,and,in the absence of contrary evidence,that he did so.bockrath,at,italics added.
defendants argue this remedy is simply not practical because a plaintiff need not disclose his or her causation evidence until expert discovery,which ordinarily occurs near the date for trial and well beyond the statutory cutoff for the filing of summary judgment motions see,subd.a.that concern is more properly addressed to the trial court,which retains broad discretion over case management and scheduling issues it does not warrant judgment entered against a plaintiff based on his or her inability to identify in the complaint a specific causative agent for a chemically induced injury rutherford owens illinois,supra,cal th at describing inherent scientific uncertainty in proving causation of mesothelioma.this is especially true in light of continuing scientific advances that may offer improved insight into causation than traditionally has been available.see,gold,the more we know,the less intelligent we are how genomic information should,and should not,change toxic tort causation doctrine harv.envtl,there can be no doubt that toxicogenomics and molecular epidemiology will,over time,produce powerful new insights into the cellular mechanics by which numerous toxic substances produce disease and demonstrate causal links that up to now could only be inferred or speculated.
in sum,the allegations of the amended complaint meet the standard enunciated in bockrath,and the trial court erred in sustaining demurrers to the products liability claims.
the joneses have adequately alleged a cause of action for fraudulent concealment 
not every fraud arises from an affirmative misstatement of material fact.the principle is fundamental that deceit may be negative as well as affirmative it may consist of suppression of that which it is one duty to declare as well as of the declaration of that which is false.citations.thus section of the civil code provides one who wilfully deceives another with intent to induce him to alter his position to his injury or risk,is liable for any damage which he thereby suffers.section of the civil code in relevant part provides a deceit,within the meaning of the last section,is either.the suppression of a fact,by one who is bound to disclose it,or who gives information of other facts which are likely to mislead for want of communication of that fact lovejoy v.at t th.t he elements of a cause of action for fraud based on concealment are the defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact,the defendant must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff,the defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff,the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or suppressed fact,and as a result of the concealment or suppression of the fact,the plaintiff must have sustained damage.kaldenbach mutual of omaha life ins.th.
in sustaining the demurrers to this cause of action,the trial court ruled the joneses had failed to allege with specificity the defendants timely knowledge of the toxic hazards of their chemicals see,blickman turkus,lp mf downtown sunnyvale,llc th,c oncealment is a species of fraud,and f raud must be pleaded with specificity or to identify the source of a duty on their part to disclose such information,if known,to carlos see,hahn mirda th.
the joneses respond that,g enerally speaking,manufacturers have a duty to warn consumers about the hazards inherent in their products.citation.the requirement purpose is to inform consumers about a product hazards or faults of which they are unaware,so that they can refrain from using the product altogether or evade the danger by careful use.johnson american standard,cal th,citing anderson owens corning fiberglas cal d,accord,pannu land rover north
