this case shows once again why it important for lawyers representing a bankruptcy debtor to turn square corners.
in june,zilog,announced that it would close one of its idaho plants,effective december.to retain employees through the plant closure,zilog offered certain employees retention bonuses.rose marie corning,selena robert and margie cleverdon collectively,the women were among the employees who accepted the offer.
in december,zilog notified the women that it had rescinded the retention bonus agreements because the women would not,after all,lose their jobs at the end of the year.in january,corning and robert learned that three male engineers would receive retention bonuses.corning and robert claim,however,that not until late april or early may,did they learn that those same three male employees had been paid bonuses even though they were not laid off.cleverdon claims that she did not learn this until.
prior to this time,on february,zilog and a related entity had filed for bankruptcy in the northern district of california.zilog employees received an email soon afterward from the company general counsel explaining that they would receive proof of claim forms from the bankruptcy court.the employees were instructed that y ou need to fill out and return the proof of claim form only if you believe that,on february,zilog owed you money other than the wages,benefits and expense reimbursements that you are entitled to as an employee.otherwise,you do not need to take any action in connection with the notice that you have received.
around this same time,the women received a notice from the bankruptcy court explaining that the deadline for filing proofs of claims that had accrued prior to the bankruptcy filing was april.the women did not file proofs of claim prior to the deadline.
the bankruptcy court confirmed zilog plan of reorganization on april of that year,and the reorganization became effective on may.the bankruptcy court april confirmation zilog reorganization that o n the effective date,the debtors shall be discharged of all liability for payment of any claims incurred before the effective date,to the fullest extent provided by bankruptcy code,except that any liability imposed by or assumed under the plan shall not be discharged.the confirmation order also provided that july,is the deadline for filing a request for payment of an administrative expense arising from february,through april.the women received written notice of the plan confirmation.
pursuant to a,confirmation of a plan operates as an injunction against the commencement or continuation of an action,the employment of process,or an act,to collect,recover or offset any such debt as a personal liability of the debtor.see also id.d.notwithstanding the discharge injunction,the women subsequently filed an action in idaho state court the idaho action alleging contract,tort and statutory claims based on zilog failure to pay the promised retention bonuses.the complaint did not allege sex discrimination.
in response to this filing,zilog initiated an adversary proceeding in the northern district of california bankruptcy court,and sought to enjoin the idaho action,arguing that those claims had been discharged in bankruptcy.shortly after commencement of this adversary proceeding,the women and zilog stipulated that the women would stay the idaho action until the bankruptcy court entered a judgment in the adversary.the bankruptcy court approved this stipulation and it was entered into the record.
subsequently,the women filed complaints with the idaho human rights commission and the united states equal employment opportunity commission.each of the verified complaints contained identical statements of fact,alleging that 
s ometime after december,i learned that i would not be paid the promised retention bonus.that in late april or early may,i learned that male employees who had signed retention bonus agreements had been paid the retention bonuses and or rehired within a period of time that zilog represented such individuals would not be rehired.
several months later,the women filed affidavits in the bankruptcy court further detailing their allegations of discrimination.corning and robert claimed consistent with their verified complaints that they did not learn until late april or early may,that the three male engineers who had received retention bonuses would not be laid off.during this same period,corning and robert allegedly learned that three male maintenance workers who had been laid off in january might be returning to zilog but would not have to repay their retention bonuses.
corning and robert also claimed to have learned by late april or early may that a seventh male employee who had been paid a retention bonus was neither terminated nor was asked for a refund.this was in contrast to a female employee who had apparently been retained,but was forced to return her bonus.finally,in,corning and robert allegedly learned that an eighth male employee had been rehired without being required to repay his retention bonus.
while corning and robert affidavits to the bankruptcy court were consistent with their verified complaints to the idaho human rights commission and the eeoc,cleverdon was not.in her complaint to the idaho human rights commission,cleverdon had alleged that she became aware of disparate treatment in late april or early may.in her later affidavit to the bankruptcy court,however,cleverdon claimed that she did not become aware of the disparate treatment until approximately,when she was informed of such by corning and robert.
subsequently,the women moved to enter their untimely contract,tort and statutory claims into the bankruptcy proceedings under the equitable doctrine of excusable neglect.see fed.bankr b.they also requested payment of their sex discrimination claims as administrative expenses 
the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment to zilog,and held all of the women claims barred by the bankruptcy confirmation order.applying california department of health services jensen in re jensen,cir per curiam,which held that a claim arises under the bankruptcy code once it is within the claimant fair contemplation,id.at,the bankruptcy court held that the women sex discrimination claims should have been within their fair contemplation as of the effective date of confirmation on may.as preconfirmation claims they are subject to the bankruptcy proceedings.the bankruptcy court also found all of the women other claims to be within their fair contemplation,and thus barred because no proofs of claim were filed by the april deadline.the bankruptcy court found no excusable neglect for the late filing of these claims,and held the women in contempt for willfully violating the discharge injunction.zilog was awarded in attorneys fees.
the district court affirmed,holding that the bankruptcy court had made explicit factual findings that,by late april or early may,corning and robert were aware that a number of male employees had received retention bonuses while remaining employed at zilog.the district court held that the bankruptcy court findings were not clearly erroneous,and that the bankruptcy court did not err in finding that corning and robert gender discrimination claims were classified appropriately as and thus barred by the may,bankruptcy discharge.emphasis added.
the district court described the issue of when cleverdon sex discrimination claim arose as closer.citing the conflict between cleverdon complaint to the idaho human rights commission and her subsequent affidavit to the bankruptcy court,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment against cleverdon in light of cleverdon conflicting statements,this court can not conclude that the bankruptcy court factual determination that cleverdon claims were sic and barred by the confirmation plan on may,sic constituted clear error.emphasis added.
the district court also affirmed the sanctions award,holding that a bsent any affirmative act by defendants to stay or dismiss the idaho litigation,the bankruptcy court finding that the continuing idaho state proceedings were a willful violation of the discharge order was reasonable.
summary judgment on the discrimination claims 
we look to federal law to determine when a claim arises under the bankruptcy code.cool fuel,bd.of equalization in re cool fuel,cir.in jensen,we held that an environmental claim arises under the bankruptcy code once it is within the claimant fair contemplation.at.jensen has been applied to a range of claims.see,in re cool fuel,at tax claim hassanally republic bank in re hassanally,cir.bap negligent construction claim corman morgan in re morgan,fraud claim.
although we have not had occasion to consider whether jensen fair contemplation test extends to claims of discrimination,we see no reason why these claims should not be analyzed under jensen framework.we therefore agree with the courts below that the women claims of sex discrimination accrued under the bankruptcy code once they were within the women fair contemplation.
the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment to zilog and held that the sex discrimination claims arose.the plan was confirmed on april,and became effective on may.the bankruptcy court held that claims arising prior to may were discharged under the plan,even though the april confirmation order only permitted claims arising from february,through april,to be filed as administrative expenses.under the bankruptcy court confirmation order,claims arising from may to may were discharged,even though no provision was made for their presentation and payment.
the issue of which date should be used to bar claims for administrative expenses was raised before the bankruptcy court at the hearing on motions for summary judgment.counsel for the women objected that,because the july bar date only related to administrative claims that had arisen on or before april,the discharge injunction should likewise only bar claims that had accrued through april,rather than may.as counsel for the women explained the problem with using the effective date is that the debtor is trying to vacate any right to payment for claims that it did even know existed at the time that one would vote on confirmation of the plan.for reasons not apparent from the record,the bankruptcy court overruled the objection.
assuming that the bankruptcy court even has the authority to discharge debts we can not see how,in this case,the bankruptcy court could have discharged claims arising between the plan confirmation and effective dates without first allowing for the presentation of such claims.given the manifest injustice of discharging claims that could not have been filed under the bankruptcy court april confirmation order,we hold that only claims against zilog arising on or before april were discharged.
even if the bankruptcy court meant to say that the women discrimination claims arose prior to the april confirmation order,summary judgment was still unwarranted.corning and robert claimed that they became aware by late april or early may that female zilog employees were subjected to disparate and allegedly discriminatory treatment.as this was a motion for summary judgment,the court was required to resolve disputed issues of fact in favor of the women,as the parties.see matsushita indus.zenith radio,d see also fed.
accepting that corning and robert sex discrimination claims arose in late april or early may,there is a substantial possibility that those claims were not within the women fair contemplation until after the april confirmation order,and thus were outside the bankruptcy process.the bankruptcy court therefore erred in granting summary judgment and finding those claims discharged.
the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment to zilog on cleverdon sex discrimination claim is even more problematic.cleverdon claimed in her complaint to the idaho human rights commission and the eeoc that she learned of the allegedly disparate treatment by late april or early may.even if this were true,the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment must be reversed for the reasons discussed above.
cleverdon,however,claimed in her subsequent affidavit to the bankruptcy court that she did not learn of the allegedly disparate treatment until.the date by which cleverdon allegedly disparate treatment was within her fair contemplation was therefore in dispute.taking the facts in the light most favorable to cleverdon,her discrimination claim did not come within her fair contemplation until months after confirmation of the plan the bankruptcy court therefore erred in granting summary judgment to zilog on cleverdon sex discrimination claim.
the district court then compounded these mistakes by deferring under the clearly erroneous standard of review to the bankruptcy court explicit factual findings findings that the bankruptcy court had no authority to make on a motion for summary judgment.the district court affirmance of the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment was therefore erroneous.
taking the facts in the light most favorable to the women,there is a substantial possibility with respect to corning and robert,and a certainty with respect to cleverdon,that their discrimination claims arose.we reverse the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment on the women discrimination claims and remand to the bankruptcy court to determine when those claims came within the women fair contemplation.see renwick bennett in re bennett,cir.
excusable neglect 
we next consider whether the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in declining to excuse the women failure to file timely proofs of claim regarding their retention bonuses.the determination of whether neglect is excusable is an equitable one,taking account of all relevant circumstances surrounding the party omission.pioneer inv.servs.brunswick assocs,d.such circumstances include the danger of prejudice to the debtor,the length of the delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings,the reason for the delay and whether the movant acted in good faith.id.this list is not exhaustive.see id.
on march,the women received the following email from zilog general counsel 
sent monday,march,pm 
to austin users field sales americas fort worth users tampa users san jose users 
subject proof of claim 
importance high 
as you know,we commenced our chapter case on february.the case will affect only the holders of the company public debt securities and the current holders of our common and preferred shares.we expect to conclude the case and emerge from chapter by early may.in the interim,the bankruptcy court has granted the company motion for permission to pay all amounts owed to employees for salary,wages,expense reimbursements,and vacation,medical,and other benefits as they become due.we expect that the chapter case will have no effect on you or on our business operations.
the federal bankruptcy rules requires sic that we provide the broadest possible notice of the case commencement.for that reason,you will likely all receive in the mail a written notice,together with a proof of claim form,from the company noticing agent.you may receive additional notices about the progress of the case.
this is nothing to be concerned about.you need to fill out and return the proof of claim form only if you believe that,on february,zilog owed you money other than the wages,benefits and expense reimbursements that you are entitled to as an employee.otherwise,you do not need to take any action in connection with the notice that you have received.
i am out of the office until monday.in my absence,if you have any particular questions,please call stephen lubben of skadden,arps.

t emphasis added.
the email was not calculated to inform the women that they needed to file their wage claims with the bankruptcy court.more likely,it would have led them to believe exactly the opposite.
the second sentence of the email states the bankruptcy case will affect only the holders of the company public debt securities and the current holders of our common and preferred shares.the clear import of this language,especially when read by employees who were not lawyers and had no expertise in bankruptcy law,is that the bankruptcy would not affect their rights.the author of the email reinforced this view by concluding the first paragraph with a sentence expressing the company expectation that the chapter case will have no effect on you or on our business operations.emphasis added.
the third paragraph reinforces the idea that the employees need not file claims with the bankruptcy court.having explained in the second paragraph that the notice was sent only because t he federal bankruptcy rules requires sic that we provide the broadest possible notice of the case commencement,the third paragraph begins by assuring employees that t his is nothing to be concerned about.the wizard of oz metro pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.then in the middle of the third only sentence that gives any hint that some employees may need to file proofs of claim after all you need to fill out and return the proof of claim form only if you believe that,on february,zilog owed you money other than the wages,benefits and expense reimbursements that you are entitled to as an employee.
assuming diligent employees made their way past the assurances that they need worry about all the legal,it is far from clear that they would have understood they were required to file proofs of claim for monies they believed they were owed as retention bonuses.the bonuses zilog had promised the women were supposed to compensate them for services they had rendered or would be rendering to the company.as such,the bonuses could easily be understood to be wages,benefits and expense reimbursements that you are entitled to as an employee the type of claims for which no proof of claim needed to be filed.we also note that the you need to do x only if y construction of the information by way of negative inference rather than affirmative designed to deflect attention from,rather than underscore the necessity of,filing proofs of claim 
read in its entirety,the email from the general counsel hardly gives fair notice to the women,or to others in their position,that they were required to file proofs of claim to preserve their rights.rather,the email seems designed to lull the employees into a false sense of security about the need to file claims,and to dissuade them from paying very close attention to any notices sent out by the bankruptcy court 
the written notice from the bankruptcy court muddied the waters further.that notice stated 
the bankruptcy court has set april,as the deadline for filing proofs of claim the bar date.if you have a prebankruptcy claim against either debtor that is not based on the delivery of goods or services to the debtors in the ordinary course of business,you must file a proof of claim so that it is received no later than the bar date.if you fail to do so,your claim will be discharged.
the plan alters the rights of the holders of zilog senior notes and its equity securities but does not alter the rights of holders of any other class of claims.if the court confirms the plan,it will be binding on all holders of claims against and interests in the debtors.
confirmation of the plan will result in a discharge of claims against the debtors,which may include all or part of your claim.a discharge means that you may never try to collect the claim from the debtors,except as provided in the plan.first emphasis in original.
part of the problem,of course,is been assured by the general counsel email that t his is nothing to be concerned about many employees may not have read the bankruptcy court notice very carefully,or at all.assuming,however,that employees did read the notice,they would have learned that no proof of claim had to be filed for any claim based on the delivery of services to the debtors in the ordinary course of business.the phrase in the ordinary course of business is most readily understood as modifying delivery of services to the debtors,which immediately precedes it.the women retention bonuses were based on their performing services for zilog,and the services were rendered in the ordinary course of zilog business.zilog does not claim that the women were required to perform extraordinary services to earn the bonuses as best the record reveals,the bonuses were to be paid if the women kept their jobs through the end of the year.given that the services they rendered to earn the bonuses were exactly the same ones they had been rendering to zilog all along,we can easily see how the women,even had they read the notice from the bankruptcy court closely,would have believed there was no need to file proofs of claim to preserve their right to recover the promised bonuses moreover,given the misleading statements in the march email that the chapter case will have no effect on you and t his is nothing to be concerned about,we can readily understand why the women may not have parsed the notice from the bankruptcy court more closely or consulted an attorney at that time.
in,as it happens,was also a bankruptcy case involving a late proof of creditor represented by an experienced bankruptcy attorney missed the deadline for filing claims because his lawyer overlooked the filing date in the bankruptcy court notice.at.the bankruptcy court refused to find excusable neglect for the creditor late filing,and the district court affirmed.see id.at.
the sixth circuit reversed the bankruptcy court refusal to accept the proofs of claim,and the supreme court affirmed.id.at.in holding that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion,the supreme court explained that the standard for excusable neglect 
is at bottom an equitable one,taking account of all relevant circumstances surrounding the party omission,including the danger of prejudice to the debtor,the length of the delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings,the reason for the delay,including whether it was within the reasonable control of the movant,and whether the movant acted in good faith.
in pincay andrews,cir en banc,we applied pioneer to hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by finding excusable neglect when a sophisticated law firm missed a filing deadline because of a paralegal error.see id.at.although we did not hold that the district court was required to find excusable neglect under those circumstances,we upheld a finding of excusable neglect because we found the evidence sufficient to support it.see id.
in pioneer and pincay,sophisticated attorneys were let off the hook after missing filing deadlines.in fact,the supreme court in pioneer went so far as to hold that it was an abuse of discretion not to find excusable neglect where a versed bankruptcy practitioner missed the bankruptcy court notice and failed to file a timely proof of claim.by contrast,corning,robert and cleverdon were unrepresented by counsel,and the notices sent out by debtor counsel and the bankruptcy court were,at the very least,ambiguous,and more likely affirmatively misleading.it would be very strange indeed to find the neglect in our case inexcusable,when the neglect in pioneer and pincay was found excusable.
zilog argues that permitting the of the women claims could create a material adverse change,which could interfere with the effectiveness of the reorganization.even if this were a theoretical possibility,as zilog puts it,the bankruptcy court made no finding that zilog would suffer any prejudice if the claims were filed late.based on the record before us,we can not say that zilog would be prejudiced by the of the women claims.see pioneer,at.in any event,to the extent that zilog is prejudiced as a result of its own deficient lawyering,the burden of such errors or malfeasance must be borne by those who caused it,rather than by innocent creditors who were misled thereby.
after pioneer and pincay,we have little difficulty in concluding that the bankruptcy court here abused its discretion in failing to find excusable neglect.see fed.bankr b w hen an act is required or allowed to be done at or within a specified period by these rules the court for cause shown may at any time in its discretion on motion made after the expiration of the specified period permit the act to be done where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect.we remand to the bankruptcy court to permit the women to file their claims in the bankruptcy proceedings as timely.similarly,in the event that the bankruptcy court determines that the women discrimination claims came within their fair contemplation after the filing of the bankruptcy petition but before its april confirmation order,the bankruptcy court shall permit those claims to be filed as timely administrative expenses.of course,if the discrimination claims are found to have accrued after april,the women may pursue those claims outside of the bankruptcy proceedings.
sanctions award 
section of the bankruptcy code provides that discharge operates as an injunction against the commencement or continuation of an action to collect,recover or offset any discharged debt as a personal liability of the debtor.a.a party who knowingly violates the discharge injunction can be held in contempt under section a of the bankruptcy code.see in re bennett,at walls wells fargo bank,cir holding that civil contempt is an appropriate remedy for a willful violation of section discharge injunction.in bennett,we noted that the party seeking contempt sanctions has the burden of proving,by clear and convincing evidence,that the sanctions are justified.we cited with approval the standard adopted by the eleventh circuit for violation of the discharge injunction t he movant must prove that the creditor knew the discharge injunction was applicable and intended the actions which violated the injunction.bennett,at citing hardy united states in re hardy,cir.
it is clear from our cases,and should have been clear to the bankruptcy court,that knowledge of the injunction is a question of fact that can normally be resolved only after an evidentiary hearing the bankruptcy court,however,decided the contempt motion on a paper record.the court did so after expressing its views about the applicable law in its oral ruling,such as contempt need not be willful to justify an award of damages,and c ontempt may be established even if the failure to comply with the court order was unintentional.the bankruptcy court also seemed to be under the misimpression that knowledge,for purposes of contempt,could be presumed while a party ca be held in contempt absent knowledge of the injunction,knowledge may be presumed in a case where the defendants received notice of bankruptcy and of confirmation of the debtor plan of reorganization.the court went on to conclude that b ased on the evidence,it appears that the defendants knew about the bankruptcy case,knew that the plan had been confirmed.that is sufficient for a presumed knowledge of the discharge injunction.
it is certainly true that a trier of fact could infer knowledge of an automatic stay or discharge injunction from the fact that a creditor knew of the bankruptcy.such an inference,however,would be a matter of fact,not a presumption implied in law.knowledge of the injunction,which is a prerequisite to its willful violation,can not be imputed it must be found.if,as here,the creditors dispute that they had such knowledge,a finding that they knew of the injunction,and thus willfully violated it,can only be made after an evidentiary hearing.
we made this point clear,if it was not before,in a case decided after the bankruptcy court entered its contempt order but before it denied the women motion to reconsider its finding of contempt.in knupfer lindblade in re dyer,cir,we dealt with contempt sanctions for violation of the automatic bankruptcy stay by a creditor,represented by counsel,who filed a lien on property of the estate after commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings.see id.at.in considering whether to uphold the sanctions,we noted that the creditor and his lawyer both knew of the bankruptcy but may not have been familiar with that particular code provision section a of the bankruptcy code,which imposes an automatic stay.id.at.while acknowledging that a party with knowledge of bankruptcy proceedings is charged with knowledge of the automatic stay for purposes of awarding damages under section h of the bankruptcy code,we hesitate d to extend that principle to the contempt context.generally,a party can not be held in contempt for violating an injunction absent knowledge of that injunction.id.at citing bennett,at,and jove eng g,irs,cir.
as noted,the women here dispute knowing of the discharge injunction.that a competent lawyer should have known about the injunction after diligent inquiry is not dispositive.the creditor lawyer in dyer no doubt should have known about the existence of the automatic stay,which he could easily have discovered by doing elementary legal research.nevertheless,we declined to affirm the contempt sanctions on this basis because the lawyer may not have been familiar with that particular code provision.there is nothing remarkable or surprising about this aspect of dyer it simply reiterates the proposition that only actual knowledge of the discharge injunction suffices for a finding of contempt 
by the time zilog was appealed to the district court,dyer had been decided and the district court,in fact,relied on it.perhaps aware that dyer undercut the bankruptcy court rationale for imposition of contempt sanctions,the district court relied on an alternative theory for affirming the contempt order.in dyer,we ultimately upheld the contempt sanctions on the ground that,though the creditor may not have known about the automatic stay initially,he became aware of it when he was notified by the trustee,and this created an affirmative duty to remedy the automatic stay violation by undo ing the recordation process.dyer,at.because the failure to cure the violation after notice was undisputed in dyer,we agreed that the violation was willful and upheld the contempt sanctions.
the district court relied on this aspect of dyer in upholding the bankruptcy court 
defendants were charged with knowledge of the stay sic no later than august,when zilog served a complaint on defendants seeking injunctive relief to stop the idaho state actions.see in re dyer,at.defendants failure to take affirmative action to undo an arguably innocent violation of the automatic stay constituted a willful violation.absent any affirmative act by defendants to stay or dismiss the idaho litigation,the bankruptcy court finding that the continuing idaho state proceedings were a willful violation of the discharge order was reasonable there is nothing in the record to suggest that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion.emphasis added.internal citation omitted.
but the record,in fact,clearly undercuts the district court conclusion.specifically,the record contains a stipulation,approved by the bankruptcy court,staying the idaho state court proceedings.
there remains the question of whether the women and their counsel were,in fact,unaware of the discharge injunction and its potential applicability to their claims.dyer relied on the fact that the automatic stay is imposed by statute,rather than court order,and counsel may not have been aware of the statute.see at.the same is true here the discharge injunction is imposed by section a of the bankruptcy code,and we have found no place where it is also embedded in the bankruptcy court confirmation order.this raises the possibility,as in dyer,that counsel for the women may not have been familiar with that particular code provision.id.at.
to say that counsel may not have known of section is not the same as saying that he did not know.dyer had no reason to resolve this uncertainty because it affirmed on another ground.here,the uncertainty is crucial because there is no evidentiary basis on which to dispose of the contempt claim.on remand,the bankruptcy court shall determine whether the women were aware of the discharge injunction and its applicability to their claims.see bennett,at in order to justify sanctions,the movant must prove that the creditor knew the discharge injunction was applicable and intended the actions which violated the injunction we vacate the bankruptcy court contempt finding and remand for a determination of willfulness.
we reverse the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment to zilog on the women sex discrimination claims the bankruptcy court dischar
