background 
factual history 
federal realty is a real estate investment trust that owns and develops shopping centers and projects.first national is a san mortgage company.beginning in the late,federal realty set out to develop santana row,a project in san jose,which was intended to be one of the nation largest projects.as part of its efforts to develop santana row,federal realty sought to acquire the property at issue in this case the property.the property was owned by d r partnership not a party to this suit and leased by it to first national.during the relevant time,hal dryan had majority ownership and absolute control of both first national and d r partnership.
over the course of several years,first national and federal realty engaged in protracted negotiations concerning the property.at various points in the negotiations,federal realty offered either to buy the property outright or to enter into a ground lease for,a lease of the underlying land with the intention of redeveloping the buildings on the property.the negotiations intensified in the summer of,when the parties exchanged several proposals regarding the terms for the ground lease,including a counter proposal and a revised proposal.at this time,first national rejected federal realty attempt to buy the property outright,noting that a purchase agreement does not address first national long term interests.finally,on august,hal dryan,on behalf of first national,and steve guttman,the president and ceo of federal realty,signed a document entitled final proposal.
the final proposal is a,document regarding a ground lease of the property.it provides for a rent of per month,with increases of annually.it gives first national a put option,allowing first national to require federal realty to buy the property at any time during the ten years.it also gives federal realty a call option at the end of ten years,by which federal realty can require first national to sell it the property at that time.the final proposal also provides that first national will be reimbursed to buy out its current lease tenant,new things west.under the final proposal,federal realty was to prepare a legal agreement for first national review to finalize the agreement.the effective date of the agreement was to be the date of vacating premises.finally,the last clause of the final proposal provides the above terms are hereby accepted by the parties subject only to approval of the terms and conditions of a formal agreement.a copy of the final proposal is attached to this opinion as appendix 
following the signing of the final proposal,the parties engaged in extensive,but ultimately unsuccessful,negotiations towards a formal agreement.as part of these negotiations,the parties exchanged several ideas regarding the proposed lease,with federal realty suggesting a lease term of years,and first national suggesting a lease term of years.the parties also discussed the possibility of an outright sale,but first national refused to sell the property for less than million.
while these negotiations were ongoing,first national gave new things west notice to vacate the premises.first national then informed federal realty of the notice to vacate and asked to be reimbursed for any accompanying loss in rent.in a letter dated may,federal realty rejected any indication that it had to reimburse first national and noted that b ecause we have never resolved a number of significant business issues relating to the acquisition of the property,we still do not have a binding agreement in place for that acquisition.
soon thereafter,the real estate market took a turn for the worse,and,although the parties exchanged several more offers and counteroffers,they were unable to reach an agreement.when these efforts proved unsuccessful,first national filed this action.it recovered damages for federal realty anticipatory breach of the final proposal,and this appeal followed.
procedural history 
in its complaint,first national alleged that federal realty had committed a breach of contract and anticipatory breach by refusing to pay rent and repudiating first national put to require federal realty to buy the property.in response,federal realty filed several motions to dismiss and for summary judgment.as relevant to this appeal,the district court rejected federal realty argument that the final proposal was not binding because of the last clause calling for a formal agreement.according to the court,although the extrinsic evidence presented persuasively suggest ed that the final proposal was conditional and that neither party intended otherwise,the last clause was reasonably susceptible to different interpretations,thereby precluding summary judgment.
the court also rejected federal realty argument that the final proposal was not binding because it was missing an essential duration of the lease.in doing so,the court allowed first national to amend its complaint to allege that the ten year put and call provisions were intended by the parties,and each of them,to,and did,have a special meaning,that is,to establish a lease term of ten years.after examining the extrinsic evidence,the court concluded that first national interpretation of the events surrounding the put and call options was plausible and sufficient for the question to go to the jury.
the liability phase of the case was tried to a jury in june.the jury found in favor of first national on its anticipatory breach claim.the jury found that the parties intended the final proposal to be an enforceable agreement,and intended the put and call options to set a ground lease duration of ten years.the district court subsequently denied federal realty motion for judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,a new trial,concluding there was sufficient evidence to support the jury special findings.
the damages phase was tried to the court in april.the court ultimately awarded first national damages of.out of that amount,approximately million,including interest,was based on lost rent from the ground lease,and approximately million was based on federal realty breach of first national put option.the court specifically found that to receive the full benefit of its bargain,first national was entitled to recover damages for both breach of the lease and breach of its put option.
the district court also denied first national motion to recover certain expert witness fees under california code of civil procedure d,which was based on first national offer to compromise that federal realty rejected.the court found that first national reasonably incurred in expert witness fees.however,first national could not recover those fees,but was limited to a recovery of expert witness fees under federal law,pursuant to this court decision in aceves allstate ins,cir.
ii.discussion 
at the outset,we reject first national argument that because there was a full trial on the merits,federal realty is precluded from challenging the district court denial of its motions for summary judgment.see,llc aftermath records,cir a district court denial of summary judgment is subject to review on appeal,despite full trial on the merits,where the district court made an error of law that,if not made,would have required the district court to grant the motion.citation omitted.moreover,to preserve this issue for appeal,federal realty did not have to present it in a motion for judgment as a matter of law.see id.at holding that an issue of law that does not rest on the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury verdict need not be raised in a motion for judgment as a matter of law to preserve the issue for appeal.rather,all federal realty had to do was raise the argument at some point before the judge submitted the case to the jury,which it did.see id.at.accordingly,the district court determinations that portions of the final proposal were ambiguous are question s of law,subject to independent review on appeal.see id.citation omitted.
questions of law 
conditional nature of the final proposal 
creation of a valid contract requires mutual assent.kruse bank of,d.where there is a manifest intention that the formal agreement is not to be complete until reduced to a formal writing to be executed,there is no binding contract until this is done.smissaert chiodo,d.thus,an agreement to agree,without more,is not a binding contract.autry republic,cal d.
however,an agreement is not unenforceable merely because it is subject to the approval of a formal contract.see,gavina.smith,cal d,an exercise of an option created a binding lease,even though a formal instrument was to be prepared and signed later pac.improvement jones,cal,finding a binding contract for a lease,even though the testimony showed that the parties contemplated substituting for this instrument a more formal lease cappelmann young,d,finding an agreement to be a binding lease,even though it provided that a proper lease shall be drawn within ten days.rather,w hether a writing constitutes a final agreement or merely an agreement to make an agreement depends primarily upon the intention of the parties.in the absence of ambiguity this must be determined by a construction of the instrument taken as a whole.smissaert,d at.
in this case,the court properly rejected federal realty argument that the final proposal was not binding.the final proposal clearly states that its terms are hereby accepted by the parties subject only to approval of the terms and conditions of a formal agreement emphases added in this regard,it is different from rennick care,cir,on which federal realty relies.in finding no binding contract in rennick,we noted that the document in that case was titled letter of intent and specifically provided that this letter of intent is of no binding effect.id.at.in this case,the document is titled final proposal,and it specifically omits federal realty standard clause,which it had inserted in earlier drafts.
moreover,contrary to federal realty argument,calling something a proposal,instead of a contract or a lease,does not necessarily mean it was not meant to be binding,especially where the circumstances suggest otherwise.id.at c alling a document letter of intent implies,unless circumstances suggest otherwise,that the parties intended it to be a nonbinding expression in contemplation of a future contract,as opposed to its sic being a binding contract.here,the circumstances demonstrate that the parties went from a counter proposal,to a revised proposal,to a final proposal.in light of this,it can not be said,as a matter of law,that the final proposal was not meant to be binding.
in reaching this conclusion,we do not question federal realty and the amici curiae assertion that preliminary agreements play an important role in real estate transactions.we do note,however,that at times it is equally important for the parties to be certain that their interim agreements in the midst of protracted negotiations can be enforced.as the california supreme court has noted,
w here the parties have agreed in writing upon the essential terms of the lease,there is a binding lease,even though a formal instrument is to be prepared and signed later.the formal instrument may be more convenient for purposes of recordation and better designed to prevent misunderstanding than the other writings but it is not essential to the existence of the lease.the mere fact that a written lease was in contemplation does not relieve either of the contracting parties from the responsibility of a contract which was already expressed in writing.when one party refuses to execute the lease according to the contract thus made,the other has a right to fall back on the written propositions as originally made,and the absence of the formal agreement contemplated is not material.
gavina,cal d at internal citations omitted.as such,the fact that the parties in this case were negotiating a new contract to replace the final proposal did not relieve either of them from their obligations under the final proposal,which was an existing contract.
omission of an essential element 
to comply with the statute of frauds,there must be some note or memorandum subscribed by the party to be charged.cal.a.a memorandum satisfies the statute of frauds if it identifies the subject of the parties agreement,shows that they made a contract,and states the essential contract terms with reasonable certainty.sterling taylor,cal th.in this case,even assuming the final proposal falls within the statute of frauds as federal realty contends,we reject the argument that it is not binding because it omits an essential term in the form of the duration of the lease.
the mere fact that a lease term is essential does not mean that it has to be express in the contract.on the contrary,although extrinsic evidence can not be used to supply an essential term,it can be used to explain essential terms that were understood by the parties but would otherwise be unintelligible to others.id.at.indeed,california courts have not hesitated to imply a term of duration when the nature of the contract and surrounding circumstances afford a reasonable ground for such implication.consol.theatres,theatrical stage emps.union,cal d.
in this case,the district court did not err in allowing extrinsic evidence to be introduced to determine whether the lease duration was completely absent or whether it could be implied from the put and call options.california has long abandoned a rule that would limit the interpretation of a written instrument to its four corners.see pac.gas thomas drayage rigging,cal d.instead,under the california parol evidence rule,t he test of admissibility of extrinsic evidence to explain the meaning of a written instrument is not whether it appears to the court to be plain and unambiguous on its face,but whether the offered evidence is relevant to prove a meaning to which the language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible.id.thus,
w here the meaning of the words used in a contract is disputed,the trial court must provisionally receive any proffered extrinsic evidence which is relevant to show whether the contract is reasonably susceptible of a particular meaning.indeed,it is reversible error for a trial court to refuse to consider such extrinsic evidence on the basis of the trial court own conclusion that the language of the contract appears to be clear and unambiguous on its face.even if a contract appears unambiguous on its face,a latent ambiguity may be exposed by extrinsic evidence which reveals more than one possible meaning to which the language of the contract is yet reasonably susceptible.
