this appeal arises out of a suit over repair work on a luxury motor coach.the company that owns the vehicle,limoliner,contracted with an automotive repair company,dattco,to do the work.the parties do not contest the finding below that dattco breached the repair contract by failing to do all of the work that limoliner had requested.but limoliner does appeal the rulings below that dattco may not be held liable under a massachusetts regulation for certain actions and omissions that occurred on the job that dattco did not breach the parties oral contract to make the repairs in a timely manner and that dattco owes damages only for the loss of use of the vehicle for one limited period of time.
we certify a question concerning the massachusetts regulation intended scope to the supreme judicial court of massachusetts,and we thus do not decide the merits of limoliner regulatory claims.we otherwise affirm.
limoliner is a massachusetts corporation that owns and operates a fleet of luxury motor coaches that are known as liners.dattco is a connecticut corporation that repairs and services motor vehicles,including buses and coaches.the undisputed facts are as follows.
on may,two limoliner employees met with two dattco representatives to discuss the possible need to repair one of the liners,liner.that vehicle had been out of service for about a year and needed extensive repair work.
at the may meeting,dattco orally agreed to repair liner by,among other things,replacing or repairing a part of the vehicle called the inverter.the parties agreed that liner would be towed to dattco facility in massachusetts for inspection and that dattco would provide a list of repairs following inspection.during that meeting,limoliner general manager told dattco sales manager that limoliner wanted liner to be repaired as soon as possible.
following that meeting,dattco generated a list of repairs,though that list did not include the inverter work that the magistrate judge found that dattco had actually agreed to perform.the two parties used this list to divide the responsibility for each repair between each party.dattco was to undertake the bulk of the repair work with the rest left for limoliner own mechanics.
after dattco took hold of liner,limoliner became concerned about the time dattco was taking to repair the vehicle.on august,at an meeting,the representatives from limoliner demanded compensation from dattco for the monetary losses limoliner claimed it had sustained up to that point as a result of its inability to use liner.on august,limoliner followed up by letter and complained about the level of attention,time and resources assigned to the job by dattco and specifically demanded in compensation.limoliner,dattco,jcb,wl,at.that letter also contained an offer to pay dattco a certain amount for its services if dattco delivered liner by on friday,august.
dattco responded to that letter by email on august.in doing so,dattco informed limoliner that liner was ready for pickup.attached to the email was an invoice for.
limoliner refused to pay,but offered to put the money in escrow in exchange for the return of liner.dattco did not accept that offer.
on october,limoliner filed this action in massachusetts superior court.the suit alleged breach of contract,misrepresentation,negligence,replevin,and violation of,a regulation promulgated by the massachusetts attorney general pursuant to.laws ch,chapter.limoliner also moved for an order directing dattco to return liner.
the court issued the requested order after first requiring limoliner to submit a deposit to the clerk office.dattco complied with the court order and returned liner to limoliner on october.
dattco removed the case to federal district court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction,answered,and counterclaimed for breach of contract and quantum meruit.a magistrate judge,presiding by consent over a bench trial,found that dattco had expressly agreed to repair liner inverter and breached the agreement by failing to make that repair the magistrate judge awarded limoliner in damages for that breach.the magistrate judge ruled for dattco on all of limoliner other claims,including the remaining contract claims and the regulatory claims.the magistrate judge also awarded dattco in damages on its quantum meruit claim,thereby reducing limoliner total recoverable damages to.
limoliner appeals on three grounds.first,limoliner contends that the magistrate judge erred when she held,as a matter of law,that does not apply to this dispute because the regulation does not apply to disputes between two businesses.second,limoliner contends that the magistrate judge committed clear error when she found both that the parties did not agree to an expedited term for performance and that dattco did not breach the parties implicit agreement to complete the work within a reasonable period of time.third,limoliner contends that the magistrate judge clearly erred in awarding damages that provide compensation only for one portion of the time that limoliner was without the use of liner.
we start with limoliner regulatory claims.chapter generally prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.laws ch,a.the statute also empowers the attorney general of massachusetts to issue regulations the violation of which constitutes a per se violation of chapter.see id.c.
limoliner regulatory claims rely on one of those regulations.it provides,among other things,that i t is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for a repair shop,prior to commencing repairs on a customer vehicle,to fail to record in writing t he specific repairs requested by the customer id.e.
the magistrate judge found that dattco failed to include the inverter in the written list of repairs it prepared prior to working on liner,even though limoliner had previously requested that specific repair.limoliner thus contends that dattco plainly violated the regulation in this and other respects.but the magistrate judge ruled that does not apply to transactions and instead regulates transactions only between businesses and individual consumers.for that reason,the magistrate judge rejected limoliner claim that dattco violated the regulation.
neither the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc nor this circuit has construed this regulation before.but the sjc has held that a subsection of an arguably analogous chapter regulation is inapplicable to corporate consumers.see knapp shoes,sylvania shoe,holding that does not apply to transactions.and we have followed knapp in concluding that a different chapter regulation also does not apply to disputes.see baker goldman,sachs,cir holding,on the basis of knapp,that does not apply to transactions.
in knapp,the sjc addressed,a provision that makes it an unfair and deceptive act or practice to fail to perform or fulfill any promises or obligations arising under a warranty.knapp held that it was reasonably clear that,in drafting the regulation,the attorney general had in mind protection for consumers,meaning individuals.knapp,at.
the sjc reached that conclusion by first noting that was promulgated in,the year before chapter was amended to give corporate entities a right of action under the statute.id.at.the sjc then examined as a whole and noted that the other two subsections of the regulation explicitly referred to consumers and concern ed matters generally involved in consumer transactions,such as the obligation to provide the customer with a written and accurate estimate of the anticipated cost of repairs and a prohibition on charging for repairs which the customer has not authorized.id.at.the sjc thus concluded that subsection of the regulation was not intended to encompass a contract dispute between businessmen because the bulk of the regulation applie d only to consumers and their interests,and subsection contain ed no language suggesting that it was meant to apply to a broader class of persons or interests.id.
dattco the magistrate judge agreed that is just like the subsection of the regulation construed in knapp.although does not use the term consumer,it does set out obligations very similar to those that the knapp court described as being generally involved in consumer transactions.see referring to repairs and service made for the benefit of the customer and with respect to the customer vehicle e obligating a repair shop to make a written record of all specific repairs requested by the customer before commencing repair work id.prohibiting a repair shop from charging for repairs that have not been authorized by the customer see also knapp,at noting in the context of that consumer and customer are used interchangeably.and the sample waiver form included in the text of the regulation provided to give repair shops the option to ask customers to authorize repairs in advance is written in the first person,as if on behalf of an individual rather than a business.see d i understand that i have the right to know before authorizing any repairs what the repairs to my car will be and what their cost will be.you need not obtain approval from me for repairs or inform me prior to performing repairs what the repairs are or their cost,if the total amount for repairs does not exceed a specified amount.
nonetheless,unlike the regulation considered in knapp,is part of the massachusetts attorney general motor vehicle regulations.thus,unlike the regulation considered in knapp,is not part of the general consumer protection regulations.and,as limoliner contends,the terms of could be read to more directly encompass acts taken in the context than could the terms of the subsection of the regulation considered in knapp.see generally id.proscribing unfair or deceptive acts or practices in relation to the customer id.defining customer as any person who has or seeks to have repairs,service or maintenance performed by a repair shop on a motor vehicle id.defining person as a corporation,among other things.
moreover,the timing of the promulgation of differs from the timing of the promulgation of.section of the thus this regulation became effective in.that was four years after corporations were granted a right of action under chapter.thus,the timing based reason the sjc gave in knapp for construing the reach of that regulation not to encompass disputes is not present here.
the sjc has not had occasion to provide additional guidance since knapp about whether regulations promulgated under chapter apply to disputes.we thus conclude that this case presents close and difficult legal issues for which there is no controlling massachusetts precedent.easthampton sav.bank city of springfield,cir.moreover,this case has the potential to impact numerous transactions concerning motor vehicle repair and service,implicates competing policy interests,and involves an area of traditional state authority.see id.at.and,finally,resolution of the regulation scope may be determinative of limoliner regulatory claims.see.accordingly,we certify the following question to the sjc,as the sjc permits us to do in these circumstances,see 
does apply to transactions in which the customer is a business entity 
the clerk of this court is directed to forward to the massachusetts supreme judicial court,under the official seal of this court,a copy of the certified question and our opinion in this case,along with copies of the briefs and appendices filed by the parties.we retain jurisdiction over this appeal,and the question of whether dattco violated,pending resolution of the certified question.
with respect to limoliner contract claims,the company contends that the magistrate judge clearly erred in finding that the parties did not agree to an expedited term of performance.limoliner also contends that,in any event,dattco breached the agreement by failing to perform within a reasonable time.we consider each argument in turn.
the contract between the parties was an oral one.the parties do not dispute that massachusetts law governs this contract.the parties also do not dispute that a representative of limoliner told dattco on may,prior to liner transfer to dattco facilities that limoliner wanted the vehicle to be repaired as soon as possible.the question,therefore,is whether that statement made expedited performance a term of the oral contract between the parties.
the parties agree that under massachusetts law this question is one of fact,see rizzo cunningham,rci northeast servs.div.boston edison,cir w here the plain meaning of a contract phrase does not spring unambiguously from the page or from the context,its proper direction becomes one for the factfinder,who must ferret out the intent of the parties.applying massachusetts law,and that we must review the magistrate judge finding only for clear error.see.a.we find none.
the magistrate judge did note that i n other contexts,phrases such as as soon as possible and as soon as practicable have been construed to mean as soon as reasonably possible under the circumstances of the case.limoliner,wl,at.but the magistrate judge expressly found,in this instance,that there was no agreement that the repairs would be performed on an expedited basis.id.the magistrate judge reasoned as follows.
the magistrate judge found that there was no evidence that limoliner ever told dattco that it needed liner by a specific date or the reason why it needed it back as soon as possible.id.at.consistent with that finding,the record shows that limoliner had not used liner for its luxury transportation business for over a year by the time it contracted with dattco for repairs.the record also provides a basis for the magistrate judge finding that dattco understood that liner had been out of service for quite some time.id.at.in fact,the dattco sales manager present at the may meeting testified that b ecause liner had been down for so long he did believe there was any urgency,no one had told him about any urgency.
as a result,the magistrate judge did not clearly err in treating limoliner single oral request for performance as soon as possible to be a perfunctory suggestion rather than a manifestation of a mutually agreed upon term of expedited performance see murphy nelson,holding that an oral conversation regarding the terms of an agreement could be found not to have been intended by the parties to be a part of their ultimate agreement,as it was no more than an expression of an opinion or suggestion concerning the transaction into which the parties contemplated entering rezendes barrows,no.civ,wl,at,holding that a written brokerage agreement did not include an expedited term of performance because the agreement contemplated a definite result and lacked an explicit expiration date,even though the broker knew that the borrowers were seeking funds as soon as possible.we therefore reject limoliner first challenge.
limoliner next argues that even if there was no agreement to expedite the repair work,dattco still failed to perform the repairs within a reasonable period of time.limoliner first contends that the magistrate judge erred by failing to make a finding on this score at all.limoliner then contends that,to the extent the magistrate judge did find that dattco performance was timely,the magistrate judge committed clear error in so finding.
under massachusetts law,if a contract is silent as to the term for performance,then the term shall be a reasonable time based on all the relevant evidence.see bushkin assocs.raytheon,cir thermo electron schiavone const,cir in the absence of any specified time limit or provision stating that time was of the essence,the term was a reasonable time.contrary to limoliner contention,the magistrate judge,applying that default term for performance,did find that dattco performed within a reasonable time.see limoliner,wl,at finding that dattco did not breach the contract with regard to the timing of the repairs,as dattco performed as soon as reasonably possible under the circumstances.
that being the case,limoliner agrees that a finding about reasonable timely performance is one of fact and is thus subject to the clearly erroneous standard of.a.see hammond litle,cir applying massachusetts law.and,once again,we find no clear error.
the reasonableness of dattco period of performance extending from may,to august,depends on the nature of the contract,the probable intention of the parties
