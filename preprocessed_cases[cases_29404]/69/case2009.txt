this case questions the proper measure of damages when a fiduciary fraudulently induces the sale of real property to a third party by failing to disclose a material fact unrelated to the value of the property.defendants brenlar investments,doing business as frank howard allan brenlar and its agent haya smith appeal from a judgment against them entered on plaintiff john strebel complaint for real estate fraud.defendants concede that substantial evidence supports the jury findings that smith concealed information about the salability of a house in sonoma county that strebel had agreed to purchase,and that strebel sold his house in the city of san bruno believing that escrow on the sonoma county house would soon close.defendants challenge the court rulings with respect to strebel damages,arguing,among other things,that the court erroneously permitted the jury to include lost appreciation in the value of the san bruno home and lost use of the san bruno property in the measure of recovery.while we reject these contentions in the published portion of this opinion,in the unpublished portion we conclude that there must be stricken from the judgment,the amount by which the verdict exceeded the economic damages to which strebel expert testified,and awarded for emotional distress arising from defendants negligence.
strebel has filed a in which he contends that the court erred by dismissing the jury before it reached a verdict on punitive damages.in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we also conclude there was no abuse of discretion in finding that strebel failed to subpoena brenlar financial documents in a timely manner and therefore was unable to present any evidence of brenlar financial worth in support of his claim for punitive damages.accordingly,we shall reduce the judgment by and affirm the judgment in all other respects.
factual and procedural history 
on august,strebel entered into a contract to buy a house in sonoma county from jon and laurie steel for.unbeknownst to strebel,the sonoma house was encumbered with tax liens and judgments that exceeded the purchase price.smith,acting as a dual agent for the buyer and sellers,was aware of the tax liens but concealed that information from strebel.on august,the steels wrote to smith,explaining that they had made an offer in compromise to the internal revenue service irs to reduce the tax liens,but that if the offer was rejected they would be unable to transfer title to strebel.smith did not convey this information to strebel.instead,when strebel learned of the tax liens,smith told him the steels were working on reducing the liens,which would not be a problem.three days later smith again reassured strebel that the steels were taking care of it and escrow would close they were moving forward with the transaction.
in the meantime,strebel was making preparations to sell his home in san bruno.strebel entered into a contract to sell the san bruno property in for.the sale was contingent on the sonoma escrow proceeding.strebel immediately told smith that he had sold the san bruno home and that escrow was set to close september.after receiving assurances from smith that the sonoma purchase was on track,strebel closed escrow on the sale of his san bruno house as scheduled and moved his personal property to a storage unit in sonoma.strebel netted approximately from the sale of his san bruno home.
unfortunately,the steels offer in compromise was rejected by the irs and on october,the steels told strebel that they could not sell him the sonoma house because of the outstanding tax liens.strebel placed the proceeds from the sale of the san bruno house into a bank account bearing four percent interest and for over one year searched unsuccessfully for additional properties in sonoma.by september,he was still unable to find a suitable replacement property and began to conclude that he had been priced out of the sonoma county real estate market.
on june,strebel filed a complaint against brenlar and smith alleging unfair business practices,fraud,negligence,and breach of fiduciary duty.at the liability phase of the trial,which began in july,the jury found that smith and brenlar had intentionally concealed material facts with the intent to defraud strebel and on a separate verdict form that they were also liable for negligence strebel was awarded in economic damages on both claims.the negligence verdict form alone contained a space for damages,which the jury found to be an additional.the jury found that brenlar and smith acted with oppression and fraud,but not malice.
after the jury returned its verdict on friday,september,the court ordered the jury to return the following monday to begin the punitive damages phase of the trial.at the same time,strebel dismissed his punitive damages claim against smith.on august,in anticipation of the punitive damages phase,strebel had attempted to subpoena brenlar financial documents.at a hearing on the afternoon of september,brenlar argued that the subpoenas had not been properly served and that an additional document request made only that afternoon was unreasonable.the court continued the hearing to monday morning and ultimately determined that strebel had not subpoenaed brenlar financial documents in a timely manner.because strebel was unable to present any evidence in support of his claim for punitive damages,the court excused the jury and entered judgment.defendants filed a timely notice of appeal and strebel filed a timely notice of.
discussion 
defendants appeal regarding damages 
strebel claimed economic damages consisted of several components the lost appreciation of his san bruno house between its sale in and trial in,the lost use of the property during that period,and other components that are not disputed on appeal strebel expert witness john testified to strebel economic damages,including the value of the loss of appreciation and use of the san bruno property.calculated the gross lost appreciation by subtracting the sale price from his opinion of the then current fair market value of the house based on a study of comparable sales.this produced an increase in value of percent,which he considered to be conservative when compared to a percent rate of appreciation between and reflected in a general market indicator survey to which he referred.he then reduced the gross amount by the estimated closing costs on such a sale to reach net lost appreciation,which he calculated to be.
calculated strebel loss of use damages by subtracting the costs associated with living in his house,mortgage interest,taxes and insurance,from the cost of renting a similar house in san bruno.this difference was.adding this amount to of lost appreciation and including the other undisputed damage elements produced a total of,which was opinion of economic damages and the amount that strebel attorney asked the jury to award.
strebel damages were based on claimed emotional distress arising from him not having a house and running around looking for a place to live and from financial injury includ ing the withholding of strebel ten thousand dollar security deposit at the exact time when he was looking for another house to buy and would have needed that to pay towards another purchase offer.
as indicated above,the jury returned verdicts awarding strebel in economic damages on his concealment and negligence claims and an additional in damages on his negligence claim.judgment was entered in his favor against brenlar and smith for.it appears that the court deducted from five percent comparative fault that the jury attributed to strebel and an additional amount received by strebel in settlement of related claims against another party.thereafter,the court denied motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a new trial that were grounded primarily on the claimed excessiveness of the damages.
appreciation damages 
by an in limine motion,defendants moved to exclude evidence of appreciation in the value of the san bruno property.after extended argument and supplemental briefing,the court denied the motion,accepting strebel contention that lost appreciation is a proper element of recovery under civil code section,which defines the measure of damages generally for fraud in the purchase,sale or exchange of property on appeal,strebel implicitly acknowledges the inapplicability of section,and defends the admissibility of the appreciation evidence under the broader measure of damages for torts under sections and without objection,the court instructed the jury under all of these sections.referring to the claim of constructive fraud by a fiduciary,the court drew from section and instructed that damages must be in an amount that would compensate plaintiff for all harm or loss caused by defendants wrongful conduct,whether the harm or loss caused by defendants wrongful conduct could have been anticipated or not.referring to the claim of fraudulent concealment,the court drew from section and baji and instructed on the measure of damages amount of the award should include,one,the difference,if any,between the actual value of that with which the plaintiff parted and the actual value of that which was received and on the additional items of recovery authorized by section,subdivision a,paragraphs,and amounts actually and reasonably expended in reliance upon the fraud any amount which would compensate the plaintiff for loss of use and enjoyment of the property to the extent that any such loss was caused by the fraud and any amount which would compensate the plaintiff for any profits or other gains which might reasonably have been earned by use of the property had the plaintiff retained it.the court used baji to instruct on causation and baji to instruct on the duty to mitigate damages 
although of little consequence there are two reasons for which section does not apply in this case.for one,the fraud was perpetrated by a fiduciary.california law is committed to the view that the fraudulent breach of fiduciary duty is a tort,and the faithless fiduciary is obligated to make good the full amount of the loss of which his breach of faith is a cause.citations.in accordance with this general principle,the cases hold that while the fraudulent property transactions between a vendor and vendee are governed by the special rule espoused in section citations,where,as here,the defrauding party stands in a fiduciary relationship to the victim of fraud,the damages must be measured pursuant to the broad provisions of sections and,regulating compensation for torts in general.pepitone russo d,fn.italics omitted.more recently the california supreme court reiterated,in california,a defrauded party is ordinarily limited to recovering his loss citation.in fraud cases involving the purchase,sale or exchange of property,the legislature has expressly provided that the rather than the measure of damages should apply,subds.a,b.this section does not apply,however,when a victim is defrauded by its fiduciaries.in this situation,the broader measure of damages provided by sections and applies.alliance mortgage rothwell cal th,d,fns.omitted alliance.
secondly,in channell anthony,supra,d at page,the court held that the consequential damages provided under section,subdivision a and are available only in conjunction with a claim for rescission.channell anthony,supra,at.b y electing to drop their rescission cause of action respondents gave up any right to claim loss of profits,except as such right was created by the final agreement see also miller starr,cal.real estate ed.a seller who loses the use and enjoyment of the premises as a proximate result of the buyer misrepresentations can recover the value of the of the premises by bringing an action for rescission,but the loss of use usually can not be recovered when the seller affirms the contract and seeks the recovery of damages because the right of possession was transferred to the buyer when title was conveyed fns.omitted.
while sections and thus provide the applicable statutory basis for the calculation of damages in this case,there is a split of authority regarding the proper measure of damages under section for a real estate broker intentional fraud.alliance,supra,cal th at,d.in alliance,the court explained,we have previously held that a plaintiff is only entitled to its actual or losses suffered because of fiduciary negligent misrepresentation under section.citations.while the measure of damages under section might be greater for a fiduciary intentional misrepresentation,we need not address that issue here.alliance,supra,at,d.some appellate courts have held that the measure of damages provided by sections and is substantially the same as that for breach of contract prescribed by section,it tends to give the injured party the benefit of his bargain and insofar as possible to place him in the same position he would have been in had the promisor performed the contract.pepitone russo,supra,d at,italics omitted fragale faulkner th,d.others,however,have concluded that the rule should apply.overgaard johnson d.overgaard hensley mcsweeney th,d.in these cases,the courts have observed that section does not set forth any benefit of the bargain rule.that section simply sets out the measure of damages long recognized in torts,namely,to compensate a plaintiff for a loss sustained rather than give him the benefit of any contract bargain.overgaard,supra,at.hensley mcsweeney,supra,at,d.
sometimes,however,neither the nor measure is particularly helpful or appropriate.we often look upon the out of pocket rule and the benefit of the bargain rule as being the sole antagonists on the battlefield of damages when at times neither is truly applicable.overgaard,supra,d at.such is the case here.strebel damages can not be measured in terms of loss or contractual benefits and expectations.unlike the more common situation in which the actionable fraud relates to the value of the property being sold or exchanged,salahutdin valley of california,th,d broker misrepresentation as to size of property and ability to subdivide caused purchasers to pay more for property than it was worth housley city of poway th,d developer misrepresentation regarding easement caused owner to sell property for less than it was worth,the facts that were fraudulently concealed here had nothing to do with the value of the sonoma or san bruno properties.strebel damages arose neither because the value of either property was more or less than the agreed price nor because the value of either was other than as promised the question is not whether strebel is entitled to his losses or to the benefit of his bargain,but whether the amount by which the value of his san bruno home appreciated after he sold it is a reasonable measure of the harm he suffered as the consequence of defendant fraud.
tort damages are awarded to fully compensate the victim for all the injury suffered.citation.there is no fixed rule for the measure of tort damages under civil code section.the measure that most appropriately compensates the injured party for the loss sustained should be adopted.santa barbara pistachio ranch chowchilla water dist.th,d.the jury here was correctly advised that the damages awarded must be in an amount that would compensate plaintiff for all harm or loss caused by defendants wrongful conduct and that defendants fraud must be a substantial factor in causing strebel loss.
strebel asserted that he was injured because defendants fraud caused him to sell his san bruno house sooner than he would otherwise have done,rendering him unable to purchase a replacement home before housing values substantially increased.strebel testified that he intended to sell his home and purchase the new house in sonoma at the same time,thereby limiting the impact of market fluctuations on the exchange.however,because of defendants fraud,strebel was unable to make the second transaction before market values rose.the resultant harm was a decrease in the buying power of the proceeds of his san bruno house in a rapidly appreciating housing market.in the words of strebel attorney in closing argument,all we asking for here is for him in effect to get enough money to now buy something comparable to the sonoma property in today market.that would be the net effect of what we asking for,which would in a sense put him back to where he was back in.in permitting the jury to consider lost appreciation,the trial court properly determined that the jury could reasonably find this element necessary to compensate strebel for the injury caused by defendants concealment.under the circumstances shown by the evidence,the jury was entitled to find that recovery of the lost appreciation was reasonable compensation for strebel inability to purchase an acceptable home in sonoma concurrently with the sale of his san bruno house 
defendants contend that sections and do not authorize strebel appreciation damages because damages proximately caused by fraud are determined as of the date when the fraud took by a later increase or decline in value.in estate of anderson d,the court rejected the argument that there is no basis in california law for an award of appreciation damages.the court upheld an award of damages based on the value at the time of trial rather than the time of the sale of property which the seller had been fraudulently induced to sell.the court concluded that california law is not as restrictive as the bank urges,and found that the award in this case does not offend against reasonableness or any other policy of recovery.ibid.the court relied in part on estate of talbot d,in which another court recognized that in cases involving a breach of loyalty,the trier of the fact should have some discretion to fix the damages in accordance with the nature and degree of the breach thus,what constitutes making good the loss may vary according to the circumstances.estate of anderson,supra,at.likewise,in garrett perry cal d,the court held that t he statement that damages are to be assessed as of the date of the fraudulent transaction is too broad insofar as it means that the court can not consider subsequent factors which affect the amount of the actual loss.id.at.the fact that values must ordinarily be considered as of the time of the fraudulent transaction does not mean that the court can not consider circumstances other than value which operate to increase or reduce the injury.id.at.here,measuring strebel damages at the time of the sale would provide no compensation for the most significant portion of the loss he suffered as a result of defendants fraud.salahutdin valley of california,supra,th at,d measuring benefit of the bargain damages as of the date of the transaction would defeat the goal of compensation for the entire loss where,as here,discovery of the fiduciary constructive fraud did not occur until years after purchase of the property.
defendants reliance on safeco ins.j d painting th,d safeco,is misplaced.in safeco,the defendant negligence caused significant fire damage to the plaintiff house.during the five months that it took to repair the damage,the real estate market declined significantly,reducing the value of the plaintiff house by.the court rejected the plaintiff claim for depreciation damages based on his lost opportunity to sell the property before the market declined,holding that the recovery of such damages would be inconsistent with the general rule that in a suit for negligent damage to real property the plaintiff may recover the lesser of the cost of repair or the diminution in value,but not both.the court reasoned,it is conceded appellant might be able to show that,but for respondent negligence,he would have been able to sell his house earlier for more than he can now obtain.the rule for recovery in tort has never rested solely on but for causation cause in fact,but has also been based on proximate cause.thus,civil code section mandates recovery not simply for all detriment caused by defendant negligence,but for all detriment proximately caused thereby a superseding cause utterly unrelated to the defendant negligence breaks the chain of proximate causation and is a bar to recovery.liability can not be predicated on a prior and remote cause which merely furnishes the condition or occasion for an injury resulting from an intervening unrelated and efficient cause,even though the injury would not have resulted but for such condition or occasion citations.although appellant might have sold his house at a high price but for respondent negligence,the decline in the market bore no relation whatsoever to the acts of respondent.respondent negligence,if such there was,was merely the condition or occasion for the market decline to affect appellant house.in assessing proximate cause,courts also look to the foreseeability of the superseding cause of injury.citation.it can hardly be said that respondent should have foreseen the steep decline that has occurred in california real estate values.if history had been any guide,a delay in sale of property in california would more likely increase the return of the owner.id.at,d.
safeco is distinguishable for many reasons.first,the damage in safeco was caused by defendant negligence,not intentional fraud by a fiduciary as in this case.as noted above,the faithless fiduciary is obligated to make good the full amount of the loss of which his breach of faith is a cause.pepitone russo,supra,d at.prince harting d.it has long been the law in this state that a faithless fiduciary must repay to the beneficiary of his fiduciary duties the entire profit that he caused the beneficiary to lose.more importantly,strebel diminished buying power in the rising real estate market was substantially related to defendants fraud.the jury was instructed on the proper standard of causation substantial factor and the record supports its finding that defendants fraud was a substantial factor in bringing about strebel damages the rising value of the property he intended to purchase with the proceeds from the san bruno home was not unforeseeable and,indeed,was the very reason strebel testified he told defendants he wanted to be sure the sonoma purchase would close before he sold the san bruno property.finally,in safeco,the court concluded that there is no compelling public policy reason to allow plaintiff to recover when the time needed to repair coincides with a general decline in the market for such properties.such a recovery would surely not deter negligence in any meaningful way.id.at,d.allowing recovery for lost appreciation under the facts of this case,however,will provide a significant deterrent to a real estate agent fraudulently misleading prospective buyers under similar circumstances in the future 
defendants next argument,that strebel appreciation damages are barred by the doctrine of avoidable consequences is no more persuasive.defendants contend that uncontradicted evidence shows that strebel had the financial ability to buy another san bruno area house.this simple action would have avoided his claimed damages for lost appreciation.under the doctrine of avoidable consequences,strebel failure to take reasonable steps to avoid lost appreciation conclusively bars his recovery for lost appreciation.in state of health services superior court cal th,d,the court explained,although courts explaining the avoidable consequences doctrine have sometimes written that a party has a duty to mitigate damages,commentators have criticized the use of the term duty in this context,arguing that it is more accurate to state simply that a plaintiff may not recover damages that the plaintiff could easily have avoided.citations.a federal appellate court explained the guiding principle this way t he community notions of fair compensation to an injured plaintiff do not include wounds which in a practical sense are.citations.under the avoidable consequences doctrine as recognized in california,a person injured by another wrongful conduct will not be compensated for damages that the injured person could have avoided by reasonable effort or expenditure.citations.the reasonableness of the injured party efforts must be judged in light of the situation existing at the time and not with the benefit of hindsight.italics added.strebel does not dispute that recovery will not be allowed for damages that a party should have foreseen and could have avoided by reasonable effort without undue risks,expense,or humiliation.as indicated above,the jury was instructed that strebel may not reco
