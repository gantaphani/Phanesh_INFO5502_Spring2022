on or about may,the buyers and the tribe entered into a written assignment and assumption agreement.under the assumption agreement,the tribe agreed to assume the buyers rights,title,and interest in four specified properties.the four properties did not include the realmuto property.

delivery of the disclosure statement was a condition precedent to the buyers performance 
realmuto contends the trial court erred in finding that the delivery of a disclosure statement,as required by section et,was a condition precedent to the buyers performance of the contract.realmuto maintains t here is no language in the contract which states that close of escrow shall occur,only after seller has provided an appropriate disclosure to the buyer.realmuto also asserts that the language in the contract calling for time frames to disclose should be viewed as a directive rather than as a condition precedent.we disagree.
in contract law,a condition precedent is either an act of a party that must be performed or an uncertain event that must happen before the contractual right accrues or the contractual duty arises.platt pacific,andelson cal th,d.the existence of a condition precedent normally depends upon the intent of the parties as determined from the words they have employed in the contract.williston on contracts ed,at.
in this case,however,we are dealing with a statutory requirement that was expressly incorporated into the parties requirement that the seller provide to the buyers a real estate transfer disclosure statement.et thus,our primary task is to determine whether the legislature intended the delivery of a disclosure statement to be a condition precedent to the buyer performance.in deciding this issue,we are guided by settled principles of statutory interpretation.the fundamental purpose of statutory construction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.people pieters cal d,pieters.we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.people jenkins cal th,d.
