law environmental consultants,law,lec or appellee,prevailed on summary judgment in an action for copyright infringement brought by osvaldo and nadja bagué,personally and on behalf of their conjugal partnership and paso del indio,pdi collectively appellants.this judgment was not appealed.subsequently,the district court awarded costs and attorney fees to lec as a prevailing party under the copyright act.this appeal followed.we affirm the award of costs and attorney fees.
a.the copyright action 
the parties were engaged by the puerto rican highway authority prha to provide historical preservation services for an archeological site.on may,was employed directly by prha to prepare various preliminary documents during the planning and proposal phases of the project.prepared a mitigation plan in october of,and a research design and proposal during and.on february,prha informed of its intent to contract with lec to oversee the administration of the laboratory phase of the project,and requested that and his company,pdi,negotiate a subcontract for the delivery of archeological services directly with lec.
upon receipt of this information,on february,obtained copyrights for the two documents he had prepared pursuant to the agreement with prha during the planning and design phases of the project.then notified prha and lec that they would have to negotiate for the implementation and use of those documents during the administration phase,because he owned the copyrights to the documents.
on september,pdi contracted with lec,in writing,to provide technical services for the preliminary administration of the project in accordance with the agreement.lec contract with prha to serve as prime contractor during the administrative phase of the project was formalized in writing on november.it provided that t he prha will have a sic complete and unrestricted ownership rights to all reports,technical memorandums,plans,data or any other work product prepared by lec in connection with the services performance.on january,copyrighted a third research and work plan,reworking the two documents from the prior work done for prha,and incorporating work done pursuant to the contract with lec.the three copyrighted documents,as described in the district court decision on the merits,are compilations of the works of various authors,the bulk of the content comprising historical fact discoveries,and otherwise consist primarily of procedures and methods of operation for the recovery,analysis and reporting of findings related to an archeological site.osvaldo puerto rico highway,d.
following lec supposed failure to comply with an oral contract to hire pdi for the final administrative phase of the project,on april,brought suit against lec in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico.the complaint alleged copyright infringement under the copyright act,et,as well as pendent state law claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.it was undisputed that lec and the highway authority utilized the data in the research design and work plan prepared by plaintiff pursuant to his contracts with them,d at.
after over two years of litigation,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of lec on april.the copyright claim was dismissed with prejudice and the state law claims were dismissed without prejudice.the district court held that the works at issue were not copyrightable because they were compilations of noncopyrightable subject matter under section of the copyright act the arrangement and selection of the noncopyrightable materials within each work lacked originality and the works were prepared in connection with a federally authorized prehistoric survey,and therefore were the property of the federal government under a.
b.the fee dispute 
on may,lec,having prevailed on the merits,filed a timely motion requesting costs and attorney fees in accordance with the copyright act,on march,the district court issued an order denying lec motion,without prejudice of being resubmitted with satisfactory evidence,in addition to lec attorneys own affidavits,justifying the reasonableness of its requested rate for attorney fees.on march,lec filed a motion for an enlargement of time,requesting an additional thirty days until april,to submit the requested evidence on the reasonableness of its rate for attorney fees.in docketing lec motion for an enlargement of time,the district court set a deadline of march,for the filing of any response in opposition from appellants.appellants filed no such response.
on april,one day before the requested deadline of april,lec submitted additional evidence concerning the reasonableness of its attorney fees rates to the district court.on may,appellants for the first time raised a timeliness challenge to the attorney fees request.appellants also reiterated a series of other objections to the request for fees and costs,arguing,inter alia,that the award was not warranted under the factors set forth in the supreme court decision in fogerty fantasy,d that the rates charged were unreasonable and that lec improperly incurred translation costs after the district court dismissed the action.
on november,the district court ordered to pay lec in costs and in attorney fees.the district court noted that p laintiffs contend that attorney fees are not warranted in this case because the court never stated nor relied on any finding that claim was frivolous or that plaintiffs filed their action in bad faith.the court found that copyrighting the documents was done in bad faith in order to leverage lec cooperation in hiring and that further use of the copyrights to bootstrap a state law contract action into federal court wasted an immeasurable amount of this court time as well as causing inappropriate and unnecessary legal expenses for lec.this appeal followed.our review as to the issue of jurisdiction is plenary.we review the district court award of costs and attorney fees for abuse of discretion.invessys,cir.
we address first the question whether the district court had jurisdiction to award attorney fees under appellants contend that the district court order of march,denying lec initial request without prejudice and with leave to resubmit,was a final order.they therefore claim that the district court was without jurisdiction to rule on lec april,motion supplementing the original fee request with additional evidence,because this motion was filed after the mandatory period to file a rule e motion had expired 
there is no question that awards of attorney fees may be appealed separately as final orders after a final determination of liability on the merits.see in re nineteen appeals,cir noting that orders setting attorneys fees are separate from determinations on the merits in a jurisdictionally significant sense.there is also no question that a dismissal of a complaint without prejudice is generally considered to be a final judgment for appeal purposes.mirpuri act,cir.here,however,lec argues that the district court order was conditional rather than final because,in denying the fees without prejudice,the district court expressly invited the defendants to file an amended request for fees including additional evidence.
the question of whether the district court initial dismissal was final is complicated.in jung mining,d,the supreme court held that where a district court dismissed a complaint but granted the plaintiff a specific period of time to refile,the initial dismissal was not final,and an appeal could be filed after a later final order of dismissal.id.at.the circuits have adopted conflicting interpretations of jung.compare richards dunne,cir finding that the district court dismissal of plaintiffs claim was not a final judgment where the court allowed plaintiffs a specific time period to amend and plaintiffs did nothing except file a notice of appeal after the time period elapsed,and wmx techs,miller,cir en banc same,with otis city of chicago,cir en banc finding that after the period of leave to amend had elapsed,the district court dismissal of plaintiff case became final,and schuurman motor vessel betty k v,cir same.
this case presents a particularly difficult problem because the original dismissal order provided no specific time limit for filing a new attorney fees request.this court has not addressed this particular issue,and the scant authority concerning such orders reveals no uniformly accepted approach.see schuurman,at hatchett,concurring noting that where no time limit for amendment is given by the district court,the initial dismissal should be appealed within thirty days azar conley,cir finding that a district court dismissal of a complaint was not final and not appealable where it set forth no time limit for amendment but detailed what a proper complaint should contain.
we need not decide whether the district court initial dismissal here was final because,even if it was final and the ten day limit of rule applied to preclude amendments to that judgment,the judgment did not preclude lec from filing a new motion for attorney fees based on different evidence.here,the district court explicitly cabined its dismissal order by denying the motion without prejudice of being resubmitted with satisfactory evidence,in addition to lec attorneys own affidavits,justifying the reasonableness of its requested rate for attorney fees.we view the district court order as being with prejudice to another request based on the same evidence,but without prejudice to a new motion based on additional evidence.in such circumstances,a single judgment can preclude further litigation of particular issues,while still permitting further litigation on other issues and the underlying claim itself.see charles alan wright arthur miller,fed.prac.pro.juris d,at ed.
to the extent that the dismissal was without prejudice lec was not barred from refiling the claim with the same court.semtek int l lockheed martin,d see also municipality of comerío,cir holding that a dismissal without prejudice does not bar refiling the claim before the same court,notwithstanding the statute of limitations wright miller,supra,at noting that a dismissal without prejudice is not a final adjudication on the merits for res judicata purposes.therefore,the district court dismissal here did not bar lec from refiling its request for attorney fees with additional evidence.
furthermore,to the extent appellants contend that lec was precluded from refiling its request under puerto rico local rule because it was not filed within days following the entry of judgment we find this argument unpersuasive.lec argues that the district court had discretion to depart from the local rules in the circumstances of this case.we agree.in general,it is for the district court to determine what departures from its rules may be overlooked.united states,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted crowley bean,cir holding that the application of a district court local rule is reviewed for abuse of discretion.while the district court does not have unbridled discretion to ignore the local rules,it enjoys a considerable latitude in applying local procedural rules and in departing from them,at.we generally will not disturb the district court departure from its local rules so long as there is sound reason for the departure and no party substantial rights have been unfairly jeopardized.id.
here,lec filed its initial fee request fifteen days after the district court granted summary judgment in its favor.the district court took over nine months to dismiss this request.eight days after this dismissal,lec filed a motion requesting an additional thirty days within which to refile its request.despite the district court express invitation to appellants to oppose lec request for an extension of time,appellants made no objection.lec then filed a new motion for attorney fees within the requested thirty days,and within days from the initial order denying its request.under these circumstances,we can not find that the district court departure from the local rule constituted an abuse of discretion.
having decided that lec second fee request was properly before the district court,we must now turn to the district court award of fees.appellants contend that even if the fee request was not,the district court should not have awarded fees under fogerty fantasy,d.
contrary to appellants argument,an explicit finding of frivolity or bad faith is not required for the award of attorney fees under.in fogerty,the supreme court interpreted the attorney fees provision of the copyright act and rejected a dual standard under which a greater burden had been placed on prevailing defendants than prevailing plaintiffs before fees could be awarded.see at.the court expressly disapproved the practice of awarding fees to prevailing defendants only upon a showing of frivolousness or bad faith.id.at.at the same time,the court rejected the british rule requiring fees as a matter of course for the winner.id.at.instead,it opted for a middle ground,under which p revailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants are to be treated alike,but attorney fees are to be awarded to prevailing parties only as a matter of the court discretion.id.
the court approved the evenhanded approach adopted by the third circuit and observed that the court discretionary decision to award fees could be guided by the list of factors that the third circuit had identified in lieb topstone industries,cir.that list included frivolousness,motivation,objective unreasonableness both in the factual and in the legal components of the case and the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence.at.quoting lieb,at see also lotus dev.borland int,cir quoting fogerty,at.
in the past,this court has applied the fogerty factors in affirming awards of attorney fees where the plaintiff copyright claim was neither frivolous nor instituted in bad faith.thus,the award of fees has been approved where the claim was objectively weak.see,invessys,at matthews freedman,cir see also fantasy,fogerty,cir.for example,in invessys,the district court rejected a copyright claim because the plaintiffs company did not buy,and therefore did not own,the copyrighted software.the district court awarded fees.in affirming the award of fees,this court stated that at first blush it might appear as if the plaintiffs had a colorable claim.at.however,after further factual development,the plaintiffs claim of ownership of the software appeared more dubious.id.this court found that the underlying copyright infringement claim was objectively quite weak.id.
so too in matthews the district court awarded fees to the prevailing party where both parties made colorable arguments regarding whether the phrase appearing on the defendant was substantially similar to the phrase on the plaintiff.at.the court found a lack of similarity and awarded fees to the alleged infringer.this court concluded that the district court could conclude that the losing party should pay even if all of the arguments it made were reasonable.id.at.
here,just as in invessys and matthews,the district court made no express finding of frivolity,nor was there a finding that the copyright litigation was itself instituted in bad faith.in justifying the award of fees,the court stated that copyrighting the documents was done in bad faith in order to leverage lec cooperation in hiring and that further use of the copyrights to bootstrap a state law contract action into federal court wasted an immeasurable amount of this court time as well as causing inappropriate and unnecessary legal expenses for lec.we understand the district court to have held that fees were justified because the plaintiffs misused the copyright to leverage its position with respect to the contract and the plaintiffs copyright claim was otherwise not sufficiently strong to warrant the federal action,the purpose of the federal action being to bring state claims within the district court jurisdiction.we need not reach the misuse ground because we agree that the district court could properly find that the copyright claim was lacking in merit because had surrendered ownership in the works at issue.
the district court concluded that the works were not copyrightable because they were associated records that were prepared for,or in con
