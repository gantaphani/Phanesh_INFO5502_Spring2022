the law partnership of leboeuf,lamb,greene macrae,leboeuf appeals the denial of its request for a direct award of a government contract and the grant of summary judgment to the department of energy.leboeuf protested the department award of a contract for outside legal services to another law firm and now contends that the district court erred in finding that its award request was moot and in granting summary judgment in view of a material issue of disputed fact as to whether the department complied with procurement regulations.we vacate the judgment and remand the case to the district court to determine whether the department adequately considered the apparent conflict of interest as required by federal and departmental regulations,and whether the department need for expert legal services on the yucca mountain project can support a direct award of the contract to leboeuf or an award of other relief.
three contracts are relevant to this appeal.all of the contracts relate to the department plans to obtain an operating license from the united states nuclear regulatory commission nrc for the yucca mountain nuclear waste repository site in nevada yucca mountain project.see nuclear waste policy act of codified as amended at.under the act,the department must issue guidelines for the recommendation of sites for a permanent repository,nominate sites for site characterization to be approved or disapproved by the president,and once a site is chosen,seek a license from the nrc to construct and operate the repository.id.
the first contract was entered into by the department in with trw environmental safety systems,trw.under the trw contract,trw was the management and operations contractor for the yucca mountain project.in that capacity,trw was to conduct studies to determine the suitability of the site as a repository,and thereby assist the office of civilian radioactive waste management ocrwm in developing an integrated radioactive waste management system for the storage and ultimate disposal of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste in a manner that protects public health and safety and the environment.see id.
the second contract,a subcontract,was entered into by trw in with the law firm of winston strawn winston.under the trw subcontract,winston was to provide expert legal services to ensure that trw performed in accordance with nrc regulations and guidelines.winston statement of work covered both consulting services and legal advice and counseling.trw request for proposals rfp stated that to be eligible,a contractor had to make a c ommitment not to engage in activities that would appear to or actually conflict with the interests of trw.
the third yucca mountain from a rfp issued by the department on may.because its office of general counsel ogc lacked the relevant expertise,the department sought expert legal counsel to provide professional legal advice and assistance to the ogc involving matters related to the licensing activities of the ocrwm for the yucca mountain project.the scope of work potentially involved review of work performed by winston for trw under the trw subcontract.the rfp required that bidders be qualified and eligible under applicable laws and regulations and to disclose any conflicts of interest.additionally,the rfp required that bidders have special nrc expertise and that attorneys chosen to work on the yucca mountain project be active members of at least one state bar.the rfp was based on a period of performance.
prior to awarding the yucca mountain contract,the department recognized the importance of avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest in hiring expert counsel.the department created a special conflict of interest provision disqualifying law firms that,within the preceding five years,had represented a party against the department in litigation relating to the standard contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel radioactive waste.in that connection,the department recognized that it was statutorily obligated to serve a broader public interest than an interested party.the head of contracting activity in the office of headquarters procurement services hca stated in his decision of july,denying the protest of a law firm as a potential bidder on the rfp,that notwithstanding the fact that utilities and the department both have an interest in having the license issued quickly,under the nuclear waste policy act,the department serves a broader interest of protecting the environment and public health.see a.in other words,the department statutory responsibilities might require action that a utility would oppose,such as,for example,a department decision imposing stricter controls that would increase the utility operating costs.the hca observed that t his difference is the source of the divergence in interests that gives rise to the various potential conflicts of interest,which can not be mitigated simply by imposing a firewall within the law firm for the protection of the department confidential information.protest decision of july,at.
only two law firms,leboeuf and winston,submitted bids.pursuant to the conflicts disclosure requirement of the department acquisition regulations dear,see,winston stated that n o actual or potential conflict of interest or unfair competitive advantage exists under the trw subcontract.based on the information provided by winston,a technical advisory committee and the contracting officer concluded that winston prior work for trw did not present an organizational conflict of interest barring its award of the contract.the department announced the award to winston,as the low bidder by over million,in september.the contract was for a term,renewable in segments for a total of ten years.
leboeuf filed an administrative appeal alleging that winston had an organizational conflict of interest oci.the department denied the appeal,stating that the yucca mountain contract was a replacement for the trw subcontract and the statement of work was substantially similar to the statement of work under the trw subcontract.subsequently,the general accounting office gao,by decision of february,denied leboeuf bid protest.gao concluded that winston did not have a conflict of interests in light of the department revised management plan for the development of the licensing application designating the ogc,and not winston,as the entity to provide concurrence review before the application was filed with the nrc.concurrence review,which was part of the department quality assurance review,involved review of the license application to assure conformance with nrc laws and regulations,which,given ogc lack of expertise,leboeuf claimed would have to be performed by winston,creating a conflict of interests.however,gao found that winston did not have a disqualifying oci because the department was ultimately responsible for review of the licensing application and the yucca mountain contract involved a continuation of work that winston had performed under the trw subcontract.
in march,leboeuf filed suit against the department in the federal court in nevada for declaratory and injunctive relief that court transferred the case to this district in january.in its complaint,leboeuf alleged that the department acted arbitrarily and capriciously and contrary to its own regulations in awarding the yucca mountain contract to winston because winston had a disqualifying conflict of interest stemming from the trw subcontract.leboeuf requested that the district court directly award it the balance of the work remaining under the yucca mountain contract,along with its bid proposal and preparation costs.
winston provided legal services to the department for two years under the yucca mountain contract,until november.at that time,winston and the department mutually agreed to cancel the contract.only a few weeks before,a november,report of the department inspector general concluded that winston had violated the oci provision of the contract by failing to disclose its lobbying and nonlobbying activities for the nuclear energy institute,a nuclear industry trade group whose members include commercial utilities that would send spent nuclear waste to the yucca mountain site.following the termination of the yucca mountain contract,the parties filed for summary judgment.
the district court denied leboeuf relief.it ruled that leboeuf request for a direct award of the yucca mountain contract was moot because the contract had been terminated in november and any new rfp for expert legal services would be for different services in view of the work done by winston.the court granted the department motion for summary judgment,concluding that it had adequately examined winston potential conflict of interests,that the nevada code of professional conduct did not fall within the federal acquisition regulations reference to applicable law and regulations,and that leboeuf had failed to show that the department acted in bad faith in awarding the contract to winston.
leboeuf position before the department,gao,and the district court was that winston was barred from being awarded the yucca mountain contract under federal and department procurement regulations,applicable state bar rules,and the terms of its earlier commitments to trw,whose interests in the approaching nrc licensing proceeding were,according to leboeuf,virtually certain to be adverse to the department interests.appellant brief at.on appeal,leboeuf renews its position,contending that the district court erred in granting summary judgment where the department merely accepted at face value winston assertion and failed to take into account any of the factors that disqualified winston.leboeuf also contends that the district court erred in ruling that leboeuf request for a direct award of the contract was moot inasmuch as the court was unable to determine on the basis of the record that the department would not employ expert counsel to complete work that winston had begun,failed to grant leboeuf a reasonable opportunity to probe and dispute the department claims that it would not use substitute expert counsel,and disregarded the material issue of fact on that issue presented by leboeuf.

the court review of the district court grant of summary judgment to the department is de novo,see tao freeh.our review of leboeuf procurement challenge pursuant to b,which incorporates the standards of,see advanced data concepts,united states,focuses first,on the contracting officer obligations under federal and departmental regulations to identify and evaluate potential conflicts of interest,and second,on the question of mootness in light of the department continuing need for expert legal services for the yucca mountain project.
under the competition in contracting act,a,bids in response to a rfp must be evaluated in accordance with the rfp and applicable procurement federal acquisition regulations far and the department acquisition regulations dear.as relevant,far a,a,requires an agency to analyze a planned procurement to identify and determine any possible organizational conflict of interests oci.the contracting officer must seek to a void,neutralize,or mitigate significant potential conflicts before awarding a contract.id.a.a contract shall be awarded to a successful offeror unless a conflict of interest is determined to exist that can not be avoided or mitigated.id.e.further,the far provides that when identifying and evaluating a potential oci,the agency should first seek the information from within the government or from other readily available sources,including the files and the knowledge of personnel within the contracting office id.a.under far a,special responsibilities are placed on the contracting officer b efore making a determination of responsibility to possess or obtain information sufficient to be satisfied that a prospective contractor currently meets the applicable standards in.when it is necessary the contracting officer shall develop,with the assistance of appropriate specialists,special standards of responsibility.id.a.
these requirements are reflected in the department procurement regulations on organizational conflicts of interest.see dear.the regulations provide that an oci exists when a contractor is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the government,or the person objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired.id.a.the dear also require the apparent successful bidder to provide a detailed statement regarding possible conflicts of interest arising as a result of any past within the past twelve months,present,or currently planned financial,contractual,organizational,or other interests relating to the performance of the statement of work.dear c.in describing the level of detail to be contained in this statement,the regulations state that as to these and any other interests enough such information must be provided to allow a meaningful evaluation of the potential effect of the interest on the performance of the statement of work.id.
the evidence of winston apparent conflict of interests appears in the language of the trw subcontract and the rfp for the yucca mountain contract.the trw subcontract bound winston to provide services exclusively to trw and not to act in a manner contrary to its interests.both the trw subcontract and the rfp included the dear oci provision,see id,and the rfp also incorporated an oci disclosure requirement,see id.the oci provision is,by its terms,designed to ensure that the contractor is not biased as a result of other contractual,organizational,financial,and other interests relating to work under the contract and to avoid any unfair competitive advantage.see id.a.the oci provision bars a contractor from participating in any capacity in department contracts,subcontracts,or proposals which stem directly from the contractor performance of work under this contract for a period of years to be set by the contracting officer after the completion of this contract.id.b i.an exception provides that n othing in this subparagraph shall preclude the contractor from competing for contracts for advisory and assistance services.id.
the department insists that there was no conflict of interests when it selected winston because the rfp contemplated a contract to the trw subcontract.the record suggests two possible grounds for this conclusion.first,under the trw contract,trw was the department prime contractor on the yucca mountain project,performing various site characterization studies to determine if yucca mountain was a suitable site for a nuclear waste repository.after trw entered into a subcontract with winston,there was considerable openness of communication between trw,winston,and t
