this appeal raises a question of first a finding of liability under rule in a private securities case require an award of damages.we hold that it does not and reject the other appellate challenges put forward by the parties.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court entered on the basis of a jury verdict finding liability,but awarding no damages.
this case grows out of derogatory statements made by employees of asensio company,asensio about chromatics color sciences international,ccsi.stockholders of ccsi brought this suit,alleging that these statements constitute material misstatements,which asensio initiated to defraud the market for its benefit,and which caused their ccsi stock to decline in value,resulting in substantial monetary losses to them.
asensio,an investment bank licensed to broker securities,focuses on identifying short sale opportunities,transactions through which investors sell a stock and then hope to buy it back at a lower price.in addition to making its own investments,asensio researches companies,makes an assessment as to their viability,and issues recommendations to investors based on its view of a company prospects.asensio maintains that it specializes in identifying companies in which fraud or hype have assertedly inflated the stock prospects or price.
in the months leading up to june,asensio amassed a significant short sell interest in ccsi,which had developed the colormate iii,a medical device to measure the bilirubin level of babies in a manner.in,the food and drug administration had granted ccsi permission to commercially market the colormate iii and the patent trademark office had issued ccsi a patent.by may,ccsi was in the final stages of contract negotiation with three major medical device companies to produce,market,and distribute the colormate iii.
however,from june to june,asensio posted on its website and attempted to disseminate as widely as possible seven reports recommending that investors sell or take a short position in ccsi.asensio suggested that ccsi stock price was inflated,on two related grounds.first,the colormate iii allegedly had little potential to become a widely used medical device.second,according to asensio,questionable private stock sales and other financial maneuverings had artificially inflated ccsi stock price.
from june to june,ccsi issued five press releases attempting to rebut the asensio reports.even so,after asensio released its reports,medical device companies ceased contract negotiations with ccsi and the price of ccsi stock dropped.on the last trading day prior to the issuance of asensio first report on june,the closing price for ccsi stock was ccsi stock did not again reach that closing price until february,eight months later.ultimately,ccsi stock rose again to a closing high of in may and ccsi succeeded in signing a distribution agreement with a medical device company in june.however,by november,ccsi stock had been and,at the time of trial,was trading at a price approaching zero.
beginning in,plaintiffs robert pearce and joseph miller purchased significant amounts of ccsi stock on margin,they borrowed money from their brokers to purchase the stock.as the price of ccsi stock declined,plaintiffs brokers issued margin calls requiring that plaintiffs either provide additional equity or sell portions of their ccsi holdings.pearce intermittently sold ccsi stock in varying amounts and at various prices from june,to october.miller similarly sold ccsi stock in varying amounts and at various prices between june,and late june.
plaintiffs filed this action on june,under section b of the securities exchange act of,b,and rule,promulgated pursuant to that statute.they allege that asensio reports contained false and misleading information,and that this information resulted in a decline in the price of ccsi stock and caused them damage when they had to sell ccsi stock at an artificially low price.plaintiffs specifically identified six statements made by asensio in two of its reports as false or misleading.these statements minimized the importance and practicality of ccsi colormate iii as a method of testing for bilirubin and assert that the market for colormate iii was extremely limited.
at trial,plaintiffs expert,perry woodside,testified first as to causation,stating his opinion that asensio misrepresentations caused the decline in the price of ccsi stock.woodside then testified to the measure of plaintiffs damages,which he calculated as the true value of ccsi stock defined as the value of the stock in the absence of the action and the reports by asensio less the amount plaintiffs received for the stock on each date on which they sold it from june,to june,woodside set the true value of ccsi stock by choosing as a starting price the average price of ccsi stock the week or month prior to june.he then charted how ccsi stock would have behaved between june,and june,absent asensio misrepresentations,by use of a benchmark mutual fund that he believed reacted to market conditions in the same way that ccsi would have but for the misrepresentations.significantly,in calculating plaintiffs damages,woodside determined that no than asensio impacted the price of ccsi stock on the dates that plaintiffs sold the stock.
asensio challenged woodside testimony on a number of grounds.in particular,asensio contended that a host of factors,including truthful information contained in its reports,ccsi public rebuttals of the reports,and scandals involving major ccsi shareholders,impacted ccsi stock price during the relevant period.although asensio did not offer expert testimony as to why ccsi stock declined at specific points,manuel asensio,the company founder,testified as to the occurrence of certain significant events on those dates.the company further relied on its reports which contained a good deal of negative information about ccsi apart from the six misstatements identified by plaintiffs,ccsi rebuttal press releases,and various news articles relating negative information about ccsi.asensio also woodside and plaintiffs about events or information other than the identified misrepresentations that assertedly impacted ccsi stock price.
at the close of evidence,the district court properly instructed the jury both as to liability and damages.the court then provided the jurors with a special interrogatory that posed two questions.first,after stating the four elements necessary to establish liability under rule,it asked if the jury unanimously found that plaintiffs had established these elements by a preponderance of the evidence.if the jurors answered no,they were instructed to go no further.if,however,they answered yes,they were directed to turn to a second inquiry and set forth the total amount plaintiffs were actually damaged as a result of the defendant alleged fraud.
during deliberations,the jury sent a written question to the trial judge asking is this a mandate to award a value greater than zero dollars given a yes response to question one after consulting with counsel,and over plaintiffs objection the district court responded the answer to that question is no.the calculation of damages is outlined in the charge on page.you can award whatever amount of damages you find each plaintiff has proved,from zero dollars up to the amount requested by each plaintiff.
the jury then returned a verdict finding asensio liable,but awarding in damages.the district court entered judgment on that verdict,awarding the plaintiffs zero damages.the court denied the parties motions except to modify its judgment so as to award costs to neither party.
the parties appeal and cross appeal on numerous grounds,the most central of which is whether,as a matter of law,the finding of liability in this private securities action requires the award of damages in some amount.
section b of the securities exchange act of protects investors against manipulation of stock prices.basic levinson,d.thus,courts have long recognized a private cause of action for violation of this provision.see ernst ernst hochfelder,d.in order to establish liability under b and rule,a private plaintiff must prove the defendant made a false statement or omission of material fact with scienter upon which plaintiff justifiably relied that proximately caused the plaintiff damages.hillson partners.adage,cir and numerous cases cited therein.
in this case,a jury acting pursuant to a proper charge neither plaintiffs nor asensio contend to the contrary found that plaintiffs had proved each of these elements,including the last,that asensio false statements had proximately caused the plaintiff s damages.id.yet that same jury awarded plaintiffs no damages,even though it had also been properly instructed as to the measure of difference between the fair value of what plaintiffs received and the fair value of what they would have received had there been no fraudulent conduct at the time of sale.affiliated ute citizens united states,d.we recognize that other damage theories may be appropriate in some situations,but plaintiffs here sought only damages.
plaintiffs argue that this result does not conform with the law that jurors could not find that asensio misrepresentations proximately caused plaintiffs damages,hillson,at,and nonetheless award plaintiffs no damages.according to plaintiffs,once the jury found asensio liable,that it proximately caused their damages,the jury had to award plaintiffs some amount of damages.brief of appellant at.thus,plaintiffs maintain that the district court erred when,in response to the jury question,it informed the jury that a finding of liability did not constitute a mandate to award a value greater than zero dollars in damages.
not surprisingly,asensio contends that the district court properly answered the jury question.the company does not maintain that plaintiffs failed to offer evidence of scienter or reliance moreover,asensio explicitly concedes that plaintiffs presented evidence that its statements caused a decline in the market price of ccsi stock,and that there was evidence before the jury to sustain its findings of both transaction causation and loss causation.brief of appellee at.but the company maintains,without further explanation,t hat the jury found asensio to have contributed to a decline in the market price for ccsi shares does not mean the plaintiffs necessarily were injured in consequence of that decline.id.at.
neither party offers much support for its position,and we have found surprisingly little law on this question.the treatises note the relative paucity of decisions dealing with damages in rule cases.thomas lee hazen,the law of securities regulation,at ed alan bloomberg lewis lowenfels,bloomberg lowenfels on securities fraud commodities fraud,at ed.they attribute the scarcity of case law to the fact that most litigation does not proceed to final judgment on the merits.hazen,supra.instead,those plaintiffs successful in establishing the elements of a private cause of action have generally settled without the need to precisely define the measure of recovery.bloomberg,supra.
the case at hand,however,does require that we grapple with this question.we now turn to that task.
in denying plaintiffs motion for a new trial on damages,the district court,of course,considered this question.the court believed that the jury findings of liability,but no damages,could be harmonized.see atlas food servs.crane vendors,cir upholding district court explanation for seemingly inconsistent verdict.in its attempt to so harmonize,the district court relied on a semantic distinction between the proximately caused injury necessary to prove liability and the damages necessary to recover a monetary award.the case law,however,forecloses such a distinction.we,along with other courts,use the terms injury and damages,as well as loss and harm,interchangeably to refer to the actual pecuniary loss that a private plaintiff must establish to prove liability in a rule case.see,rombach chang,cir injury ottmann hanger orthopedic group,cir damages in re int l.sec,cir economic harm schatz rosenberg,cir losses 
although we disagree with the district court rationale for upholding the jury verdict,we agree with the premise underlying its answer to the jury question namely,that a jury faithfully following a legally sound charge can find liability and no damages.we recognize that this conclusion initially appears at odds with the general proposition that the law imposes no liability without proof of damages.nevertheless,we believe a close review of the limited helpful case law supports the conclusion that we reach in this case.
first,these cases indicate that although courts use damages as well as injury,harm,or loss in discussing liability in cases,they employ that term to resolve a different question than the amount of recoverable damages,which is the standard damages inquiry.second,these cases demonstrate that when courts require a showing of damages proximately caused by the defendant conduct for liability,they require only that the plaintiff show that the defendant conduct was a substantial cause of its injury it is during the subsequent damages inquiry that the exact amount of damages solely caused by the defendant conduct must be calculated.
turning to the first point,when determining whether a plaintiff has demonstrated that a defendant proximately caused damages to establish rule liability,courts look to whether the plaintiff has proved the fact that the defendant caused damages,rather than the amount of recoverable damages.see,law medco research,cir dismissing claim when plaintiffs failed to rebut testimony that general market forces caused the entire decline in value because if the fraud caused no harm,the suit fails emphasis added harnett billman,cir upholding dismissal of plaintiff claim where plaintiff neither alleged,nor could he prove,any injury arising out of fraud emphasis added wolf frank,cir finding that plaintiffs could not establish actual damage sufficient to sustain a claim when they ultimately profited from the transaction in question.
indeed,courts considering claims often refer to the fact of proximately caused damage and the amount of proximately caused damage as involving separate,although related,inquiries.see,rochez,rhoades,cir finding that injury ha d plainly been shown and liability ha d been conclusively established even though plaintiff had failed to place into evidence all the necessary elements for an accurate determination of damages in re warner communications sec,aff,cir noting expert testimony would be needed to fix not only the amount,but the existence of actual damages see also private litigation securities reform act plsra,stat,codified at b suggesting a distinction between the loss and the amount for which damages can be recovered by stating that in a rule action,the plaintiff must prove the defendant actions caused the loss for which the plaintiff seeks to recover damages emphasis added.thus,courts not infrequently bifurcate the liability and damages phases of trials.see,gross weingarten,cir.
for purposes of liability in a rule case,a plaintiff proof of damages proximately caused by the defendant seems to function as a requirement designed to forestall attenuated,and difficult to prove,claims.see generally blue chip stamps manor drug stores,d holding that standing to bring a private damage action under rule is limited to the class of plaintiffs who have at least dealt in the security in an objectively demonstrable way and does not include those who sue for intangible economic injury such as loss of a noncontractual opportunity to buy or sell to protect against an inexorable broadening of the class of plaintiff who may sue in this area of the law.requiring plaintiffs to demonstrate the fact of proximately caused damage to establish liability precludes wholly speculative claims and claims by plaintiffs who ultimately profit from,or experience no economic pinch as a result of,the challenged transaction,wolf,at.
but this requirement does not seem intended to deter plaintiffs who suffer a harm,but have difficulty proving the precise amount of their recoverable damages.imposing a requirement that plaintiffs prove the amount of recoverable damages to establish liability would potentially frustrate a significant number of claims by such plaintiffs because proof of the amount of recoverable damages in a case may be difficult to establish.see generally blue chip stamps,at.noting that the damages suffered by purchasers and sellers pursuing a b cause of action may on occasion be difficult to ascertain in re warner communications.at referring to the calculation of recoverable damages as a battle of the experts,the result of which is virtually impossible to predict with any certainty.
this analysis of the proximately caused loss necessary to prove liability neither invites unwarranted and attenuated claims,nor discourages sufficiently concrete claims.rather,our conclusions mirror the balance regarding cognizable claims set forth in blue chip stamps,as well as the supreme court general directive that b must be read flexibly,not technically and restrictively and that the statute provides a cause of action for any plaintiff who suffer s an injury as a result of deceptive practices touching its sale or purchase of securities.santa fe,green,d emphasis added internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
thus,we believe rule is best read to permit,in an appropriate case,a jury to find liability but award no damages.however,such cases will be rare.most often,if a plaintiff can demonstrate that the defendant acts caused him economic loss and so establish liability,the plaintiff will also be able to establish facts and circumstances tending to show the probable amount of damages sufficient to allow the trier of fact to form a reasonable and probable estimate of recoverable damages.story parchment paterson parchment paper.quotation marks omitted.if a plaintiff proves liability and damages which are definitively attributable to the wrong,a jury award of damages will be upheld even if there is some uncertain ty as to their amount.see also davis merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir 
however,the amount of recoverable damages may not be determined by mere speculation or guess.story,at.a plaintiff must still produce evidence show ing the extent of the damages as a matter of just and reasonable inference,although the result be only approximate,and if the plaintiff fails to do so a fact finder can not award damages.see also united states life ins.mech.farmers bank,cir affirming district court finding of breach of an indenture agreement but refusal to award damages for that breach glick campagna,cir upholding finding of liability,but vacating damage award and remanding in case because district court did not have an adequate foundation for determining the stock value rochez brothers,at remanding for further determination of the amount of recoverable damages although plaintiff injury and liability had been plainly shown because a lthough the law does not command mathematical preciseness from the evidence in finding damages,sufficient facts must be introduced so that a court can arrive at an intelligent estimate without speculation or conjecture.
turning to the second point,we note that although recovering an award of damages requires a plaintiff to prove that defendant fraud actually caused the damages awarded,a,establishing loss sufficient to prove liability loss causation does not require a plaintiff to prove that the defendant fraud was the sole cause of the plaintiff loss.semerenko cendant,cir holding that plaintiff adequately pled loss causation by alleging that defendant misrepresentations directly or proximately caused,or were a substantial contributing cause of,the damages sustained by plaintiff and observing that s o long as the alleged misrepresentations were a substantial cause of the inflation in the price of a security and in its subsequent decline in value,other contributing forces will not bar recovery emphasis added caremark,coram healthcare,cir noting that plaintiff satisfactorily pleads loss causation without alleging that all of its loss can be attributed to the false statement of the defendant emphasis added.
in sum,to establish liability,a plaintiff need only prove that defendant misrepresentation was a substantial cause of the loss by showing a direct or proximate relationship between the loss and the misrepresentation.gasner bd.of supervisors,cir on the other hand,recovering damages based on the market price of a security as plaintiffs have sought require s elimination of that portion of the price decline that is the result of forces unrelated to the wrong,in re executive telecard.sec,see also hazen,supra,at,at,so as to limit recovery to actual damages on account of the act complained of.a.
thus,in a given case,a jury could properly conclude that the plaintiff proved the defendant fraud constituted a substantial cause of plaintiff loss and so find the defendant liable but the plaintiff failed to provide a method to discern by just and reasonable inference,story,at,the amount of plaintiff loss solely caused by defendant fraud,and so refuse to award the plaintiff any damages.the eleventh circuit has come to the same conclusion,albeit in dicta.see robbins koger,cir.the robbins court noted the important distinction between loss causation on the one hand and proof of damages on the other.id.at.to satisfy the loss causation element,a plaintiff need not show that a misrepresentation was the sole reason for the investment decline in value,but a plaintiff will be allowed to recover only damages actually caused by the misrepresentation.id.emphasis added.therefore,the court explained as long as the misrepresentation is one substantial cause of the investment decline in value,other contributing forces will not bar recovery under the loss causation requirement.but in determining recoverable damages,these contributing forces must be isolated and removed.id.emphasis added 
with these principles in mind,we consider the facts of this case.
after close review of the record,we believe the evidence at trial provided the jurors with a sound basis on which to reach the result they did.namely,the jurors could have reasonably found that plaintiffs offered sufficient evidence that asensio misrepresentations constituted one substantial cause of plaintiffs loss from the decline in value of ccsi stock and so found asensio liable to plaintiffs.but,the jurors could also have reasonably found that plaintiffs failed to offer evidence from which the jurors could discern the amount of recoverable damages to plaintiffs resulting solely from asensio misrepresentations.
plaintiffs expert,woodside,a professor of economics and finance,testified that in his expert opinion the asensio reports caused ccsi stock price to decline tremendously in the relevant time in a matter of just very few days,almost percent of the value of the company disappeared.woodside explained that he based this opinion on the timing of asensio statements immediately before the precipitous decline and their extremely negative and untrue assessment of ccsi sole product,colormate iii.woodside further explained that he had examined other market factors that might have borne upon the decline in the value of stock at the point in time and found none.the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting woodside testimony,see tfws,schaefer,cir,and,as asensio itself concedes,this evidence certainly provided a basis for the jury liability finding 
however,plaintiffs did not merely contend that asensio misrepresentations were a substantial cause of their damages rather,they contended that asensio misrepresentations were the sole cause of the decline in ccsi stock prices and their resulting monetary loss.but the evidence they offered in support of this contention was weak.first,although woodside so opined,his event analysis,the sole method by which he and plaintiffs sought to demonstrate the impact of factors other than the alleged fraud on the price of the stock,was markedly thin.an event analysis is often required to support an expert damages calculation and generally involves the computation of a statistical regression analysis or,at minimum,the compilation of a detailed analysis of each particular event that might have influenced the stock price.see in re imperial credit.sec,d,in re oracle sec.whatever computations woodside made,however,were apparently done in hi
