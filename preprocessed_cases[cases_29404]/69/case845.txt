argonne national laboratory,as its website proclaims,is one of the department of energy largest research centers.see http.descended from the world war ii manhattan project,it now engages in upwards of research projects,ranging from studies of the atomic nucleus to global climate change research.id.although argonne is operated by the university of chicago for the department of energy office of science,the department chicago operations office maintains general oversight over the facility.this case concerns four department of energy doe employees who worked at that office,three of whom were in the argonne group,and one of whom was a physical scientist and program manager.all four contend that doe discriminated against them on the basis of their race white and gender male,and retaliated against them when they complained.three also accused doe of age discrimination,but they have dropped that theory on appeal.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of doe.because the court correctly ruled that the plaintiffs did not raise genuine issues of fact for either their discrimination claims,for which title vii,provided the exclusive remedy,or the adverse action part of their retaliation claims,we affirm.
all four plaintiffs were essentially middle managers at doe chicago operations office,employed at the level.plaintiff bernard mlynczak was a physical scientist responsible for overseeing the construction of the advanced photon source facility at argonne.plaintiff thomas balamut worked as a general engineer,managing engineering construction at the argonne facility.plaintiff jurgis paliulionis was also a general engineer he was charged with assuring that argonne followed pertinent doe policies and regulations in the course of its projects.finally,plaintiff john kasprowicz was a program manager and physical scientist his job involved overseeing technical tests,writing descriptions,and closing out contracts.
alleged discriminatory actions 
the focal point of each plaintiff discrimination complaint was doe decision to fill three positions within the argonne group with,eva pavia hispanic,roxanne purucker white,and susan heston white.anibal taboas,a male hispanic,headed the argonne group from to,and it was he who allegedly selected the three women as a result of intentional discrimination against white males.we turn,therefore,to the circumstances of these three decisions,taking the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.
affirmative action policies 
underlying the plaintiffs complaints about all three specific hiring decisions is a general argument about doe affirmative action policy.briefly put,they claim that this policy permits unlawful reverse discrimination.as plaintiffs brief puts it,the doe affirmative action and diversity plans and accomplishment reports reflected a of reverse discrimination that was statistically driven.the summary judgment record reflects that in the late,in compliance with a directive from the equal employment opportunity commission that required all federal agencies to adopt an affirmative action plan,the chicago doe office prepared such a plan.the plan set forth the office goals for providing employment opportunities for women and minorities.about ten years later,the office created a more comprehensive document entitled workforce,which had goals similar to those in the affirmative action policy.
the focus of the affirmative action plans was on ensuring diversity in the applicant pool for positions at the agency.thus,while they stress active recruitment of women and minority candidates,they do not contain quotas,nor do they authorize management to give preference to female or minority applicants for jobs or promotions.instead,the chicago doe office is bound by the rules in the doe merit promotion policy,under which selecting officials may not make a hiring or promotion decision based on race,color,sex,national origin,age,or disability.race or sex may be considered only in the unlikely event that two candidates are so equally qualified that there is no other meaningful distinction between them.that said,the success of managers at the chicago office in achieving equal employment office eeo goals and objectives was one of twelve factors taken into account in their performance evaluations.success was not limited to hiring or promotion decisions it included a wide variety of career development measures,including recruiting at minority colleges,developing facilities,or attending a career fair directed toward women.
taboas scores on this element for the years to ranged from meeting those objectives to far exceeding them.his evaluations reveal that,during that time period,of the promotions and of new hires were awarded to women or minorities.the record does not reveal,however,any detail about what those positions were,who applied,or the qualifications of the applicants.plaintiffs point out that taboas admitted that he takes an individual race,sex,or minority status into consideration,and if he does not see adequate diversity in a job category,he will look hard for diversity in the list of qualified applicants.it is against the background of this policy that the three contested employment decisions took place.
pavia hiring 
in,a environmental position opened up within the argonne group.in preparation for filling the position,supervisor richard baker prepared a position description and forwarded it to elizabeth lyon,a personnel specialist in the office human resources department.the hr department had a choice of filling the position through a noncompetitive process,under which it would look only to current federal employees,or a competitive process,under which it would open the job to all united states citizens.taboas decided to use the latter process,because he wanted to bring in someone from the outside.lyon opted for a variant of the competitive process in which doe could obtain authority from the federal office of personnel management opm to perform the recruitment itself.although the noncompetitive process was generally used in chicago,it was not unusual to use the competitive process.
normally,once the chicago office receives opm authorization,it advertises the vacancy externally and posts it on an internal doe bulletin board.vacancy announcements ordinarily remain open for days.in fact,the particular environmental position at issue had come open some months earlier and had been offered to a white male in another doe office,but he had declined the offer.as a result,doe had to begin all over again.once lyon began working on it,she accelerated the process,leaving the announcement open for only nine days.she did so because opm had delayed in giving doe authority to fill the job,and she was anxious to find someone because she had heard rumors that there would be a hiring freeze.
the plaintiffs testified that lyon cut corners and failed to post the position internally lyon could not say whether she had done so or not,and so we assume that she did not.in any case,the plaintiffs had access to the external advertisement for the position,but they never saw it,and so none of them applied.
six people did submit applications for this position pavia and five others.rick slagle,lyon supervisor,stated that he believed that there would have been eight to applications if the position had been posted internally as well.lyon scored the applicants and prepared a selection certificate for further review.although baker normally would have been responsible for that review,he was on vacation,and so the certificate went directly to taboas,baker boss.taboas selected pavia,whom he had met earlier during a business meeting,for the job.her qualifications included a law degree,a bachelor of science degree in health physics,and almost nine years of work experience with nuclear and hazardous waste management.taboas testified that the latter experience was his primary reason for selecting her,given the fact that the environmental scientist position involved project management responsibilities with a significant emphasis on hazardous waste disposal.he also testified that pavia was the most qualified applicant,in his estimation,and that her qualifications far exceeded those required for the position.
purucker promotion 
the second allegedly discriminatory action involved a promotion to a position for a safety programs branch manager within the argonne group.that position became available in july.mlynczak applied for it and made it to the short list of candidates,but in the end taboas selected roxanne purucker,without holding interviews.he concluded that purucker had superior qualifications for the job,because she had the necessary background in industrial safety and hygiene indeed,she was a certified industrial hygienist,hazardous waste management,and management of a sophisticated contractor staff.mlynczak believes that his qualifications were equal to or better than purucker and that she was promoted solely because she is a woman.he held a bachelor of arts degree in biology and an mba,and had received a number of excellence awards for his work.
heston appointment 
finally,in october a position at the advanced photon source aps facility at the level became available.robert wunderlich,a white male who reported to taboas,appointed susan heston to that position,with taboas approval.this amounted to a lateral transfer for heston,who was already working at the level elsewhere in the office.wunderlich did not advertise the position,both because he too was concerned about the anticipated hiring freeze and because he wanted to maintain control over the selection.he had worked with heston before,and had a favorable impression of her,and he also counted as a plus the fact that she was already at the level and could easily make the lateral move.mlynczak was interested in this position,but he was forestalled from applying for it because it was never posted.he asserts without citation to the record in his brief that heston was being bumped out of a job that she was unable to perform.once again,he claims that his qualifications far exceeded heston,as he had been performing the duties called for in the job and heston had no experience in accelerator facilities such as the aps.he also asserts,again without a proper reference to the record,that when he asked why he was not selected for this promotion,he was told that the secretary of doe was not awarding any supervisory positions to white males after heston was selected,wunderlich commented to mlynczak that he had been screwed.
alleged retaliation 
in july,mlynczak filed complaints with the eeo against taboas and wunderlich,claiming that they had discriminated against him in the pavia,purucker,and heston selections.balamut,kasprowicz,and paliulionis also filed eeo complaints with respect to pavia hiring.after these complaints were lodged,all four plaintiffs claimed that individuals in the chicago office retaliated against them in various ways.for example,in august,balamut sent a letter to richard gallegos,the director of the office of civil rights and equal employment opportunity at doe western area power administration,expressing his fear that taboas would engage in violent reprisals because of the eeo complaints.during the same month,balamut participated in a conference call with a former director of security for doe,edward mccallum,who told balamut that taboas had committed various security breaches during mccallum tenure,including improper use of a firearm.
gallegos forwarded a copy of balamut letter to cherri langenfeld,the manager of the chicago office langenfeld in turn first met with the director of security,and later provided taboas with a copy of the letter that identified balamut as the author.a couple of days later,balamut sent langenfeld a letter asking that she keep the gallegos correspondence confidential and not disclose it to taboas,but this was obviously too late.
in the end,not much came of this letter aside from a petition that was circulated urging the employees to support taboas and various acts by which ostracized balamut and called him unflattering names such as cockroach.he also claims that his performance ratings have deteriorated,cooperation at the workplace has diminished,and he lost bonus opportunities until he was transferred to a different position.later,in,taboas sued balamut for defamation and other claims.a doe official told kasprowicz that taboas would drop the suit if all eeo matters were also dropped.
on the basis of this record,the district court granted summary judgment for doe.because our review of that decision is de novo,we proceed immediately to the arguments plaintiffs have made on appeal.rather than structuring the discussion,we look instead at the four alleged grounds for relief discrimination with respect to the three different promotion decisions and retaliation.
all four plaintiffs have based their claims on title vii,of the civil rights act of,which prohibits discrimination based on race,color,religion,sex,and national origin in federal employment.see.although mlynczak asserts that he is also entitled to assert a claim directly under constitutional equal protection principles based on the due process clause of the fifth amendment,see bolling sharpe,the district court held that this avenue was foreclosed by the supreme court decision in brown general services administration,d.the district court was correct brown squarely holds that provides the exclusive judicial remedy for claims of discrimination in federal employment.at.nothing in the supreme court later opinion in adarand constructors,pena,d,which does not even cite brown and which concerned the equal protection rights of private federal contractors,changed that rule.
although claims brought by federal employees are subject to slightly different procedural prerequisites,which apparently were satisfied in these cases or,as points,the government has now forfeited,the substance of the federal employee right in is the same as the more familiar rights assured to all other employees,found in a.the rights there assured apply to men as well as women,see oncale sundowner offshore,d,and to whites as well as members of various minority groups,see mcdonald santa fe trail transp,d.as we noted in gore indiana university,cir,however,conventional analysis 
is not very helpful for claims.because it is the unusual employer who discriminates against majority employees,a male plaintiff alleging gender discrimination must show something more than the fact that he is gendered rather,the plaintiff in such cases must show background circumstances that demonstrate that a particular employer has reason or inclination to discriminate invidiously against whites or men or evidence that there is something fishy about the facts at hand.
id.at internal quotations and citations omitted.
the plaintiffs recognize this burden,at least implicitly,and attempt to meet it through their reliance on the doe affirmative action policy and the incentives the agency gives to managers to enhance the diversity of the workforce.otherwise,our analysis follows the path for any discrimination claim.here,however,rather than belabor the question whether the plaintiffs are proceeding under the direct method of proving discrimination,which includes the possibility of showing discrimination by circumstantial evidence,see rudin lincoln land cmty,cir troupe may dep stores,cir,or the indirect method launched by mcdonnell douglas green,d,we have examined the record from both perspectives simultaneously.
we are unpersuaded that any of the direct meaning circumstantial evidence of discriminatory intent was enough to save the plaintiffs cases.langenfeld,for example,made a number of comments indicating that she was happy that women were being hired,that she would favor a minority candidate over a nonminority candidate,and that it was good for white men to experience a little discrimination.these comments may reflect on her part,but they fall short of showing that the chicago office discriminated against these plaintiffs.langenfeld was not one of the decisionmakers for any of the employment decisions at issue here.see,crabtree steel,cir stray remarks made by nondecisionmakers are not evidence that the decision had a discriminatory motive.although taboas was a decisionmaker and the evidence showed that
