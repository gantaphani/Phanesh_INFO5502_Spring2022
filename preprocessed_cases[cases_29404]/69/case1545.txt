markem imaje sued zipher and videojet technologies,together zipher in the united states district court for the district of new hampshire,requesting a declaratory judgment that zipher patent the patent is not infringed by markem.the district court granted summary judgment of noninfringement and zipher appeals.we conclude that the district court erred in construing a critical claim term thus the summary judgment of is vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings on the corrected claim construction.
the patented invention 
the patent,entitled tape drive and printing apparatus,describes and claims a device for transfer printing.in transfer printing,ink is carried by a ribbon that is moved into contact with the substrate to be printed,and a print head impresses upon the ribbon and causes the ink to transfer from the ribbon to the substrate.in thermal transfer printing,the print head is heated,facilitating transfer and adherence of the ink to the substrate.thermal transfer printers are used for such tasks as printing on plastic packaging and other surfaces to which ink does not readily adhere.in systems where the thermal printing is part of a mechanized and automated process,the printing step must keep pace with the production line,with minimal down time.the patent is directed to a heat transfer printing apparatus that provides increased control over the acceleration,deceleration,speed,and positional accuracy of the printing operation,while minimizing waste of unused portions of the ink ribbon.
in transfer printers in general,the ink ribbon is wound on two spools,one spool for supplying the ribbon for positioning on the substrate,and the other spool for taking up the ribbon after use.the patent explains that prior art transfer printers 
rely upon a wide range of different approaches to the problem of how to drive the ribbon spools.some rely upon stepper motors,others on dc motors to directly or indirectly drive the spools.generally the known arrangements drive only the spool onto which ribbon is taken up the spool and rely upon some form of slipping clutch arrangement on the spool from which ribbon is drawn the supply spool to provide a resistive force so as to ensure that the ribbon is maintained in tension during the printing and ribbon winding processes and to prevent ribbon overrun when the ribbon is brought to rest.
patent ll.the patent states that it will be appreciated that maintaining adequate tension is an essential requirement for proper functioning of the printer.id.ll.the patent is directed to an improvement in controlling the movement and tension of the ribbon.
figure of the patent shows the two ribbon spools and,with ribbon extending between them and passing under the print head at 
the patent specification explains the problems with the slipping clutch that has been used to provide ribbon tension in prior art printers.a slipping clutch provides a constant resistive torque to the supply spool,and the constant torque causes the tension in the ribbon to vary as the supply spool outer diameter changes with the draw of ribbon.the patent states that such dynamically changing ribbon tension requires tight tolerances in clutch force,which is difficult to maintain because wear in the clutch tends to change the resistive force of the clutch.too much clutch force can break the ribbon or require more power to drive the ribbon,and too little clutch force can cause the supply spool to overrun.the patent states given these constraints,typical printer designs have compromised performance by way of limiting the rate of acceleration,the rate of deceleration,and the maximum speed capability of the ribbon transport system.overall printer performance has as a result been compromised.id.
examples of conventional clutch or drive mechanisms are discussed in the patent,including mechanisms in which,instead of a slipping clutch,a motor connected to the supply spool supplies a resistive force to provide ribbon tension.in another prior apparatus,a motor coupled to the supply spool act s as a feedback transducer to enable appropriate control of the motor driving the spool to take account of changing spool diameters while maintaining a constant ribbon speed.id.ll.the patent distinguishes this prior apparatus from what the patent calls the mechanism of the apparatus,explaining that 
although this prior art arrangement does avoid the need for example of a capstan drive interposed between the two spools so as to achieve reliable ribbon delivery speeds,only one of the motors is driven to deliver torque to assist ribbon transport.there is no suggestion that the apparatus can operate in mode,that is the motor driving the spool operating to pull the ribbon and the motor driving the supply spool operating to push the associated spool in a direction which assists tape transport.
in accordance with the mode of the patent,both the spool and the supply spool are driven to particular angular positions by stepper motors that receive commands from a microcontroller.the takeup spool rotates and takes up a given length of ribbon per rotation,while the supply spool is rotated to feed out the same length of ribbon,independent of the constantly changing spool diameter.such an arrangement is not provided in the prior devices,and is described as solving various problems encountered with prior devices.
as described in the patent,stepper motors rotate by selectively energizing electromagnets around the outside of the motor,referred to as the stator,to interact with permanent magnets or electromagnets on the shaft or rotor of the motor.id.ll.unlike dc direct current motors,which are analog devices that simply rotate when power is supplied,stepper motors have discrete angular positions or steps and can be forced or driven to stay in particular step positions.zipher expert witness,professor kuc,explained that an advantage of a stepper motor is that when it still,it got a holding torque to keep the ribbon in place.hearing tr.
the holding torque results from the electromagnetic attraction between poles of the rotor and poles of the stator in an energized stepper motor at rest.when an external torque resulting from tension in the print ribbon is applied to the spools,these electromagnetic forces create an opposing torque to keep the motor in its current angular position,thereby maintaining tension in the print ribbon.if the motor maximum holding torque is exceeded by the external torque,the motor shaft will rotate thus holding torque also specifies the minimum amount of external torque needed to rotate the shaft of a stepper motor commanded to hold steady in its current position.markem expert witness,peter landers,agreed with zipher expert that when power is applied to a stepper motor it is held in position so that even when the spool of the printer is not rotating it will hold the ribbon tension to the level it was set before.hearing tr.
the patent describes optically monitoring the radii of the spools and using the data to calculate the step rate and the number of steps required by each motor to drive the spools in an appropriate manner so as to feed the ribbon a predetermined distance.ll.the patent explains that t ension in the ribbon between the two spools must however be closely controlled to avoid the tension becoming too high resulting in over tightening of the ribbon on the spools or even ribbon breakage or the tension becoming too low resulting in loss of positional control as a result of the ribbon becoming slack.id.ll.the patent describes its method of estimating ribbon tension t,and explains how tension is maintained within predetermined limits 
if the derived value of t is too high above a predetermined limit,then a small step adjustment can be made to either or both of the motors to add a short section of ribbon to the length of ribbon between the spools.if the derived value of t is too low below a different predetermined limit,then a short section of ribbon can be removed from the length of ribbon between the spools m athematical processing results in a correction amount of ribbon that needs to be added to or removed from the ribbon path between the spools during the next ribbon feed.this addition or removal of ribbon maintains ribbon tension within acceptable limits.
id.ll.claim,the broadest claim of the patent,is directed to a tape drive that corrects tension divergences from the predetermined limit in this manner 
a tape drive comprising 
two motors,at least one of which is a stepper motor 
two tape spool supports on which spools of tape are mounted,each spool being driveable by a respective one of said motors 
a controller adapted to control energization of said two motors such that tape is transported in at least one direction between spools of tape mounted on the spool supports 
wherein the controller energizes both said motors to drive the spools in a tape transport direction,and 
said controller calculates a length of tape to be added to or subtracted from tape extending between said spools in order to maintain tension in said tape between predetermined limit values and controls said motors to drive the spools to add or subtract the calculated length of tape to or from the tape extending between said spools.
following a claim construction hearing,the district court construed driveable and drive to mean rotateable and rotate,as proposed by markem,rejecting zipher broader construction.markem,wl,at.the district court explained in its reconsideration opinion that the use of the plural word spools in the claim clause to drive the spools to add or subtract the calculated length of tape means that both spools must rotate.markem,wl,at.the court further explained that both spools must rotate to add or subtract a single calculated length of tape.markem imaje,wl,at.
the operation of markem accused devices was not disputed,as the district court explained 
although markem tape drives rotate both spools during the tape tension adjustment process,only a single spool is rotated to achieve each adjustment.if tape tension is too low,the spool is rotated to decrease the length of tape between the spools and if tape tension is too high,the supply spool is rotated to increase the length of tape between the spools.
id.based on the district court ruling that the term drive in the claims requires that both spools are rotated together to adjust the tape,the court granted summary judgment of.zipher appeals,stating that the judgment was based on an erroneous claim construction.
discussion 
claim construction receives plenary review on appeal.cybor fas,en banc.the grant of summary judgment also receives plenary review.
zipher argues that the district court erred in limiting the claim phrase drive the spools to mean rotate the spools.zipher argues that drive in this phrase has the inclusive meaning of not only rotate but also hold steady in a commanded position.the district court acknowledged that the ordinary meaning of drive can be broad enough to encompass not only the rotation of the spools but also application of a holding torque that prevents the spool from rotating.markem,wl,at.the district court observed that m ost of the references to driving the spools in the specification could accommodate either proposed construction that is,drive could mean applying only rotational torque,or it could also include application of a holding torque.id.at.however,the court found that other usages in the specification support limiting drive to mean only the narrower rotate and concluded that when the specification uses drive to refer to the spools,it supports markem narrower construction of rotating the spools rather than merely controlling them.id.at.
the district court reasoned that giving drive a meaning broader than rotation in the final clause of the claim the tension control clause would be contradictory to the meaning of drive in the tape transport clause,which states that the controller energizes both said motors to drive the spools in a tape transport direction.markem states that zipher conceded that drive the spools in a tape transport direction means that both spools are rotated in the tape transport direction.markem stresses that claim terms are normally used consistently throughout the patent,phillips awh,en banc,and that a claim term should be construed consistently with its appearance in other places in the same claim or in other claims of the same patent.id.quoting rexnord laitram.thus,according to markem,drive requires that the spool rotate,for example in the claim clause controls said motors to drive the spools to add or subtract the calculated length of tape.zipher argues that this construction would exclude the holding torque function that is necessary to accomplish the tension correction described in the specification,see patent ll stating that if tension is too high a small step adjustment can be made to either or both of the motors to add a short section of ribbon.
the district court determined that because the claim clause controls said motors to drive the spools already used the word control,the patentee could not have intended control and drive to mean the same thing.the court declined to view the claim clause each spool being driveable by a respective one of said motors to include driving to control tape movement or torque.the district court pointed to a passage in the specification which states that prior art devices drive only the spool onto which ribbon is taken up,patent ll,suggesting that a supply spool controlled by a slipping clutch is not driven.the district court concluded that drive can not mean apply torque or else the specification would not have stated that only the supply spool is driven.see markem,wl,at.thus the court concluded that the patentee intended a narrow interpretation of drive in the claim,excluding the role of applying torque to a spool to hold it in place.
zipher argues that the term drive has a meaning similar to that of control,and is not limited to rotation motion.we agree that drive need not be narrowly construed merely because a broader construction would make it similar to the word control that is also used in the claim.nothing in the specification or the overall invention as presented in the claim and as argued to the patent examiner requires the narrow construction.
the district court also cited a passage where the specification describes a circumstance in which the takeup motor is energized to rotate and the supply motor is.id.the patent states that 
if motor is pulling,the drive circuit for that motor is enabled and therefore the rotation angle for the spool being driven is known.the drive circuit for the motor being pulled is disabled line low.thus motor acts as a generator and a is generated across each of the motor windings to.
patent ll.the court concluded that the fact that only the spool is described as being driven suggests that driving a spool means actively rotating it,not passively or indirectly controlling its motion.markem,wl at.however,the cited passage in the specification does not limit driving to rotation,or negate the substance of the invention,which requires that separate motors control the movement of the spools as appropriate to provide torque and tension.all that the cited passage suggests is that a deenergized motor that does not provide drag is not driving a spool.the specification does not suggest that an energized motor actively applying torque to either rotate a spool or hold it steady does not drive the spool.
zipher points out that the motor functions in the specification include rotating,holding steady,stopping,accelerating,decelerating,and all the other drive functions the motors perform,zipher br.the term drive is used throughout the specification in connection with the motor control of the spools.it is not inconsistent for drive the spools in a tape transport direction to mean apply torque to cause rotation,and for drive the spools to mean apply torque to the spools.the district court acknowledged that drive can include the application of torque,and the specification uses drive to encompass both rotation and torque applied to the spools.the specification does not support the district court conclusion that to drive the spools means only to provide rotational torque.
both parties argue that the prosecution history favors their po
