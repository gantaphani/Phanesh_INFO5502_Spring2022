in a mass tort action,class counsel stipulated to the certification of a mandatory,class with respect to punitive damages.to settle the action,class counsel agreed to dismiss the punitive damages class claims with prejudice.despite objections from some class members,the trial court dismissed the punitive damages claims and approved the settlement.two of these objectors now contend class counsel committed legal malpractice and seek to recover the punitive damages they would have recovered but for counsel negligence.we now consider whether plaintiffs in a legal malpractice action may recover as compensatory damages the punitive damages they allegedly lost due to the negligence of their attorneys in the underlying litigation lost punitive damages.we conclude they may not.
a.the underlying class action 
in,a processing tower at a refinery in rodeo,california,released hydrogen sulfide and a toxic chemical called catacarb into the atmosphere.the release of these substances affected thousands of residents living near the refinery.
soon thereafter,respondent lieff,cabraser,heimann bernstein,llp lieff cabraser,filed a class action lawsuit against union oil company of california unocal,the owner of the refinery.the complaint sought,among other things,punitive damages.other law firms also filed individual and class action lawsuits against casper,meadows schwartz casper meadows,which had entered into contingent fee contracts with and filed suit on behalf of appellants brent ferguson and florencia prieto collectively appellants and other individuals.
pursuant to a pretrial order,the trial court consolidated these actions against unocal and designated them as complex litigation.the court gave primary responsibility for managing the consolidated actions to a steering committee of plaintiffs included lieff cabraser and casper meadows.the court designated lieff cabraser as class counsel and casper meadows as direct action counsel.
lieff cabraser then filed a first amended model complaint identifying four potential classes personal injury,property damage,medical monitoring,and punitive damages unocal class action.several months later,lieff cabraser,its class counsel,and unocal entered into a stipulation and order approved by the trial court.under the stipulation and order,the class action plaintiffs agreed to withdraw the allegations of the personal injury and property damage classes.the parties also stipulated to the certification of a mandatory,punitive damages class and agreed to schedule the issue of certification of the medical monitoring class for briefing and decision.finally,the stipulation and order gave individuals with claims for personal injury or property damage days to file their claims and gave plaintiffs the right to seek certification of the personal injury and property damage classes if unocal moved to decertify or substantially modify the punitive damages class.
following extensive discovery,lieff cabraser engaged in settlement negotiations with unocal under the aegis of retired judge daniel weinstein,the settlement master.after extensive negotiations and discussion,the parties tentatively agreed to an million global settlement of the consolidated class and individual actions.the settlement required the dismissal of the punitive damages class claims with prejudice.
the parties then stipulated to an order referring all issues concerning the good faith and scope of the settlement and the allocation of settlement proceeds to judge weinstein.pursuant to this order,judge weinstein reported that the settlement negotiations were conducted at arm length by highly qualified counsel who were thoroughly knowledgeable about the evidence and the law.he further concluded that the million settlement was a fair,reasonable,and just settlement for all of the settling parties.observing that the settlement could not have been achieved without class counsel agreement to dismiss with prejudice the punitive damages allegations of the punitive damages class and finding the handful of objections to the proposed dismissal to be unpersuasive,judge weinstein recommended that the court grant class counsel motion to dismiss the punitive damages class claims with prejudice.
after providing notice of the proposed dismissal of the punitive damages class claims,lieff cabraser filed the motion to dismiss.the motion included authorizations from the various attorneys representing the individual casper dismiss their clients claims in exchange for participation in the million global settlement.
over individual members of the punitive damages class received notice of the motion eight,including appellants,filed objections.appellants focused on the purported inadequacy and unfairness of the settlement and asked the court to allocate the million settlement solely to the punitive damages claims.ferguson himself attended the hearing on the motion and personally voiced his objections to the court.appellants proceeded in propria persona because casper meadows refused to represent them in opposing the motion and settlement and because they could not find another attorney to assist them.
at the hearing,the trial court approved the settlement and dismissed the punitive damages class claims with prejudice.in doing so,the court stated i satisfied that those concerns that you the objectors have have been fully considered by the class counsel that are proposing this settlement.and i satisfied that this appears to be a fair and reasonable settlement for all parties involved my understanding of the settlement is that the million settlement does encompass all punitive damages claims that have been filed,and i hearing from everyone that i have a great deal of confidence in that this is a settlement that should be approved and that the dismissal of the punitive claims would be appropriate.
in its written order dismissing the punitive damages class claims,the court concluded that the public interest in punishing unocal for its conduct at its rodeo refinery,and in deterring unocal from future such conduct has been achieved.the court also issued an order finding that the settlement is fair,reasonable and made in good faith,as that term is used in code of civil procedure section.
appellants did not appeal the dismissal of the punitive damages claims.instead,represented by casper meadows,they participated in the claims process created by the settlement.ferguson received an award of and prieto received an award of from the million settlement.neither ferguson nor prieto appealed or otherwise challenged these awards.
b.the legal malpractice action 
a few weeks after receiving the settlement awards,appellants filed the instant action against,among others,lieff cabraser and the individual attorneys at lieff cabraser involved in the settlement of the unocal class william bernstein,donald arbitblit,and jonathan selbin collectively respondents.after initial demurrer rulings by the trial court appellants filed a third amended complaint.the complaint stated causes of action,including negligence,legal malpractice,breach of fiduciary duty,fiduciary fraud,intentional fraud,breach of contract,constructive fraud,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,conspiracy to commit fraud,and unjust enrichment.the gist of the complaint was that the settlement and related notices were inadequate and that respondents breached their fiduciary duty and committed malpractice by certifying the punitive damages class,negotiating and recommending the settlement,and refusing to support appellants objections to the settlement.as compensatory damages,appellants alleged they lost a potential award of punitive damages against unocal and received an award of compensatory damages far below the amount they would have received but for respondents tortious conduct.
the trial court initially sustained respondents demurrers to the causes of action.the court later granted summary judgment for respondents on appellants remaining claims because the undisputed evidence established that these claims were barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel.the court also found no due process violation because appellants received adequate notice of the proceedings in the unocal class action.finally,the court barred appellants unjust enrichment claim because respondents received no benefit at appellants expense.pursuant to these findings,the court entered judgment in favor of respondents.
the court of appeal affirmed.the court found that the trial court properly sustained the demurrers to appellants causes of action because knowledge of all relevant events and notices by casper meadows was imputed to them.the court then upheld the summary judgment because appellants could recover no damages from respondents as a matter of law.first,the court held that appellants,by participating in the claims process,waived their claims of inadequate compensatory damages.second,the court held that as a matter of law,lost punitive damages are not recoverable as compensatory damages for legal malpractice.because the court found no cognizable damages,it did not address any other issues.
we granted review solely to determine whether lost punitive damages are recoverable in a legal malpractice action and conclude they are not.
ii.discussion 
citing merenda superior court th,d,appellants contend they merely seek the value of the recovery they lost through respondents negligence,the punitive damages they should have recovered from unocal.because these lost punitive damages are compensatory,not punitive,in the context of a legal malpractice action ibid,they contend they may recover these damages even though respondents did not act oppressively,fraudulently,or maliciously see,subd.a.respondents counter that appellants may not recover lost punitive damages as compensatory damages for attorney negligence under the reasoning of piscitelli friedenberg th,d.according to respondents,allowing recovery of lost punitive damages contravenes the purpose of punitive damages awards and can not be justified as a matter of policy.id.at,d.we agree with respondents,and find that legal malpractice plaintiffs may not recover lost punitive damages as compensatory damages.
detriment is a loss or harm suffered in person or property.for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract,the measure of damages is the amount which will compensate for all the detriment proximately caused thereby,whether it could have been anticipated or not,italics added.thus,an attorney liability,as in other negligence cases,is for all damages directly and proximately caused by his negligence.smith lewis cal d,overruled on another point in in re marriage of brown cal d,fn,quoting pete henderson d.
proximate cause involves two elements.ppg industries,transamerica ins.cal th,d,ppg.one is cause in fact.an act is a cause in fact if it is a necessary antecedent of an event.ibid.whether defendant negligence was a cause in fact of plaintiff damage is a factual question for the jury to resolve.smith lewis,supra,cal d at,fn.
by contrast,the second element focuses on public policy considerations.because the purported causes of an event may be traced back to the dawn of humanity,the law has imposed additional limitations on liability other than simple causality.ppg,supra,cal th at,d.these additional limitations are related not only to the degree of connection between the conduct and the injury,but also with public policy.id.at,d.thus,proximate cause is ordinarily concerned,not with the fact of causation,but with the various considerations of policy that limit an actor responsibility for the consequences of his conduct,quoting mosley arden farms cal d,conc.opn.of traynor.
applying this understanding of proximate causation in the punitive damages context,we recently refused to hold a negligent insurer liable for punitive damages assessed against its insured.in ppg,an insurer refused to settle an action against its insured for an amount within the insured policy limits.as a result,the insured suffered a judgment for million in punitive damages.ppg,supra,cal th at,d.the insured sued its insurer for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and sought to recover as compensatory damages the million it had been ordered to pay as punitive damages id.at,d.the trial court granted summary judgment for the insurer,and the court of appeal affirmed.ibid.
we agreed.although the insurer negligence was the cause in fact of the punitive damages award ppg,supra,cal th at,d,we nonetheless concluded that the insurer negligence did not proximately cause the award id.at,d.in reaching this conclusion,we held that three policy considerations strongly militate against allowing the insured,the morally culpable wrongdoer in the third party lawsuit,to shift to its insurance company the obligation to pay punitive damages resulting from the insured egregious misconduct in that lawsuit,fn.omitted.first,allowing the insured to shift to its insurer its responsibility to pay the punitive damages in the third party action would violate the public policy against reducing or offsetting liability for intentional wrongdoing by the negligence of another.id.at,d.second,allowing the insurer to assume liability for punitive damages premised on the egregious conduct of its insured would defeat the public policies underlying these damages.ibid.finally,requiring the insurer to pay punitive damages incurred by its insured would violate the public policy against indemnification for punitive damages.id.at,d,fn.omitted.
applying a similar analysis,we conclude that public policy considerations strongly militate against allowing a plaintiff to recover lost punitive damages as compensatory damages in a legal malpractice action.first,allowing recovery of lost punitive damages would defeat the very purpose behind such damages.punitive damages by definition are not intended to compensate the injured party,but rather to punish the tortfeasor whose wrongful action was intentional or malicious,and to deter him and others from similar extreme conduct.newport fact concerts,d newport see also,subd.a punitive damages are damages for the sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant.that purpose is a purely public one.adams murakami cal d.the essential question therefore in every case must be whether the amount of punitive damages awarded substantially serves the societal interest.ibid.
making a negligent attorney liable for lost punitive damages would not serve a societal interest,because the attorney did not commit and had no control over the intentional misconduct justifying the punitive damages award.imposing liability for lost punitive damages on negligent attorneys would therefore neither punish the culpable tortfeasor see newport,supra,at.under ordinary principles of retribution,it is the wrongdoer himself who is made to suffer for his unlawful conduct,nor deter that tortfeasor and others from committing similar wrongful acts in the future see cappetta lippman.indeed,allowing appellants to recover lost punitive damages would not effectuate the public purpose behind such damages in this case because,as the trial court in the unocal class action found,the public interest in punishing unocal and in deterring unocal from future such conduct has been achieved by the million settlement.see ante,d at,at.
allowing recovery of lost punitive damages as compensatory damages in legal malpractice actions would also violate public policy,because the amount of the award bears no relation to the gravity of the attorney misconduct or his or her wealth.a plaintiff seeking to recover lost punitive damages from his negligent attorney is deliberately seeking an award disproportionate or at least unrelated to the attorney ability to pay.that result is contrary to the public purpose of punitive damages.adams murakami,supra,cal d at.
contrary to appellants assertion,awarding lost punitive damages would not indirectly further the deterrent purpose of punitive damages by encouraging attorneys to exercise reasonable care in investigating or defending punitive damages claims.jacobsen oliver d.the policy considerations in a state where,as in california,punitive damages are awarded for punishment and deterrence,would seem to require that the damages rest ultimately as well as nominally on the party actually responsible for the wrong.peterson superior court cal d,fn,italics added.by ultimately and nominally imposing damages on an attorney,purporting to punish and deter a wrongdoer who was not responsible for the wrong,an award of lost punitive damages necessarily frustrates the purpose of such damages.
even assuming an award of lost punitive damages may have some indirect deterrent effect,it still conflicts with the public purpose behind punitive damages.the ultimately proper level of punitive damages is an amount not so low that the defendant can absorb it with little or no discomfort citation,nor so high that it destroys,annihilates,or cripples the defendant.rufo simpson th,d.thus,an award of lost punitive damages can only further the goal of deterrence if it deters without being excessive.adams murakami,supra,cal d at.because an award of lost punitive damages bears no relation to the gravity of the attorney misconduct or his or her wealth,it can not further the deterrent purpose behind such damages.indeed,where,as here,the intentional wrongdoer is a wealthy corporation whose alleged misconduct was especially reprehensible,any award of lost punitive damages is likely to be disproportionate to the attorney ability to pay id.at,and may financially destroy the attorney.such a result would undoubtedly contravene the purpose of punitive damages,which is to deter,not destroy.ibid.
second,permitting recovery of lost punitive damages would violate the public policy against speculative damages.d amages may not be based upon sheer speculation or surmise,and the mere possibility or even probability that damage will result from wrongful conduct does not render it actionable.in re easterbrook d,disapproved on other grounds by people romero cal th,fn,d.damage to be subject to a proper award must be such as follows the act complained of as a legal certainty agnew parks d.
because an award of punitive damages constitutes a moral determination,lost punitive damages are too speculative to support a cause of action for attorney negligence.in determining compensatory damages in a legal malpractice action,the jury task is to determine what a reasonable judge or fact finder would have done in the underlying action absent attorney negligence.mattco forge,arthur young th,d,quoting brust newton.the standard is an objective one.mattco forge,at,d.lost punitive damages,however,are not amenable to an objective determination.unlike the measure of actual damages suffered,which presents a question of historical or predictive fact,citation,the level of punitive damages is not really a fact tried by the jury.cooper industries,leatherman tool group,d,quoting gasperini center for humanities,d dis.opn.of scalia.instead,a jury imposition of punitive damages is an expression of its moral condemnation.cooper industries,at.indeed,a plaintiff is not entitled,as of right to an award of punitive damages brewer second baptist church cal d,brewer,even if the jury finds the defendant guilty of oppression,fraud,or malice,subd.a.thus,to award lost punitive damages,the trier of fact must determine what moral judgment would have been made by a reasonable jury.because moral judgments are inherently subjective,a jury can not objectively determine whether punitive damages should have been awarded or the proper amount of those damages with any legal certainty.see rest d law governing lawyers,com.h,an award of lost punitive damages calls for a speculative reconstruction of a hypothetical jury reaction.lost punitive damages are therefore too speculative to support a cause of action for legal malpractice.see in re easterbrook,supra,d at.agnew parks,supra,d at.
third,the complex standard of proof applicable to claims for lost punitive damages militates against the recovery of such damages.because the standards of proof governing compensatory and punitive damages are different compare,except as otherwise provided by law,the burden of proof requires proof by a preponderance of the evidence with,subd.a plaintiff may recover punitive damages only where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression,fraud,or malice italics added,the standard of proof for lost punitive damages will be,in essence,a standard within a standard.to recover lost punitive damages,a plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that but for attorney negligence the jury would have found clear and convincing evidence of oppression,fraud or malice.in light of this complex standard,t he mental gymnastics required to reach an intelligent verdict would be difficult to comprehend much less execute.wiley county of san diego cal th,d,wiley.this pragmatic difficulty provides additional support for barring recovery of lost punitive damages in a legal malpractice action.see ibid.
fourth,allowing recovery of lost punitive damages in this case would hinder the ability of trial courts to manage and resolve mass tort actions by discouraging the use of mandatory,punitive damages classes.c ourts have encouraged the use of mandatory class actions to handle punitive damages claims in mass tort cases.mandatory class actions avoid the unfairness that results when a few who win the race to the a defendant early in the litigation process.they also avoid the possible unfairness of punishing a defendant over and over again for the same tortious conduct.in re exxon valdez cir.making class counsel liable for lost punitive damages would,however,discourage counsel from using these mandatory classes because counsel would otherwise face the specter of multiple legal malpractice lawsuits from disgruntled class members.
indeed,allowing lost punitive damages may adversely impact the overall ability of courts to manage their caseloads by making settlement more difficult in cases involving punitive damages claims.because dissatisfied clients may seek such damages based solely on an allegation of negligent undervaluation of the punitive damages claims,the settlement of such claims exposes plaintiffs attorneys to potentially devastating liability.faced with this risk,plaintiffs attorneys will likely be more hesitant to settle and more intransigent in their settlement demands.
finally,allowing recovery of lost punitive damages as compensatory damages in a legal malpractice action may exact a significant social cost.exposing attorneys to such liability would likely increase the cost of malpractice insurance,cause insurers to exclude coverage for these damages,or further discourage insurers from providing professional liability insurance in california.see ahern,what a firm to do,recorder,this past year,california saw the departure of nine insurance companies that provide professional liability insurance to attorneys.the resulting financial burden on attorneys would probably make it more difficult for consumers to obtain legal services or obtain recovery for legal malpractice.at a minimum,the specter of lost punitive damages would encourage the practice of defensive law.wiley,supra,cal th at,d.i n our already overburdened system it behooves no one to encourage the additional expenditure of resources merely to build a record against a potential malpractice claim.id.at,d,quoting bailey tucker.even though respondents and amici curiae provide no concrete evidence that this parade of horribles will occur,we deem it unwise to inflict the risk a bsent a compelling reason to do so.newport,supra,at.
and appellants offer no compelling reason to take this risk.the general rule that the measure of damages in a legal malpractice action is the value of the claim lost does not preclude us from barring recovery of lost punitive damages for public policy reasons.smith lewis,supra,cal d at.a plaintiff in a legal malpractice action is entitled only to be made whole.ibid.but i t should be presumed a plaintiff has been made whole for his injuries by compensatory damages state farm mutual automobile ins.campbell,d,see also adams murakami,supra,cal d at,whatever his or her injury,a plaintiff will be made whole by the award of compensatory damages.thus,b y definition punitive damages are not intended to make the plaintiff whole by comp
