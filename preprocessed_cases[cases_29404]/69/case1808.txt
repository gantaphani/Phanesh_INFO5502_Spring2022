the ratcliff architects ratcliff provided design services under contract with the county of san mateo the county for a hospital renovation and expansion project.ratcliff subcontracted with ted jacob engineering group,tjeg for mechanical and electrical engineering services.the scope of the project increased over time.tjeg submitted claims for additional fees based on the increased basic scope of work and for additional services it alleged it was directed to perform by ratcliff.ratcliff paid some,but not all,of tjeg claims.tjeg sued ratcliff and prevailed in a jury trial.the trial court awarded prejudgment interest on tjeg recovery and awarded tjeg its attorney fees and costs.ratcliff argues the judgment must be reversed because the instructions to the jury were contradictory and confusing,and because tjeg claims were not sufficiently certain to support an award of prejudgment interest.we affirm.
in the published portion of this opinion we hold that,in the absence of a negotiated agreement upon price,and assuming no contrary contractual provision applies,a subcontractor may still pursue a claim seeking a judicial determination of additional fees when it performs work demanded of it by the general contractor constituting a material change in the scope of work defined under the contract.if good faith negotiation between the parties fails to result in agreement on price,the subcontractor is not required to elect between abandoning the job and forfeiting its right of recovery if it elects to perform the required work.
the project 
in about,the county commissioned kmd to study a potential renovation and expansion of the san mateo county general hospital the project.the kmd study,which was completed in may,included a design with an estimated construction cost of without cost escalation or a percent contingency concept.the kmd study concluded that the central plant of the hospital would have to be replaced.
the county then directly commissioned tjeg to further study the central plant issue.tjeg study the central plant study,completed in july,concluded that the cost of the central plant replacement would be much higher than had been originally estimated by kmd.
the county began hiring a design team for the project.consistent with custom and practice in the industry,the county intended to contract directly with an architectural firm,which would in turn contract with consultants to assist in the design of the project.the architectural firm and its consultants collectively would comprise the design team.ratcliff asked tjeg for a proposal for the mechanical including hvac and plumbing and electrical design work on the project.
notwithstanding the conclusion of tjeg central plant study,ratcliff told tjeg to base its fee proposal on concept from the kmd study and tjeg did so.at an august,meeting with ratcliff and the county,tjeg principal ted jacob asked how tjeg fees would be adjusted if the project scope exceeded what was anticipated in the kmd study.he received strict instructions to base his fee on the kmd scheme on the hospital and the central plant,and was told that at the end of the design development they would make the adjustment based on estimated construction costs at that time.jacob memorialized this understanding as to the scope of work included in tjeg proposal in an august,letter to ratcliff.
based on concept,jacob proposed a fee of for mechanical and electrical design work.its fee proposal stated the following items are not outlined in the kmd master plan but must be performed as recommended in the central plant study and per our meeting with fred countryman.it is agreed that the additional fees will be allocated to us after design development.a list of additional tasks and fees followed.shortly thereafter,ratcliff directed tjeg to commence work on the project.
stephanie bartos,ratcliff manager on the project until january,testified that she believed there was a discrepancy between the work defined in the kmd study and what actually had to be done to complete the work according to code and good design practice.ellipsis in original.she testified that the county representative on the project,fred countryman,had insisted that ratcliff base its fee on concept and promised that the fee would change if the scope of work changed.
on august,ratcliff and the county executed an agreement for architectural services contract.the contract defined the project scope to be as described in the facility program and conceptual design report,volumes and,prepared by,dated may,and the central plant feasibility study prepared by ted jacob engineering group,dated july,with any subsequent revisions agreed upon by owner and architect.italics added.a fixed fee of covered ratcliff performance of basic services on the project,which included programming verification,schematic design,design development,preparation of construction documents,and construction contract administration.paragraph.from this fee,ratcliff was responsible for payment of its subcontracting consultants.paragraph.
paragraph of the contract provided,substantial changes in the project scope shall provide sufficient basis for renegotiation of ratcliff fee.ratcliff was also entitled to additional compensation if it performed services that were not encompassed in basic services.extra services paragraph.paragraph of the contract provided that extra services shall not be rendered by ratcliff under this agreement unless they are first authorized in writing by the county.the payment to ratcliff for extra services shall be at the hourly rates set forth in an exhibit to the contract.
although ratcliff directed tjeg to start work on the project in august,ratcliff and tjeg did not sign a written contract until august.in february,ratcliff sent tjeg a draft contract,which incorporated by reference the contract and required tjeg to perform services in accordance with the that contract.tjeg had by that time received an executed copy of the contract.tjeg fee for basic services in the draft contract was set at.
by february,the defined scope of the project had already changed,as described in greater detail post.tjeg refused to sign the february contract as drafted without clarification that its fee was based on the kmd study scope of work alone.a revised version of the draft contract prepared in march changed the fee to,but it also was not signed.in may,ratcliff published a design development report that reflected the changed scope of the project and included new construction cost estimates.
in a july,letter to ratcliff,tjeg wrote that its fee was based on the kmd study and did not reflect any increases to the building areas and estimated construction costs which have occurred during the design development process.tjeg requested in additional fees based on this increased scope of work.in an august,letter to ratcliff,tjeg again requested the fee increase for services which are required due to building area and construction cost increases which have occurred to date.the august,letter stated,the fees listed in the agreement part iii,compensation dated march,were based upon construction costs extracted from the kmd may report.these fees do not reflect any increases to the building areas and estimated construction costs which have occurred during the design development.
on august,tjeg principal ted jacob signed the march revised contract,but with a modification.at part iii,compensation which provided for a fee of for basic services,he added the notation,revised as noted in ted jacob eng.letter dated august,and he attached to the contract the referenced letter and its enclosures which included tjeg and,letters.the contract also provided in part iv for payment for additional services at specified hourly billing rates,with prior written authorization from ratcliff.ratcliff signed this modified version of the contract contract.
thus,the seeds of this litigation were sown when ratcliff and tjeg signed a contract which both parties explicitly understood was based on a defined scope of work excluding the central plant study,although ratcliff had earlier contracted with the county for a defined scope of basic services explicitly including that study.ratcliff,however,did not appear to be fully cognizant of this discrepancy until much later.stephanie bartos agreed in her testimony that the fee in the august contract was based on work under the kmd master plan,but believed that the august contract was as well.she did not believe the fees in the august contract would be sufficient to compensate tjeg for the mechanical and engineering work on the project that was actually underway in august.
change in project scope during schematic design and design development 
as noted,the project scope,even as defined in the contract,had changed between august,and august.in the schematic design phase,which culminated in a december report,the footprint of the project changed and the estimated square footage and construction costs increased.ted jacob testified that the mechanical and electrical engineering work involved in modifying the site utilities for the new layout required was a m onumental task.tjeg discussed the issue with ratcliff in a series of meetings and asked for increased fees for these services.
bartos knew in the fall of,that the scope of the project would increase and that the increase would cause ratcliff and tjeg to incur additional costs.however,countryman had told her that any increase in the construction budget would be a political problem because the county board of supervisors had to vote to continue the project.she decided to wait until after the board approved the project in december before requesting additional fees.ratcliff cost consultant initially estimated the cost of the project as modified in the december schematic design at million,but the cost consultant later reduced that figure in order to keep it within budget.the cost consultant achieved the reduction in price in part by reducing the contingency cushion from percent to percent and by decreasing projected cost escalations from percent to percent.
countryman testified that ratcliff told the county at the end of the schematic design phase that the estimated costs for the project had not increased,and that ratcliff assured the county that both the construction costs and their fees were adequate.he said that he had specifically asked bartos if there was any change in ratcliff design fee and she confirmed that there was not.ratcliff told the board of supervisors at the december meeting that the project was still within budget and that the board approved the project with that assurance.the county later denied certain of ratcliff requests for additional fees on the basis that they should have been presented at that time.an expert witness for tjeg,david zion,opined that ratcliff misrepresented the cost of the project to the board of supervisors in violation of its professional standard of care.
in a may design development report,estimated construction cost was for the inpatient wing compared to in the kmd study concept for the clinic compared to in concept and for the central plant compared to in concept.the total construction cost was before escalation,compared to before escalation in the kmd concept.
in the summer of,the project scope expanded further when the county adopted a plan adding a diagnostic and treatment building to the hospital.
requests for additional basic services fees based on increased scope of work 
as noted,in letters dated july and august,and again in an august,letter,tjeg requested for additional basic services fees based on the increase scope of the project reflected in the may design development report.in the meantime,tjeg was in constant communication with bartos on the issue.in an august,memorandum memorializing a meeting between tjeg and ratcliff,jacob wrote,the additional design fee of will be presented by the ratcliff architects to the county.at ratcliff request,tjeg later revised its additional fee request to based on lowered construction cost estimates following the design development report 
bartos testified that she agreed to incorporate this material into ongoing fee requests to the county for additional fees,and did so both orally and in writing.she testified that she would not have sent tjeg request on to the county unless she thought tjeg was entitled to the additional fees.however,i would only think they were entitled to receive them from us if we got them from the county 
in may,ratcliff submitted tjeg additional fee request to the county.in approximately the summer of,tjeg and ratcliff met with the county about the fee request and countryman agreed to prepare a contract amendment to pay the request if ratcliff provided a detailed letter supporting the request.between may and march,countryman waited for ratcliff to submit such a letter,but ratcliff never did so.when countryman asked bartos about the letter,she said she had not sent it because ratcliff wanted to request additional funds and she wanted to submit the requests together.tjeg was never paid these additional fees.
in november,ratcliff and the county executed a contract amendment amendment increasing the estimated construction cost of the project based on the changes caused by the adoption of the plan adding the diagnostic and treatment building and also increasing ratcliff fee.tjeg expert zion opined that ratcliff violated the standard of care and ethical duties of an architect when,while negotiating additional basic services fees for the plan,it did not include tjeg request for about in fees based on changes to the scope of the project before adoption of the plan.he opined that ratcliff did not timely submit tjeg request for additional fees to the county.
in may,ratcliff compiled all of the outstanding additional fee requests for the design team into a binder that came to be known as the red book.fred jacob of tjeg testified that he met with david thurston of ratcliff as part of this compilation process,that he discussed the correct valuation of tjeg fee adjustment resulting from the change in the original master plan,and that he came to an agreement with thurston that was an appropriate fee adjustment for tjeg for the basic services and was a fair and reasonable valuation of tjeg additional work.tjeg performed all of the work covered by this fee request.in the red book,ratcliff asked for this fee adjustment as part of an overall fee adjustment of for basic contract scope change for the whole design team kit ratcliff denied that ratcliff had agreed was a fair and reasonable evaluation of tjeg work or that tjeg was entitled to be paid that amount,and said ratcliff was merely moving their proposals forward.thurston did not testify.
in august,ratcliff sent tjeg an amendment to the contract amendment,which increased tjeg fee to cover increased work caused by adoption of the plan.tjeg did not sign the amendment because it did not include all of its outstanding fee requests based on the increased scope of the project.tjeg was paid the additional fee provided in the amendment,but that fee did not cover any part of the amounts that tjeg sought to recover in the litigation.
on december,tjeg sent ratcliff a series of invoices for its outstanding claims for additional fees on the project.one of these invoices was for basic contract scope change in the amount requested in the red book of.
in about february,the county argued in a letter to ratcliff that the design team fee requests in the red book based on increases in the basic scope of work lacked merit because the work was already encompassed in the definition of basic services in the contract.kit ratcliff went back and reread ratcliff agreement with the county.and in looking at the scope of work that was required of ratcliff in the agreement and looking at his words,it was pretty sobering,because i felt like he had made some very strong points in his statements.he concluded ratcliff would not prevail if it pursued its claim against the county based on an increase in the originally defined scope of the project.he also concluded that tjeg claim lacked merit because the work was encompassed within the definition of basic services in the contract.ratcliff nevertheless continued to seek additional fees to see if the county would grant them.in an august,letter,ratcliff disputed the position taken by the county in its february letter and requested mediation of the fee issues.
in august,ratcliff again compiled all outstanding additional fee requests for the design team in a binder that came to be known as the purple book.the purple book again requested a fee adjustment for tjeg for basic contract scope changes as part of the overall request for for the entire design team,although ratcliff omitted certain other claims because kit ratcliff felt they would be difficult to win.
failing to reach agreement on the fee disputes,in about march,ratcliff gave notices terminating its contract with the county and its contract with tjeg.ratcliff and the county executed a written termination agreement,effective may,which acknowledged satisfaction of all fee claims,with the exception of those set forth in the purple book,which ratcliff continued to pursue 
construction contract administration costs 
in lieu of hiring a general contractor,the county hired a construction manager who worked with multiple prime contractors.as a result,the design team construction contract administration costs were much higher than usual.tjeg incurred additional construction contract administration costs of about a month for the entire period of construction.
in the may red book,ratcliff requested in additional compensation for itself and for tjeg for the increased construction administration work resulting from the lack of a general contractor.ratcliff did not discuss this request with tjeg before submitting the red book to the county.
in an august,letter to ratcliff,tjeg requested in additional compensation for construction administration from june through august,and projected in additional construction administration fees for september to february,for a total of.fred jacob discussed this letter with thurston,who agreed on tjeg methodology for calculating the additional fee request.ratcliff directed tjeg to perform all of the additional construction administration work and tjeg performed the work.on december,tjeg invoiced ratcliff for unpaid contract administration services.
in june,ratcliff and the county executed a contract amendment amendment that increased ratcliff basic services fee by for contract administration plus a separate extra services allowance intended for tjeg.the amendment also stated,approval of this amendment settles any and all claims by ratcliff which have been previously submitted regarding the contract administration of phases i through iii.the county representative,countryman testified that as part of an amendment to the contract the county had approved about for tjeg services,which he assumed was part of the figure in amendment.tjeg expert zion opined that ratcliff violated its duty of care to tjeg when it negotiated additional construction contract administration fees from the county for itself,waiving further claims,but failed to request adequate fees to cover tjeg additional construction administration costs.
in august,ratcliff and tjeg executed an amendment to the contract amendment,which provided in additional compensation to cover the expense of a tjeg employee attendance at a weekly meeting with contractors through october.this in compensation was in addition to the a month in additional costs encompassed in tjeg already outstanding fee request.tjeg did not intend to waive its claim for those fees by signing amendment.
in the august purple book,ratcliff omitted its own construction contract administration fee requests because kit ratcliff concluded the it had received under amendment was the best deal we were going to get.the purple book,however,did include tjeg construction administration claims for for june to december for january to june,and in projected costs for july to december for a total of.
in december,ratcliff and the county executed another contract amendment amendment that extended the construction administration services authorized in amendment for three months and increased ratcliff compensation by another.amendment again stated,approval of this amendment constitutes full and final settlement of any and all claims for the provision of services under the provisions regarding the construction contract administration phase as contained in the contract and the amendment.also in december,ratcliff and tjeg executed a contract amendment amendment that increased tjeg fee by for contract administration fees from november,through january.
before trial,tjeg tallied all of the hours it spent on contract administration on the project from june through march.the total with escalation was.tjeg had been paid that had been budgeted for construction contract administration in the original contract,under amendment,and under amendment.it sought an award of the remaining balance of.
david sasai,tjeg project coordinator,testified that ratcliff directed tjeg to perform several additional services as defined in the contract during the project.sasai practice on receiving such a request from ratcliff was to document the request,price it in consultation with the various disciplines within tjeg,review the price estimate with ted or fred jacob,and then submit the price documentation to ratcliff.ratcliff would direct tjeg to perform additional services either orally,by change order,or by providing documents that showed changes.ratcliff never told sasai that tjeg needed written authorization before performing the requested additional services or that it would not be paid in the absence of prior written authorization.ted jacob testified similarly.when ratcliff directed tjeg to proceed with additional services without providing written authorization,tjeg documented the scope of work and a fee proposal for the request and presented it to ratcliff for signature and approval.ratcliff never told tjeg not to proceed with this work.
among additional services claims included in the may red book,of these claims were pursued by tjeg at trial.while ratcliff was preparing the red book,sasai met with thurston at ratcliff to discuss these additional services requests.sasai and thurston discussed the additional work performed by tjeg,and sasai testified that thurston agreed that the requested fees represented the fair value of the work.thurston did not contend that tjeg would not be paid because it had not received prior written authorization for the work.sasai testimony was that ratcliff had directed tjeg to perform all of this work that tjeg had performed the work that ratcliff had never told tjeg to stop performing the work and that ratcliff never said tjeg would not be paid because it had not received prior written authorization.
the red book identified the additional services items as increase in the number of bid packages,value engineering,additional phasing drawings,increase in site lighting,change in airflow and infection control for clinic building,relocation of dishwasher,equipment changes in the hospital,implementation of measures necessary to obtain utility rebates,uninterruptable power supply for main computer room,relocation of an emergency generator,coordination of telecommunication data systems,implementation of state energy commission recommendations,addition of emergency power to the clinic building,presentation about intercom safety and nurse call systems,change in lighting for computer room,revision of telephone systems and design of fiber optic charting technology.all of these additional services were also identified in tjeg december,invoices to ratcliff.these fee requests totaled.
in may letters to ratcliff,tjeg requested for additional services performed to address a problem with the seismic bracing of piping from the central plant in fees for additional services performed to address a problem with the generators and in fees for additional services performed to address a problem with the installation of equipment and piping in the central plant.tjeg and ratcliff agreed on this scope of work and that the requested amounts represented the fair and reasonable value of the work.ratcliff never objected to the may letters.tjeg also incurred in reimbursable costs above what had been budgeted as part of its fee.
the august purple book prepared by ratcliff included all additional services claims that had been included in the red book,the three additional services requests reflected in the may letters,as well as the request for reimbursables,for a total of 
contract termination 
as noted above,ratcliff terminated its contract with the county in march,because of the ongoing disputes about the fee claims books and because of the stress of the construction contract administration work.the termination agreement was signed in may.
on or about march,tjeg sent a series of final invoices to ratcliff for tjeg work on the project to date based on fees that had been approved in the original contract or by contract amendment.the invoices credited fees that had been previously billed for work that was never performed because of the early termination.by submitting the invoices,tjeg asserted that it did not intend to waive its right to be paid for construction administration,the change in the basic services scope of work from the kmd study,or additional services it had performed and it continued to pursue those claims.ratcliff never indicated in or that by submitting these invoices tjeg had settled and disposed of all of its claims.ratcliff later paid tjeg for other items not included in these invoices and not expressly authorized in the contract or its amendments.
ii.procedural history 
tjeg filed this lawsuit against ratcliff in january.the trial court granted ratcliff motion for judgment on the pleadings a jury found in favor of tjeg on ratcliff.in tjeg i,we affirmed the judgment on ratcliff but reversed the judgment on tjeg complaint.we concluded that ambiguities exist as to material terms of the contract so as to render the judgment on the pleadings erroneous.contrary to ratcliff argument,the contract amendments do not conclusively establish that they resolved all outstanding claims by tjeg t he amendments do not on their face establish that tjeg was not entitled to further compensation for additional services or other basic services beyond the original scope of the basic services provided for in the contract.moreover,as tjeg asserts,the amendments to the contract do not state that they resolve all pending claims for payment by tjeg.tjeg i,supra.further,additional services is not defined and such additional services are not enumerated in either the contract or the contract t he contract is ambiguous as to whether such additional services by tjeg must be authorized by both the county and ratcliff or solely by ratcliff in addition,assuming county approval was required,the contract is ambiguous as to which party was obligated to obtain that authorization of course,if tjeg contractual interpretation is correct,tjeg would be entitled to rely on the assumption that before ratliff directed it to perform some additional service,ratliff had obtained the county approval.
after remand,tjeg filed a second amended complaint asserting causes of action for breach of contract,breach of implied contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and quantum meruit.the contract causes of action went to trial before a jury,with the trial court interpreting the contract and instructing the jury on its application.in closing argument,tjeg asked the jury to award it for work caused by the increased basic scope of work on the project the claim in the red and purple books minus percent for work that was also included in tjeg construction administration claim for unpaid construction contract administration work and for uncompensated additional services work it performed.the total amount of tjeg claim was.the jury returned a general verdict in tjeg favor for.
after trial,tjeg moved to dismiss its quantum meruit cause of action without prejudice.the trial court dismissed the claim with prejudice.tjeg also moved for an award of prejudgment interest.over ratcliff opposition,the trial court granted the motion and awarded in prejudgment interest pursuant to civil code section,subdivision a,and an alternative discretionary award of in prejudgment interest pursuant to civil code section,subdivision b.the court entered judgment in the amount of the jury award of plus prejudgment interest of.
ratcliff filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a motion for a new trial relying in part on alleged errors in the jury instructions.the court denied both motions.
tjeg moved for an award of attorney fees under the parties contract and pursuant to statute.the court granted the motion and awarded in attorney fees.
ratcliff appeals from the judgment,from the order denying its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,and from the award of attorney fees.tjeg has filed a protective from the order dismissing its quantum meruit claim with prejudice.
iii.discussion 
ratcliff challenges the judgment on the grounds that the jury instructions were argumentative,contradictory and confusing.it further contends that the award of prejudgment interest was unauthorized because tjeg claims were neither certain nor capable of being made certain by calculation.we reject both arguments and affirm the judgment 
jury instructions 
ratcliff argues the trial court erred in providing the jury with argumentative and contradictory instructions.it contends that the instructions precluded fair consideration of ratcliff primary defense that the only valid and enforceable contract between ratcliff and tjeg was exclusively incorporated in the agreement signed by both parties on august,and in its five written amendments.
the major flaw in this argument is that the issue of contract interpretation was never submitted to the jury.the court ruled that it would provisionally admit evidence to support the parties conflicting interpretations of the contracts,and would submit special interrogatories to the jury if it became necessary for it to resolve such issues.the trial court ultimately found no conflicting extrinsic evidence requiring jury resolution,interpreted the contract as a matter of law on the basis on the evidence,and instructed the jury accordingly.the court concluded the contract was not integrated,that it consisted of writings in addition to those identified by ratcliff,and that it did not require tjeg to confirm the county approval of additional work before it performed that work.because these issues were settled as far as the jury was concerned,the alleged instructional errors could not have misled the jury into rejecting contrary theories.in any event,ratcliff fails to make any showing of a reasonable probability that any errors in the instructions affected the jury verdict.
standard of review 
the propriety of jury instructions is a question of law that we review de novo.citation.cristler express messenger systems,th.in soule general motors cal th soule,the california supreme court definitively held,there is no rule of automatic reversal or inherent prejudice applicable to any category of civil instructional error,whether of commission or omission.a judgment may not be reversed for instructional error in a civil case unless,after an examination of the entire cause,including the evidence,the court shall be of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.cal,art.vi.instructional error in a civil case is prejudicial where it seems probable that the error prejudicially affected the verdict.citations.soule,at.
ratcliff argues that a more lenient standard for reversal applies when jury instructions are internally inconsistent or contradictory as opposed to flatly erroneous.citing henderson harnischfeger,ratcliff argues reversal is required on a showing that contradictory instructions possibly affected the verdict.henderson harnischfeger cal d,henderson.in soule,however,the supreme court clearly held that its adoption of the aforementioned uniform test for civil instructional error disposes of the contention that we must find the erroneous instruction in this case prejudicial because it raises a mere possibility that the jury verdict was based on an incorrect legal theory.see,citation henderson,at pp.citation.the maxim that an appellate court may not speculate on the instructional basis of a general verdict can not mean that a civil judgment must invariably be reversed unless the record explicitly shows that the jury did not rely on the erroneous theory.such a rigid rule would be at odds with people watson cal d,which sought to eliminate the notion that the mere possibility of prejudice from trial error warrants reversal under article vi,section of the california constitution soule,supra,cal th at,fn.the court noted that article vi,section reference to misdirection of the jury logically includes every kind of instructional error.it seems manifest that incorrect,ambiguous,conflicting,or wrongly omitted instructions may equally misdirect the jury deliberations.id.at,italics added.
we apply soule uniform test for civil instructional error,which asks if it is reasonably probable the error affected the verdict.
interpretation of the contract 
before trial,the court informed the parties that issues of contract interpretation were questions of law that the court would decide based on the written terms of the parties contract and any relevant extrinsic evidence presented at trial subject to the jury resolution of factual conflicts in the extrinsic evidence.the jury would decide issues of breach and damages.
at the close of tjeg case,the court heard argument on ratcliff motion for nonsuit,and focused on the issue of tjeg right to claim additional fees for basic services under the contract.among other things,ratcliff argued that tjeg claims for additional work based on an increase in the basic scope of work on the project including the additional contract administration claims were precluded by the incorporated provisions of paragraph of the contract,and that paragraph substantial changes in the project scope shall provide sufficient basis for renegotiation of ratcliff fee.was an unenforceable agreement to agree.tjeg argued that,under the authority of coleman engineering north american aviation,cal d coleman,such contract modifications were within the contemplation of the parties,enforceable even in the absence of prior agreement on price or cost,and required the parties to negotiate in good faith for an appropriate adjustment.
in coleman,the parties contract which consisted of purchase orders included a provision that,buyer reserves the right at any time to make changes in drawings and specifications in such event there will be made an equitable adjustment in price and time of performance mutually satisfactory to buyer and seller,coleman,supra,cal d at.when changes later occurred,the plaintiff requested an adjustment in both the price and the time for performance.id.at.negotiations on a new fee were unsuccessful,and the plaintiff stopped working on the project.the defendant argued that plaintiff termination of work was a breach.id.at.the supreme court held,t he effect to be given to the provision for adjustment of price to the mutual satisfaction of the parties,an provision should not be determined merely from the written agreement itself but should depend upon the changes requested undoubtedly,if the subsequent changes are minor or of not great magnitude the contractor must perform and obtain a subsequent judicial determination as to the price of the changes.however,where the changes are of great magnitude in relation to the entire contract,the contractor must negotiate in good faith to settle the price citation,and where he has done so,he is not required to continue performance in the absence of an agreement as to the price.id.at.tjeg argued that coleman does say you have to stop working.if you keep working you are going to get your recovery at the end on the contract.the court found coleman to be controlling authority.
the trial court ultimately provided special jury instructions on the meaning of the parties contract.the trial court first instructed the jury that the written contract admitted in evidence as exhibits contract and tjeg august,letter and enclosures,which included tjeg august and,letters to ratcliff,as amended by the parties,governs the rights and duties of the parties.it is my job as judge to interpret the meaning of this contract,and therefore,i will tell you what the contract means.ratcliff and tjeg entered into a consulting agreement whereby tjeg agreed to perform mechanical,electrical,and plumbing design services,as required in the agreement,based on the kmd report.ratcliff agreed to pay tjeg a fixed fee for those services.tjeg was required to perform basic services for the mechanical,plumbing,fire protection,and electrical portions of the project in accordance with the consulting agreement,and in accordance with ratcliff agreement with the county insofar as it required basic services for the mechanical,electrical,and plumbing systems 
the trial court then provided what hereafter will be referred to as the coleman instruction the contract provides methods for an adjustment in the contract price one method for basic services and one method for additional services.for basic services,the agreement requires tjeg and ratcliff to negotiate in good faith for an appropriate adjustment in fee if there is a substantial change in the scope of the project.if an agreement on an adjustment in fee was reached,tjeg was required to perform the substantial change in the scope of the project and ratcliff was required to pay for the work as agreed.if no agreement on the adjustment in fee was reached,tjeg was entitled to be paid the reasonable value of the work performed,if any.
regarding issues related to basic and additional services,the court provided the following instructions to recover for a substantial change in the scope of basic services,tjeg must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that 
a.there was a substantial change in the scope of the project that resulted in extra work for tjeg 
b.that ratcliff directed tjeg to perform the work 
c.that tjeg performed the work and 
d.that ratcliff did not pay tjeg for the work and 
tjeg must prove the amount of its damages.hereafter referred to as the basic services burden instruction.
to recover for additional services,tjeg must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that 
ratcliff directed tjeg to perform additional services 
b.that tjeg performed the additional services and 
c.that ratcliff did not pay tjeg for the work.
tjeg must prove the amount of its damages.hereafter referred to as the additional services burden instruction.
in determining whether tjeg was entitled either to additional fees for a substantial change in the scope of basic services or additional services,an amendment to the agreement was not a precondition for ratcliff to become obligated to pay tjeg any money for work performed by tjeg.tjeg was not required to obtain written authorization from ratcliff or the county for a substantial change in the scope of basic services.tjeg was not required to obtain any authorization from the county.ratcliff was required to obtain authorization from the county for a substantial change in the scope of basic services.tjeg was entitled to rely on ratcliff to satisfy any obligation for county authorization of a substantial change in the scope of basic services.
the contract documents require written authorization to tjeg from ratcliff for additional services.however,if you find that ratcliff issued oral direction to tjeg for additional services,that tjeg complied with such oral direction and provided such additional services,and that ratcliff accepted tjeg performance,then you may find that ratcliff has waived the requirement that additional services shall require written authorization from the architect.ratcliff was required to obtain authorization from the county for additional services.tjeg was entitled to rely on ratcliff to satisfy any obligation for county authorization for additional services.hereafter referred to as the special waiver instruction.
the court also provided a number of standard instructions on contract law,which we discuss post to the extent necessary.
basic services 
ratcliff first argues that the special instruction discussion of basic services compensation was internally inconsistent and legally erroneous.according to ratcliff,coleman,supra,cal d,holds that parties who have an provision in their contract must negotiate in good faith when a change arises,but it does not hold that a performing party is guaranteed payment for its work in the absence of a successfully negotiated agreement on a new fee.rather,in the absence of a renegotiated fee,the performing party must either stop work on the job or perform the modified scope of work for the original fee.
ratcliff thus argues the following two sentences in the coleman instruction correctly reflect the coleman holding for basic services,the agreement requires tjeg and ratcliff to negotiate in good faith for an appropriate adjustment in fee if there is a substantial change in the scope of the project.if an agreement on an adjustment in fee was reached,tjeg was required to perform the substantial change in the scope of the project and ratcliff was required to pay for the work as agreed.however,ratcliff contends that the next sentence is inconsistent with coleman and contradicts the first two if no agreement on the adjustment in fee was reached,tjeg was entitled to be paid the reasonable value of the work performed,if any.
we believe that the trial court interpretation and application of coleman was correct.coleman addressed the enforceability of a construction contract which included a provision for renegotiation of the contract fee in the event of substantial changes in the project scope of work an provision.coleman,supra,cal d at.as a general principle,the court held that the enforceability of a contract leaving some of its terms to future determination depends on the relative importance of the unsettled term.ibid.where the indefinite promise is so essential to the bargain that an inability to enforce it renders enforcement of the remainder of the contract unfair,the contract may be abandoned.if the matters left for future agreement are unessential,each party will be forced to accept a reasonable determination of the unsettled point or if possible the unsettled point may be left unperformed and the remainder of the contract be enforced.ibid.in the construction context,if the subsequent changes are minor or of not great magnitude the contractor must perform and obtain a subsequent judicial determination as to the price of the changes.however,where the changes are of great magnitude in relation to the entire contract,the contractor must negotiate in good faith to settle the price citation,and where he has done so,he is not required to continue performance in the absence of an agreement as to the price.id.at,italics added.
what coleman does not expressly address is whether a contractor faced with a substantial change in its originally contracted scope of work,who is unable to successfully negotiate a price for that additional work,may elect to continue to work and reserve its right to subsequently obtain a judicial determination as to the value of the changes.the trial court concluded that it may and we agree.so long as the other contracting party continues to demand performance of the increased scope of work,and in the absence of any conflicting provision of the contract,the contractor may continue to work after unsuccessful negotiations and subsequently recover the value of that work.to hold otherwise would compel a contractor to walk off the job in the face of what it believes to be major changes in the scope of work required of it,with significant consequences if its judgment is later proven wrong,or alternatively forfeit any right to seek compensation for that work,regardless of the extent of the additional burdens imposed.it would also be particularly anomalous to read coleman as permitting a contractor to obtain a subsequent judicial determination of the value of changes to the scope of work that are minor or of not great magnitude,while denying the contractor the right to such a determination and any recovery where changes are of great magnitude in relation to the entire contract.the interpretation urged by ratcliff is also impractical and economically inefficient.construction projects pose complex time management challenges,requiring multiple contractors and subcontractors to coordinate their efforts as numerous design revisions and change orders inevitably arise.to complete these projects efficiently,the parties must be able to continue working despite contract disputes with reasonable assurances of the ability to ultimately obtain a fair resolution of those disputes 
the jury was told that the parties were required to negotiate in good faith to set a new fee if the scope of work in the contract changed substantially.to the extent they agreed upon compensation,tjeg was entitled to recover the agreed upon amount.to the extent that negotiations were unsuccessful and ratcliff nevertheless directed tjeg to perform the work,tjeg was entitled to compensation for the fair and reasonable value of the additional work it performed pursuant to that direction.the instruction as a whole correctly reflects the trial court reading of coleman,which we approve.
ratcliff next argues that the basic services burden instruction abandoned the coleman rule altogether,saying nothing about a renegotiated fee.now,inexplicably,tjeg had to prove only that ratcliff directed work constituting a substantial change in basic services.as noted,however,ratcliff misreads both coleman and the coleman instruction to permit recovery only if negotiations on a new fee culminate in a mutual agreement.in fact,the trial court interpreted coleman to allow a party that performed the increased work to be paid in any event it must be paid the fee if negotiations are successful,and the fair and reasonable value of the work if negotiations are unsuccessful.the basic services burden instruction is consistent with this rule and the court thus correctly instructed the jury.
finally,ratcliff complains that the jury had to guess whether any agreement was required and whether a breach needed to be proven,issues raised by the court standard instructions on contract law but not directly addressed in the special instruction.we see no confusion in the instructions when they are read as a whole.the trial court instructed the jury that t he written contract admitted as exhibits and,as amended by the parties,governs the rights and duties of the parties.that is,the court itself determined the existence and terms of the parties underlying contract.the court further instructed the jury that t he contract provides methods for an adjustment in the contract price and described in the coleman instruction the method of adjusting the basic services compensation based on a substantial increase in the scope of work.the standard instructions on reaching an agreement were relevant to the jury determination of whether ratcliff and tjeg had actually negotiated a new fee between themselves based on the increased scope of work.the standard instructions on breach of contract were relevant to the jury determination of whether ratcliff had paid tjeg for either the agreed upon value,or the reasonable value,of basic services work tjeg actually performed that was outside the original scope of the project.the basic services burden instruction clearly and correctly set forth this framework for the jury to follow.there was no reasonable probability of confusion.
additional services and waiver 
ratcliff argues the trial court failed to clearly instruct the jury on the requirements for finding that ratcliff had waived a contractual requirement of prior written authorization for performance of additional services on the project.after providing the additional services burden instruction quoted above,the court gave the special waiver instruction also quoted above.the court also told the jury a condition is waived when a party by his words or conduct justifies another to believe that a conditional promise will be performed despite the of a condition,and the other party relies upon the manifestations to his substantial detriment.hereafter referred to as the general waiver instruction.
ratcliff first complains that the additional services burden instruction makes no mention of the written authorization requirement contained in the contract,extra services rendered by ratcliff must be first authorized in writing by the county paragraph additional services under part iv of the contract to be provided at specified hourly billing rates,with prior written authorization from ratcliff.however,the instruction requires proof that ratcliff directed tjeg to perform the additional services and does not state that an oral direction would be sufficient.it leaves that issue open.two paragraphs later,in the special waiver instruction,the court advised the jury that ratcliff oral direction to tjeg to perform the services combined with ratcliff acceptance of the services would constitute a waiver.this additional services instruction was an appropriate application of the general waiver instruction to the facts of the case ratcliff conduct of accepting services without complaint in the absence of written authorization would justify tjeg in believing the written authorization condition had been waived,and tjeg performance of substantial work in the expectation of being paid would amount to reliance to its substantial detriment.ratcliff has not demonstrated how these instructions might have misled the jury or caused them to improperly reject ratcliff defense.
and modified contracts 
ratcliff argues the instructions on and modified contracts did not clearly state whether contracts could be modified by conduct alone or whether words were required.in one instruction,the trial court told the jury that c ontracts can be modified by the conduct of the parties,without spoken or written words.in another instruction,the court told the jury,you must decide whether a reasonable person would conclude from the words and conduct of tjeg and ratcliff that they agreed to further modify the contract.the latter instruction,however,did not require words to prove a modification or otherwise contradict the first instruction.the jury was instructed to consider the parties words and conduct,but was also told it could find a modification based on conduct alone.there was no internal contradiction in the instructions.
ratcliff argues a combined instruction on contract formation and modification was confusing because it did not clearly state whether the following language applied only to contract formation,or to modification as well conduct will create a contract if the conduct of both parties is intentional and each knows,or has reason to know,that the other party will interpret the conduct as an agreement to enter into a contract.however,the very next sentence in the instruction explains,ratcliff contend s that the parties did not enter into a contract or amendment,modification other than the agreement and its five amendments because such an agreement or amendment was never written or signed.to overcome this contention,tjeg must prove all of the following.that the parties understood and agreed to the terms of the agreement and.that the parties agreed to be bound without a written agreement.in other words,the jury was instructed that if conduct was the basis for finding a modification,the conduct must show agreement to be bound,intentional conduct the party has reason to know the other party will interpret as agreement and must be understood as agreeing to the modified terms,and agreeing to be bound without a writing.the instructions are not contradictory or misleading.moreover,ratcliff again offers no explanation of how this alleged lack of clarity might have affected the verdict.
covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
ratcliff argues that the instructions on breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing were confusing because they required tjeg to prove it had a contract with ratcliff and that all conditions for ratcliff performance under the contract had occurred or were waived,but the previously discussed alleged instructional errors interfered with the jury ability to make those determinations.t he jury could not decide tjeg implied covenant claim without determining which contracts came into being what they said in the end about tjeg compensation whether any agreement at all was required on the basic services issue and whether tjeg had to prove,and if so did prove,that ratcliff had waived the clause respecting additional services.as already explained,the court decided and instructed the jury that tjeg and ratcliff had a written contract and described its terms to the jury.the court told the jury under the terms of the contract tjeg was entitled to be paid for any additional basic services that the jury found that ratcliff had directed it to perform that were based on a substantial change in the scope of the project that tjeg was entitled to be paid the fair value of such services in the event it could not negotiate a new fee with ratcliff and that ratcliff oral direction to tjeg to perform additional services combined with its acceptance of those services could constitute a waiver of the contractual written authorization requirement.therefore,there were no instructional contradictions or ambiguities that prevented the jury from accurately applying the implied covenant instructions.
summary instruction 
ratcliff argues the trial court provided an argumentative instruction summarizing the parties positions in the trial.
the contested instruction read tjeg claims that it and ratcliff entered into a contract for the provision of mechanical,electrical,and plumbing services for the master plan improvements of the san mateo county health center.tjeg claims that the terms of the contract permitted ratcliff to direct changes in the scope of work to be performed and,thereafter,permitted tjeg to be compensated for the resulting additional work performed.tjeg claims that ratcliff breached this contract by directing changes in the scope of work to be performed and failing to pay for the reasonable and value of the added scope of work performed by tjeg.tjeg also claims that,to the extent that ratcliff asked tjeg to perform services outside the scope of the contract and those services were performed,such services were performed under the mutual agreement that tjeg would be paid for such services.tjeg further claims that ratcliff breached the agreement of the parties by unfairly interfering with tjeg right to receive the benefits of the contract by misleading the county and tjeg as to the true project costs,by requesting additional services of tjeg and thereafter refusing to pay for them,failing to submit tjeg requests for additional payment to the owner of the project in a timely manner,and by obtaining compensation for ratcliff own services from the owner in lieu of and at the expense of tjeg.tjeg also claims that ratcliff breach of this contract caused harm to tjeg for which ratcliff should pay.ratcliff denies tjeg claims.
ratcliff first faults this instruction because it states that ratcliff denies all of tjeg claims,necessarily including the claim that tjeg and ratcliff had entered into a contract,whereas ratcliff entire defense was that the parties entered into a unmodified written contract that was limited by its express terms.there was no reasonable probability the jury was misled by the instruction,as ratcliff clearly stated its position in both opening and closing arguments that the parties had a contract that was limited to the agreement signed august,and its five written amendments.
ratcliff next faults the instruction for stating that tjeg claimed the terms of the contract permitted ratcliff to direct changes in the scope of work to be performed and permitted tjeg to be compensated for the resulting additional work performed,without providing more detail,whether the terms were written or oral.however,ratcliff cites no authority that a summary instruction of this type must set forth the parties positions in exhaustive detail.later instructions elaborated on tjeg theories and set forth all of the elements tjeg had to prove in order to prevail on its claims.also,tjeg gave opening and closing statements that explained its theory of the case.
ratcliff complains that the instruction said tjeg claimed that ratcliff breached the contract by failing to pay the reasonable and value of the added scope of work it directed tjeg to perform without explaining in the summary or any other instruction how reasonable and values were supposed to mesh in any of jacob theories.in fact,the basic services coleman instruction explained that the parties had an obligation to negotiate in good faith the fee for any additional work which ratcliff directed,and if the jury found that tjeg had performed such work,that ratcliff had to pay the fee if the negotiations were successful and the fair and reasonable value of the work if the negotiations were unsuccessful.
ratcliff also complains the instruction description of tjeg claim that,to the extent that ratcliff asked tjeg to perform services outside the scope of the contract and those services were performed,such services were performed under the mutual agreement that tjeg would be paid for such services failed to define services outside the scope of the contract,which might refer to basic services for an increased scope of work or additional services.the jury,however,was later instructed in detail about how to determine whether tjeg was entitled to additional compensation for basic services or additional services.ratcliff also complains that this language did not specify whether mutual agreement was written,oral or implied,did not specify a formula or mechanism for payment,and did not clarify whether to ask and direct tjeg to perform work were synonymous.as already explained,the court instructed the jury on the meaning of the written terms of the contract that the court found to be enforceable,and how to determine whether those terms had been augmented or modified by the parties words or conduct.the court explained how tjeg payment should be determined under the written terms of the contract as interpreted by the court,and payment by any additional terms found by the jury to exist would be dictated by those terms.ratcliff has made no showing whatsoever that any of these alleged ambiguities in the instructions could have affected the jury.there was no evidence that ratcliff asked tjeg to perform services in a manner that might fall short of directing them to perform the services nor is there anything in the record before us to indicate that ratcliff asked the court to clarify this alleged ambiguity.the valuation of tjeg claims at trial was consistent with the valuations placed on them by ratcliff in the purple book,and there was no evidence adduced that the value of tjeg work was any less than what tjeg claimed it to be.
we reject ratcliff claims of instructional error and affirm the jury award of damages to tjeg.
motion for prejudgment interest 
ratcliff argues the trial court erred in awarding prejudgment interest because the amount of tjeg damages was not certain or capable of ready calculation,as evidenced by tjeg shifting legal demands for damages over time.the trial court rejected ratcliff arguments and awarded interest based on the dates tjeg claims became certain in the red and purple books.we affirm.

ratcliff contentions 
in arguing that tjeg claims were neither certain nor capable of being made certain by calculation,ratcliff cites the following varied valuations by tjeg of its claims in its filings.
in tjeg january original complaint,tjeg demanded for its breach of contract,open book account and quantum meruit causes of action,and on an account stated.although the damages were not further broken down,the complaint explained that tjeg was seeking fees for work caused by an increase in the scope of the project,for construction contract administration work,and for additional services work.
in a stop notice filed july,tjeg summarily claimed that was due under the contract.
in a june response to ratcliff demand for a bill of particulars,tjeg claimed a total of due on the project and provided a copy of the purple book,a printout of all hours tjeg worked on the project,and a printout of its reimbursable expenses.in august,tjeg amended this filing to include outstanding additional services compensation and claimed a total amount owed of.
in may,tjeg filed a first amended complaint asserting two causes of action,breach of contract and quantum meruit.for each cause of action,it claimed damages of.the complaint alleged that ratcliff failed to pay tjeg for work caused by an increase in the scope of the project,an increase in construction contract administration work,and additional services work.
on june,tjeg filed an application for a right to attach order and order for issuance of writ of attachment,seeking to attach ratcliff settlement proceeds from the county.tjeg sought to secure,which included fees in excess of plus interest,costs,and attorney fees.tjeg attached a declaration explaining ratcliff owed tjeg sums for work caused by an increase in the scope of the project,an increase in construction contract administration work,and additional services work,and it attached a copy of the purple book.
in its july second amended complaint asserting causes of action for breach of contract,breach of implied contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and quantum meruit,tjeg sought damages of for each cause of action.the complaint alleged that ratcliff had failed to pay tjeg for work caused by an increase in the scope of the project,an increase in construction contract administration work,and additional services work.
in its march trial brief,tjeg wrote that it was owed for work caused by an increase in the scope of the project,for work related to the county plan,more than for construction contract administration work,and in additional services for a total of.in its opening statement,tjeg asked for for work caused by the increased scope of the project,for work related to the plan,and for construction contract administration.it also mentioned additional services,but did not quantify that claim.during trial,tjeg dropped its claim related to the plan.in its opposition to ratcliff motion for nonsuit,tjeg argued it was entitled to recover plus plus for additional services.in its closing argument,tjeg requested minus to avoid amounts included in their contract administration claim,plus and.the jury awarded 
nothing in this litigation history undermines tjeg entitlement to prejudgment interest.all of the filings other than summary demands explained that tjeg claims were based on increased work due to the changed scope of the project,its excessive construction contract administration work caused by the absence of a general contractor,and its unpaid additional services work.tjeg gave ratcliff itemized claims in each of these areas when ratcliff prepared the red and purple books.ratcliff therefore had all information it needed to quantify its debt to tjeg.in fact,it utilized and relied upon the detailed information provided by tjeg in presenting its own claims to the county.the fact that some claims were ultimately dropped by tjeg or rejected by the jury did not interfere with ratcliff ability to accurately quantify the claims that were ultimately successful.although tjeg total damages demands may have varied over time,they always totaled at least as much as the jury awarded.thus,ratcliff was always on notice that it was holding,and potentially accruing interest on,at least in funds that it might ultimately be ordered to pay to tjeg.the disparity between the plaintiff demand in the complaint and the amount of damages ultimately awarded was immaterial.see national farm workers service center,cataran,d,nfwsc harvest figures contained in parties stipulation derived from defendants records u nder these circumstances,there can be no prejudice to defendants merely because plaintiffs prayed for a substantially greater award than they received.
ratcliff relies on two cases where courts held the plaintiff claims were not sufficiently certain to support an award of prejudgment interest in part because of the plaintiff own inconsistency in the amount of its claims.we find both cases distinguishable.in conderback,standard oil d conderback,there was no single contractual document in which the sum due or the means of calculating it are clearly provided for.indeed,according to plaintiff theory,compensation was predicated on an open ended purchase order involving application of a pricing formula and negotiations between the parties,all in accordance with a prior course of dealing the defendant could not determine what was owing until it had received from plaintiff some statement with supporting data from which it could make the determination.id.at.although the plaintiff there had provided records for the defendant to review,the court was not persuaded the defendant could have quantified plaintiff claims from these records,noting that the plaintiff itself arrived at several different results.id.at,fn.omitted.unlike the parties in conderback,tjeg and ratcliff met and agreed on the value of the claims that were ultimately awarded by the jury when ratcliff prepared its red and purple books and the claims did not vary thereafter.moreover,as to the additional services claims,the pricing formula tjeg used to calculate the claim was set forth in the undisputed written terms of the contract.
ratcliff also cites wisper california commerce bank th wisper,where a major issue at trial was the plaintiff own liability for the damages due to contributory negligence and the jury ultimately awarded it only percent of its damages claim.id.at.the court held prejudgment interest was unwarranted in light of the vast disparity between the claimed damage and that which was awarded,arising from a factual environment in which most,if not all,of plaintiff loss was a result of its own irresponsible behavior.see also distefano hall d,damages not sufficiently certain where complex factual and legal issues needed to be resolved at trial.wisper acknowledges that a dispute about the defendant liability rather than about the amount of damages generally does not make damages uncertain for purposes of awarding prejudgment interest.wisper,at.however,wisper was unusual in that the plaintiff significant contributory negligence was at issue.here,comparative fault was not at issue.
the facts here are more analogous to general insurance,where the appellate court upheld an award of prejudgment interest in an action on a construction contract despite the fact that the total amount claimed for the claimed extra work and excess labor costs differs by several thousand dollars as it is alleged in respondent complaint,in its first answers to appellants interrogatories,and in its trial brief,and t he figure which the trial court found to be due and owing general insurance,supra,d at.interest was awarded from the date the plaintiff gave defendants a fully itemized accounting of its claims there,during discovery.id.at.here,the trial court awarded interest from the date tjeg accounted for its claims to ratcliff satisfaction and they were included in the red and purple books submitted to the county.
even if a plaintiff accounting of a claim contains errors or includes items that are later dropped,the claim may be sufficiently certain to support an award of prejudgment interest.in marine terminals paceco,d,the court explained,by submitting the invoices to defendant,plaintiff made its damages known to defendant and rendered them certain,even though one of the invoices included inapplicable charges.id.at.the errors were minor and could have been easily corrected at the time the demand for payment was made.defendant disputed its liability but at no time prior to trial disputed the amount or method of calculating plaintiff damages.those damages were readily ascertainable and capable of being made certain from the data furnished to defendant in.id.at.in coleman,the supreme court similarly observed,the mere fact that there is a slight difference between the amount of damages claimed and the amount awarded does not preclude an award of prejudgment interest citation,and the erroneous omission of a few matters from the account or erroneous calculation of the costs do not mean that the damages are not capable of being made certain by calculation.coleman,supra,cal d at.thus,tjeg abandonment of its claim for money due on its work related to the plan,for example,does not require reversal of the interest award.
finally,the main issue at trial here was the extent of ratcliff contractual obligation to pay tjeg for its fees regardless of whether ratcliff was compensated for the work by the county.similarly,in nfwsc,t he sole dispute between the parties involved a question of contract interpretation as to whether payments were owing for juice grapes and work performed by employees of labor contractors.regardless of the resolution of this dispute,the fact remained that damages could be readily calculated once it was determined whether the disputed categories were to be included in the sum total of damages.nfwsc,supra,d at,fn.omitted.the same could be said here.
assessing prejudgment interest on the full amount of the jury award furthers the policy of civil code section,which is to make the injured party whole for the accrual of wealth which could have been produced during the period of loss.citation.i n situations where the defendant could have timely paid a certain amount and has thus deprived the plaintiff of the economic benefit of those funds,the defendant should therefore compensate with appropriate interest.citation.great western drywall,roel construction,th,brackets in original.
trial court calculation of prejudgment interest 
we briefly review the trial court calculation of the prejudgment interest award,which ratcliff challenges only obliquely as part of its larger claim that damages were uncertain.tjeg does not challenge the court method of calculation.we affirm the award as supported by substantial evidence.see winograd american broadcasting th,factual determinations by the trial court are reviewed for substantial evidence.
tjeg moved for an award of prejudgment interest from the date of the december,invoices,which covered tjeg claim for basic services work caused by the increase in the scope of the project,for additional services,and for construction contract administration.tjeg asked for prejudgment interest on the remainder of the jury award as of march,when ratcliff terminated its agreement with tjeg and all of its work was completed.
the trial court was not persuaded that claims became certain as of the date of tjeg december invoices.the court instead relied on dates various claims were included in the red and purple books tjeg presented substantial evidence at trial that amounts included by ratcliff in its submissions to the county in the red book and purple book were certain at least as of the dates of those submissions on an item by item basis as reflected in those submissions.indeed,ratcliff willingness to forward those claims to the county with its endorsement as to payment is compelling evidence that ratcliff not only knew the amounts involved and did not dispute them,but that it agreed with them.tjeg witnesses testified,contrary to ratcliff position in this case,that the sums identified in those documents represented an agreement between tjeg and ratcliff as to the manner of calculation and the amount of those sums.contrary to its argument now,no ratcliff witness testified that those amounts were disputed once they had been put forward in the redbook or the purple book.
the trial court calculated the prejudgment interest award as follows the court has identified that was known or knowable as of may,from its review of the redbook.exh.that amount should be reduced by because of uncertainty as to which portions of tjeg claims the jury rejected,leaving a balance upon which interest may be calculated as of that date of.annual interest on that amount of times years equals.twenty five additional days of interest adds,bringing the total interest for this portion of the award to.as for the remaining,in the purple book ratcliff acknowledged amounts owed to tjeg of attributable to its work on the project as of august.exh.although many of the items identified in the purple book had previously been identified in the red book,there will be no duplication of interest if annual interest of is multiplied by and years,for a total of.since the court has already subtracted the full amount of the jury reduction from the sums due by may,no further reduction is appropriate for the sums otherwise due by august.
we review the trial court ruling,not its reasoning,and we find the grant of prejudgment interest supported by substantial evidence in the record.see in re marriage of burgess cal th,w e are required to uphold the ruling if it is correct on any basis,regardless of whether such basis was actually invoked.the red book includes the following items that were part of tjeg damages claim to the jury the request for basic services fees for work caused by the increased scope of the project and additional services fee requests that totaled.the purple book includes the following additional items that were part of tjeg damages claim to the jury the three additional services claims reflected in tjeg may letters plus the claim for reimbursables for a total of in new additional services claims,plus in construction contract administration claims through for to june and for july to.
tjeg asked the jury to award in contract administration costs,more than the contract administration claims listed in the purple book.tjeg also asked the jury to award in additional services costs,more than the additional services claims in the red and purple books plus,totaling the jury awarded less than tjeg requested.it can be inferred that the difference between the amount of the contract administration and additional services claims tjeg made at trial and the amount that were identified in the red and purple books plus,totaling were accounted for in the jury reduction of tjeg overall damages claim.the remainder of the shortfall in the jury verdict minus,equaling remains unexplained.
subtracting the unexplained amount of the shortfall in the jury verdict from the total claims established in the red book plus,totaling yields a total of in claims that were awarded by the jury and that were certain as of the date of the red book.the trial court could have awarded prejudgment interest on this amount as of the date of the red book,but it awarded interest on the lesser amount of,a difference of.
as noted,the total contract administration claims identified in the purple book were.when the in overlap between the basic services claim and the contract administration claims is deducted from this figure,there remain in contract administration claims that were awarded by the jury and that were certain as of the date of the purple book.adding in new additional services claims in the purple book brings the total to in claims that were awarded by the jury and that were certain as of the date of the purple book.adding the in claims for which interest could have been awarded from the date of the red book and thus necessarily could also be awarded from the later date of the purple book brings the total to,the amount on which the trial court actually awarded prejudgment interest from the date of the purple book.
in sum,the trial court award of prejudgment interest is supported by substantial evidence.because we affirm the trial court award of prejudgment interest pursuant to civil code section,subdivision a,we need not address its contingent award pursuant to civil code section,subdivision b.

tjeg also requested additional fees for increased work required by adoption of the plan.tjeg performed,and was paid for,all of this work.
in our opinion in the prior appeal,we noted that the contract included a provision that receipt by ratcliff of funds from the county for work performed by tjeg is a condition precedent to ratcliff obligation to pay for work performed by tjeg.tjeg i,supra.we also noted that ratcliff had conceded the provision was an unenforceable provision that is void as against public policy.ibid.the provision was deleted from the copy of the contract that was provided to the jury at the trial under review here.
the red book request for additional compensation also included a request for for completed work on additional scope changes,and proposed two alternatives for compensation for additional construction administration effort.both of these requests included additional compensation for tjeg.those claims are discussed post.
ratcliff filed a against the county in this action.all claims between ratcliff and the county were settled in in a confidential mediation.
a summary table of the design team requests for additional compensation in the purple book identifies tjeg contract administration costs for this period as rather than.however,ratcliff executive summary in the purple book identifies the sum as and supporting documentation for the claim in the purple book including a tally of individual tjeg employees projected labor hours and costs identify the figure as.when considered in its entirety,the trial court could reasonably find that the purple book asserted an claim and the lower amount in the summary table was a typographical error.
the sum of the additional services claims,the three requests made in may plus plus,equaling,and the request for reimburseables is.the total in the purple book is less than this figure because in the purple book ratcliff claimed only for additional services performed to address a problem with the installation of equipment and piping in the central plant.in the purple book,the may requests and the request for reimburseables total.

ratcliff challenges the award of attorney fees and costs solely on the ground that it must be reversed if the judgment or prejudgment interest award is reversed.because we affirm the judgment and award of prejudgment interest,we affirm the award of fees and costs as well.we dismiss tjeg protective as moot.we also deny ratcliff january,motion to strike new contention in reply brief as moot.
although both paragraph of the contract and coleman speak of substantial changes to the contract,the term necessarily has different meanings in the two contexts.under paragraph,a substantial change in the scope of work is a basis for renegotiating the basic services fee
