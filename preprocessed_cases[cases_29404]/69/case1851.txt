statement of the facts and case 
respondent hal is the guardian and father of minor hal was appointed guardian of and his brother derek,who is now an adult,in.
appellant james valentine is the suspended trustee of a life insurance trust hereinafter referred to as the kmp trust established by and derek mother,kelsey,to provide for the health,maintenance,education,travel,and welfare,and general welfare,of the boys at the time of her death.kelsey died in a plane crash on october.
upon kelsey death in,hal became the single guardian of the boys.valentine served as trustee of the kmp trust,and provided support for the boys pursuant to the provisions of the trust.in may,the trust was funded with from the proceeds of kelsey life insurance policy.valentine initially transferred to guardianship account on may,and continued to disperse per month to the account until the time he was suspended as trustee in march.
in january,hal filed his third account and report of guardian and petition for attorney fees that included the period from october to october.valentine filed objections to the third account in march,and filed amended objections in april.hal filed a reply to the objections in june,asserting that the objections were without merit and that pursuant to probate code,section valentine had no standing to assert his objections.
in august,the court ruled that valentine was an interested party under probate code,section,and permitted valentine to proceed to trial on the objections.the court also appointed an attorney to represent the interests of prior to trial in december,valentine filed supplemental objections.
during trial,attorney for,deborah malkin,represented to the court that she was satisfied with hal expenditures as stated in the third account.after valentine case in chief,the court granted hal motion for judgment under code of civil procedure section.hal then moved for attorney fees and costs under probate code section,which provides compensation if the court determines objections are brought in bad faith.

discussion 
appeal in case no.and approval of third account 
valentine asserts the trial court erred in granting hal motion for judgment pursuant to code of civil procedure section.valentine also asserts the court erred in denying his objections to the third accounting.
a fundamental rule of appellate review is that a judgment or order of the lower court is presumed correct.all intendments and presumptions are indulged to support it on matters as to which the record is silent,and error must be affirmatively shown.denham superior court cal d,conservatorship of rand th,d.the party challenging the order has the burden to show that the court abused its discretion or that the order was not supported by substantial evidence.denham superior court,supra,cal d at,estate of leslie cal d.
applicability of code of civil procedure section 
initially,valentine argues the court improperly granted judgment in favor of hal at the close of valentine case in chief,because code of civil procedure section is inapplicable in probate proceedings such as the instant case.the basis of valentine argument appears to be that the as guardian,hal had the burden of proof as to the third accounting,and therefore,judgment at the close of valentine case in chief as to the objections was improper.
valentine provides no authority for the proposition that code of civil procedure section does not apply to probate proceedings.indeed,there are cases in which courts have granted judgment pursuant to code of civil procedure section in probate actions.see,in re estate of truckenmiller d.
moreover,valentine argument that judgment was improper in this case because hal had the burden of proof regarding the third accounting is equally specious.by analogy to conservatorship proceedings,guardianship accountings require the same procedure for filings and objections see,conservatorship provisions stating requirements for accountings and objections,guardianship provisions stating requirements for accountings and objections.in conservatorship proceedings,the burden of proof in any hearing on objections is on the objector.in re conservatorship of hume th,d.
because the statutory mechanism for conservatorship accountings and objections is the essentially the same as that for guardianship accountings and objections,the same principles as stated in hume regarding the burden of proof apply.here,as objector at the trial,valentine had the burden of proof regarding his objections.the court having determined that valentine failed that burden,acted entirely within its discretion when it entered judgment in favor of hal at the conclusion of valentine case in chief pursuant to code of civil procedure section.
objections asserted at trial 
on appeal,valentine asserts the court erred in its ruling on his objections to the third account.specifically,valentine asserts the court erred as to his objections that hal improperly used guardianship funds for the minor support,that the shared equity agreement between hal and the minor was unfair to the minor,and that the wrongful death proceeds from the death of the minor mother were mishandled.
with regard to the use of the guardianship funds,the basis of valentine objection is his argument that hal,as the minor father,should have exhausted his own personal funds before he was permitted to use the funds in the kmp trust for the care and maintenance of the minor.
in the trial court and on appeal,valentine cites armstrong armstrong cal d,for the proposition that a minor property held in trust may not be used for his support when a living parent has the obligation to provide for the minor basic support needs.valentine asserts the holding in armstrong requires that hal,as the minor father in this case,exhaust his own personal resources to provide for the minor maintenance before dipping into the assets of the trust.
the problem with valentine position is that while the armstrong case does state that a parent must provide for the needs of his or her minor child regardless of the child property,there is an exception to this rule when there is trust and the express purpose of the trust in question is contribution to the support and maintenance of the child.armstrong armstrong,supra,cal d at.here,the kmp trust was specifically created by the minor mother for the health,maintenance,education,travel,and welfare,and general welfare of the minor.moreover,the court found that hal was using his own funds to support the minor in addition to the funds provided by the trust.as such,we find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in overruling valentine objection to hal use of the trust funds.
in addition to the use of the guardianship funds,valentine also asserts the court erred in overruling his objection to the shared equity agreement between hal and the minor.however,the shared equity agreement was approved as part of the second account,and therefore,valentine objection in the instant case was untimely.such as action is an improper attempt by valentine to prio
