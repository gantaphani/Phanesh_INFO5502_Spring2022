medical device inventor ronald russo brought this lawsuit against ballard medical products contending that the company misappropriated his trade secret and breached the parties confidentiality agreement by incorporating certain of his innovations into one of its popular medical devices without his consent.after a trial,a jury found for russo and awarded him million in damages.on appeal,ballard argues primarily that russo state law claims are preempted by federal patent law.russo,submitting that the district court erred in declining to add,interest to his award.finding none of the parties various arguments for reversal persuasive,we affirm.
in ballard introduced its flagship product,the trach care catheter,a catheter designed to remove debris from endotracheal ventilator tubes without having to disconnect patients from the ventilators on which they depend for oxygen before the trach care,medical professionals relied on an process,in which they had to disconnect the patient from the ventilator,insert a catheter into the patient airway to suction accumulated mucus,and then remove the catheter before reconnecting the process that not only involved temporarily removing the patient from the ventilator,but also a risk of infection from the cleaning process.
russo is an independent medical device designer.in,ballard retained russo in a consulting role with the aim of improving various aspects of its trach care catheter.after completing this project,russo continued working independently on tracheal suction devices,while ballard also worked on its own to improve its product.in particular,ballard focused on enhancing the useful life span of its catheter.as its name implies,the trach care is approved by the united states food and drug administration fda for only hours continuous use.after that period,even ballard design is insufficient to prevent bacteria from developing to the point of unduly risking patient infection.
in,after several failed attempts to extend the life span of the trach care,ballard again sought russo help.russo agreed and,building on his independent work,he devised various improvements to the trach care,all memorialized in a series of drawings and a prototype.these improvements included a vented duckbill valve that isolated the of the catheter assembly from the catheter cleaning innovation that allowed mucus to be more effectively cleaned from the catheter in the cleaning chamber while minimizing back flow to the patient.russo improvements also included an additional wiper seal to wipe the catheter clean,which allowed the tip of the catheter to be withdrawn past the wiper seal into the cleaning chamber,leaving secretions in the cleaning chamber.in combination,russo modifications created a more effective method for cleaning ballard catheter,which he expected would improve the device safety and,consequently,its useful life span.
in early,russo agreed to meet with ballard to discuss his improvements,but conditioned any meeting on the parties executing a confidential disclosure agreement cda.ballard assented to this condition,sending russo a proposed cda for his consideration.russo signed the document and,in april,the parties met in new york city to discuss russo research.in preparation for the meeting,but after signing the cda,russo forwarded a binder of materials to ballard disclosing his innovations,and he brought additional drawings and a prototype to the meeting itself.during the course of the conference,russo gave the drawings to ballard engineers,showed them the prototype,explained his various improvements,and answered a million questions.at.
before the meeting concluded,ballard asked russo how much it would cost to license his innovations.russo replied with a request for,plus a annual royalty with a guaranteed annual minimum payment of,but the parties concluded the meeting without reaching any agreement on terms.over the next few months,the parties continued to negotiate,during which time russo dropped his request to a annual royalty with a guaranteed annual minimum.eventually,ballard agreed to a royalty rate,but still would not acquiesce to an annual minimum payment and,in august,negotiations ended without a meeting of the minds.
shortly after the parties broke off negotiations,russo asked ballard general counsel,paul hess,to return the confidential materials he had shared with ballard pursuant to the cda.hess promised that he would secure the return of russo materials,but russo received nothing.when russo brought this to hess attention and renewed his request in september,hess represented that ballard was unable to locate russo materials.
unknown to russo at the time,ballard made use of his work to secure two patents and introduce a new product to market.in september,ballard submitted a patent application embodying the innovations russo disclosed at the parties new york meeting though that application was denied,the patent and trademark office subsequently issued ballard two patents based on its application,patent the patent and the patent.both contained the essential innovations embodied in russo prototype and drawings.the only difference between russo work and ballard patents was the substitution of a flap valve for a duckbill the patent allowed for either kind of valve to be used.otherwise,the designs were exactly the same as the ones russo proposed.id.at.ballard patents allowed it to introduce a new device,the trach care,which the company began selling in.as its name suggests,trach care is approved by the fda for hours continuous use.at the heart of the product are russo designs ensuring a superior cleaning process,delaying the build up of potentially infectious bacteria,and thus allowing ballard product to be safely employed for an extended period.
believing that ballard misappropriated his trade secret and violated the parties cda,russo filed suit in rhode island superior court.ballard removed the action to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction and,pursuant to a forum selection clause in the cda,the case was transferred to the district of utah.at the trial that followed,the district court submitted two claims to the jury misappropriation of russo trade secret,and breach of contract,the cda.both claims turned on russo allegation that,in derogation of the cda,ballard misappropriated his drawings and prototype by using them in its trach care product.for his trade secret claim,russo sought unjust enrichment damages,and asserted that those damages were properly measured by the net profit the company expected to secure from its trach care product over the life of the and patents.without his innovations,russo claimed,ballard simply could not have created its new product and would have been forced to continue offering only its product.russo expert estimated the present value of ballard expected net profits from the trach care product over the life of its patents to be million.russo also sought compensatory damages for his actual loss under the breach of contract claim.russo argued that,but for ballard breach,the parties would have agreed on at least a royalty rate and a minimum annual payment.using several conservative assumptions,russo expert testified that this would have amounted to royalty payments over the life of ballard patents with a net present value of at least million.
for its part,ballard contended that russo never,at the new york city meeting or otherwise,disclosed any design containing the innovations found in ballard trach care product.instead,ballard submitted,its engineers independently developed all of the innovations embodied in its product.additionally,ballard argued that russo state tort claims were preempted by federal patent law.ballard further challenged russo damages evidence and presented its own damages expert who opined that,even if ballard did misappropriate russo innovations,his losses were much smaller than he claimed.
ultimately,the jury found in favor of russo,awarding him million in unjust enrichment damages for his trade secret misappropriation claim and million in damages for his breach of contract claim.the district court entered judgment for russo in the amount of million and denied all of the parties various motions.ballard now appeals,asking us to hold russo suit preempted by federal patent law and,alternatively,seeking to overturn the jury damage awards on a variety of other grounds.for his part,russo the district court denial of,interest.
before reaching the merits of the parties appeals,we must pause to address a jurisdictional question.russo asserts that our jurisdiction arises under,and that the district court had jurisdiction over this dispute based on diversity of citizenship,pursuant to.ballard concurs in this analysis,but identifies a potential wrinkle.ballard draws our attention to the fact that the federal circuit has exclusive jurisdiction pursuant to over appeals from district court judgments predicated on,a provision that gives the district court original jurisdiction over any civil action arising under any act of congress relating to patents,plant variety protection,copyrights and trademarks.id.ballard assures us that neither of these provisions pertains to this case but nonetheless flags them for our independent consideration because,it says,they would,if applicable,divest us of subject matter jurisdiction over this dispute.
it is our obligation always to be certain of our subject matter jurisdiction.see,adams reliance standard life ins,cir.in fulfilling our obligation in this case,we are guided by the supreme court instruction that the federal circuit exclusive jurisdiction arises under sections and if,but only if,federal patent law creates the cause of action or the plaintiff right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal patent law,in that patent law is a necessary element of one of the claims.christianson colt indus.operating,d.in answering this question,we are told to look only to the face of the plaintiff complaint,not the manner in which the case was tried if on the face of a complaint there are reasons completely unrelated to the provisions and purposes of the patent laws why the plaintiff may or may not be entitled to the relief it seeks,then the claim does not arise under those laws.id.at.internal citation,quotation marks,and brackets omitted.thus,a claim supported by alternative theories in the complaint may not form the basis for a jurisdiction unless patent law is essential to each of those theories.id.internal citations,quotation marks,and brackets omitted.see also at t integrated network.
russo claims for relief do not meet this restrictive test.neither of his two state law claims for relief was created by federal patent law.and neither necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal patent law.christianson,at.in his trade secret claim,russo asserts that he disclosed a trade secret to ballard,that ballard misappropriated that secret by using it to develop the trach care product without his knowledge or consent,and that ballard actions harmed him.under utah trade secret statute,this is all russo had to prove to prevail.see,et.to be sure,ballard patents are mentioned in russo complaint as evidence showing how ballard misappropriated his designs.but the fact that patents may be used as evidence in aid of a trade secret claim is not the same thing as raising a substantial or really,any question of federal patent law.see uroplasty,advanced uroscience,trade secret complaint does not implicate exclusive federal circuit jurisdiction because,while plaintiff may use defendant patent to show misappropriation,and the patent thus may be evidence in support of plaintiff misappropriation allegations the mere presence of the patent does not create a substantial issue of patent law.
what holds true for russo trade secret claim also holds true for his breach of contract claim.to secure damages for the latter claim,russo had to show only that he disclosed materials to ballard pursuant to the cda,that ballard then disclosed those materials to others,that russo was harmed by this act and suffered damages,and that this result was reasonably foreseeable to ballard.here,again,the fact that ballard used russo ideas to secure patents is surely relevant evidence suggesting a breach occurred,but it does not implicate any question of federal patent law.see id.discussing breach of contract claim as well as trade secret misappropriation claim valves,dray,when breach of contract claim requires a showing that defendant infringed patents,patent law is a necessary element of the breach of contract claim.
with our jurisdiction confirmed,we turn to the merits of ballard appeal.first and primarily,the company asserts that,while the nature of the claims presented in russo complaint did not necessarily implicate patent law and thus invest the federal circuit with exclusive jurisdiction,the case russo actually presented at trial was irreconcilable with federal patent law and so preempted by it.because ballard preemption in a variety of ways before the district court,including by motions for summary judgment,directed verdict,and judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,a new trial is a legal argument,we review it de novo we begin by outlining the principles that control our preemption analysis,and then turn to assess their application in russo case.
the supremacy clause of the constitution provides that federal law trumps,or preempts,contrary state laws.const.art.vi,cl.while a seemingly simple rule,preemption takes a number of guises,known variously as explicit,field,and conflict preemption.the first two of these species of preemption do not bear on our current problem.federal patent law does not explicitly preempt state trade secret laws.see.neither has congress evinced an intent to occupy exclusively the entire intellectual property field associated with inventions.kewanee oil bicron,d.our only concern in this case is thus narrowed to conflict preemption.conflict preemption arises when state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress,as expressed in this case in the patent act.id.at.citations omitted.when it comes to assessing this question,two particular doctrinal strands bear upon our analysis,one illustrated by kewanee oil,the other by bonito boats,thunder craft boats,d.
in kewanee oil,the supreme court confronted the question whether the patent act preempted a claim for violation of ohio trade secret law,a law substantively identical for our purposes to the utah trade secret statute under which russo sought relief in this case.at the outset,the court readily acknowledged that good arguments could be mustered for preempting traditional state trade secret claims even so,the court ultimately took the view that such claims do not fatally conflict with federal patent law.kewanee oil,at.see also aronson quick point pencil,d same holding with respect to contract claims for breach of a royalty agreement.
in reaching its conclusion,the kewanee oil court stressed that traditional state trade secret laws and federal patent law usually serve complementary,not conflicting,purposes.both create incentives to invention,after all,and plainly i n this respect the two systems are not and never would be in conflict.at.trade secret serves this shared purpose,moreover,in arenas where patent law does not reach,thus mitigating the potential for conflict between the two systems of law.id.at.trade secret laws operate only to protect those ideas held in secret,while patent law affords the exclusive means of protecting the right to an invention only after it is disclosed to the public.id.similarly,trade secret law applies to innovations that may not ever be amenable to patent,given patent law strict requirements of novelty,utility,and.id.the kewanee oil court also emphasized the social costs associated with preempting state trade secret laws.without trade secret protection,the court observed,the holders of trade secrets would be discouraged from sharing their ideas with potential manufacturers who,in such a regime,could not be bound to pay a license fee or protect any secret.id.at.such a rule of law would serve to encourage the hoard ing rather than the disseminat ion of knowledge,requiring trade secret holders to engage in the and economically wasteful enterprise of constructing duplicative manufacturing and marketing mechanisms to get their ideas to market.id.at.such inefficiencies would deter the development and dissemination of scientific and technological innovations,causing society,as a whole,to suffer,id.at,a result,the court emphasized,that can not be justified by reference to any policy that the federal patent law seeks to advance,id.at.indeed,if anything,such a regime would be inimical to patent law primary purpose,embodied in our constitution,of promot ing the progress of science and the useful arts.const.art.i,cl.
at the same time,the kewanee oil court was not blind to costs and considerations on the other side of the ledger.though not all trade secrets are amenable to patent,many are,and the potential for conflict between state and federal law is,for these secrets,at its peak.id.at.federal law expresses a strong interest in seeing that patentable innovations do not stay bottled up in secret but are instead shared with the public in order to promote social progress.this interest is most obviously embodied in patent law bargain of providing inventors with many years of monopoly rents in return for the public opportunity to use and enjoy their ideas.id.but even for this class of trade amenable to patent and thus for which there is a strong interest in their public court ultimately declined to preempt traditional state trade secret laws.it did so reasoning that,even here,trade secret laws pose no reasonable risk of deterring inventors with patentable ideas from sharing their work with the world through the patent process.id.trade secret laws,after all,provide far weaker protection than patent law in critical respects.id.at.while proof of inventorship under patent law operates against the world,forbidding any use of the invention for whatever purpose for a significant length of time,and affording monopoly rents during that period,trade secret laws do nothing to foreclose others from discovering the trade secret holder idea either independently or by means of reverse engineering and exploiting it for profit publicly.id.at.so,w here patent law acts as a barrier,trade secret law functions relatively as a sieve,and a rational inventor would have every reason to choose the barrier over the sieve.id.at.of course,there is the possibility that the occasional rare inventor will choose trade secret protection over patent protection,even where a patent is available.id.but this,the court held,is no cause for serious concern.patent law objective of encouraging scientific and technological progress is not likely to be significantly impeded because,i f something is to be discovered at all very likely it will be discovered by more than one person.id.as the court put it,i f watson and crick had not discovered the structure of dna it is likely that linus pauling would have made the discovery soon.id.at.so,e ven were an inventor to keep his discovery completely to himself,something that neither the patent nor trade secret laws forbid,there is a high probability that it will be soon independently developed.id.at.
under the arrangement contemplated by the court in kewanee oil,then,inventors have a choice.they may keep their ideas secret with the protection of state law but run the risk of potential independent discovery by others.or they may disclose their ideas and enjoy the ensuing legal monopoly afforded by federal patent law.see bonito boats,at.i t is a condition upon the inventor right to a patent that he shall not exploit his discovery competitively after it is ready for patenting he must content himself with either secrecy or legal monopoly.quoting metallizing eng g kenyon bearing auto parts,cir.hand,cert denied.
to say that traditional trade secret claims can peacefully coexist with patent law,however,is not to say that states may freely regulate the dissemination of potentially patentable innovations.far from it.the court in kewanee oil cautioned that,if a state,through a system of protection,were to cause a substantial risk that holders of patentable inventions would not seek patents,but rather would rely on the state protection,we would be compelled to hold that such a system could not constitutionally continue to exist.at.this warning anticipated and was amplified by the court holding fifteen years later in bonito boats.
in bonito boats,the court faced a florida statute that made it unlawful for any person to use the direct molding process to duplicate for the purpose of sale any manufactured vessel hull or component part of a vessel made by another without the written permission of that other person.at.in essence,the florida law afforded vessel hull designers who had already made their designs publicly known by manufacturing and selling boats embodying their designs with protections different from,and more extensive than,federal patent law.plainly,florida sought to protect its highly prized boat design industry from what it considered to be undesirable competition.
the court had no difficulty holding florida statute preempted by federal patent law,explaining that states may not offer protection s to publicly disclosed ideas because the ultimate goal of public disclosure and use which is the centerpiece of federal patent policy is contravened by a state law that substantially interferes with the enjoyment of an unpatented utilitarian or design conception which has been freely disclosed by its author to the public at large.id.at.simply put,once an idea is in the public domain,federal patent law controls states may not further insulate their inventors from or expose them to competition.still,the court in bonito boats took pains to reaffirm kewanee oil,and underscore the compatibility of its holdings.the court explained that,so long as the veil of secrecy continues to shroud an idea,it remains private property amenable to state trade secret laws.id.at.federal law requires only,but significantly,that,once that veil is lifted,an inventor must choose between the protection of a federal patent or the dedication of his idea to the public at large,by placing it in the public domain.id.
with this guidance in hand,we turn to the specifics of ballard preemption argument,which itself divides into two parts.first,ballard submits that the liability case russo tried was irreconcilable with the presumption of inventorship arising from ballard patents.appellant br.at.second,even if russo liability case is consistent with federal patent law,ballard argues that the damages he sought are not.in ballard view,the district court intruded on ballard patents by instructing the jury to award,or allowing russo to seek and obtain,the full value of ballard invention per se,rather than the value of his misappropriated trade secret.we address each of these preemption claims in turn.
ballard complains that,at trial,russo cast himself as the true inventor of the trach care,and that any question of inventorship must be established under federal patent law standards.in ballard words,russo claims depended upon establishing that he,and not ballard engineers,was the true inventor of the subject matter of ballard patents.appellant br.at.and any such claim,ballard submits,is irreconcilable with ballard patents.id.at.
we do not agree.as was true of his complaint,see supra part ii,no question of federal patent law was raised by russo trial.he did not seek to be proclaimed the inventor of ballard patents,or seek any of the rights associated with inventorship of a patent,right to exclude the public from exploiting the ideas embodied in those patents.instead,like any other plaintiff proceeding under traditional trade secret laws,russo simply sought to establish that he had a valid trade secret that he disclosed his secret to ballard under terms precluding the company from making use of the secret without his consent that ballard violated that trust and that ballard conduct caused him harm.indeed,the court instructions to the jury on the elements necessary to find liability tracked precisely the elements of utah trade secret law,and did not call upon the jury to decide any question falling within patent domain.compare jury inst.with,et.
exactly the same can be said of russo cda claim.at trial,russo sought simply to establish,consistent with entirely unremarkable breach of contract jury instructions,that ballard breached the terms of its written promise to maintain russo confidences.the jury in this case was asked to decide whether ballard disclosed russo secret,as he alleged,by some improper means and in violation of the parties agreement,or whether the company discovered his idea independently by fair and honest means,a question kewanee oil has held may be tried under state law without running afoul of federal patent law.at.
to be sure,russo pointed at trial,precisely as he did in his complaint,to ballard patents as evidence of how ballard misappropriated his secret and breached the cda.but this bare fact does not necessarily mean that his trial raised any question of federal patent law,as we have already noted,see supra part ii,let alone suggest that russo sought rights associated with being a patent inventor.as our sister circuit explained in the face of an identical challenge,t he fact that the defendant improperly secured a patent and used this patent to obtain incremental profits can be properly used as evidence to show misappropriation of a trade secret and the extent of the plaintiff resulting damages without suggesting that t he right involved here is at all.of colorado,american cyanamid.were the law otherwise,it would be incongruous indeed.any defendant could and would have a significant incentive to insulate itself from a trade secret misappropriation claim simply by patenting the stolen idea.and kewanee oil holding that trade secret and patent law can coexist would be significantly impaired because patent law would preempt many if not most trade secret claims.
ballard arguments from precedent undermine,rather than bolster,its cause.the company relies heavily on university of colorado foundation american cyanamid,in asserting that federal inventorship standards should have been used to determine if russo was entitled to his relief.in american cyanamid,two university of colorado research physicians helped american cyanamid reformulate a prenatal supplement,sharing a confidential manuscript with the company.without the doctors knowledge,however,the company eventually patented a new formula using their research.the doctors and the university sued alleging,among other things,that the company wrongfully used its confidential materials,failed to list them as inventors on the patent,and failed to disclose the patent application to them.in a holding ballard highlights,the federal circuit held that some of the claims implicated the question of inventorship and the right to exclude the public from using their invention and,accordingly,had to be decided under federal,not state,law.id.at.
but this tells only half the story.while some of the doctors claims involved patent law issues that had to be decided under federal law,the federal circuit went on to hold that not every claim brought by the doctors did so,explaining that federal patent law does not preempt state law claims for unjust enrichment for wrongful use of the doctors research results.id.at.ballard also neglects to mention that,after the case was remanded and eventually returned to it,the federal circuit reaffirmed this point,holding that the doctors unjust enrichment claim was properly adjudicated under state law.as our sister circuit explained,the doctors unjust enrichment claim is not at all,but springs from cyanamid alleged wrongful use of the doctors research results t he doctors claim of unjust enrichment is a legal claim to remedy the breach of contract implied in law for disclosure of their confidential manuscript in exchange for a promise not to disseminate the idea without the doctors consent.american cyanamid,at.the line drawn by the federal circuit in american cyanamid is thus the very same line we have drawn here,and the same one drawn by the supreme court in kewanee oil and bonito boats,between those claims,like russo,that arise from the misappropriation of a trade secret,which generally may be tried under state law,and those that seek to exclude others from employing a publicly disclosed idea,which must be tried under federal patent law 
liability aside,ballard submits that the district court jury instructions wrongly authorized the jury to give russo the full benefit of its trach care product per se.as ballard puts it,the district court should have limited russo recovery to damages appropriate to misappropriation of a trade secret,but i nstead,the court allowed the jury to award russo damages for the value of the invention per se.appellant br.at.the district court award,ballard complains,represents a value protected exclusively by patent law,and,to avoid any interference with patent law,the court should have limited russo damages to the incremental profits derived from use of his idea,rather than total profits from selling a product incorporating that idea.id.at.alternatively,ballard submits that,even if the district court correctly instructed the jury that russo was entitled only to the incremental value his trade secret added to ballard product,russo tried his case in a way that allowed him to evade the district court instructions and recoup the full value of ballard patents per se.id.at.as a matter of fact,ballard contends,russo asked the jury to award,and the jury did award,russo damages for the value of the invention per se.id.at.
we do not necessarily disagree with the premise undergirding ballard arguments.it may be that a state law claim automatically or per se guaranteeing a plaintiff the full value of a defendant patents could interfere with federal patent law.but that simply is not the sort of claim we have before us.in any trade secret or breach of a cda trial,a properly instructed jury may award the plaintiff only those damages it has suffered,or the amount the defendant has been enriched,by virtue of the defendant misconduct.by dint of this required causal link between the defendant misconduct and the plaintiff recovery,the plaintiff is precluded from obtaining any earnings the defendant received,or value it derived,from other causal factors,including its own innovative work.recognizing just these points,the district court in this case never required or permitted russo to recover the value of ballard product or patents per se.instead,in describing the scope of russo permissible damages in connection with his trade secret claim,the court instructed the jury to award only those damages caused by ballard violation of utah trade secret law damages for misappropriation of a trade secret may include the actual loss to russo caused by the misappropriation.but damages may also include any unjust enrichment flowing to the party that misappropriated the trade secret.in this context,unjust enrichment is defined as the reasonable value of the benefit that the party who misappropriated the trade secret has gained from disclosing or using the trade secret.jury inst.similarly,the court instructed that damages for breach of the cda had to be limited to those that ballard had reason to foresee,at the time the contract was made,as a probable result of that contract.jury inst.
with respect to both claims,then,the district court properly informed the jury that russo could recoup only amounts causally attributable to ballard misconduct,not to other factors,including ballard own hard work.in this way,our case again parallels american cyanamid,where the federal circuit held that the plaintiffs could and did,without impinging on federal patent law interests,recoup the incremental profits earned by the defendant company that were attributable to its misconduct when it improperly secured a patent using the plaintiffs confidential manuscript.at.we concur,and so did the district court,which recognized just these points and correctly instructed the jury to abide them in this case 
to be sure,russo suggested that ballard was able to extend the useful life of its product,and thus offer the trach care,only because of its exploitation of his trade secret.that is,in russo view,all of ballard net profits on its trach care were causally attributable to its misappropriation of his ideas rather than any other source.but in pursuing this line of argument,russo did not suggest that a trade secret violation automatically and per se entitled him to the full value of the patents ballard later secured.rather,russo argued that,on the facts of this particular case,the evidence showed the incremental value his trade secret added to ballard was to transform the useful life span of its trach care product from to hours.ballard cites no authority suggesting that this is an impermissible theory under trade secret law,or that it somehow impermissibly trenches on federal patent law,and we are aware of none.see generally c f packing,ibp,the jury was free to decide whether defendant misappropriation was responsible for of its profits on a particular product,as plaintiff claimed the evidence suggested,or,as defendant claimed.of course,ballard contests whether sufficient evidence exists in the trial record from which a reasonable jury could find that the incremental value added by russo accounts for the full difference between ballard trach care and products,and we recognize the viability of this argument and take it up in earnest shortly,see infra part iv.but,for our current purposes,the dispositive point is that ballard has identified no legal impediment in patent law to russo right to recover the full incremental value added by his misappropriated trade secret,whatever that may be,and in these circumstances we are unable to reverse the jury award 
as we have foreshadowed,ballard legal arguments bleed into a factual one,with the company next contending that the million in damages the jury awarded exceeded what the record evidence could support.we may,of course,reverse a jury award for lack of a sufficient evidentiary basis when,but only when,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,the amount of damages awarded is clearly erroneous,or there is no evidence to support it.hudson smith,cir bitler smith,cir.
those circumstances do not pertain here.with respect to the jury million unjust enrichment award,the parties presented competing evidence about the incremental value added by russo contributions to ballard trach care product.russo took the position and presented evidence suggesting that the only material difference between ballard trach care and products stemmed from its exploitation of his trade secrets accordingly,in his view,he was entitled to the present value of ballard expected net profits on its trach care product,or million.critically,ballard does not now contest the admission of russo evidence suggesting that he was solely responsible for the innovations contained in ballard trach care product instead,it points us to,and asks us to credit,its contrary evidence suggesting that russo contributions added nothing,or very little of value,to its independent work.as is often the case,the jury found the truth to lie somewhere in between the extremes suggested by the evidence received at trial,returning an award that represented of the damages russo sought.when the damages awarded by the jury fall within the range permitted by the evidence admitted at trial and whose admission is unchallenged on appeal,we may not second guess the award.see c f packing,at in setting damages,the jury function is to weigh contradictory evidence,to judge the credibility of the witnesses,and to resolve factual disputes.hudson,at bitler,at.
much the same holds true for russo breach of contract claim.ballard stresses that russo own expert estimated that the royalty the parties discussed would yield million over the life of ballard patents,not the million awarded by the jury.but russo expert testified that his million estimate was conservative because,among other things,it employed a annual sales growth figure when ballard achieved a growth rate in the period to and a growth rate in the period to.at.in addition,the expert calculated royalties only through the life of the patent because after such time,anyone could access the technology,even though he testified such products often have a very long life.id.at.russo expert testified that modest changes in any of the assumptions he employed would yield a significantly greater award.ballard does not contest that the evidence could support changes in the expert assumptions,or that such changes supported by the evidence could yield damages in excess of million.accordingly,we again are in no position to say that the jury award was clearly erroneous,or that there is no evidence to support it.hudson,at.
while we have addressed ballard central arguments,it presents a flurry of additional,but significantly less developed arguments for overturning the jury damages award.we address the most colorable of these claims here,but find none persuasive.
first,ballard asserts that russo unjust enrichment and royalty damages should be limited to,and not extend beyond,the contract period discussed in the cda.this argument,however,depends on a misconstruction of the cda and a selective view of the evidence.while the cda indicated that ballard obligations to keep russo secrets only extended for two years,it imposed no limit on the damages russo could seek in the event ballard chose to breach the agreement.to be sure,ballard argues that it was free to make use of the information disclosed by russo after the cda expired.but it could do so lawfully only if neither russo nor anyone else secured patents covering russo innovations during the cda term.ballard strains to suggest that the evidence at trial,as a matter of law,demonstrates that this surely would have been the case.but a strain it is.ballard points only to the fact that russo had not patented or licensed his ideas to another company by the time of its breach.meanwhile,competing record evidence shows that russo was no stranger to the patent process,having patented other ideas previously,and thus that he was presumably able to patent his latest innovations,too.in fact,russo testified that the only reason he had not yet incurred the expense of patenting his catheter improvement ideas was because of the parties confidentiality agreement protecting against ballard use of his ideas.russo further testified that he was still anticipating that ballard demonstrated interest in his ideas would lead it,sooner or later,to license them before the cda expired.at see also id.ballard was the largest manufacturer of closed trach suction systems in the world i knew what i had.they already offered me a substantial amount of money,and i felt that sooner or later they would come back to me.plainly,the jury was free to conclude on the basis of these facts that russo had a valid reason for waiting to patent his idea and that,in the event the parties negotiations did not yield a licensing agreement within two years,he was able and ready to secure appropriate patents that would have foreclosed ballard use of his ideas without his consent.
second,ballard argues that its misappropriation of russo trade secrets at most only gave the company a head start to a result it would have eventually achieved on its own,and that the district court should have given its proffered jury instruction underscoring this point.under the head start or lead time rule,adopted in some jurisdictions,a trade secret defendant damages may be limited to the time the defendant saved in getting a product to market by virtue of its misappropriation.see uniform trade secrets act cmts.ballard has failed to point us to a single utah case adopting the head start rule,but even this deficiency and assuming utah embraces the rule,we discern no reversible error in the district court jury instructions.the jury was instructed that unjust enrichment is defined as the reasonable value of the benefit that the party who misappropriated the trade secret has gained from disclosing or using the trade secret,and that it may only award damages for a time period equal to the amount of time you find that russo trade secret would be entitled to protection,plus any additional period,if any,that you find that
