by means of this interlocutory appeal,the commonwealth of puerto rico attempts to exploit the supreme court recent redefinition of the calculus of federalism.see,rosie swift,cir noting that the court has tilt ed the scales more and more toward states rights.the commonwealth core contention is that the civil rights act fails validly to abrogate the states eleventh amendment immunity insofar as the act authorizes the imposition of compensatory damages in title vii actions against the states and against puerto rico,which is considered the functional equivalent of a state for eleventh amendment purposes.this raises an interesting question but,as presently postured,one that falls beyond our purview.
the stumbling block is the precept that n o matter how tantalizing a problem may be,a federal appellate court can not scratch intellectual itches unless it has jurisdiction to reach them.director,owcp bath iron works,cir.in this instance,the commonwealth interlocutory appeal rests not on a denial of an asserted immunity from suit,but,rather,on a denial of an asserted immunity from the imposition of a certain type of money damages.so constructed,the appeal does not satisfy the requirements of the collateral order doctrine,and,thus,does not come within the encincture of our appellate jurisdiction.we therefore dismiss the appeal,leaving the substantive issue raised by the commonwealth to await review.
setting the stage 
we glean the necessary facts from the plaintiff complaint.see lachapelle berkshire life ins,cir.
the commonwealth hired tom√°s aquino,a native of the dominican republic,on september.he worked in various capacities for the department of natural resources the department during the next fifteen years.at that point,he was unceremoniously ousted from his employment.
the plaintiff concluded that his firing resulted from national origin discrimination and filed an administrative complaint to that effect with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.the eeoc declined to pursue a investigation,instead issuing a right to sue letter.letter in hand,the plaintiff repaired to the federal district court and sued the commonwealth under title vii,to.his complaint alleged that he had been discharged on the basis of his national origin,see id.a,and prayed for reinstatement,back pay,marginal benefits,compensatory damages,and any other remedy in law or equity that might be available against the commonwealth 
the title vii claim brought the plaintiff face to face with the eleventh amendment,which provides that t he judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state,or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.const.amend.xi.this provision has been authoritatively interpreted to safeguard states from suits brought in federal court by their own citizens as well as by citizens of other states.see,edelman jordan,d rosie,at.this immunity can,however,be waived or abrogated by congress under certain limited circumstances.see college sav.bank.prepaid postsecondary educ.expense,d ramirez fire,cir.
despite its unique commonwealth status,puerto rico is treated for many juridical purposes as a state.the eleventh amendment is included in this compendium and,thus,puerto rico is entitled to a full measure of eleventh amendment immunity.see,jusino mercado comm.of puerto rico,cir.
hoisting this banner,the commonwealth moved to dismiss the plaintiff complaint on the ground that the eleventh amendment pretermitted it at least in part.to comprehend the commonwealth position,it is helpful to place title vii into an historical perspective.
congress originally enacted title vii as part of the civil rights act of,stat.in,it amended the law to include public employers,thus clearing the way for the prosecution of private rights of action against states that practiced discrimination.see equal employment opportunity act of,stat.this new right afforded only a limited set of remedies against a state defendant,mainly equitable in nature.congress expanded the roster of remedies available against the states in,adding compensatory damages to the mix.see civil rights act of,stat,codified at a.
in this proceeding,the commonwealth,with a bow toward the supreme court decision in fitzpatrick bitzer,d,concedes that title vii,in its incarnation,constituted a valid abrogation of state sovereign immunity.see appellant br.at.in line with this concession,it has not,insofar as can be gleaned from its papers,attempted to circumnavigate federal jurisdiction as to the remedies that were authorized when fitzpatrick was decided,the remedies originally provided by the amendments to title vii.these remedies included pecuniary damages,albeit in the form of back pay awards.see g see also fitzpatrick,at.holding that a back pay award is appropriate in a title vii case because congress had the power to abrogate state sovereign immunity under section five of the fourteenth amendment sea land serv.estado libre asociado,cir discussing fitzpatrick.
this concession perforce means that the plaintiff complaint has opened the eleventh amendment portal at least.the commonwealth,however,seeks to keep the gates from opening more widely.to that end,it directs its eleventh amendment challenge to the availability of the nascent compensatory damages remedy.it grounds this challenge on the premise that the civil rights act,which made that anodyne available against the states for the first time,fails to pass the congruence and proportionality test delineated by the supreme court recent eleventh amendment jurisprudence.see,city of boerne flores,d holding that legislation passed pursuant to section five of the fourteenth amendment must exhibit congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.all legislation enacted pursuant to section five of the fourteenth amendment must pass this test in order validly to abrogate states eleventh amendment immunity.bd.of trustees of of garrett,d.
invoking this doctrine and noting that congress relied upon section five in authorizing private rights of action against state defendants,the commonwealth asserts that congress acted outside its constitutional authority in purporting to abrogate state sovereign immunity when it amended title vii in and that,therefore,the eleventh amendment continues to protect the commonwealth from being forced to pay compensatory damages in title vii actions.unimpressed by the ingenuity of this assertion,the district court summarily denied the commonwealth motion to dismiss.this appeal ensued.
appellate jurisdiction 
even though the parties have assumed the existence of appellate jurisdiction,we enjoy no comparable luxury.because federal courts are powerless to act in the absence of subject matter jurisdiction,we have an unflagging obligation to notice jurisdictional defects and to pursue them on our own initiative.see ins.of ir.compagnie des bauxites de guinee,d united states horn,cir in re recticel foam,cir.after all,litigants can not confer subject matter jurisdiction on a federal court by indolence,oversight,acquiescence,or consent.horn,at.
the difficulty here is that the order appealed order denying the commonwealth motion to not end the case.it is,therefore,not final.that matters because federal appellate jurisdiction in most civil actions arises out of the power to review final decisions of the district courts of the united states.although this finality principle admits of certain exceptions,the majority of them are statutory in origin.see,id.a establishing special rules for jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals from orders involving injunctive relief,admiralty cases,and receivership matters.none of these statutory exceptions applies here.
to be sure,the supreme court has glossed the finality principle,admonishing that the general requirement of finality should not be applied mechanically.see cohen beneficial indus.loan.suggesting that courts should give the finality principle a practical rather than a technical construction.this pragmatic approach has spawned a few exceptions to the general rule.chief among these is the collateral order doctrine.because that doctrine affords the only arguable basis for appellate jurisdiction over this appeal,we chart its contours.
any effort to decipher the collateral order doctrine must begin with the supreme court seminal opinion in cohen.there,the court held that an order may be appealed immediately if it finally determine s claims of right separable from,and collateral to,rights asserted in the action,too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.id.at.following the cohen court lead,we have said that collaterality demands conformity to the following four requirements 
the order must involve an issue essentially unrelated to the merits of the main dispute,capable of review without disrupting the main trial a complete resolution of the issue,not one that is unfinished or inconclusive a right incapable of vindication on appeal from final judgment and an important and unsettled question of controlling law,not merely a question of the proper exercise of the trial court discretion.
united states sorren,cir.typically,all four of these we have termed separability,finality,urgency,and importance,recticel foam,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted must be satisfied in order to pave the way for the operation of the collateral order doctrine.see id.at.
a decade ago,the supreme court ruled that an interlocutory order denying a state claim of eleventh amendment immunity from suit may be appealed immediately by way of the collateral order doctrine.aqueduct sewer auth.metcalf eddy,d.the state claim that the eleventh amendment conferred upon it a total immunity from suit furnished the predicate for the court finding that the elements of the collateral order doctrine were present.see id.at.the court reasoned as follows.a trial court denial of such an immunity claim is final because it conclusively determines that the state can be subjected to the coercive processes of the federal courts.see id.at.it is urgent because the principal benefit conferred by the eleventh immunity from be lost as litigation proceeds past motion practice.id.third,the trial court order involves an important legal question the existence and extent of a fundamental constitutional protection.id.and,finally,that question has no bearing on the substantive merits of the case and,thus,is separable.id.
here,the parties assumption that we enjoy appellate jurisdiction apparently rests on the belief that puerto rico aqueduct is controlling.we are less sanguine.the precise question before the puerto rico aqueduct court was whether a district court order denying a claim by a state or a state entity to eleventh amendment immunity from suit in federal court may be appealed under the collateral order doctrine.id.at.emphasis supplied.the court affirmative answer to that question gives us appellate jurisdiction to in the absence of a final a state is amenable to suit in a federal court with respect to a title vii claim.see,okruhlik of,cir.but that issue is not before us.here,the commonwealth does not assert that it is immune from a title vii suit in federal court.its only developed argument is that it is immune from a particular strain of damages a remedy first made available by congress in.this fact distinguishes the case before us from puerto rico aqueduct.see mercer magnant,cir the foundation for the interlocutory appeal authorized by puerto rico aqueduct is the existence of a right not to be a litigant.it follows inexorably that accepting appellate jurisdiction over the instant appeal would require an extension of the holding announced in puerto rico aqueduct 
we turn,then,to the task of testing the viability of such an extension.this requires us to assess the commonwealth actual asseveration that subjecting it to a claim for compensatory damages in a title vii suit properly brought against it in a federal court is barred by the eleventh amendment and to decide,applying the cohen criteria,whether a pretrial rejection of that asseveration is subject to immediate appeal.
of the four requirements underpinning the collateral order doctrine,urgency is perhaps the most elemental.see recticel foam,at terming urgency the central focus of the cohen inquiry and perhaps the dispositive criterion boreri fiat,cir similar.here,our inquiry this criterion we have equated urgency with a showing of irreparable harm.see boreri,at.in this instance,the commonwealth has wholly failed to show that precluding an immediate appeal of the district court order will result in any irreparable harm.we explain briefly.
there is a critical difference between avoiding trial,on the one hand,and limiting exposure to liability,on the other hand.the denial of a colorable claim of immunity from suit can not effectively be reviewed after trial as the very object and purpose of the immunity is to protect the holder from the indignity of being subjected to the coercive processes of a judicial tribunal at the instance of a private party.see in re ayers.see also pullman constr,united states,cir characterizing the court decision in puerto rico aqueduct as protecting a governmental body right to avoid litigation in another sovereign courts.put another way,the ultimate justification for applying the collateral order doctrine in cases involving state sovereign immunity is the importance of ensuring that the states dignitary interests can be fully vindicated.aqueduct,at.
this concern is not implicated when the state interposes the eleventh amendment not as the basis for an immunity from suit,but,rather,as a defense to one of several remedies sought by a particular plaintiff.see thomas nakatani,cir explaining that the crucial difference between orders denying immunity that are immediately appealable and orders that are not is whether the action would proceed against the state whether or not it prevailed on appeal.that scenario reflects an interest which,unlike immunity from suit,is fully vindicable on appeal from final judgment.digital equip.desktop direct,d.that is a vastly different matter when a state has filed a pretrial motion invoking the eleventh amendment not to establish an immunity from suit but merely to afford itself a defense to a particular strain of damages,there is no reason to enswathe a denial of its motion within the collateral order doctrine.see cherry of.bd.of regents,cir declining to address claim that state agency is immune from a punitive damages award on interlocutory appeal because a claim of immunity to a certain class of damages is different in kind from a claim of immunity from suit chandler,cir finding no appellate jurisdiction over state claim that an award of punitive damages for a violation of title ii of the ada is barred by the eleventh amendment because the state concedes that it is subject to suit in federal court.
divorced from the question of whether a state can be sued at all in a federal court,the much narrower question of whether it can be held liable for a certain type of pecuniary damages is a question that adequately can be reviewed following trial.see cherry,at finding no risk of irretrievable loss and holding that a denial of a claimed immunity from punitive damages can be effectively reviewed after judgment see generally csx,kissimmee util,cir adjudging claims of sovereign immunity under florida state law not subject to interlocutory review because florida state immunity is immunity only from damages and not from suit itself aqueduct,at.suggesting that if the eleventh amendment conferred only a defense to liability,interlocutory review might not be warranted.in the ordinary case,a party who is subjected to an erroneous award of damages can remedy that error fully through an appeal.see swint chambers county comm n,d making clear that a potentially erroneous ruling on liability may be reviewed effectively on appeal from final judgment.
that tenet is fully operative here.if the plaintiff case goes forward and the commonwealth is found liable for compensatory damages,it will have an ample o
