plaintiff wanda bryant filed suit against defendant aiken regional medical centers,armc,alleging that armc had denied her a promotion on several occasions both because of her race and in retaliation for her complaints about discrimination in armc hiring policies.a jury found in her favor and awarded her backpay,compensatory damages for emotional distress,and punitive damages.the district court declined to overturn the jury verdict.we affirm the jury finding of liability and its award of backpay and compensatory damages for emotional distress,but we reverse the award of punitive damages.
wanda bryant,an woman,was trained as a surgical technician in the united states army reserves.she received her diploma in that field from the army in february.after completing her medical training,she took a job as a surgical technician at the medical college of georgia.she also worked twenty and thirty hours a a surgical technician for armc on an as needed basis.she continued working for armc until december,when she was called up to active duty in saudi arabia during the first gulf war.while in saudi arabia,she served as a surgical technician with the field hospital unit.
some time after returning from the persian gulf,bryant applied for a position as a surgical technician with armc.she was informed that there were no openings for surgical technicians,but was offered a position as a central services technician.the position of central services technician offered substantially less pay and required significantly less skill than the position of surgical technician.central service technicians are chiefly responsible for assembling trays of surgical equipment for upcoming procedures and cleaning instruments after surgery.surgical technicians,by contrast,act as direct assistants to doctors during surgical procedures in the operating rooms.while in saudi arabia with her reserve unit,for example,bryant worked as a surgical technician on surgeries involving everything from war casualties and burn victims to the delivery of newborn babies.after receiving armc offer,bryant agreed to take the position of central services technician in the hope that a surgical technician position would become available.
while employed at armc as a central services technician,bryant enrolled in an associate nursing degree program at the university of south.she later applied and was accepted in an armc nursing scholarship program,under which armc agreed to give her a thousand dollars per semester towards her university tuition.as part of this scholarship program,bryant agreed to work for armc for a year and a half in exchange for every year of tuition assistance she received from armc.she attended school while continuing to work as a central services technician at armc.she also began to work on an basis for another employer,joseph hospital,in her preferred position of surgical technician.
there was a shortage of surgical technicians throughout armc in both and.in october,bryant saw a job as a surgical technician posted on an armc employee bulletin board.bryant applied for the job,complying with required procedures and discussing her application with her manager and the perioperative surgical coordinator.she received no response of any kind to her application.
three months later,in january,the surgical technician position was still open,and bryant submitted a second application for the job.this time,she received a response.the hiring managers informed her that in order to become a surgical technician she first had to complete a training program.when bryant told them that she had already been certified as a surgical technician by the that she had in fact previously worked as a surgical technician for managers reiterated that she would have to complete the training program at the hospital in order to become a surgical technician.because training was only offered during hours when bryant was unavailable because of her class schedule at nursing school,she was not offered the job.
the surgical technician position still had not been filled in april.because bryant school semester had ended and she was therefore available for training,she reapplied once again for the same job.
bryant also complained,she testified,to her supervisor and to the hospital service excellence coordinator who was a designated point person for race discrimination complaints that she believed she was being discriminated against in the promotion process because of her race.the service excellence coordinator told her that he would check into it and get back to her with a response.she never heard anything back from him.shortly after her complaint,however,her treatment at work changed dramatically.previously,bryant testified,she had been recognized as a good worker and the most experienced central service technician on her shift in fact,she had been made a de facto supervisor of inexperienced technicians.after her discussion with the service excellence coordinator,however,she testified that she suddenly became subject to constant nitpicky critiques from armc management and that the atmosphere became hostile.and once again,bryant was not offered the surgical technician position,which remained open until september despite the acknowledged shortage armc was suffering throughout that entire year.
bryant graduated from nursing school in december,at a time when armc was suffering from a nursing shortage that had plagued the hospital throughout.in the beginning of december,bryant applied for a series of nursing positions that had been posted at armc.armc does not dispute that she would have qualified for at least two of these positions upon receiving her nursing license beyond paper qualifications,bryant also had a documentary record of strong job performance.her immediate supervisor in the central services department wrote her an unsolicited letter of recommendation,stating that bryant exhibited discipline,energy and commitment,that her work ethic was a n example for others on staff,that she was almost passionate about getting the job done right,that she frequently volunteered to cover shifts or work overtime even with short notice,and that others on staff look ed to her for advice and guidance.
despite this recommendation,bryant was interviewed for only one position.when she arrived for the interview,however,she was informed that the hiring nurse was unavailable.bryant was interviewed instead by two staff nurses.she never heard back from any nurse in that department.she repeatedly contacted armc human resources department throughout the application process,to no avail.she also contacted the chief nursing executive,who just casually dismissed bryant concerns and repeatedly put bryant off because she did have time to discuss the issue.the chief nursing executive ultimately told bryant that she did see what the problem was with a licensed nurse simply continuing to work as a central services technician.and the director of human resources responded to her concerns by informing her that he did not have a signed copy of her scholarship agreement,telling her that she should not consider herself bound to work for armc any longer,and wishing her good luck in her future career.
bryant finally decided that she had to seek employment as a nurse at other hospitals.she gave two weeks notice to armc and resigned her position as a central services technician effective february.she took a nursing position at barnwell county hospital,a job which gave her lower pay and fewer employee benefits than the nursing positions at armc would have.
bryant brought suit against armc under title vii of the civil rights act of,et,and.she alleged that armc had repeatedly discriminated against her in the job application process both because of her race and because she had complained about racial discrimination.the case went to trial,and the jury found that armc had refused to promote bryant to the surgical technician position in retaliation for her complaints about racial discrimination.the jury also found that bryant had been denied a promotion to the registered nurse position because she was.the jury found that racial discrimination was not a factor,however,in armc failure to offer bryant a surgical technician position.bryant was awarded in compensatory damages for lost wages and benefits,for emotional distress,and in punitive damages.this appeal ensued.
armc first argues that the district court erred in failing to grant judgment as a matter of law,or in the alternative a new trial,on bryant retaliation claims.

a plaintiff can prove illegal retaliation under title vii or if he shows that he engaged in protected activity,he suffered an adverse employment action at the hands of his employer and the employer took the adverse action because of the protected activity.spriggs diamond auto glass,cir.once the plaintiff makes this case,the employer can defend itself by producing evidence of a legitimate,reason for taking the adverse employment action.id.it is then up to the jury to decide whether the adverse action was actually taken for the proffered reason,or if it was intended as a retaliatory measure.when reviewing the judgment below,we examine the full trial record to determine whether sufficient evidence supported the jury verdict on the ultimate question of the alleged retaliatory discrimination.gibson old town trolley tours of washington,cir.
bryant clearly engaged in protected activity.title vii protects the right of employees to oppose any unlawful employment practice under title vii.employees are thus guaranteed the right to complain to their superiors about suspected violations of title vii.thompson potomac power,cir.bryant did exactly that.the jury heard testimony that she complained to both her immediate supervisor and the hospital service excellence coordinator about her suspicion that she had not been promoted to surgical technician because of racial discrimination.
it is similarly beyond quarrel that bryant suffered an adverse employment action.it has long been clear that failure to promote an employee constitutes an adverse employment action for the purposes of.von gunten maryland,cir page bolger,cir.bryant was denied a promotion to the position of surgical technician when she applied for the third time in april.
bryant also presented evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to find that armc failure to promote her was the result of her complaints about suspected discrimination.she testified that after her complaints,her treatment at work changed dramatically.she went from being recognized as a superior employee to being faced with constant nitpicky criticisms and the repeated charge that your job is not up to par.the jury could have concluded from the evidence that this change in treatment was one manifestation of hospital management retaliation against bryant for her complaint.it was similarly a reasonable inference,particularly given the jury ability to judge the credibility of several of armc managerial employees,that this retaliation further manifested itself in the hospital refusal to promote bryant.
the reasonableness of this inference is supported by the lack of any real reason to deny bryant the job.armc does not suggest that bryant work as a central services technician was subpar indeed,there was substantial evidence that precisely the opposite was true.she had extensive experience as a surgical service in the saudi arabian trauma centers during wartime and even an extended stint at armc itself.her skills were current,because she had been continuing to work as a surgical technician at another hospital.and there was a conceded shortage of surgical technicians at armc at the time she applied.in light of all these factors,it was a reasonable inference for the jury to conclude that the service excellence coordinator who was,after all,responsible for handling and resolving precisely such complaints had shared bryant complaints with others in hospital management,and that bryant had been denied her requested promotion because of those complaints 
we therefore hold that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict on the issue of unlawful retaliation,and the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a new trial on this score.
armc next argues that the trial court should have granted judgment as a matter of law or a new trial on bryant claim that she was denied a promotion to nurse because of her race.
under the framework established by mcdonnell douglas green,d,bryant must present evidence that she is a member of a protected group she applied for the position in question she was qualified for the position and she was rejected for the position under circumstances giving rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.brown mclean,cir.to defend itself,armc must then respond by producing a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its decision.columbia colleton med,at.once the parties satisfy these relatively modest obligations the trier of fact proceeds to decide the ultimate question whether plaintiff has proved that the defendant intentionally discriminated against her because of her race.fuller phipps,cir quoting mary honor ctr.hicks,d internal punctuation omitted,abrogated on other grounds,desert palace,costa,d evidentiary standard for jury instruction.we now review the jury resolution of that final question under the standards set forth by rule and rule.
viewed in the light most favorable to bryant,there was sufficient evidence to support her claim of racial discrimination.armc was suffering from the same nursing shortage that was plaguing the entire health care industry.in the context of this hiring crunch,armc had a commitment from bryant that she would work for the hospital as a scholarship program guaranteed armc first call on bryant services.and armc makes no argument that bryant was a difficult or mediocre employee indeed,there is significant evidence in the record to support the conclusion that she had an established record of excellent performance.
armc thus had every reason to hire bryant.instead,she was given the runaround for more than two months after applying for vacant nursing jobs for which she would have been fully qualified.some of her applications were simply ignored.one armc manager told her that she saw no problem with a licensed nurse being stuck in a job in central services.and the director of human resources ultimately tried to nudge her out the door by releasing her from her commitment to the hospital and wishing her the best of luck in her future career.moreover,almost two months after her departure,some of the nursing positions she had applied for were still unfilled.with no legitimate reason proffered for this treatment of a qualified applicant for a vacancy,we can not say that there was no reasonable basis for the jury to conclude that racial discrimination was the reason for the company failure to hire bryant.
on appeal,armc contends that bryant did not offer evidence that she was treated differently from a similarly situated white applicant or that the hospital ever hired a less qualified white applicant for a position bryant sought.this argument misapprehends the requirements of title vii bryant is not required as a matter of law to point to a similarly situated white comparator in order to succeed on a race discrimination claim.see columbia colleton med,at holding that plaintiff need not prove that she was better qualified than a successful applicant if other circumstantial evidence suggests discrimination.we would never hold,for example,that an employer w
