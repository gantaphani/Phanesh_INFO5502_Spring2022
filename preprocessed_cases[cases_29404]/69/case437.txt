the sarbanes oxley act of makes it illegal for publicly traded companies to retaliate against employees who report potentially unlawful conduct.see a.in this case,a video game publishing company,southpeak interactive southpeak fired its chief financial officer after she raised concerns about a misstatement on one of the company filings with the securities and exchange commission sec.a jury found that the company and two of its top officers violated the sarbanes oxley act,and the district court awarded the chief financial officer more than half a million dollars in back pay and emotional distress damages.
the ensuing appeal raises a number of questions about employees rights under the sarbanes oxley act.the case requires us to consider such issues as when a whistleblower may file suit,what she needs to do to exhaust her administrative remedies,and what types of remedies are available under the statute.we affirm the district court rulings on each of these issues.in doing so,we hold that sarbanes oxley act retaliatory discharge claims are subject to the statute of limitations under a,and not the limitations period set forth in b.we further hold that the administrative complaint in this case satisfies the exhaustion requirement,and that emotional distress damages are available under the statute.
the case also requires us to address the handling of apparent inconsistencies in a jury verdict and the steps a court must take in calculating attorneys fees.on these issues,too,we affirm the district court.
southpeak is a company that designs,develops,and distributes video games for playstation,xbox,wii,and other gaming systems.in june,the company hired andrea gail jones appellee to work as an accountant.it later promoted appellee to chief financial officer.
in february,southpeak sought to place an order with nintendo for units of a video game called my baby girl.southpeak chief executive officer,melanie mroz mroz,and its chairman,terry phillips phillips,hoped to place the order as soon as possible,but the company lacked the funds it would need to pay nintendo in advance.to avoid delay,phillips directed his assistant to send nintendo a wire transfer of from phillips personal account.however,the company did not properly record this debt on its balance sheet or in its quarterly financial report,which was filed with the sec on may.
when informed of the omission,appellee became very concerned.she asked phillips for an explanation.his response,she said,did not seem,i guess,to make sense or seem credible to me.id.at.about a week later,appellee called the chairman of southpeak audit committee to report her suspicion that the company was engaging in a fraud.
on august,southpeak outside counsel asked appellee to review and approve draft language for an amendment to the company erroneous quarterly report.the proposed amendment denied any intentional fraud or misstatement in the earlier filing.appellee refused to sign the amended report.in an august,letter to the outside counsel,she explained,i do not know how a conclusion of no intentional wrongdoing or fraud can be reached.that same day,southpeak board of directors held a special meeting in which it voted to terminate appellee employment.mroz notified appellee of the board decision the next day.
appellee,through counsel,filed a complaint with the occupational safety and health administration osha on october.the complaint states,on august,in a clear violation of the securities exchange act,southpeak terminated jones employment,apparently in retaliation for jones sic attempts to correct statements in periodic reports filed,and proposed to be filed,by southpeak.in the second numbered paragraph,the complaint further provides 
the names and addresses of the company s and person s who are alleged to have violated the act who the complaint is being filed against 
southpeak interactive corporation 
polo parkway.
midlothian,va 
terry phillips,chairman of the board 
patrice strachan,vp of operations 
melanie mroz,chief executive officer 
on october,osha sent southpeak a letter notifying the company of appellee complaint,along with a copy of the complaint itself.the letter was addressed exclusively to southpeak,without any reference to mroz or phillips.
more than days passed without a final order from osha consequently,on july,appellee sent osha a letter explaining that she was electing to file a federal lawsuit pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act and b.see u.b b authorizing suits at law or equity in federal court if the secretary of labor has not issued a final decision within days of the filing of an osha complaint.appellee sent a copy of the letter to a lawyer identified as counsel for southpeak interactive she did not send a copy to mroz or phillips.
appellee waited nearly two years to file suit.her june,complaint named southpeak,mroz,and phillips collectively,appellants as defendants.the claims included one count of retaliation pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act,and one count of retaliation pursuant to the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank,h a the district court granted appellants motion to dismiss the dodd frank claims on retroactivity grounds.the court,however,denied appellants motion to dismiss the sarbanes oxley act claims,rejecting appellants arguments that the statute of limitations barred those claims and that appellee failed to exhaust her administrative remedies.
a jury trial began on july.at the conclusion of the trial,the jury was provided a verdict form naming each of the three defendants.the form addressed each defendant separately.if the jury found a defendant liable,it could place a check mark next to a statement to that effect.the form also provided blank spaces for any back pay or compensatory damages the jury wished to assess against that defendant.
the jury returned a verdict the first verdict finding each of the three defendants was liable.with regard to southpeak,the jury assessed in back pay and in compensatory damages.however,the jury did not assess any damages against mroz or phillips.in a sidebar conference with counsel,the court expressed some confusion over whether the jury might be trying to account for no duplication of damages.and i think i need to ask them if that what they doing or if they think that there were no damages caused.turning to the jury,the court advised 
ladies and gentlemen,i notice that in one place you articulate a sum to be assessed as damages for compensatory and backpay.in two other places,you find the respective defendants liable but express no damage figure at all.it is unclear to us whether you are finding that that particular defendant caused no damage or you are simply trying to avoid awarding more than you awarded,more damage than you found that jones had suffered 
so i going to let you go back and take your verdict form,and if you mean it,with those instructions,you can return it,or you can amend it,or you can do such else,or send a question,or do whatever you need to do.
before the jury could return to the jury room,the court agreed to a second sidebar conference with counsel.during this discussion,appellants attorney told the court,i just want to make sure the jury does take it from your instruction that they can go back and change it to have damage against each of them i thought that maybe you were suggesting that that what they were supposed to do.to address this concern,the court clarified its previous instruction,telling the jurors 
i am not by giving you this instruction trying to do anything but clear up what appears to be a problem.i am not telling you what you have to do,nor suggesting that you need to put a damage figure in either of those places where you have a zero,but we need to make sure we have a verdict that we know what you are doing.
following a brief discussion in the jury room,the jury passed the court a note stating from southpeak we want a total of back pay and compensatory.we do not find that terry phillips or melanie mroz are individually responsible for any amount.alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.conferring again with counsel,the court said,i t seems to me if that what they want to do,they need to make another finding on their verdict form t hey need to check the one that says you not liable.id.at.the attorneys for both sides said they agreed.
when the jury returned,the foreperson confirmed that mroz and phillips were not individually responsible.then what you need to do,the court said,is eliminate the checkmarks indicating liability for mroz and phillips and initial it there,and then we will have the verdict.the court asked the foreperson,do you need to retire or can you do it here id.the foreperson said she did not need to retire,but evidently someone else does.id.with that,the court permitted the jury to return once more to the jury room.
when,at last,the court session resumed,the jury returned another verdict the final verdict in which it again found all three defendants liable.this time,the assessment against southpeak comprised in back pay and no compensatory damages.the assessments against mroz and phillips were for apiece in compensatory damages.in a sidebar conference,appellants attorney asked the court to instruct that they go back and reconsider because it is impossible to come up with that verdict clearly,there is something wrong with the way they understand this case because it does stand to reason,and the evidence would support a verdict of that nature.the attorney then requested a mistrial.the court denied the request.when the sidebar conference ended,the clerk polled the jury every member affirmed the final verdict.
appellants moved for a new trial,remittitur,or an amended judgment pursuant to rules and of the federal rules of civil procedure.they argued,among other things,that the back pay award was not supported by the evidence,and that the compensatory damages assessed against mroz and phillips were excessive.appellants also argued that the court should have accepted the first verdict.on october,the district court denied most of appellants requests.the court,however,reclassified the assessment against southpeak,holding the company responsible for in back pay and in compensatory damages.the court also granted southpeak motion for a new trial nisi remittitur with regard to the compensatory damages awards against mroz and phillips,giving appellee an opportunity to accept a reduced award of apiece from those two defendants.appellee accepted the reduced award.
on december,appellee petitioned the court for an order holding appellants jointly and severally liable for in attorneys fees.ultimately,the court awarded in attorneys fees.as requested,the court held appellants jointly and severally liable for the sum.
of limitations 
we first consider appellants contention that the statute of limitations bars this action.this is a legal issue,which we review de novo.see sewell coal,office of workers comp.programs,cir.
appellee filed suit on june,a little less than three years after her termination.the district court held that the sarbanes oxley act claims were timely because the suit commenced within the time limit set forth in a.however,appellants argue that a does not apply to these claims.rather,they say,appellee action is subject to the limitations period set forth in b because the retaliatory discharge claims involve a claim of fraud in contravention of a regulatory requirement concerning the securities laws.b.
section a supplies a catchall,or fallback,statute of limitations for certain federal statutes that create a cause of action but are silent as to the applicable limitations period,at see jones donnelley sons,d.the default provision states 
except as otherwise provided by law,a civil action arising under an act of congress enacted after the date of the enactment of this section may not be commenced later than years after the cause of action accrues.
a.this provision was on the books for more than a decade before congress amended section as part of the sarbanes oxley act.with this legislation,congress retained the default provision but added a new subsection,b,which provides 
notwithstanding subsection a,a private right of action that involves a claim of fraud,deceit,manipulation,or contrivance in contravention of a regulatory requirement concerning the securities laws,as defined in section a of the securities exchange act of a,may be brought not later than the earlier of 
years after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation or 
years after such violation.
courts have not hesitated to apply b to securities fraud claims brought under section b of the securities exchange act,b.see in re exxon mobil.sec,cir indeed,the implied cause of action recognized under b is widely known and referred to as securities fraud.to conclude that b does not apply to b claims would be absurd.citation omitted.it is easy to see why this is so.congress confined b reach to causes of action involving a claim of fraud,deceit,manipulation,or contrivance in contravention of securities regulations.b.this language,as several courts have previously noted,closely tracks the language of section b of the securities exchange act,which creates liability for any person who employ s any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of sec regulations.in re global crossing.sec,d,alterations in original quoting b see in re exxon mobil,at.
typically,a section b securities fraud action requires a plaintiff to prove six elements a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant scienter a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission economic loss and loss causation.yates mun.mortg.equity,llc,cir quoting stoneridge inv.partners,llc scientific atlanta,d.the second element,scienter,separates securities fraud from other causes of action under the securities exchange act.it requires the plaintiff to prove not only that the defendant made a material misrepresentation,but that he did so with the intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.tellabs,makor issues rights,d internal quotation marks omitted.
the text of b,with its references to fraud,deceit,manipulation,and contrivance,strongly implies a need for proof of fraudulent intent the third circuit has held accordingly,concluding that b applies only to section b securities fraud claims and other claims requiring proof of fraudulent intent.in re exxon mobil,at.in in re exxon mobil.securities litigation,the third circuit determined that b did not apply to claims for false or misleading proxy statements pursuant to section a of the securities exchange act because such claims do not require proof of fraudulent intent.id.
here,in their opening brief,appellants argue that b covers appellee sarbanes oxley act claims because those claims involve allegations of fraud.appellants br.however,b does not speak in terms of allegations.per its text,b covers private rights of action that involve a claim of fraud.b emphasis supplied.appellee has not advanced a claim of fraud.her claim,rather,alleges retaliatory discharge under the sarbanes oxley act.to succeed on this claim,she must show that she engaged in protected activity,the employer knew that she engaged in the protected activity,she suffered an unfavorable personnel action,and the protected activity was a contributing factor in the unfavorable action.see feldman law enforcement assocs,cir.the first of these elements does not require proof that the employer conduct was,in fact,a legally actionable fraud.the whistleblower need only show that she had both a subjective belief and an objectively reasonable belief that the conduct violated relevant law.welch chao,cir internal quotation marks omitted.though courts have stated that the whistleblower theory of fraud should at least approximate the basic elements of fraud,day staples,cir accord van asdale int l game,cir,it is not necessary to show that a shareholder would,in fact,have accrued a cause of action.
appellee complaint was not specific in identifying the securities law that she believed appellants violated.her allegation does,however,approximate the basic elements of a section b securities fraud claim.while a shareholder bringing a section b claim would bear the burden of establishing a strong inference of scienter,see b a,appellee is under no such obligation.her retaliation claim can succeed without discovery of the facts constituting securities fraud.b.it stands to reason,then,that b,which hinges on the discovery of such facts,does not apply.section a controls,and because appellee brought her suit within that section window,her claim is not barred.
exhaustion of administrative remedies 
the next question before us is whether appellee properly exhausted her administrative remedies as to mroz and phillips.this is a pure question of law,which we review de novo.see ex rel.lorsson chapel hill carrboro bd.of,wl cir.
by statute,a sarbanes oxley act whistleblower can not go straight to court.rather,she must first file an administrative complaint with the secretary of labor.see b.this complaint must be filed not later than days after the date on which such violation occurs.b.the whistleblower must then wait days for osha to investigate the allegation and issue a decision.see b b.if,after days,osha has not issued a final decision and there is no showing that such delay is due to the bad faith of the claimant,the whistleblower may bring suit for de novo review in the appropriate district court of the united states.id.
appellants recognize that appellee administrative complaint was timely,and that osha did not issue a final decision within days.they argue,though,that the osha complaint did not clearly identify mroz and phillips as respondents.they further assert that even if the fault lies with osha for failing to pursue claims against mroz and phillips,the burden was on appellee to press osha to address its oversight.
to be sure,an exhaustion requirement would be meaningless if the complainant were free to litigate claims bearing little or no connection to the preceding administrative complaint.in the context of title vii cases,we have long recognized that t he scope of the plaintiff right to file a federal lawsuit is determined by the contents of the charge filed with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.jones calvert,cir see chacko patuxent,cir holding that a title vii plaintiff fails to exhaust his administrative remedies where his administrative charges reference different time frames,actors,and discriminatory conduct than the central factual allegations in his formal suit.however,we have also said that the administrative charge does not strictly limit the ensuing lawsuit.bryant bell atl,cir internal quotation marks omitted.rather,the litigation may encompass claims reasonably related to the original complaint,and those developed by reasonable investigation of the original complaint.evans techs.applications serv,cir see sydnor fairfax,cir the touchstone for exhaustion is whether plaintiff administrative and judicial claims are reasonably related,not precisely the same citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
our decision in sydnor fairfax county,virginia,cir,is illustrative.there,a disabled nurse indicated in a questionnaire accompanying her eeoc charge that she had sought authorization to perform work.later,in a lawsuit alleging a violation of the americans with disabilities act,she sought a different accommodation namely,authorization for work with the assistance of a wheelchair.see at.we found this distinction to be insignificant,reasoning that the eeoc questionnaire afforded the nurse employer ample notice of the allegations against it.id.at.we stated,the exhaustion requirement should not become a tripwire for hapless plaintiffs.while it is important to stop clever parties from circumventing statutory commands,we may not erect insurmountable barriers to litigation out of overly technical concerns.id.at.
nothing in the record before us suggests that appellee was trying to circumvent the sarbanes oxley act exhaustion requirement.see woodford ngo,d e xhaustion requirements are designed to deal with parties who do not want to exhaust.appellee osha complaint is substantially similar to her complaint in this action.the alleged harm,a retaliatory termination,is identical.in addition,the osha complaint plainly identifies mroz and phillips as person s who are alleged to have violated the act who the complaint is being filed against.nothing more precise is required.indeed,the department of labor regulations in effect at the time appellee filed the complaint expressly provided that n o particular form of complaint is required.b.appellee satisfied her burden,and osha subsequent treatment of the complaint can not take away her opportunity to seek recourse.maui police dep t,cir the eeoc failure to address a claim asserted by the plaintiff in her charge has no bearing on whether the plaintiff has exhausted her administrative remedies with regard to that claim.
we recognize that a primary objective of exhaustion requirements is to put parties on notice of the allegations against them.in the context of title vii actions,exhaustion gives the employer an opportunity to investigate and resolve the issue and prevents the employer from later complaining of prejudice,since it has known of the allegations from the very beginning.chacko,at.here,though,there can be no doubt that mroz and phillips were well aware of appellee allegations.mroz was the company chief executive,and phillips its chairman.in its october letter notifying southpeak of appellee administrative complaint,osha listed phillips as the contact person for the company.subsequently,southpeak counsel discussed the complaint with both mroz and phillips.surely,it could not have gone unnoticed that the complaint identified mroz and phillips as person s who are alleged to have violated the act.it should not have been all that surprising,then,when appellee named the two executives in the instant civil action.
nature of available remedies 
appellants next challenge the award of emotional distress damages.the final verdict held mroz and phillips accountable for apiece in compensatory damages.the district court,which later reduced that sum to apiece,inferred that these awards must represent appellee damages for emotional distress.appellants argue that such damages are not permissible under the whistleblower protection provisions of the sarbanes oxley act.we reject this reading of c,which expressly entitles a prevailing employee to all relief necessary to make her whole.c.we also reject appellants backup argument that the emotional distress award in this case was excessive.
availability of emotional distress damages 
the first question is whether emotional distress damages are available under c.this,too,is a question of law that we review de novo.see rice cmty.health ass n,cir applying de novo review to a district court determination that west virginia contract law permitted consequential damages.
the remedies provision at c has two parts.subsection c provides an employee prevailing in any enforcement action under b shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make the employee whole.c.in subsection c,the provision goes on to state that compensatory damages 
shall include 
a reinstatement with the same seniority status that the employee would have had,but for the discrimination 
b the amount of back pay,with interest and 
c compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination,including litigation costs,expert witness fees,and reasonable attorney fees.
appellants argue that the three forms of compensatory damages itemized in subsection c are the only forms of relief available under the statute.there are two problems with this argument.first,it all but ignores the language in subsection c that says a prevailing employee shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make the employee whole.c.second,appellants interpretation of the words shall include in subsection c is at odds with our precedent.in project for america,long,we said that the term shall include sets a floor,not a ceiling,cir internal quotation marks omitted interpreting section i of the national voter registration act.courts have repeatedly indicated that shall include is not equivalent to limited to.id.
to date,two federal circuit courts have considered the availability of emotional distress damages under.both have concluded that such damages are available.see halliburton,admin.review,cir lockheed martin admin.review,cir.to support its position,appellants can only direct our attention to a smattering of district court decisions,most of them unpublished.these cases,by and large,liken c to the remedies provision in title vii prior to its amendments.see,walton nova info,d,murray txu,no.cv p,wl,at.june.at that time,title vii provided 
t he court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such unlawful employment practice,and order such affirmative action as may be appropriate,which may include,but is not limited to,reinstatement or hiring of employees,with or without back pay,or any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.
g.in united states burke,the supreme court held that this provision did not support damages for pain and suffering,emotional distress,harm to reputation,or other consequential damages,d.the district court opinions cited by appellants suggest that the sarbanes oxley act remedies provision at c operates the same way.
the fifth circuit decision in halliburton,administrative review board,cir,explains why the district courts reasoning misses the mark.by its terms,the sarbanes oxley act provision entitles a prevailing plaintiff to all relief necessary to make the employee whole.c.title vii was not so generous.see halliburton,at.beyond that,the sarbanes oxley act plainly affords at least some damages,that is,legal relief,in addition to equitable remedies.see u.b b authorizing sarbanes oxley act whistleblowers to bring an action at law or equity.title vii afforded only equitable relief.halliburton,at.
in the fifth circuit view,and in ours,the remedies provision in more strongly resembles the remedies provision for retaliation claims under the false claims act,h.in language that parallels the provision now before us,the false claims act states that a prevailing plaintiff shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make that plaintiff whole.h.it further states that relief shall include reinstatement,back pay,and compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination,including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys fees.id.h.every federal circuit court to have addressed the issue has concluded that the false claims act affords noneconomic compensatory damages.halliburton,at see brandon anesthesia pain mgmt,cir stating that the allowance for special damages in h permits recovery for emotional distress hammond northland counseling,cir.
though the case before us centers on a termination of employment,we note that the sarbanes oxley act whistleblower protection provisions proscribe a wide range of retaliatory actions,including threats and harassment.see a.there will be times when the primary harm will be noneconomic.in these instances,the department of labor the department observes,compensatory relief,such as emotional distress damages,may be the only remedy that would make the complainant whole.amicus br.the department takes the position that the statute countenances emotional distress awards,and indeed the department administrative review board has a history of upholding compensatory damages in sarbanes oxley act whistleblower cases.see menendez halliburton,case,wl,at.march.in these circumstances,where congress has explicitly empowered the department to enforce by formal adjudication,we afford deference to the department interpretation.see welch,at.we therefore join the department,and the fifth and tenth circuits,in concluding that emotional distress damages are available under c.
amount of emotional distress damages 
appellants argue in the alternative that the emotional distress award was excessive.appellants,we note,have already benefitted from a reduction in the emotional distress damages.in its final verdict,the jury found mroz and phillips liable for apiece,all for emotional distress.the district court later reduced these awards to apiece.
the power and duty of the trial judge to set aside an excessive verdict is.cline wal mart stores,cir internal quotation marks omitted.under rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure,a court may order a new trial nisi remittitur if it concludes that a jury award of compensatory damages is excessive.sloane equifax info,llc,cir.on appeal,we reverse the grant or denial of a motion for new trial only upon a showing of abuse of discretion.pursuant to this standard,w e must give the benefit of every doubt to the judgment of the trial judge,while recognizing that there must be an upper limit to allowable damages.cline,at alterations in original citation omitted quoting gasperini ctr.for humanities,d.
we find no abuse of discretion here.to the contrary,the district court opinion offers a meticulous and explanation for the reduced award the court selected.see jones southpeak interactive of,d.the court properly took note of appellee testimony about the toll her firing took on her family and her psyche.appellee,describing herself as the bread winner of the family,testified that her termination caused concern we have four children who at that time ranged from age eleven to age four.so there was a lot of responsibility,and always has been on my shoulders to provide for the family.appellee said she felt awful because she had no choice but to seek unemployment benefits.id.at.on job interviews,she said,the interviewer would always get to the question,why you were terminated.and that was not a good conversation.id.at.all told,it took months for appellee to secure a new job.
appellee also testified that,even years after her termination,she still cries sometimes when she thinks about her experience at southpeak.as the district court noted,appellee husband corroborated her account,saying he has been woken up many times in the middle of the night with her crying.not understanding,like,people do the things they do,and lie about her.and just not knowing why bad things happen.jones,d at.
after concluding that the evidence supported an award for emotional distress,the court compared the jury damages assessment to awards in comparable cases,just as we have done in our own review of awards for emotional distress.see,hetzel cnty.of prince william,cir comparing cases involving awards for emotional distress.this was a sound approach.we see no reason to disturb the court judgment.
perceived inconsistencies in the verdict 
we turn now to the hubbub that followed the jurors emergence from the jury room.appellants raise two arguments about this stage of the proceedings.in the first place,they argue that the court should have accepted the first verdict.separately,appellants argue that the court should not have accepted the final verdict.we address each of these arguments in turn.
the first verdict 
first,we consider the district court decision to reject the first verdict as inconsistent.as this presents a mixed question of law and fact,see wilks reyes,cir,we inspect the court factual findings for clear error and examine de novo the legal conclusions derived from those facts,see meson gatx tech.servs,cir.actions taken after the inconsistency determination are reviewed for abuse of discretion.see hauser kubalak,cir per curiam.
