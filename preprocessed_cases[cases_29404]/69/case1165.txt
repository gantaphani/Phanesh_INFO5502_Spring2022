dish network corporation and dish network,llc collectively dish appeal the district court order denying dish motion for a preliminary injunction.dish argues that it is likely to succeed in its argument that of the satellite television extension and localism act of stela,stat.amending,which accelerates the timetable under which satellite providers that carry local stations in hd format in a particular market must carry qualified noncommercial educational television stations in hd,is a regulation of free speech in violation of the first amendment.dish asserts that the statute interferes with its editorial discretion and judgment by forcing it to delay offering commercial programming in hd to certain markets.that delay,dish argues,forces dish subscribers to receive public broadcasting service pbs programs in hd before commercial programs,even though they prefer watching the world cup and american idol in vivid colors over jim leher and elmo.
because we agree with the district court that dish failed to demonstrate it is likely to succeed on the merits,we affirm the denial of injunctive relief.see winter natural res.def.council.
it is helpful first to briefly review how satellite television works,why it is regulated,and how came to be enacted.there are only two major direct broadcast satellite providers in the united states directtv,which has about million subscribers,and dish,which has about million subscribers.they rely on assigned radio frequency bands to transmit signals to consumers from satellites located at designated orbital locations in space.the transmissions are governed by the federal communications commission fcc and international regulations.
the united states has been assigned eight orbital locations for providing satellite service.each location is divided into satellite channels.transmissions from satellites in the same orbital location may cause signal interference,so congress has authorized the fcc to grant licenses to satellite service providers assigning them the use of specified channels at particular orbital locations.the licenses are limited in duration and the fcc may grant or renew them only if doing so will serve the public interest,convenience,or necessity.
in,congress created an exception to copyright law to better enable competition between satellite tv and cable tv.the satellite home viewer improvement act of shvia amended the copyright act to create statutory copyright licenses for satellite carriers that allow them to retransmit a local broadcast station signal without first getting permission from the individual copyright holders.the copyright license is also subject to statutory and regulatory conditions.
as a condition of their licenses,carriers have certain public obligations.for example,they must also carry,on request,the signals of all other television broadcast stations in the same local market.a.see satellite broad.and commc ns ass fcc,cir rejecting first amendment challenge.additionally,all satellite providers must set aside four to seven percent of their channel capacity for noncommercial programming of an educational or informational nature.b see also time warner entm t fcc,per curiam rejecting first amendment challenge,reh g en banc denied.finally,and particularly relevant to the case at hand,satellite service providers are required to treat all local television stations the same regarding picture quality.
the condition was applied to hd programming in through an fcc rule.see,k.under that rule,satellite providers that carry any local stations in hd format in a particular market must carry all local stations in hd format.the regulation gives providers four years to meet the following implementation timetable they must achieve compliance in fifteen percent of the markets in which they carry local channels in hd by,thirty percent by,sixty percent by,and percent by.
the challenge is that hd consumes three to four times the channel capacity as standard definition sd programming.because dish currently lacks capacity to offer all local channels in hd,it prioritized local market television stations according to customer demand,and decided not to prioritize transmitting pbs in hd.instead,dish offered the major networks in hd and delayed offering pbs in hd except in alaska and hawaii,where it was legally obligated to do so.by comparison,its competitor directtv provided channels of hd pbs in its regions of operation.
congress determined that by forcing public broadcasting stations to the back of the hd priority line,dish was jeopardizing public television ability to compete with commercial television and thereby threatening the right of consumers to receive federally funded programming broadcast by pbs.cong.rec.daily ed.may,speech of anna eshoo.in response,congress enacted of stela to ensure that satellite providers do not discriminate against noncommercial high definition signals and to promote an even playing field.id.
the provision accelerates the hd timetable for qualified noncommercial educational television stations.under,satellite carriers who take advantage of the statutory compulsory copyright license to provide local broadcasts in hd format must also provide qualified noncommercial educational television stations located within that local market in hd format.carriers were given until december,to meet the requirement in fifty percent of the local markets in which they provide hd programming and until december,to comply fully in all remaining markets.
but congress created an exemption to for satellite providers who entered into a private carriage agreement with at least thirty qualified noncommercial educational television stations.to avoid more burdensome timeline,dish entered into such a contract.doing so forced it to postpone launching hd services in ten new television markets.dish then filed suit to enjoin,arguing that it is a constitutionally impermissible regulation of the company first amendment right to free speech.
the district court denied dish motion for a preliminary injunction without opinion.during the hearing,the court focused entirely on whether dish was likely to succeed on the merits of its claim.the court concluded the regulation was and not an infringement on dish first amendment rights.it reasoned that is designed to keep pbs competitive with other local outlets,not to regulate content.in summarizing its conclusions,the district court explained 
u nder the case law we are dealing with content.you got to offer pbs and now they saying you got to offer it in hd so it as attractive as other local stations and i do think it impinges or infringes the first amendment.
we review a district court grant or denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion and the underlying legal principles de novo.stormans,selecky,cir.the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction lies within the discretion of the district court and we may reverse a district court only where it relied on an erroneous legal premise or abused its discretion.sports form,united press int l,cir.to determine whether the district court abused its discretion,the reviewing court must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.id.at citations omitted.
we have noted that in some cases,parties appeal orders granting or denying motions for preliminary injunctions in order to ascertain the views of the appellate court on the merits of the litigation,but that due to the limited scope of our review our disposition of appeals from most preliminary injunctions may provide little guidance as to the appropriate disposition on the merits and that such appeals often result in unnecessary delay to the parties and inefficient use of judicial resources.id.at.thus,we offer our analysis with the necessary caveat that accompanies any preliminary injunction this opinion is not an adjudication on the merits of dish claim.we conclude only that,based on our de novo review of the underlying legal principles,the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that dish is not likely to succeed.
to warrant a preliminary injunction,dish must demonstrate that it meets all four of the elements of the preliminary injunction test established in winter natural res.def.council,that an injunction would be in the public interest,that without an injunction irreparable harm is likely,that the balance of equities tips in its favor,and that it is likely to succeed on the merits.id.at.dish argues that in the case of a first amendment claim,all four of the winter factors collapse into the merits.we have held otherwise.
while a first amendment claim certainly raises the specter of irreparable harm and public interest considerations,proving the likelihood of such a claim is not enough to satisfy winter.stormans,at see also klein city of san clemente,cir even where the plaintiff was likely to succeed on the merits of his first amendment claim,he must also demonstrate that he is likely to suffer irreparable injury in the absence of a preliminary injunction,and that the balance of equities and the public interest tip in his favor citing winter.at.
therefore,even if we were to determine that dish is likely to succeed on the merits,we would still need to consider whether it satisfied the remaining elements of the preliminary injunction test.however,because we agree with the district court that dish has failed to satisfy its burden of demonstrating it has met the first element,we need not consider the remaining three.
to determine whether dish is likely to succeed on the merits of its claim,we must first consider whether the first amendment likely applies.the government argues that does not implicate the first amendment because it does not constitute a serious infringement on dish editorial discretion.it suggests that the provision is merely a modest alteration to the hd timetable concerning only the timing of a means of signal transmission.the government stresses that dish is not challenging congress initial requirement that satellite carriers offer pbs in hd,only its timing,which does not rise to the level of a first amendment burden additionally,the government argues that the first amendment is not implicated because does not affect dish selection of channels or interfere with its expressive decisions.
dish counters that does affect dish selection of channels because hd transmissions are offered on separate channels than sd transmissions and that if dish carries pbs in hd,it can not carry other stations in hd.regarding the question whether the first amendment applies to a provision that merely affects the timing of a requirement,dish proposes that the accelerated pace unconstitutionally benefits pbs the fact that the benefit lasts only three years is irrelevant.
the supreme court has recognized that cable television operators exercise a significant amount of editorial discretion regarding what their programming will include.city of los angeles preferred commc ns,quoting fcc midwest video.in turner broadcasting system,fcc,turner i,the supreme court applied intermediate scrutiny to a regulation that required carriage of local broadcast stations on cable systems.in doing so,the court announced that laws that single out the press,or certain elements thereof,for special treatment pose a particular danger of abuse by the state and so are always subject to at least some degree of heightened first amendment scrutiny.turner i,at quoting arkansas writer project,ragland.
section does not affect dish ability to offer programs.it affects only when dish can offer those programs in hd.even so,turner i instructs that any law that singles out an element of the press is subject to some form of heightened first amendment scrutiny.for example,in turner i,the supreme court determined that regulations that impose special obligations upon cable operators and special burdens upon cable programmers implicate the first amendment.turner i,at.applying that logic to the case at hand,while obligations and burdens on satellite carriers are minimal and nuanced,they do exist.therefore,the first amendment is likely implicated.
strict scrutiny applies to government actions that stifle or promote speech on account of its message.such laws conflict with basic first amendment principles valuing and protecting an individual right to decide which ideas and beliefs are worth expressing,and almost always violate the first amendment.see id.acknowledging that the first amendment,subject to only narrow and exceptions,does not countenance governmental control over the content of messages expressed by private individuals.by contrast,regulations of speech unrelated to content are less likely to conflict with core first amendment values,so they are subject only to intermediate scrutiny.id.at.
dish argues that we should apply strict scrutiny because is a regulation of free speech.the supreme court has said that the principal inquiry in determining content neutrality is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of agreement or disagreement with the message it conveys.ward rock against racism,see also turner i,at.generally,laws that by their terms distinguish favored speech from disfavored speech on the basis of the ideas or views expressed are content based.by contrast,laws that confer benefits or impose burdens on speech without reference to the ideas or views expressed are in most instances content neutral.turner i,at internal citations omitted.finally,even a statute that facially distinguishes a category of speech or speakers is if justified by interests that are unrelated to the suppression of free expression.city of renton playtime theatres.
dish argues is because 
to be a qualified noncommercial educational television station,a station must be eligible for a corporation for public broadcasting cpb grant,and those grants are allocated according to certain content criteria 
congress motive in enacting was to promote subject matter it deemed worthier.to support this contention,dish highlights comments primary sponsor,anna eshoo,made announcing her personal preference for pbs programming over certain channels 
strict scrutiny applies where congress preference is based on subject matter,regardless of whether it discriminates on the basis of viewpoint.brief for at citing bullfrog films,wick,cir.
section preference is reserved only for a subset of beneficiaries,so that even the most educational,irreligious,apolitical station gets no preference if it is not currently on the government dole.
first,the criteria used to determine whether a station receives federal funding are designed not to promote congress preference,but to guard against the influence of special interests.cong.rec.june,recognizing the need to insulate public broadcasting from special interest,commercial,or any other kind,at noting the risk of influence of special they commercial,political,or religious.furthermore,the cpb offers financial incentives for stations to differentiate their programming and the government is forbidden by law from exercising any direction,supervision,or control over the cpb.
section seeks to support expression,not suppress it,the government maintains.the record supports that assertion.eshoo may have expressed a personal preference for pbs over,but it does not follow that her personal preference is what drove congress to enact.the legislative record clearly indicates that in congress aimed to prohibit satellite carriers from discriminating against noncommercial stations in a manner that interferes with the rights of consumers to receive federally funded programming broadcast by america public broadcasting service,pbs.cong.rec.daily ed.may,speech of anna eshoo.the legislation sought to even the playing field and promote fair competition.dish contention that congress enacted because congress thinks pbs is better than commercial television contradicts the legislative record.
as for dish remaining arguments,turner i is informative.in turner i,the supreme court held that sections of the cable television consumer protection and competition act of requiring cable television systems to dedicate some of their channels to local broadcast television stations constituted a restriction on speech,subject to intermediate scrutiny.turner i,at.the court de
