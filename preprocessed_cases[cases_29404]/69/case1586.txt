du pont de nemours company dupont appeals from the district court denial of its motion for preliminary injunction.memorandum opinion,du pont de nemours company macdermid,case,wl,preliminary injunction opinion.we heard oral argument on april.we hold that the district court abused its discretion in finding that a substantial question as to validity existed because of uncertainty regarding the priority date.because the district court did not reach the parties remaining arguments as to validity and enforceability as well as the remaining preliminary injunction factors,we vacate and remand for the district court to consider these issues in light of the correct priority date.
dupont is the assignee of patent the patent,titled process for making a flexographic printing plate and a photosensitive element for use in the process.the application for this patent was filed on february,and the patent issued on august.according to dupont,its cyrel fast digital thermal technology is its commercial embodiment of the invention of the patent.
in prosecuting the patent,dupont originally filed a provisional application on march,and on february,it filed a application.the application data sheet ads filed with the application stated continuity data this application is a of provisional which is pending.the patent as issued,however,did not reference the provisional application due to an oversight by the patent and trademark office pto.after issuance,dupont sought a certificate of correction pursuant to to add a reference to the provisional application on the title page of the patent.the pto issued the certificate of correction on july,adding to the title page,related application data,provisional application,filed on march.
in april,dupont sued macdermid and macdermid printing solutions,llc macdermid in the district of colorado for patent infringement,alleging that macdermid magma,mlt,and lava products infringed dupont patent as well as another patent not at issue in this appeal in july,the case was transferred from the district of colorado to the district of new jersey.
in october,dupont moved for a preliminary injunction,seeking to enjoin macdermid from continuing to infringe claim of the patent.dupont argued that macdermid mlt and magma plates infringe claim and that macdermid induces infringement of claim by encouraging customers to use its lava system and mlt and magma plates in an infringing manner.dupont also argued that its patent is valid,noting the presumption of validity,evidence of commercial success,and macdermid offer to take a license.dupont further argued that it had not committed inequitable conduct in prosecuting its patent.
in response,macdermid raised a number of validity and enforceability challenges.relevant to this appeal,macdermid argued that the patent was invalid under section b because the invention was on sale or in public use before the critical date.according to macdermid,that date was february,or one year before the filing date of the application.
in reply,dupont argued that macdermid had not created a substantial question of validity based on the public use or on sale bars of section b.in particular,dupont argued that macdermid evidence of sales prior to the critical date were actually of prior technology not claimed in the patent analog and not digital technology.dupont also responded to macdermid other invalidity and unenforceability arguments.in support of its reply,dupont filed witness declarations that either said that the filing date for the patent was february,or suggested that february,was the critical date.
on february,the district court held a hearing on dupont motion for preliminary injunction.at the hearing,dupont counsel addressed a september trade show at which it gave a general demonstration of the workflow for a digital thermally developed plate.dupont counsel stated that the critical date was february,and that the september trade show was before the critical date.
the court then agreed to allow each party to submit a letter brief regarding whether the use at that trade show was a public use.both macdermid and dupont submitted letter briefs that presented substantive arguments on this point.in its letter brief,dupont still appeared to accept that the critical date was one year before the filing date of the application.
two days later,dupont submitted a letter to the court,for the first time identifying an earlier critical date.the letter stated 
further investigation has revealed that the patent was based upon,and claims priority to a provisional patent application,filed on march.this means that only activities prior to march,sic can invalidate the patent under b accordingly,the demonstration at label expo in september is not an invalidating bar under b.
the next day,the parties had a telephone conference with the court regarding dupont letter.at the hearing,the district court denied macdermid oral motion to expunge dupont letter.in doing so the court stated 
well,from where my role is positioned as opposed to your adversarial roles,what strikes me is that if i were to rule let say adverse to du pont based upon a set of facts that is on its face inescapable,then the circuit court could well find plain error,and this would be not a service to either party or the circuit court.having been alerted to this problem and simply to judicially exclude any consideration of it,it true that we still in briefing on this supplemental issue.i just do see that the positions have hardened to the point where i can ignore the import of this fact.
app x at.the court then allowed the parties to each file a letter brief explaining their positions both on procedural and substantive bases.
macdermid then filed a letter brief opposing dupont argument that the critical date should be based on the provisional rather than the application.macdermid argued that dupont statements detailed above that the critical date was february,were binding judicial admissions and that dupont was estopped from taking a contrary position.if not judicial admissions,then macdermid argued that they were evidentiary admissions which are more than sufficient to create a substantial question concerning the validity of the patent.macdermid also argued that the application was not entitled to the filing date of the provisional because the application names inventors not named in the provisional application dupont did not use the proper language in claiming priority to the provisional the filing receipt,published application,and issued patent did not reference the provisional,showing that the pto did not recognize priority to the provisional dupont did not alert the pto that the priority information was missing until the patent issued and the certificate of correction that added the priority information was wrongly issued.macdermid also argued that it would be unfairly prejudiced by dupont change of position.
dupont submitted a letter in response,stating that it had promptly notified the court of its discovery that the patent was entitled to an earlier effective filing date,and that macdermid admitted it had been aware of the provisional application.dupont also argued that its application had properly claimed priority to the provisional application,thus entitling it to a march,effective filing date,and that it did not make binding judicial admissions.
on august,the district court entered a memorandum opinion construing various terms and denying dupont motion for a preliminary injunction.preliminary injunction opinion at.the district court first noted that macdermid had not disputed infringement in opposing dupont motion for a preliminary injunction,and so the court held that dupont had shown a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on infringement.id.at 
next,the court addressed whether macdermid had raised a substantial question of validity under section b.id.at.after laying out the parties arguments as to the various prior uses,the court addressed dupont argument that the critical date should be based on the filing date of the provisional application rather than the application.id.at.the district court held that dupont had not shown that macdermid asserted defense that the patent is invalid under either the public use or bars of section b lacks substantial merit.id.at.the court noted that the parties disputed whether dupont should be allowed to argue the earlier critical date based on the provisional application.id.without explicitly deciding whether dupont argument should be allowed,the court held that dupont had failed to prove the earlier critical date in any event and that dupont earlier admissions as to the later critical date raised a substantial question as to validity 
even if the court permits dupont to now argue that march,is the critical date,such statement would require evidence that was not proffered in dupont briefs in support of its motion or during oral argument.further,the court agrees with macdermid that dupont numerous assertions that the critical date is february,and its subsequent letter stating that the critical date is actually march,raise substantial questions regarding whether the invention of the patent was in public use or on sale one year prior to the date of the applicable patent application.
id.at.the district court found that it could not grant a preliminary injunction on the record before it,but reserved judgment as to how it would view the issue on a fully developed record on summary judgment.id.in a footnote,the court stated 
if the court of appeals determines that it is preferable that this court make factual findings on the issue of the correct critical date,for purposes of deciding this preliminary injunction motion,we will permit both parties to fully brief that issue and we will consider any request for an evidentiary hearing limited to that issue.
the district court declined to address macdermid remaining invalidity and unenforceability arguments.id.at.and because it found that dupont had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits as to validity,the court did not address the remaining preliminary injunction factors.id.at.
dupont then filed a notice of appeal of the district court denial of a preliminary injunction.the district court sua sponte stayed the case and administratively terminated the case subject to later reopening.we have jurisdiction pursuant to c.
we review the district court denial of a motion for preliminary injunctive relief for abuse of discretion,the underlying factual determinations for clear error,and legal conclusions de novo,tate access floors,interface architectural.in seeking a preliminary injunction,the patentee has the burden to show a likelihood of success regarding the patent validity if the accused infringer raises a substantial question regarding validity,the district court should find that the patentee has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits.see entegris,pall.
on appeal,the sole issue raised by dupont is whether the district court correctly held that macdermid raised a substantial question of validity based on the uncertainty as to whether the application was entitled to claim priority to the provisional application.we find that this conclusion was an abuse of discretion because based on the undisputed facts contained in the prosecution history,the application was entitled to the filing date of the provisional application as a matter of law 
e states in relevant part 
an application for patent for an invention disclosed in the manner provided by the first paragraph of section of this title in a provisional application,by an inventor or inventors named in the provisional application,shall have the same effect,as to such invention,as though filed on the date of the provisional application if the application for patent is filed not later than months after the date on which the provisional application was filed and if it contains or is amended to contain a specific reference to the provisional application.
under this section,four requirements must be met for a application to claim priority to a provisional application the provisional must comply with the requirements of section,first paragraph,and the must be for the same invention the must be filed within twelve months of the provisional there must be an overlap of inventorship and the must include a specific reference to the provisional.it is undisputed that the first two requirements were met in this case.the provisional and applications had the same written description and claims,and the application was filed within a year of the provisional application the provisional was filed on march,and the was filed on february.macdermid argues,however,that the latter two requirements overlap of inventorship and specific reference were not met.
the facts underlying macdermid arguments,however,are not disputed,the extent of the overlap of inventorship and the language contained in the application referencing the provisional application.the only issue is the legal significance of these facts,whether the application is entitled to claim the priority date of the provisional application.determination of the priority date,the effective filing date is purely a question of law if the facts underlying that determination are undisputed.see broadcast innovation,charter commc n.
here,the district court gave two reasons why a substantial question of validity was present dupont had provided insufficient evidence to show that it was entitled to the priority date of the provisional application and the conflict in dupont statements as to the critical date initially conceding the effective filing date as that of the application but then later arguing that the effective filing date should be that of the provisional application.neither of these concerns was warranted.
first,it is unclear what necessary evidence the district court thought was missing from the preliminary injunction record.in responding to the motion for preliminary injunction,macdermid provided the district court with the patent prosecution history including the ads containing the reference to the provisional application,and dupont complaint included as an attachment the certificate of correction which corrected the patent to include a reference to the provisional application.we see no evidentiary deficiency that prevented the district court from resolving this issue.
additionally,since the facts underlying the priority determination are undisputed,dupont counsel conflicting characterization of those facts is immaterial to the legal analysis and can not serve to create a substantial question of validity dupont counsel candidly admitted at oral argument in this appeal that the initial concession of a later priority date was based on an oversight,but that the oversight was corrected as soon as it was discovered.such inconsistent attorney argument standing alone can not create a substantial question as to a purely legal issue when the undisputed facts necessary to resolve the legal issue are before the court.
we thus conclude that the district court reliance on lack of evidence and conflicting attorney argument to find a substantial question of validity was an abuse of discretion.because the facts that dupont contends entitle the patent to the effective filing date of the provisional application are not disputed,we can resolve this question in the first instance.
overlap of inventorship 
macdermid argues that the patent can not claim priority to the provisional application because the provisional application named only one inventor,whereas the issued patent names five inventors.because the provisional and applications were identical,the argument goes,they should have named the same inventors,or dupont should have at least amended the provisional application to name additional inventors.d if the name or names of an inventor or inventors were omitted in a provisional application through error without any deceptive intention on the part of the omitted inventor or inventors,the provisional application may be amended to add the name or names of the omitted inventor or inventors.according to macdermid,overlap of at least one inventor is insufficient because all patent applications,including provisional applications,need to be made in the names of the true inventors.we disagree.
this court has held that for a utility application to be affor
