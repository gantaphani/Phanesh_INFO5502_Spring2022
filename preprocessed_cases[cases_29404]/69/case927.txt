zoltek is a missouri corporation that manufactures and sells carbon fiber.sp are british corporations that manufacture a strong,building material produced using carbon fiber called prepreg.prepreg is made by weaving carbon fiber into sheets and then impregnating the sheets with liquid resin.the prepreg sheets are then sold to builders who can mold them into different shapes for a variety of applications.used in this way,prepreg is a common substitute for fiberglass.one common application for prepreg is the manufacture of wind energy turbine blades.
the parties entered into a supply agreement in november.under the disputed agreement,zoltek promised to manufacture and sell to sp all of sp requirements between november,and december,for large filament count carbon fibers carbon fibers as defined by panex specifications,at market price.sp,in turn,promised to obtain their total requirements for suitable quality,in the reasonable opinion of sp,carbon fibers from zoltek,the volume not to exceed the amount actually purchased by sp in the preceding contract year plus one million pounds.large filament count,or carbon fiber,contains or more filaments per bundle.carbon fiber,by contrast,contains fewer than filaments per bundle,commonly or fewer filaments per bundle.is more expensive to produce,but superior in quality.
when the supply agreement was formed,most manufacturers used carbon fiber.the purpose of the agreement was to develop a new market for fiber as a less expensive alternative to fiber in the industry.
before april,zoltek produced a carbon fiber product called panex.sp purchased and pounds of panex from zoltek under the supply agreement in and,respectively.sp placed an order for pounds of panex in,but returned it due to alleged quality defects.in april,zoltek stopped manufacturing panex,and started making a carbon fiber product called panex.sp ordered no panex or in.sp ordered and received pounds of panex in.
the dispute in this case centers on two orders that sp placed with zoltek in and that were never filled.sp ordered pounds of panex in,and claims that it was entitled to pounds of panex in.
on february,sp sued zoltek for breach of contract alleging lost profits through december,and future lost profits through december.because the parties disputed whether the supply agreement entitled sp to both panex and panex,sp damages expert made alternative lost profit calculations in lost profits under count i corresponding to pounds of panex,and in lost profits under count ii corresponding to pounds of panex.
on november,a jury awarded sp lost profits under both counts through december,but declined to award sp future lost profits.the district court vacated the award under count ii as duplicative,giving sp a final sum of.zoltek filed motions under federal rule of civil procedure a for a new trial,and under rule b for judgment as a matter of law,in connection with both the liability and damages phases of the proceedings,and the district court denied both motions.zoltek appeals the district court denial of those motions.sp the district court vacation of the jury award under count ii of the complaint.

zoltek argues that the district court erred in four ways.first,zoltek argues that the district court erred by refusing to allow it to raise two arguments to the jury.zoltek sought to urge that the supply agreement was void for lack of mutuality of obligation.the district court concluded that zoltek argument was an affirmative defense,which zoltek waived by failing to plead it,and the district court then denied as untimely zoltek motion to amend its complaint to add a mutuality defense.second,the district court ruled that zoltek failed to make a submissible case that sp had abandoned the supply agreement.third,zoltek argues that the district court failed to remedy unfairly prejudicial testimony at trial.fourth,zoltek argues that the jury damages award to sp was not based on adequate evidence,that the district court erred by allowing sp to amend its damages calculations days before trial,that sp revised damages calculations were inadequate as a matter of law,and that the district court instructed the jury incorrectly in connection with the damages phase of the proceedings.
we first consider zoltek objection to the district court resolution of arguments concerning mutuality of obligation.zoltek urged that the supply agreement was unenforceable as a requirements contract due to a lack of mutuality,which is in essence an argument that sp failed to show that the supply agreement was supported by valid consideration.see restatement second of contracts if the requirement of consideration is met,there is no additional requirement of mutuality of obligation.usa chem,lewis,famous brands,david sherman,cir.we conclude that whether or not zoltek contention should not have been characterized as an affirmative defense,the district court correctly ruled in the alternative that the supply agreement contained mutuality as a matter of law.
sp contends that our decision in overholt crop ins.serv.travis,cir,establishes that lack of consideration is an affirmative defense that is waived if not raised in an answer.overholt held that it was unnecessary to reach the merits of an argument that certain restrictive covenants in a contract were void for lack of consideration,because the defendants waived this affirmative defense by failing to raise it in their answer,see.c,and by failing to identify any relevant exceptions to this general rule.id.at.zoltek counters with our statement in first union bank pictet overseas trust,cir,that whether a contention is an affirmative defense is a question of state law,id.at,and with missouri authority that distinguishes between failure of consideration,which is an affirmative defense applicable where consideration that once existed becomes worthless or,and lack of consideration,which is an element of the claim that can not be waived through failure to plead.ennis mclaggan,mfa dettler.
assuming for the sake of argument that zoltek argument regarding lack of consideration need not be pleaded as an affirmative defense,we agree with the district court that the supply agreement was supported by adequate consideration as a matter of law.under missouri law,whether consideration is sufficient to establish a contract is normally a question of law for the court and not a question of fact for the jury.allison agribank,fcb.missouri law long has followed a rule that w hen a party relies upon a writing or a number of writings to establish a contract,it is unquestionably the province of the court to determine from the writing or writings whether or not a contract was entered into.nelson cal hirsch sons iron rail.
zoltek advances three reasons why the contract lacked mutuality of obligation.all three are based on an allegation that sp requirements under the agreement are hopelessly manipulable and determined by sp subjective preferences,rather than by objective criteria outside of sp control.specifically,zoltek argues that sp could at all times order or not order zoltek fiber as it wanted because sp had zero requirements for fiber when the contract was formed,the price protection clause gave sp the option to purchase carbon fibers from other producers whenever sp wanted to,and sp was free to buy fiber,which zoltek alleges is interchangeable with fiber,in place of whenever it pleased.
first,we disagree with zoltek that the supply agreement lacks mutuality if sp had zero requirements for fiber when the contract was formed.a duty of good faith is implied in requirements contracts under missouri law,see.home shopping club,roberts broad,and this implied obligation of good faith is enough to avoid finding a contract null and void due to an illusory promise.magruder quarry,briscoe,see also national refining cox.the supply agreement bound sp to order product from zoltek in good faith,and if sp failed to purchase anything from zoltek during the term of the agreement,then the contract allowed zoltek to allege that sp acted in bad faith by failing to make purchases.an assertion of bad faith,however,is an argument that sp breached the agreement,not that the agreement lacked mutuality or consideration in the first place.the district court ruling on zoltek proposed defense did not foreclose it from arguing to the jury that sp breached the agreement.
second,we disagree with zoltek that the price protection clause in the contract made sp obligation illusory.the price protection clause gave zoltek a right of first refusal to sell carbon fiber to sp for the same price as offered by a third party seller.if zoltek offered to match the price offered by another supplier,then sp was obligated to purchase from zoltek.we think the missouri courts are likely to agree with the observation in a leading treatise that this mechanism does not render the contract illusory 
the seller may not promise to meet such prices,but the seller may be given the option of doing so.if the seller meets such prices,the buyer must buy of the seller or not at all.if the seller does not meet such prices,the buyer has the privilege of buying elsewhere.such promises are not illusory and the contract is valid.
arthur linton corbin,et,corbin on contracts.
zoltek authorities do not persuade us to the contrary.they demonstrate only that if sp had an unfettered option to purchase from another supplier during the term of the contract,then this option would destroy the exclusivity of the arrangement,and demonstrate lack of consideration,in re modern dairy of champaign,cir harvey fearless farris wholesale,cir loizeaux builders supply donald ludwig,propane,general motors.the inclusion in the supply agreement of a right of first refusal for zoltek to retain its exclusive right to supply sp,so long as it matched a market price offered by another supplier,is sufficient to create mutuality of obligation and consideration.
third,we do not agree with zoltek that if and fiber are interchangeable,then the supply agreement lacked mutuality.there was a good deal of evidence at trial that and fiber are distinct products,with different qualities and applications.but assuming for the sake of argument that a jury could find that and fibers are in fact interchangeable,as zoltek contends,the authorities cited by zoltek do not establish that the supply agreement is void for lack of mutuality.these cases illustrate,rather,that when a buyer contracts to purchase its requirements for a product from a particular seller,but a good faith basis to do an interchangeable product from a third party instead,the buyer may have breached the requirements contract,fike great lakes chemical,cir empire gas american bakeries,cir loudenback fertilizer.phosphate,cir.zoltek was free to argue on this basis that sp purchase of fiber from parties other than zoltek was a breach of the agreement to purchase fiber exclusively from zoltek,but the jury found that sp performed its obligations under the contract.sp obligation to purchase in good faith all of its requirements for fiber exclusively from zoltek was sufficient consideration to make the contract valid.
for these reasons,we agree with the district court alternative holding that on the face of the agreement,there is mutuality of obligation and,therefore,consideration.therefore,any error in characterizing lack of consideration as an affirmative defense or in denying zoltek motion to amend its complaint did not prejudice zoltek.
zoltek next contends that the district court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on zoltek theory that sp had abandoned the supply agreement.zoltek asked the court to give an instruction that the jury verdict must be for zoltek if the parties,by their conduct,treated the supply agreement as if it were no longer in effect,and thereby abandoned the supply agreement.zoltek app.the district court refused the proposed instruction,and later stood by its decision in orders.in denying zoltek motion for judgment as a matter of law,the court explained that zoltek argued in its trial brief that plaintiffs abandoned the agreement,that zoltek argued for the first time in its motion that the parties mutually abandoned the supply agreement.the court ruled that it would not address an argument raised for the first time in a motion.doc,at 
under missouri law,whether abandonment is an issue for the court or the jury depends on the nature of the argument advanced by the party claiming abandonment.when an abandonment by one party to a contract is predicated of certain specific acts,or one given act,it is proper for the court to declare whether such act or acts constitute an abandonment.chouteau jupiter iron works,chouteau i.thus,it was error for the trial court in henry bassett,to submit to a jury the question whether a contract was abandoned or not,id.at,where no mutual agreement of abandonment was alleged,but it was charged that the plaintiff,henry,had abandoned the contract by taking certain specific acts.chouteau i,at.in that circumstance,the trial court should have declared whether the specified acts of the plaintiff were sufficient to constitute an abandonment.henry,at.
by contrast,where a mutual agreement to abandon is relied upon,it may be proved by an express agreement to that effect,or by circumstances which warrant the inference,that the parties mutually agreed to abandon it.chouteau i,at.if certain acts by one party are insufficient by themselves to constitute abandonment,then the jury should be so instructed,and the failure to do so is reversible error,id.at,but the question of mutual abandonment should be submitted to a jury,if the evidence on the whole is sufficient to support a finding of abandonment.chouteau jupiter,chouteau ii see bacon boss,citing chouteau ii.to be proved under missouri law,a mutual abandonment must be demonstrated by positive and unequivocal acts and conduct which are inconsistent with a mutual intention to be further bound by the contract.waddington wick,see gere technical,daniel joint venture,cir missouri law.
in the district court,zoltek argued that sp abandoned the supply agreement when it purchased no carbon fiber from zoltek between february and early.we agree with the district court that the absence of orders by sp,even over a period of more than two years,is insufficient to demonstrate a mutual abandonment of the supply agreement.a buyer under a requirements contract may,consistent with the contract,reduce its requirements even to zero,as long as the buyer is acting in good faith.see cmt.reasonable elasticity in the requirements is expressly envisaged by this section and good faith variations from prior requirements are permitted even when the variation may be such as to result in discontinuance.that a buyer does so,therefore,is not a positive and unequivocal act demonstrating abandonment,and the district court was correct to conclude that sp acts did not constitute an abandonment.the jury,moreover,found that sp performed its obligations under the supply agreement,thus rejecting any suggestion that sp failure to order carbon fiber in and was a breach of the contract,much less an abandonment.
on appeal,zoltek contends that a agreement for panex,signed by the parties in april,superseded the supply agreement and demonstrated a mutual intent of the parties to abandon the contract.this argument,however,was not presented in the district court,and we therefore decline to consider it.prior to the jury verdict,zoltek never cited the contract as evidence of mutual abandonment.zoltek argued instead that the agreement for panex showed that the supply agreement did not include panex.tr.the district court,therefore,correctly observed that zoltek advanced a contention of mutual abandonment for the first time in its motions.the court properly declined to instruct the jury on abandonment based on the arguments then presented,and zoltek subsequent reliance on the contract comes too late to support a conclusion that the district court instructions were erroneous.
zoltek next contends that the district court admitted irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial evidence at trial.we review the district court evidentiary decisions for abuse of discretion.hoselton metz baking,cir.zoltek focuses on sp use of a statement made by zoltek attorney,alan kohn,at a preliminary injunction hearing.in opposing sp motion for an injunction that would have required zoltek to provide sp with panex,kohn stated t hey have no contract for panex.all they have is some old panex contract which zoltek is ready,willing and able to perform.zoltek app.in later proceedings,sp quoted kohn statement,over zoltek repeated objections,and argued that it was an admission by zoltek that the supply agreement entitled sp at least to a supply of panex.zoltek contends that the kohn statement was taken out of context and used to mislead the jury.
the district court allowed sp to quote the kohn statement,but also gave zoltek an opportunity to present evidence to place the statement in what zoltek argued was the proper context.zoltek ceo testified that the quotation from kohn was a mischaracterization of what he said,and that i n balance,what kohn said was reasonable.he testified that kohn meant that there was a failed or an old contract which zoltek would be ready,willing,and able to perform against if it had not been breached by multiple breaches,but that kohn unfortunate single statement by itself is not representative of what should have been said.tr.emphasis added.
a statement by a party attorney can be admissible as an admission by a party opponent if it is relevant.harris steelweld equip,cir.given the context in which kohn made his statement,the district court concluded that kohn statement was relevant as an admission that zoltek was willing to perform under the supply agreement by producing panex to sp 
there was no misinterpretation.i understood exactly what he said to me at that hearing so you can characterize it any number of ways that you want to.but when i left that hearing,i thought that panex was going to be supplied to the plaintiffs but not,as they had asked for now,that was my impression and i think it was a reasonable impression and a reasonable conclusion to draw,based on what was said during that hearing.
the court conclusion that kohn statement was relevant on this basis was not an abuse of discretion.although the specific issue presented in the preliminary injunction hearing was whether zoltek was required to provide panex,kohn relied on zoltek asserted willingness to provide panex in an effort to persuade the court to deny the motion.having made the statement in an effort to gain advantage in the litigation,we do not think zoltek can establish that the district court abused its discretion by permitting sp to invoke counsel statement as a potential admission.the district court adequately guarded against any unfair prejudice by permitting zoltek ceo to place kohn statement in what zoltek believed to be the proper context,and to offer a mitigating explanation for kohn comment.
kohn argument is different from the attorney statement that was held to be irrelevant and inadmissible in schneider lockheed aircraft.in that case,the purported admission was made in the context of litigation involving a defendant complaint for indemnity and contribution.the disputed statement by counsel was prefaced with a caveat that the allegations at issue were assumed to be true for purposes of a motion to dismiss the complaint.the court in schneider held that pleadings were excepted from the general rule of admissibility,because t he goals of efficient federal procedure would be frustrated if hypothetical pleadings from proceedings could be introduced into evidence.id.at.the court reasoned that the purely contingent statements concerning the complaint were irrelevant to the issues in the underlying lawsuit.the statement by zoltek counsel,of course,was not made in the context of a pleading,and it was not the sort of hypothetical assumption involved in a defendant complaint for contribution and indemnity.we therefore conclude that schneider is distinguishable,and that the district court ruling was not reversible error 
zoltek argues that the jury damages award to sp was based on impermissible speculation and other improper grounds.zoltek contends that sp damages calculations were based only on summaries of lost sales provided by sp management,conversations with sp management,and projected sales from sp budgets,and that none of these sources were sufficiently reliable to support the jury verdict.

we conclude that the jury award in this case was adequately supported by the record.sp damages expert,donna smith,calculated sp lost profits based primarily on a document created by sp director called summary of vestas and gamesa lost sales,budget figures kept in the ordinary course of business by sp,conversations with sp management,deposition testimony of zoltek personnel,and zoltek annual reports and investor presentations.smith testified that the method and sources she used to calculate sp lost profits was generally accepted by experts in this field.zoltek had an opportunity to challenge smith assertion that her sources were consistent with professionally accepted standards,and to dispute the reliability of the underlying factual information on which she relied.the sources were not so slight as to be fundamentally unsupported,and the weight to be given smith opinion was properly left to the jury.
the district court reasoned that smith compared the sales projections provided by sp managing director with actual purchases,and found that the amounts were substantially equal.relying in part on zoltek own projection that demand for fiber was expected to exceed supply for years to come,smith testified that sp could have processed and sold all of the panex to which it was entitled to under the supply agreement.s
