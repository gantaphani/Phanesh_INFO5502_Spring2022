plaintiffs filed a class action suit against alleging sexual discrimination under title vii of the civil rights act.the district court certified the class with minor modifications to plaintiffs proposed class.we have jurisdiction under e.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court,concluding that it did not abuse its discretion when it certified the class.
background 
plaintiffs third amended complaint,brought on behalf of six named plaintiffs and all others similarly situated,asserts claims against for sex discrimination under title vii of the civil rights act.plaintiffs allege that women employed in stores are paid less than men in comparable positions,despite having higher performance ratings and greater seniority,and receive wait longer to management positions than men.plaintiffs contend that strong,centralized structure fosters or facilitates gender stereotyping and discrimination,that the policies and practices underlying this discriminatory treatment are consistent throughout stores,and that this discrimination is common to all women who work or have worked in stores.
on april,plaintiffs filed a motion to certify a nationwide class of women who have been subjected to allegedly discriminatory pay and promotions policies.the proposed class consists of women employed in a range of hourly employees to salaried is estimated to include more than million women.the class seeks injunctive and declaratory relief,back pay,and punitive damages,but does not seek traditional compensatory damages.
plaintiffs proposed that the district court certify the following class pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure 
all women employed at any domestic retail store at any time since december,who have been or may be subjected to challenged pay and management track promotions policies and practices.
dukes stores,dukes i.
on september,after the parties had conducted extensive discovery and filed copious briefs,the district court heard oral argument.at the hearing,emphasized the historic nature of plaintiffs motion,inasmuch as it concerns a class of approximately million women who work or worked in one or more of stores in regions at any time since.the court acknowledged concerns but noted that,while the class size was large,the issues were not unusual.
district court proceedings 
on june,the district court issued an order granting in part and denying in part plaintiffs motion for class certification.see dukes i,at.with respect to plaintiffs claims for equal pay,the district court granted plaintiffs motion as to issues of alleged discrimination and all forms of requested relief.with respect to plaintiffs promotion claim,the court finding was mixed.the court certified the proposed class with respect to issues of alleged discrimination including liability for punitive damages,as well as injunctive and declaratory relief however,the court rejected the proposed class with respect to the request for back pay because data relating to the challenged promotions were not available for all class members.both parties appealed.
ii.the appeal 
pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f,appealed,contending that the district court erred by concluding that the class met rule a commonality and typicality requirements eliminating ability to respond to individual plaintiff claims and failing to recognize that plaintiffs claims for monetary relief predominated over their claims for injunctive or declaratory relief.plaintiffs,asserting that the district court erroneously limited the backpay relief for many of plaintiffs promotion claims.
discussion 
standard and scope of review 
we review a district court decision regarding class certification for abuse of discretion.see staton boeing,cir.the district court decision to certify a class is subject to very limited review and will be reversed only upon a strong showing that the district court decision was a clear abuse of discretion.armstrong davis,cir citation omitted see also gonzales free speech,cir abuse of discretion is a highly deferential standard,under which the appellate court can not substitute its view of what constitutes substantial justification for that of the district court rather,the review is limited to assuring that the district court determination has a basis in reason.citation omitted blyden mancusi,cir a district court decision to certify a class is reviewed for abuse of discretion,and a reviewing court must exercise even greater deference when the district court has certified a class than when it has declined to do so.citation omitted doninger pac.nw.bell,cir j udgment of the trial court should be given the greatest respect and the broadest discretion citation omitted.a court abuses its discretion if it applies an impermissible legal criterion.see molski gleich,cir.moreover,the district court factual findings as to the applicability of rule criteria are entitled to the traditional deference given to such determinations.see local joint executive trust fund las vegas sands,cir citation omitted.
rule provides district courts with broad discretion to determine whether a class should be certified,and to revisit that certification throughout the legal proceedings before the court.see armstrong davis,cir.if later evidence disproves plaintiffs contentions that common issues predominate,the district court can at that stage modify or decertify the class,see.of sw.falcon,d even after a certification order is entered,the judge remains free to modify it in light of subsequent developments in the litigation,or use a variety of management devices to address the individualized issues that have arisen,see in re visa antitrust,cir newberg on class actions at to 
our review is limited to whether the district court correctly selected and applied rule criteria.see bogus am.speech hearing ass,cir waste mgmt.holdings,mowbray,cir an abuse occurs when a court,in making a discretionary ruling,relies upon an improper factor,omits consideration of a factor entitled to substantial weight,or mulls the correct mix of factors but makes a clear error of judgment in assaying them.thus,if plaintiffs demonstrate that they meet rule requirements,they should be allowed to pursue their action as a class.see smilow sw.bell mobile,cir there is even less reason to decertify a class where the possible existence of individual damages issues is a matter of conjecture.
ii.class certification and rule 
a district court may certify a class only if the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable there are questions of law and fact common to the class the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class and the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.a.
the district court must also find that at least one of the following three conditions are satisfied the prosecution of separate actions would create a risk of a inconsistent or varying adjudications or b individual adjudications dispositive of the interests of other members not a party to those adjudications the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class or the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.see.b.
the party seeking certification bears the burden of showing that each of the four requirements of rule a and at least one requirement of rule b have been met.see zinser accufix research,amended,cir.
the class in this case is broad and diverse.it encompasses approximately million employees,both salaried and hourly,with a range of positions,who are or were employed at one or more of stores across the country.plaintiffs contend,and the district court found,that the large class is united by a complex array of discriminatory practices against women.
numerosity 
rule a requires that the class be so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.a.does not contest that numerosity is satisfied here,given that both parties estimate that the proposed class includes approximately million women.
commonality 
rule a requires that there are questions of law or fact common to the class.a.commonality focuses on the relationship of common facts and legal issues among class members.see,herbert newberg alba conte,newberg on class actions at ed.we noted in hanlon chrysler,cir 
rule a has been construed permissively.all questions of fact and law need not be common to satisfy the rule.the existence of shared legal issues with divergent factual predicates is sufficient,as is a common core of salient facts coupled with disparate legal remedies within the class.
the commonality test is qualitative rather than significant issue common to the class may be sufficient to warrant certification.see,savino computer credit,aff,cir see also newberg on class actions at.as the district court properly noted,plaintiffs may demonstrate commonality by showing that class members have shared legal issues by divergent facts or that they share a common core of facts but base their claims for relief on different legal theories.dukes i,at citing hanlon,at.
the district court found that plaintiffs had provided evidence sufficient to support their contention that significant factual and legal questions are common to all class members.after analyzing plaintiffs evidence,the district court stated 
plaintiffs have exceeded the permissive and minimal burden of establishing commonality by providing significant evidence of corporate practices and policies,which include a excessive subjectivity in personnel decisions,b gender stereotyping,and c maintenance of a strong corporate culture statistical evidence of gender disparities caused by discrimination and anecdotal evidence of gender bias.together,this evidence raises an inference that engages in discriminatory practices in compensation and promotion that affect all plaintiffs in a common manner.
dukes i,at.the court noted that raised a number of challenges to plaintiffs evidence of commonality but concluded that,in fact,most of these objections related not to the rule a requirement of commonality but to the ultimate merits of the case and thus should properly be addressed by a jury considering the merits rather than a judge considering class certification.see id.we agree we further conclude,as explained in more detail below,that it was within the district court discretion to find that the commonality prerequisite to class certification was satisfied.see.a.
significant proof of a corporate policy of discrimination 
plaintiffs presented four categories of evidence facts supporting the existence of policies and practices expert opinions supporting the existence of policies and practices and expert statistical evidence of gender disparities attributable to discrimination and anecdotal evidence from class members around the country of discriminatory attitudes held or tolerated by management.see dukes i,at.contends that this evidence is not sufficient to raise an inference of discrimination.
factual evidence 
plaintiffs presented evidence of uniform personnel and management structure across stores headquarters extensive oversight of store operations,policies governing pay and promotion decisions,and a strong,centralized corporate culture consistent disparities in every domestic region of the company.such evidence supports plaintiffs contention that operates a highly centralized company that promotes policies common to all stores and maintains a single system of oversight.does not challenge this evidence.
expert opinion 
plaintiffs presented evidence from william bielby,a sociologist,to interpret and explain the facts that suggest that has and promotes a strong corporate culture that may include gender stereotyping.bielby based his opinion on,among other things,managers deposition testimony organizational charts correspondence,memos,reports,and presentations relating to personnel policy and practice,diversity,and equal employment opportunity issues documents describing the culture and history of the company and a large body of social science research on organizational policy and practice and on workplace bias.
bielby testified that by employing a social framework analysis,he examined the distinctive features of policies and practices and evaluated them against what social science shows to be factors that create and sustain bias and those that minimize bias.in bielby opinion,social science research demonstrates that gender stereotypes are especially likely to influence personnel decisions when they are based on subjective factors,because substantial discretion tends to allow people to seek out and retain information and ignore or minimize information that defies stereotypes.dukes i,at.bielby concluded that centralized coordination,reinforced by a strong organizational culture,sustains uniformity in personnel policy and practice that there are significant deficiencies in equal employment policies and practices and that personnel policies and practices make pay and promotion decisions vulnerable to gender bias.see id.
challenges bielby third conclusion as vague and imprecise because he concluded that is vulnerable to bias or gender stereotyping but failed to identify a specific discriminatory policy at.specifically,contends that bielby testimony does not meet the standards for expert testimony set forth in federal rule of evidence and daubert merrell dow,daubert i,d,which held that a trial court must act as a gatekeeper in determining whether to admit or exclude expert evidence.
made an identical argument to the district court and the district court properly rejected it.did not and does not challenge bielby methodology or contend that his findings lack relevance because they do not relate to any issue in the case,daubert,at,but challenges only whether certain inferences can be persuasively drawn from his data.because daubert does not require a court to admit or exclude evidence based on its persuasiveness,but rather,requires a court to admit or exclude evidence based on its scientific reliability and relevance,id.at.evidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence citing,and relevance standard is a liberal one,testing bielby testimony for daubert reliability would not have addressed objections.it would have simply revealed what itself has admitted and courts have long accepted that properly analyzed social science data,like that offered by bielby,may add probative value to plaintiffs class action claims.see price waterhouse hopkins,d considering similar evidence offered by expert social psychologist.
accordingly,contention that the district court was required to subject bielby testimony to the daubert test,simply because the conclusion he reached seemed unpersuasive absent certain corroborating evidence,is misplaced.see daubert,at.the focus,of course,must be solely on principles and methodology,not on the conclusions that they generate.while a jury may ultimately agree with that,in the absence of a specific discriminatory policy promulgated by,it is hard to believe,based solely on bielby social science analysis,that engaged in actual gender discrimination,that question must be left to the merits stage of the litigation.at the class certification stage,it is enough that bielby presented,scientifically reliable evidence tending to show that a common question of,does policy of decentralized,subjective employment decision making operate to discriminate against female employees exists with respect to all members of the class this he did and,thus,we find no error in the district court acceptance of bielby evidence to support its finding of commonality.
statistical evidence 
it is that commonality may be established by raising an inference of discrimination through the use of statistical analysis.see caridad,at,overruled on other grounds by in re ipo,at see also stastny bell,cir recognizing that statistical data showing comparable disparities experienced by protected employees may raise an inference of a policy or practice of discrimination.
richard drogin,plaintiffs statistician,analyzed data at a regional level.he ran separate regression analyses for each of the regions containing stores he concluded that there are statistically significant disparities between men and women at in terms of compensation and promotions,that these disparities are across regions,and that they can be explained only by gender discrimination.dukes i,at.marc bendick,plaintiffs labor economics expert,conducted a study comparing with twenty of its competitors and concluded that promotes a smaller percentage of women than its competitors see id.
challenges drogin findings and faults his decision to conduct his research on the regional level,rather than analyze the data.however,the proper test of whether workforce statistics should be viewed at the macro regional or micro store or level depends largely on the similarity of the employment practices and the interchange of employees at the various facilities.see kirkland new york state of corr,cir recognizing that the focus of analysis depends on nature of defendant employment practices barbara lindemann paul grossman,employment discrimination law,ed.
here,drogin explained that a analysis would not capture the effect of district,regional,and control over uniform compensation policies and procedures the dissemination of uniform compensation policies and procedures resulting from the frequent movement of store managers or strong corporate culture.because drogin provided a reasonable explanation for conducting his research at the regional level,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it credited drogin analysis and concluded that his analysis supported plaintiffs contention that corporate structure and policies led to a pattern or practice of discrimination.
also contends that the district court erred by not finding statistical evidence more probative than plaintiffs evidence because,according to,its analysis was conducted.however,contrary to characterization of its analysis,its research was not conducted at the individual store level.joan haworth,expert,did not conduct a analysis instead she reviewed data at the level by comparing departments to analyze the pay differential between male and female hourly employees moreover,our job on this appeal is to determine whether the district court abused its discretion in finding that,based on all the evidence presented,there existed common questions of fact sufficient to justify class certification.see armstrong,at free speech coalition,at.our job is not to the relative probativeness of the commonality evidence ourselves.thus,even if we were to find,based on an independent review of the record,that statistical evidence was more persuasive than plaintiffs which we do not,in any alone would not allow us to find that the district court improperly relied on drogin testimony as a valid component of its commonality analysis or that the district court erred in its ultimate conclusion that the commonality prerequisite was satisfied.
because the district court reasonably concluded that drogin regional analysis was probative and based on scientific principles,because provided little or no proper legal or factual challenge to it and because the district court was within its discretion when it found that haworth was stricken for failing to satisfy the standards of federal rules of evidence and did not undermine or contradict drogin evidence as insisted,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it relied on drogin use and interpretation of statistical data as a valid component of its commonality analysis.
anecdotal evidence 
circumstantial and anecdotal evidence of discrimination is commonly used in title vii pattern and practice cases to bolster statistical proof by bringing the cold numbers convincingly to life.int l of teamsters united states,d see also rudebusch,at.contends that the district court erred by concluding that the anecdotal evidence,presented by plaintiffs in the form of declarations,supported a finding of commonality maintains that the declarations depict a handful of widely divergent events that can not be deemed probative or representative of discrimination in pay or promotions.
in their declarations,the potential class members testified to being paid less than similarly situated men,being denied or delayed in receiving promotions in a disproportionate manner when compared with similarly situated men,working in an atmosphere with a strong corporate culture of discrimination,and being subjected to various individual sexist acts.the district court credited this evidence.
contends that the district court erred because the declarations can not sufficiently represent a class of million.however,we find no authority requiring or even suggesting that a plaintiff class submit a statistically significant number of declarations for such evidence to have any value.further,the district court did not state that this anecdotal evidence provided sufficient proof to establish commonality by itself,but rather noted that such evidence provides support for plaintiffs contention that commonality is present.see dukes i,at this anecdotal evidence,in combination with the other evidence previously discussed,further supports an inference that policies and procedures have the effect of discriminating against plaintiffs in a common manner.because the declarations raise an inference of common discriminatory experiences and are consistent with plaintiffs statistical evidence,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it credited plaintiffs anecdotal evidence.
subjective 
as discussed above,the district court found substantial evidence suggesting common pay and promotion policies among many stores.see dukes i,at.the court also reasoned that decision to permit its managers to utilize subjectivity in interpreting those policies offers additional support for a commonality finding.see id.relying on sperling roche,challenges the latter conclusion,contending that managers discretionary authority does not support a finding of commonality because d ecentralized,discretionary decisionmaking is not inherently discriminatory.
it is that subjective is a ready mechanism for discrimination and that courts should scrutinize it carefully.sengupta,cir.is correct that discretionary by itself is insufficient to meet plaintiffs burden of proof.the district court recognized this,noting that managerial discretion is but one of several factors that supported a finding of commonality.see dukes i,at and while the presence of excessive subjectivity,alone,does not necessarily create a common question of fact,where,as here,such subjectivity is part of a consistent corporate policy and supported by other evidence giving rise to an inference of discrimination,courts have not hesitated to find that commonality is satisfied.is incorrect,however,that decentralized,subjective decisionmaking can not contribute to an inference of discrimination.indeed,courts from around the country have found a llegations of similar discriminatory employment practices,such as the use of entirely subjective personnel processes that operate to discriminate,sufficient to satisfy the commonality and typicality requirements of rule a.shipes,at see also supra note and cases cited therein.
plaintiffs produced substantial evidence of centralized company culture and policies,see dukes i,at,thus providing a nexus between the subjective and the considerable statistical evidence demonstrating a pattern of discriminatory pay and promotions for female employees,see id.at see also reid lockheed martin aeronautics,recognizing that subjective may give rise to an inference of discrimination where there is evidence to provide a nexus between the subjective and discrimination.therefore,for the reasons stated above,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it held that subjective policy raises an inference of discrimination,and provides support for plaintiffs contention that commonality exists among possible class members.
conclusion 
plaintiffs factual evidence,expert opinions,statistical evidence,and anecdotal evidence demonstrate that female employees nationwide were subjected to a single set of corporate policies not merely a number of independent discriminatory acts that may have worked to unlawfully discriminate against them in violation of title vii.evidence of subjective decision making policies provide further evidence of a common practice of discrimination.many other courts have reached the same conclusion based on similar evidence.see,caridad,at,overruled on other grounds by in re ipo,at staton,at shipes,at cox,at segar,at.accordingly,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the commonality prerequisite to class certification was satisfied.
typicality 
as an initial matter,plaintiffs contend that has waived a challenge to the district court typicality finding by failing to offer specific objections to the district court typicality finding.however,because refers,somewhat obliquely,to the typicality factor in its opening brief and because typicality and commonality are similar and tend to merge,see falcon,at,we conclude that did not waive its opportunity to challenge the district court findings with regard to typicality thus,although did not raise a specific challenge,it nevertheless raised a general objection to the district court conclusion that plaintiffs evidence satisfies the typicality requirement.as discussed below,to satisfy the typicality prerequisite,plaintiffs must demonstrate that their claims and their class representatives are sufficiently typical of the class.
plaintiffs claims are sufficiently typical 
rule a requires that the claims or defenses of the representative parties be typical of the claims or defenses of the class.a.we stated in hanlon that u nder the rule permissive standards,representative claims are typical if they are reasonably coextensive with those of absent class members they need not be substantially identical.at.some degree of individuality is to be expected in all cases,but that specificity does not necessarily defeat typicality.see staton,at.
thus,we must consider whether the injury allegedly suffered by the named plaintiffs and the rest of the class resulted from the same allegedly discriminatory practice.see id.we agree with the district court that it did.even though individual employees in different stores with different managers may have received different levels of pay or may have been denied promotion or promoted at different rates,because the discrimination they allegedly suffered occurred through an alleged common,excessively subjective in a corporate culture of uniformity and gender claims are sufficiently typical to satisfy rule a.
plaintiffs representatives are sufficiently typical of the class 
typicality requires that the named plaintiffs be members of the class they represent.see falcon,at.there is no dispute that the class representatives are typical of the hourly class members,because almost all of the class representatives hold hourly positions.instead,contends that the class representatives are not typical of all female managers because only one of six class representative holds a salaried management position,and she holds a somewhat position.
however,because all female employees faced the same alleged discrimination,the lack of a class representative for each management category does not undermine plaintiffs certification goal.see hartman duffey,recognizing that an employee can challenge discrimination in different job categories where the primary practices used to discriminate in the different categories are themselves similar.while it may be prudent to have the class divided into represented by a named plaintiff from each of the differing job categories,it would not be necessary to the validity of the class certification to do so.paxton union bank,cir holding that t ypicality is not defeated because of the varied promotional opportunities at issue,or the differing qualifications of plaintiffs and class members.
in addition,because the range of managers in the proposed class is limited to those working in stores,it is not a very broad class,and a named plaintiff occupying a,salaried,management position is sufficient to satisfy the permissive typicality requirement.staton,at recognizing that u nder the rule permissive standards,plaintiffs are not required to offer a class representative for each type of discrimination claim alleged quoting hanlon,at.
because plaintiffs claims and plaintiffs representatives are sufficiently typical of the class,the district court acted within its discretion when it found that plaintiffs satisfied the typicality prerequisite.
adequate representation 
rule a permits certification of a class action only if the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.a.this factor requires that the proposed representative plaintiffs do not have conflicts of interest with the proposed class,and that plaintiffs are represented by qualified and competent counsel.see hanlon,at see also molski,at.
before the district court,argued that plaintiffs can not satisfy this factor because of a conflict of interest between female managers who are both plaintiff class members and agents of.relying on staton,the district court recognized that courts need not deny certification of an employment class simply because the class includes both supervisory and employees.see dukes i,at see also staton,at.we agree.finally,because does not challenge the district court finding that plaintiffs class representatives and counsel are adequate,we need not analyze this factor.
conclusion 
based on the evidence before it,which the district court rigorously examined,see falcon,at.chamberlan ford motor,cir,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it found that the rule a elements were satisfied.
as mentioned earlier,plaintiffs moved to certify the class under rule b,which requires that plaintiffs show that the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class,thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief with respect to the class as a whole.b the district court agreed with plaintiffs.see dukes i,at resolution of this issue is governed by molski gleich,cir,which holds that b class actions can include claims for monetary damages so long as such damages are not the predominant relief sought,but instead are secondary to the primary claim for injunctive or declaratory relief.contends that the district court merely paid lip service to rule b and erred in certifying the class under rule b because claims for monetary relief predominate over claims for injunctive and declaratory relief.
rule b is not appropriate for all classes and does not extend to cases in which the appropriate final relief relates exclusively or predominantly to money damages.b,comm.notes to,see also zinser,at class certification under rule b is appropriate only where the primary relief sought is declaratory or injunctive.in molski we refused to adopt a rule distinguishing between incidental and nonincidental damages for the purposes of determining predominance because such a rule would nullify the discretion vested in the district courts through rule.molski,at.instead,we examine the specific facts and circumstances of each case,focusing predominantly on the plaintiffs intent in bringing the suit.see kanter,cir linney cellular alaska,cir.at a minimum,however,we must satisfy ourselves that even in the absence of a possible monetary recovery,reasonable plaintiffs would bring the suit to obtain the injunctive or declaratory relief sought and the injunctive or declaratory relief sought would be both reasonably necessary and appropriate were the plaintiffs to succeed on the merits.robinson,at,quoted with approval in molski,at.
unrebutted evidence does not undermine plaintiffs claim that injunctive and declaratory relief predominate 
first asserts that the district court failed to even evaluate rule b requirement that the challenged conduct be generally applicable to the class.maintains that its unrebutted statistics demonstrate that there is no evidence of pervasive discrimination that would justify injunctive relief and that,therefore,the challenged conduct does not affect all members.however,contention is not persuasive.as explained above,evidence was rebutted by plaintiffs to the extent that plaintiffs evidence and theories remain viable at this analysis stage.further,the issue before us is whether plaintiffs primary goal in bringing this action is to obtain injunctive relief not whether plaintiffs will ultimately prevail.see molski,at.consequently,can not derive support from this argument.
the size of plaintiffs damages request does not undermine plaintiffs claim that injunctive and declaratory relief predominate 
contends that monetary claims necessarily predominate because this case involves claims that may amount to billions of dollars.however,such a large amount is principally a function of size,and the predominance test turns on the primary goal of the the theoretical or possible size of the damage award.as the district court stated,
f ocusing on the potential size of a punitive damage award would have the perverse effect of making it more difficult to certify a class the more egregious the defendant conduct or the larger the defendant.such a result hardly squares with the remedial purposes of title vii.
dukes i,at.because has not shown that the size of the monetary request undermines plaintiffs claim that injunctive and declaratory relief predominate,we find that argument fails.
a request for backpay does not undermine plaintiffs claim that injunctive and declaratory relief predominate 
asserts that plaintiffs request for backpay weighs against certification because it proves that claims for monetary relief predominate.the district court reasoned that backpay is recoverable as an equitable,remedy in employment class actions notwithstanding its monetary nature.dukes i,at.contends that the district court erroneously deemed backpay equitable and erred by failing to recognize that backpay,whether equitable or not,is still a form of monetary relief.
while the district court was correct in labeling back pay as an equitable remedy available under title vii,see a referencing g,any suggestion that back pay status as an equitable remedy somehow prevents it from also being a form of monetary relief for purposes of rule b is incorrect.back pay is certainly not of an injunctive nature or of a corresponding declaratory nature,fed.civ.proc.b,advisory committee notes,and thus plaintiffs request for back pay weighs against certification under rule b,its equitable nature notwithstanding.
that a request for back pay weighs against rule b certification,however,does not mean that certification under this rule is improper whenever back pay is requested.if it did,then the principal category of cases contemplated by the advisory committee as being certifiable under rule b,actions in the field where a party is charged with discriminating unlawfully against a class,fed.civ.proc.b,advisory committee no longer be eligible for b certification unless the class members agreed to forego the back pay remedy congress specifically made available to discrimination victims under title vii.this result would not only thwart legislative intent,but it would also put discrimination victims to the hobson choice of having to settle for only a partial remedy in order to proceed as a class action or having to bear the enormous costs of an individual lawsuit in order to receive the injunction plus back pay remedy authorized by title vii.it is unlikely the congress that approved both rule b and intended to put discrimination victims to such a choice.
accordingly,while plaintiffs request for back pay does weigh against class certification under rule b,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded,like many courts before it,that this discrimination class action was certifiable under rule b notwithstanding plaintiffs prayer for back pay relief.see,eubanks billington,i t is not uncommon in employment discrimination cases for the class to seek monetary relief in the form of back pay or front pay,in addition to injunctive or declaratory relief,and still be certified under rule b.as molski requires,we are satisfied that,even in the absence of a possible back pay recovery,reasonable plaintiffs would bring the suit to obtain an injunction against discriminatory employment practices and that such injunctive relief would be both reasonably necessary and appropriate if the plaintiffs succeed on the merits.molski,at.
a request for punitive damages does not undermine plaintiffs claim that injunctive and declaratory relief predominate 
while plaintiffs do not ask for compensatory damages in this case beyond the back pay just discussed,they do seek punitive damages to punish for its allegedly reckless disregard of the rights of its women employees to equal employment opportunity,and to deter similar misconduct by and other large retailers in the future.dukes i,at.contends that plaintiffs request for punitive damages is wholly inconsistent with rule b certification.this view,however,has not been adopted by this circuit and,if adopted,would thwart congressional intent for the same reasons as discussed with respect to plaintiffs request for back pay specifically,it would be to prevent victims of particularly egregious discrimination from simultaneously proceeding as a class action under rule b which was specifically designed to facilitate discrimination class seeking the punitive damages provided for under title vii.see a.therefore,we find that the district court acted within its discretion when it concluded that plaintiffs claims for punitive damages do not predominate over their claims for injunctive and declaratory relief.see molski,at robinson,at recognizing that a district court may certify class under b if it finds in its discretion that the positive weight or value of the injunctive relief sought is predominant even though punitive damages are claimed.
in addition,the district court order contains a provision to allow plaintiffs to of claims for punitive damages.see dukes i,at accordingly,notice and an opportunity to shall be provided to the plaintiff class with respect to plaintiffs claim for punitive damages.although there is no absolute right of in a rule b class,even where monetary relief is sought and made available,other courts have recognized that district courts should consider the possibility of rights.in re monumental life ins,cir jefferson ingersoll int l,cir see also ticor title ins,brown,d suggesting that provisions allowing plaintiffs to of damages claims may be appropriate where plaintiffs move to certify a class bringing a claim for punitive damages.we note that a district court discretion to include an provision is.see,in re monumental life ins,at noting that district courts have discretion to order notice and rights when certifying a rule b class robinson,at recognizing that notice and can be afforded b class members with respect to damage claims jefferson,at.
class certification may not be proper as to class members who were not employees as of the date plaintiffs complaint was filed 
final contention is that,because a substantial number of the putative class members no longer work for,thus,no longer have standing to seek injunctive or declaratory and declaratory relief can not possibly predominate over monetary relief for purposes of certifying this class under rule b.
we agree with to this extent those putative class members who were no longer employees at the time plaintiffs complaint was filed do not have standing to pursue injunctive or declaratory relief.see walsh.dep t of human,cir recognizing that former employees lack standing to seek injunctive relief because they would not stand to benefit from an injunction requiring the policies to cease at their former place of work am.civil liberties union of lomax,cir when evaluating whether the standing elements are present,we must look at the facts as they exist at the time the complaint was filed.quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d internal quotation marks omitted.under these circumstances,it is difficult to say that,even in the absence of a possible monetary recovery,reasonable plaintiffs who lack standing to seek injunctive or declaratory relief would nonetheless bring th is suit to obtain the injunctive or declaratory relief sought.molski,at quoting robinson,at.
this does not mean that the entire class must fall.those putative class members who were still employees as of june,when plaintiffs complaint was filed do have standing to seek the injunctive and declaratory relief requested in the complaint,see lomax,at,and we are satisfied that these putative class members would reasonably bring this suit to put an end to the practices they complain of even in the absence of a possible monetary recovery.we are also satisfied that,if these plaintiffs ultimately succeed on the merits,an injunction or declaratory judgment preventing from continuing to engage in unlawful employment discrimination would be both reasonably necessary and appropriate.molski,at quoting robinson,at.moreover,for the reasons explained in parts,we are confident that the primary relief sought by these plaintiffs remains declaratory and injunctive in nature notwithstanding their request to also be made whole in a monetary sense to the full extent provided for under title vii.accordingly,class certification under rule b was appropriate at least as to these plaintiffs.
we thus remand to the district court for a determination of the appropriate scope of the class in light of the above observation and in light of any evidence presented to it regarding which putative class members were still employees as of june.
iii.class action can proceed in a way that is both manageable and in accordance with due process 
the parties agree that this is the largest class certified in history.the district court was cognizant of this when it concluded that the class size,although large,was not unmanageable.see dukes i,at.indeed,the district court acknowledged that,while courts possess wide discretion to flexibly respond to manageability issues that may arise during the course of a class action,see,blackie barrack,cir,this court must be confident that such issues will not be of such a magnitude as to defy its ability to oversee this case in a responsible and reasonable manner.dukes i,at.after giv ing these matters considerable thought and deliberation,the district court concluded that,with one minor exception the size of the class would not present undue obstacles to managing this class action.id.
to demonstrate the manageability of the class action,the district court outlined a trial plan based,in large part,on how other courts have handled similarly large and complex class action suits and a number of amici contend that at least some aspects of this trial plan violate their due process rights,as well as section g of title vii the rules enabling act and the supreme court decision in teamsters united states,d.
at this stage,we express no opinion regarding objections to the district court tentative trial plan or that trial plan itself,but simply note that,because there are a range of may or may not include the district court proposed course of would allow this class action to proceed in a manner that is both manageable and in accordance with due process,manageability concerns present no bar to class certification here.
for example,in hilao estate of ferdinand marcos,cir,the district court employed the following procedure to determine the amount of compensatory damages due the plaintiffs in a large class action 
in all,claims were received.the district court ruled of these claims to be facially invalid,leaving claims.from these,a list of claims was randomly selected by computer.this number of randomly selected claims was chosen on the basis of the testimony of james dannemiller,an expert on statistics,who testified that the examination of a random sample of claims would achieve a percent statistical probability that the same percentage determined to be valid among the examined claims would be applicable to the totality of claims filed.
the district court then appointed sol schreiber as a special master and a expert under rule of the federal rules of evidence.schreiber supervised the taking of depositions of the randomly selected claimants 
schreiber then reviewed the claim s and recommended that claims of the in the sample be found not valid 
schreiber then recommended the amount of damages to be awarded to the remaining claimants 
based on his recommendation that of the claims in the random sample be rejected as invalid,he recommended the application of a invalidity rate to the remaining claims he recommended that the award to the class be determined by multiplying the number of valid remaining claims by the average award recommended for the claims by adding the recommended awards,schreiber arrived at a recommendation for a total compensatory damage award 
a jury trial on compensatory damages was then held dannemiller testified that the selection of the random sample met the standards of inferential statistics,that the successful efforts to locate and obtain testimony from the claimants in the random sample were of the highest standards in his profession,that the procedures followed conformed to the standards of inferential statistics,and that the injuries of the claimants were representative of the class as a whole.testimony from the claimants and their witnesses was introduced.schreiber testified as to his recommendations,and his report was supplied to the jury.the jury was instructed that it could accept,modify or reject schreiber recommendations and that it could independently,on the basis of the evidence of the claimants,reach its own judgment as to the actual damages of those claimants and of the aggregate damages suffered by the class as a whole.
the jury deliberated for five days before reaching a verdict.contrary to the master recommendations,the jury found against only two of the claimants in the random sample.as to the sample claims,the jury generally adopted the master recommendations,although it did not follow his recommendations in instances.as to the claims of the remaining class members,the jury adopted the awards recommended by the master.the district court subsequently entered judgment for of the claimants in the sample in the amounts awarded by the jury,and for the remaining plaintiffs in the amounts awarded by the jury,to be divided pro rata.
hilao,at footnotes omitted.
on appeal,the hilao court was presented with some of the same objections to its trial plan as presents here after a lengthy discussion,however,the hilao court rejected these challenges and approved of the trial plan,addressing the due process issue as follows 
while the district court methodology in determining valid claims is unorthodox,it can be justified by the extraordinarily unusual nature of this case.due process,unlike some legal rules,is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time,place and circumstances.cafeteria and restaurant workers union,local mcelroy,d 
the interest of the defendant that is affected is at best an interest in not paying damages for any invalid claims the statistical method used by the district court obviously presents a somewhat greater risk of error in comparison to an adversarial adjudication of each claim,since the former method requires a probabilistic prediction albeit an extremely accurate one of how many of the total claims are invalid hilao interest in the use of the statistical method,on the other hand,is enormous,since adversarial resolution of each class member claim would pose insurmountable practical hurdles.the ancillary interest of the judiciary in the procedure is obviously also substantial,since individual adversarial determinations of claim validity would clog the docket of the district court for years.under the balancing test set forth in mathews eldridge,d,and connecticut doehr,d,the procedure used by the district court did not violate due process.
hilao,at footnote omitted.
because we see no reason why a similar procedure to that used in hilao could not be employed in this case we conclude that there exists at least one method of managing this large class action that,albeit somewhat imperfect,nonetheless protects the due process rights of all involved parties accordingly,we find no reason to find this class unsuited to class certification.
conclusion 
for the reasons set forth above,we hold that the district court acted within its broad discretion in concluding that it would be better to handle this case as a class action instead of clogging the federal courts with innumerable individual suits litigating the same issues repeatedly.the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding the pleading requirements of rule satisfied,at least as to those plaintiffs who were still employees on june.failed to point to any specific management problems that would render a class action impracticable in this case,and the district court has the discretion to modify or decertify the class should it become unmanageable.although the size of this class action is large,mere size does not render a case unmanageable.
we deny plaintiffs,because the district court did not abuse its discretion when it found that back pay for promotions may be limited to those plaintiffs for whom proof of qualification and interest exists.finally,we must reiterate that our findings relate only to class action procedural questions we neither analyze nor reach the merits of plaintiffs allegations of gender discrimination.
i respectfully dissent.the majority new opinion does not solve the problems of its previous opinion.class action certification still violates rule,likely deprives many women who have been discriminated against of the money they are entitled to,and deprives of its constitutional rights to jury trial and due process of law.
class actions may not be brought in federal court unless they satisfy,among other things,the criteria of federal rule of civil procedure a 
the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable,there are questions of law or fact common to the class,the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class,and the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class 
these criteria are called,for short numerosity commonality typicality and adequacy of representation in the somewhat analogous case of general telephone of the southwest falcon the supreme court held that class certification had been inappropriate,where a who was not promoted had been allowed to sue on behalf of all applicants for employment.the court held that the rule requirements apply fully to title vii class actions,and rejected the tacit assumption underlying the rejected rule that all will be well for surely the plaintiff will win and manna will fall on all members of the class.
in this case,the only one of the four rule requirements that is satisfied is numerosity.in seeking to represent as large a class as imaginable,plaintiffs have destroyed their commonality,typicality,and adequacy of representation,as in many other attempted class certifications that have 
this class lacks commonality because the questions common to the class are insubstantial.the only common question plaintiffs identify with any precision is whether promotion criteria are excessively subjective.this is not a commonality with any clear relationship to sex discrimination in pay,promotions or terminations.plaintiffs sociologist claims merely that a subjective system is vulnerable to sex discrimination.but the supreme court recognized in watson fort worth bank trust that,although disparate impact analysis may be usable in subjective criteria cases,leaving promotion decisions to the unchecked discretion of lower level supervisors should itself raise no inference of discriminatory conduct because i t is that many jobs require personal qualities that have never been considered amenable to standardized testing.vulnerability to sex discrimination is not sex discrimination.
plaintiffs only evidence of sex discrimination is that around of employees are female,but only about of its managers are female.but as the supreme court recognized in watson,i t is entirely unrealistic to assume that unlawful discrimination is the sole cause of people failing to gravitate to jobs and employers in accord with the laws of chance.not everybody wants to be a manager.those women who want to be managers may find better opportunities elsewhere.plaintiffs statistics do not purport to compare women who want to be managers at with men who want to be managers at,just female and male employees,whether they want management jobs or not.
this class lacks typicality because the claims or defenses of the representative parties are not typical of the claims or defenses of the class.plaintiffs must show the existence of a class of persons who have suffered the same injury as themselves there are seven named plaintiffs here they are,with the gist of the claims they make in the complaint 
betty dukes african american female promoted to manager,then demoted in retaliation for discrimination complaints.did not apply for several slots filled by african american females,african american males,hispanic female,filipino male,and caucasian male because she was discouraged by discrimination against women.
patricia surgeson sexually harassed,replaced by a male who got a better title and more money,denied management opportunities,quit.
cleo page quickly promoted to manager,but denied a department manager position after being told it a man world.a caucasian female got the department manager position.page later got a different department manager position.but a caucasian male,a latina,and a caucasian female got other management positions she sought and she got paid less than a caucasian male with less seniority.
chris kwapnoski sought management positions given to less qualified men.manager made sexist remarks.
deborah gunter sought management positions given to less experienced males.males she trained were promoted instead of her.never got a management position.fired after complaining about discrimination and a reduction in her hours.
karen williamson sought management position but was never promoted,even though qualified.males got promotions that were not ed.
edith arana african american woman.sought management position but never promoted.store manager told her he did not want women.fired after falsely accused of stealing time in retaliation for her discrimination complaints.
typicality exists only if these seven women claims are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.they are not even typical with respect to each other,let alone with respect to the class of a ll women employed at any domestic retail store at any time since december,who have been or may be subjected to challenged pay and management track promotions policies and practices.some of the seven named plaintiffs and members of the putative class work for,some have quit,some have been fired.some claim sex discrimination,some claim mixed motive race and sex discrimination,some appear to claim only race discrimination.some claim retaliation,and some appear to claim unfairness but not discrimination.some of the seven plead a prima facie case,some do not.
nor are the defenses to the claims likely to be common even as to these seven,let alone all female employees.some are likely to be vulnerable to defenses such as misconduct,some are not.for example,defense to arana claim might be that she really did steal time,or that fired her because the manager concluded in good faith after reasonable investigation that she stole time.for dukes,the obvious potential defense is that they did promote her to manager and hoped for the best,but she did not do well.for kwapnoski,the defense may be no defense at all,just a money settlement and promotion.we can not know how the individual cases may proceed,but we can easily tell from the complaint that they will be different from each other as to both the claims and the defenses.whatever the vulnerability to sex discrimination of the corporate culture of this national corporation with no centralized system for promotion,the various plaintiffs claims and defenses against them do not resemble one another 
the fourth requirement under rule is that the seven named plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.the majority opinion and the district court give this little attention,no doubt because everyone knows that the lawyers,being without real clients who can instruct them if a class is certified,will run the case as they choose.based on their own descriptions of the wrongs done to them in the complaint,the interests of the seven named plaintiffs diverge from each other,as will the interests of other members of the class.women who still work at and who want promotions have an interest in the terms of an injunction.but an injunction and declaratory judgment can not benefit women who have quit or been fired and do not want to return.for them,compensatory and punitive damages are what matter.those who are managers,and many have female store managers,have interests in preserving their own managerial flexibility under whatever injunction may issue,while those who are not and do not want to be managers may not share this concern.those who face strong defenses,such as if they did indeed steal time or money,have a considerable interest in a fast,mass settlement,while those who have impressive performance records have an interest in pushing their individual cases to trial.
the class certification we are reviewing is pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.that is error because b certification is only available when injunctive and declaratory relief predominate.injunctive and declaratory relief can not possibly predominate for the women who will benefit from neither,because they no longer work at and have no desire to return.the majority now acknowledges that these class members lack standing to sue for declaratory and injunctive relief,yet leaves it to the district court to decide whether they can stay in the class.for the whole class,the complaint seeks punitive damages,and for a class this big,one would expect the claim to be in the billions of dollars,like a tobacco or oil spill case.
it is risible to say that injunctive and declaratory relief predominate,even for those who do have standing to seek such relief.the majority says punitive damages do not predominate because it would thwart congressional intent if a defendant guilty of egregious sex discrimination were not punished.that may be so,but it has nothing to do with whether the claim for declaratory and injunctive relief predominates.for anyone but the richest people in the world,billions of dollars are going to predominate over words and solemn commands and promises about how to behave in the future.what cashier or stocker would care much about how the district court told to run its business after getting enough cash to quit 
even worse than the rule violations,the district court management plan for this class action violates constitutional rights to due process and jury trial.the district court order establishes a first phase of the case in which a jury will determine liability including liability for punitive damages and an injunction on a basis,without adjudicating the merits of any class member claim.then in a second phase,a special master will determine total front and back pay for the women discriminated against on the basis of some unspecified generally applicable formula 
both phases of this plan are constitutionally defective because they are inadequately individualized there will never be an adjudication,let alone an adjudication by an article iii judge and a jury,to determine whether owes any particular woman the money it will be required to pay,nor will any particular woman ever get a trial to establish how much she is owed.will never get a chance,for example,to prove to a jury that dukes was tried as a manager and did not perform well,or that arana did indeed steal time or at least that after a good faith investigation fired her for that nonpretextual reason.under both the seventh amendment and the statute applicable to punitive damages in title vii cases is entitled to trial by jury of these issues.
nor is there a legitimate way for the jury or court to decide upon a punitive damages award,since the jury will never make a compensatory damages award.it is now firmly established that the due process clause constrains punitive damages to a ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages and that the ratio can rarely exceed a nine to one ratio yet compensatory damages will never be determined here.after the punitive damages have already been awarded,a special master will decide upon whatever lost pay may be awarded,by formula rather than examination of individual cases.we have explained that in a,action,an approach that compares each plaintiff individual compensatory damages with the punitive damages awards against each defendant more accurately reflects the true relationship between the harm for which a particular defendant is responsible,and the punitive damages assessed against that defendant.in this case,a ratio analysis will not be possible because punitive damages will be unanchored to compensatory damages 
in its first opinion,the majority explicitly approved of the district court trial plan in the face of the due process deprivations.in this second opinion,the majority express es no opinion regarding objections to the district court scheme and finds it sufficient to note that there are a range of may or may not include the district court proposed course of would allow this class action to proceed in a manner that is both manageable and in accordance with due process.has appealed precisely the unconstitutionality in the district court order,so it is incumbent upon us to correct it.
the majority seeks cover under hilao estate of ferdinand marcos where we allowed a class action against the dictator of the philippines for victims of disappearances,torture,and summary executions.assuming that that case was correctly decided this one is distinguishable.the victims of sex discrimination by can obtain individual counsel where they live and do not face the problems of proving injuries suffered in a foreign country.hilao included a plan to have a random sample of claims go to jury trial while in this case no individual cases will go to trial.and in hilao,a jury award of compensatory damages would be made and would provide the information necessary for the constitutionally required ratio analysis.
there are serious reasons for these rules constraining class actions.class actions need special justification because they are an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only.they are designed largely to solve an attorneys fees problem.the policy at the very core of the class action mechanism is to overcome the problem that small recoveries do not provide the incentive for any individual to bring a solo action prosecuting his or her rights.a class action solves this problem by aggregating the relatively paltry potential recoveries into something worth someone usually an attorney labor.that need does not pertain here.much of the bar now earns a living by litigating sex discrimination claims.many sex discrimination cases satisfy the three elements that make a contingent fee case worth accepting,good liability,high damages potential,and collectibility of a judgment,sweetened by the lagniappe of statutory attorneys fees awards these features of individual sex discrimination cases eliminate financial barriers that might make individual lawsuits unlikely or infeasible,so women discriminated against by do not need a class action.they can,with contingent fee agreements,afford to hire their own lawyers and control what the lawyers do for them.
women employed by who have suffered sex discrimination stand to lose a lot if this sex discrimination class action goes forward.all the members of the class will be bound by the judgment or settlement because,under rule,the judgment shall include all class members,whether or not favorable to the class.what if the plaintiffs class loses worse,for many women in the class,what if the plaintiffs win women who have suffered great loss because of sex discrimination will have to share the punitive damages award with many women who did not.women entitled to considerable compensatory damages in addition to lost pay will be deprived of them.women who have left will get injunctive and declaratory relief of no value to them,while new female employees will benefit from the injustice done to other women.if the settlement is mostly words for the women and money for the lawyers,a realistic possibility,it will be a pyrrhic victory indeed.
a lawyer representing a class is in practical effect a lawyer without a client.clients as principals compel their lawyers as agents to serve their interests.without individual clients to control what they do,the lawyers have a powerful financial incentive to settle the case on terms favorable to themselves,but not necessarily favorable to their unknown clients with varying individual circumstances that are unknown to their purported lawyers.
the absence of any real clients to control them leaves the lawyers free to pursue their own earnestly held views about the public good generally.they will doubtless have their own views,which they will try to get into an injunction,such as about how ought to manage its stores,how it should train and promote employees,and how and whether ought to be unionized,even though these social views may be of little interest to many of the women they purport to represent.counsel will also have a practical interest in maximizing attorneys fees.will have an interest in agreeing to enough lawyers fees so that the terms of an injunction to which plaintiffs counsel will agree will be less onerous.true,the parties must obtain judicial approval of a settlement,but that is not much of a substitute for client control.the judge has a very considerable incentive to clear the docket of a case so large and complex as to be almost untriable,and the judge also will know nothing of the individual circumstances and needs of the million members of the class.nor,in a proposed settlement urged upon the judge by both the plaintiffs and the defendant lawyers,will the judge have the benefit of adversarial presentations,except perhaps from those typically and disapprovingly called gadfly opponents of the settlement.a class action settlement is a bargain proffered for its approval without benefit of adversarial investigation.
none of these burdens to justice need be borne in this case.no class action is necessary to obtain justice for women wronged by sex discrimination at,because there is no attorneys fees barrier to their obtaining individual justice.plenty of lawyers make good livings litigating sex discrimination cases for contingent fees.
the district court calls this class certification historic,a euphemism for unprecedented.in the law,the absence of precedent is no recommendation.this class certification violates the requirements of rule.it sacrifices the rights of women injured by sex discrimination.and it violates constitutional rights.the class action may be useful for punishing and shifting much of its management to the lawyers and special master negotiating and supervising the injunction.but it is not useful for doing justice between and women against whom it may have discriminated because of their sex.and that is what lawsuits are for.
the district court formula approach to dividing up punitive damages and back pay means that women injured by sex discrimination will have to share any recovery with women who were not.women who were fired or not promoted for good reasons will take money from they do not deserve,and get reinstated or promoted as well.compensatory damages will be forfeited.this is rough justice indeed.rough,anyway.since when were the district courts converted into administrative agencies and empowered to ignore individual justice 
as the district court acknowledged,dukes i,at,although federal courts are no longer permitted to engage in conditional certification,fed.civ.proc,advisory committee notes amends,district courts retain the authority to amend or decertify a class if,based on information not available or circumstances not anticipated when the class was certified,the court finds that either is warranted.
of course,we recognize that courts are not only at liberty to but must consider evidence which goes to the requirements of rule at the class certification stage even if the evidence may also relate to the underlying merits of the case.hanon dataproducts,cir.if the district court had rejected arguments regarding commonality solely because they overlapped with merits issues,that would have been error.however,as we explain in the following sections,the district court did not do this but,instead,conducted a rigorous analysis of the conflicting evidence presented on the commonality question and ultimately concluded that the commonality prerequisite was satisfied.see falcon,at.hanon,at.

regression analyses,in general terms,provide estimates of the effect of independent variables on a single dependent variable.see hemmings tidyman,cir.the purpose of this methodology is to estimate the extent to which a particular independent variable in this case,gender has influenced the dependent variables of compensation and promotion.see see also rudebusch hughes,cir.as long as the analyses include enough relevant independent variables,education,experience,performance,the results will indicate whether any salary disparities are attributable to gender thereby raising an inference of discrimination or whether the disparities are attributable to other factors and thereby refuting such an inference.see hemmings,at see also eeoc.of,cir a regression analysis is a common statistical tool designed to isolate the influence of one particular factor,a dependent variable,salary.citation omitted.
