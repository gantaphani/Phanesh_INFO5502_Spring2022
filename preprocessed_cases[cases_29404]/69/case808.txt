donald horina filed a action against the city of granite city,see,alleging that certain provisions of ordinance city regulation on the manner in which individuals can distribute handbills in his first amendment right to distribute religious literature.the district court,however,determined that the entire ordinance is unconstitutional because the city produced no evidence showing that any restrictions on handbilling were needed to further a substantial government interest.the court further awarded horina in compensatory damages,and in attorneys fees and costs.we affirm the district court judgment that ordinance is unconstitutional.however,we reverse the district court judgment awarding horina compensatory damages,and remand this matter so the district court can revisit the issue.and following the parties stipulation,we order the district court to modify the amount of attorneys fees and costs due to horina to.
the facts are undisputed.horina is a retired teacher from charles,missouri.as part of what he believes to be his calling as a christian to tell others about their need to be born again,horina regularly traveled across the mississippi river to granite city,illinois,to distribute literature and gospel pamphlets that include bible verses and short interpretations.although he distributed the literature around various areas in the city,he regularly frequented the sidewalk in front of the hope clinic for women,an outpatient surgical treatment center that provides abortions.
horina would regularly place his literature on the windshields of cars parked on the city streets adjacent to the hope clinic,much to the chagrin of at least one individual nathan lang,a security guard at the clinic.after horina placed gospel tracts on lang car on two separate occasions,lang confronted horina and asked him to stop placing the tracts on his car.but despite the request,in july lang watched from afar as horina slid a gospel tract through the open driver side window of his car.
in response,lang contacted the granite city police department,which,in turn,cited horina for violating the city ordinance prohibiting the indiscriminate distribution of cards,circulars,handbills,samples of merchandise or any advertising matter whatsoever on any public street or sidewalk.however,the city later altered the charge to a violation of the city trespass ordinance.see granite city,municipal code tit.ix,chs.d.horina pled guilty to the violation as amended,and was levied a fine.
nearly two years after horina paid his fine he filed suit against granite city,alleging that the city ordinance prohibiting indiscriminate handbilling violated his rights under the first and fourteenth amendments to engage in protected,the distribution of religious literature.he asked the district court to enjoin the city from enforcing the ordinance and to award him monetary damages to compensate him for the violation of his civil rights.the district court granted horina request for an result that spurred the city to repeal its prohibition on indiscriminate handbilling,and to replace it with a revised regulation,ordinance.
much like granite city earlier restriction,ordinance defined handbill to include any leaflet,pamphlet,brochure,notice,handout,circular,card,photograph,drawing,or advertisement printed on paper or on cardboard.however,ordinance replaced the broad ban on indiscriminate handbilling with six separate regulations,each specifying when and how an individual could distribute literature.for instance,b of the ordinance stated that n o person shall deposit or throw any handbill in or upon any vehicle.section c of the ordinance similarly provided no person shall deposit,place,or throw any handbill upon any private premises which are temporarily or continuously unoccupied.any individual who was caught handbilling outside of the ordinance parameters would be subject to a fine no less than and up to.as the city explained in the ordinance preamble,such restrictions were necessary to protect the city residents desire to be free from unwanted intrusion,trespass,harassment,and litter.
shortly after granite city enacted ordinance,horina amended his motion for a preliminary injunction against the ban on indiscriminate handbilling to include the newly enacted ordinance.in his motion,horina asserted that b and c were facially unconstitutional because they were unreasonable restrictions on the time,place,and manner in which he could place handbills on automobile windshields and unoccupied homes.see ward rock against racism,d weinberg city of,cir.specifically,horina asserted that the city could not show that b and c restrictions served a substantial government interest because there was no proof that handbilling caused the social ills that the city claimed it had an interest in preventing intrusion,trespass,harassment,and litter.the district judge,michael reagan,pressed the city on this issue at the hearing on horina amended motion,and asked the city if it had any evidence of an empirical nature to support this ordinance other than to assume that there is going to be intrusion and litter.the city,however,responded that it had not completed any specific studies with regard to the correlation between handbilling and intrusion,trespass,harassment,and litter,and that it was,in fact,unnecessary for the city to produce evidence establishing a correlation between handbilling and those problems.
the court took horina amended motion under advisement.but before judge reagan rendered a ruling,horina filed a motion for a judgment on the pleadings,see.c,largely reasserting the arguments he had made in his amended motion,and asking the district court to enjoin granite city from enforcing b and c permanently on the ground that the provisions were unconstitutional.in response,the city repeated that ordinance restrictions were necessary to assure the citizens of granite city the desire to be free of unwanted intrusion,trespass,harassment,and litter,but yet again pointed to no evidence showing that handbilling caused those problems.apparently concerned with the city lack of proffered evidence justifying the ordinance,judge reagan held a status conference during which he again asked the city whether it would introduce evidence showing that handbilling caused intrusion,trespass,harassment,or litter.the city,however,responded that it would not.
the district court granted horina motion for judgment on the pleadings,but went beyond the relief that he requested.the court did not permanently enjoin granite city from enforcing only b and c,as horina requested instead,the court permanently enjoined the city from enforcing ordinance in its entirety.the court expansive relief was based on its determination that the city failed to satisfy its burden of producing evidence showing that handbilling constitutes or in any way results in unwanted intrusion,trespass,harassment,or litter in the city.the court pointed out that the city failed to proffer any empirical studies,testimony,police records,reported injuries,or anything else that the city did not even allege that such evidence exists and that the city offered only mere conjecture in an attempt to establish the ordinance justifications.and because the city could not show that the entire ordinance served a substantial government interest,the court concluded,the ordinance,as a whole,was an unreasonable restriction on the time,place,and manner in which individuals could handbill.judge reagan therefore declared the ordinance unconstitutional on its face,and permanently enjoined the city from enforcing it.
armed with the district court judgment,horina sought in compensatory damages from granite city to account for the humiliation,emotional distress,and loss of first amendment rights that he endured due to the city unconstitutional handbilling restrictions.the district court thus scheduled a bench trial solely on the issue of damages.horina was the only witness to testify at the trial,but his testimony regarding the injuries he suffered was framed only in the most general terms and was often contradictory.for instance,horina testified that,for about one year after his citation for trespass,he avoided the city altogether and suffered personal humiliation as a result.but horina also admitted that he continued to distribute gospel tracts in other cities,and that he eventually returned to the city to distribute his tracts once or twice a week.horina further claimed that,because of the city restrictions,he feared that he would be cited for distributing his tracts.horina also acknowledged,however,that in earlier court proceedings related to his challenge to the city ban on indiscriminate handbilling,the city chief of police stated that horina would not be cited for his activities,and that in response,horina felt that there was less of a chance of getting arrested.indeed,horina admitted,other than his trespass citation,he was not arrested for distributing his tracts,or even asked by city authorities to limit his activities.horina also testified about the expenses he incurred while challenging the city restrictions.in particular,horina stated that he appeared in court six to eight times,and that during each of those trips he spent u nder for meals.however,horina also stated that he had no receipts from those purchases,and provided no other information regarding his expenses related to his trips to court.
the district court issued a order,in which it awarded horina in compensatory damages.specifically,the court awarded horina to account for his expenses that amount,the court stated,should adequately cover approximately court appearances estimating one hour each at per hour,travel of one hour per trip again,at per hour mileage miles at per mile and meals eight at each.but the court also determined that horina was not due the full he requested for his humiliation,emotional distress,and loss of first amendment rights.in explaining the award,the court did not point to any particular portion of horina testimony detailing his injuries.instead,the court stated that the precise extent to which horina constitutional rights were chilled remains relatively unclear,and opined that horina has minimal evidence regarding his emotional distress and feelings of humiliation.nevertheless,the court deemed what minimal evidence horina introduced still warranted an award of.shortly thereafter,the court also calculated that horina was due in attorneys fees and costs,and issued a separate order awarding horina that amount.see.d.
ii.analysis 
granite city makes three arguments on appeal.the city first contends that the district court incorrectly concluded that ordinance is unconstitutional.the city further argues that the district court erroneously calculated the award,and likewise incorrectly determined how much in attorneys fees and costs horina was due.we address each argument below.
a.the district court determination that ordinance is unconstitutional 
before we address the merits of granite city challenge to the district court decision striking down ordinance,we must first clarify this case procedural posture.the city states that it appeals from the district court grant of horina rule c motion for judgment on the pleadings,an assertion with which horina agrees.if the parties are correct,then we would review the district court decision as we would a decision granting a motion to dismiss under.b.see pisciotta old bancorp,cir guise bwm mortgage,llc,cir.but in agreeing on this case procedural posture,the parties ignore that the district court repeatedly asked the city to proffer evidence outside of its pleadings to show that handbilling caused litter,intrusion,trespass,and harassment.and in so seeking this additional evidence,the district court both treated horina rule c motion as one for summary judgment,see.c d omega healthcare investors,cir,and put the parties on notice that it would treat the motion as one for summary judgment,see fleischfresser dirs.of sch.dist,cir stating that district court gives sufficient notice that it is treating rule motion as motion when both parties had every reason to know that extraneous material was being considered.we will thus review the district court decision as if it granted horina summary a de novo review,see foskett great wolf resorts,cir,we will view the record in the light most favorable to granite city,the party,and will examine whether there is a genuine issue of material fact that precludes judgment as a matter of law,see.c celotex catrett,d cady sheahan,cir.
traditionally,handbilling has referred to the practice of offering written it handbills,pamphlets,tracts,advertisements,booklets,notices or other individuals in public places for their acceptance or rejection.see members of city council taxpayers for vincent,d schneider new jersey.as the united states supreme court recognized nearly years ago in the its decision lovell griffin,handbilling is both a method of communication that has a long and venerable history that predates the birth of this nation,and is a form of speech that is protected under the first and fourteenth amendments.see.noting that handbills have been historic weapons in the defense of liberty,as the pamphlets of thomas paine and others in our own history abundantly attest see also murdock pennsylvania.the hand distribution of religious tracts is an form of missionary old as the history of printing presses.and in the time since the supreme court decided lovell,federal courts have invalidated bans on distributing literature on public streets,see,united states grace,d schneider,at.weinberg,at,restrictions on individuals rights to engage in handbilling,see,martin city of struthers.watseka.public action council,cir,and licensing requirements for those who wished to distribute their handbills,see watchtower bible tract soc y of,vill.of stratton,d lovell,at.
but as with all forms of protected speech,the right to handbill is not absolute,see taxpayers for vincent,at,and federal courts have determined that governments may enact reasonable restrictions on handbilling that are also consistent with the first amendment.specifically,so long as the restrictions are content neutral that is,unrelated to the content of the speech expressed in the may regulate the time,place,and manner in which the activity of handbilling itself occurs.see weinberg,at.and under this time,place,and manner analysis,such restrictions can survive scrutiny only if the government can show that they serve a substantial government interest are narrowly tailored to advance that interest and leave open ample alternative channels of communication to allow the individual handbilling other ways to convey his or her message.see ward,at.weinberg,at.
granite city,however,argues that the time,place,and manner analysis is an inappropriate method to assess the constitutionality of ordinance as a whole,and that the district court was wrong to employ it.according to the city,not all of the ordinance provisions restrict handbilling as that practice has been traditionally is,distributing literature to individuals in a public place.as the city sees it,b and c instead restrict the practice of intruding on other individuals private windshields of privately owned automobiles and privately owned unoccupied buildings,leave information without first affording individuals the opportunity to accept or reject it.this distinction is important,the city asserts,because private property is a nonpublic forum,meaning that any restriction of speech in that forum should be weighed under the approach,and not the time,place,and manner analysis that the district court employed.and under the approach,regulations of speech in nonpublic fora are assessed only for reasonableness,see perry educ.ass perry local educators ass n,d deboer vill.of oak park,cir,a standard that,the city argues,b and c easily satisfy.
granite city argument raises interesting questions as to whether placing handbills on privately owned automobiles and unoccupied buildings are activities that fall under the traditional definition of handbilling.but we need not address those questions here because the city argument in support of the approach is fatally flawed.the approach applies only when a government restricts speech on property that the government itself owns.the validity of the restriction,in turn,depends on the type of government forum in which the speech occurs.see int t soc y for krishna consciousness lee,d perry educ.ass n,at.gilles blanchard,cir.and thus far,the supreme court has identified three publicly owned fora that guide this approach traditional public fora such as street corners,city squares,and city parks,fora designated for a particular use such as a publicly owned amphitheater,and nonpublic fora everything else publicly owned that is not a traditional public forum or a designated forum.see lee,at.see also gilles,at noting dubiously that circuit courts of appeals have carved out a fourth category of public fora,the limited designated public forum.
in other words,the term nonpublic forum is not synonymous with privately owned property,as granite city suggests.the designation merely signifies that the property in question is publicly owned,but is neither a traditional public forum,nor a designated public forum.see lee,at.stating that nonpublic fora are all remaining public property other than traditional public fora and designated public fora perry educ.ass n,at.public property which is not by tradition or designation a forum for public communication is governed by different standards.gilles,at.the city is therefore wrong to assert that b and c should be weighed under the approach solely because those provisions prohibit intrusion on other individuals private property.
that said,granite city does not otherwise challenge the district court application of the time,place,and manner analysis.and because ordinance is a restriction,we see no reason to conclude that the district court was wrong to employ that analysis when assessing the ordinance constitutionality.see jobe city of catlettsburg,cir concluding that doctrine does not apply to privately owned automobiles parked on city streets,and that restrictions on placing pamphlets on automobiles are assessed under time,place,and manner analysis krantz city of fort smith,cir applying time,place,and manner analysis to assess prohibition of placing handbills on automobile windshields watseka,at applying time,place,and manner analysis to weigh ordinance regulating when individuals may engage in soliciting.
the question thus becomes whether the district court correctly concluded that ordinance,in its entirety,is an unconstitutional time,place,and manner restriction on handbilling.granite city argues no,and challenges the court conclusion that the city failed to proffer evidence showing that handbilling causes litter,intrusion,trespass,and harassment.specifically,the city takes issue with the district court determination that the city needed to present empirical studies,testimony,police records,or reported injuries showing that the ordinance was justified.in granite city view,the district court overstated what evidence it needed to proffer when it was,in fact,under no obligation to present evidence to support the purposes of the ordinance.instead,the city argues,common sense shows that the ordinance was needed to combat litter,intrusion,trespass,and harassment.
we have no quarrel with granite city claim that the prevention of litter,intrusion,trespass,and harassment is a substantial government interest.see watchtower bible tract soc y of,at.stating that prevention of crime and protecting residents privacy are important interests jobe,at determining that litter and visual blight and the protection of individual property rights are substantial government interests.
but we can not accept granite city assertion that it can rely on mere common sense to show that ordinance is needed to combat those ills.although common sense does have its value when assessing the constitutionality of an ordinance or statute,see anderson milwaukee county,cir weinberg,at,it can be used to mask unsupported conjecture,which is,of course,verboten in the first amendment context,see nixon shrink.gov t pac,d weinberg,at.that is why the government has the burden of showing that there is evidence supporting its proffered justification for its speech restriction when asserting that the restriction survives the time,place,and manner analysis.weinberg,at see also dima town of hallie,cir.in satisfying this burden,however,the government does not always need to produce a panoply of empirical studies,testimony,police records,or reported injuries,as judge reagan put it less evidence might be sufficient,of course,depending on the scope and context of the restriction in question.see dima,at the first amendment does not require a city,before enacting such an ordinance,to conduct new studies or produce evidence independent of that already generated by other cities,so long as whatever evidence the city relies upon is reasonably believed to be relevant to the problem that the city addresses.quoting city of renton playtime theatres,d.but the government must nevertheless proffer something showing that the restriction actually serves a government interest,and we have struck down time,place,and manner restrictions where the government failed to produce objective evidence showing that the restrictions served the interests asserted.see weinberg,at watseka,at.
here,the experienced district judge correctly concluded that granite city failed to proffer any evidence showing that handbilling caused litter,intrusion,trespass,or harassment in the city.the record reveals that the city introduced absolutely no evidence before the district court showing that ordinance was needed to combat those problems.even more,the city failed on several occasions to respond to judge reagan requests for evidence supporting the ordinance justifications.
for its part,granite city now points to what it deems to be proof that handbilling causes litter,intrusion,trespass,or harassment,but this late proffer fails to carry the day.specifically,the city contends that the fact that horina placed a gospel tract in lang automobile against his wishes shows that ordinance is needed to combat trespass.but this point hurts the city more than it helps.after all,for his indiscretion horina was eventually cited with trespassing on lang fact that creates the distinct impression that a broad restriction on handbilling is not needed to combat trespass when the city already has enacted an ordinance that proscribes trespass,see granite city,municipal code tit.ix,chs.see also ward,at.stating that speech restriction can withstand scrutiny under time,place,and manner analysis only if government interest is achieved less effectively absent the regulation quoting united states albertini,d weinberg,at same.
equally meritless is the city contention that the fact that at least one state and other cities have passed laws similar to ordinance proves that handbilling causes litter,intrusion,trespass,or harassment.the fact that other states and cities have restrictions on handbilling says nothing about whether handbilling caused litter,intrusion,trespass,or harassment in granite city to such an extent as to necessitate a handbilling restriction nor does it alleviate the city burden of producing evidence showing that the ordinance is justified.see playtime theatres,at.stating that evidence generated by other municipal governments must be relevant to the problem the municipal government in question is attempting to address dima,at same.but that aside,because the city points to no other evidence showing that handbilling causes those problems,we have no basis upon which to conclude that any of the ordinance provisions serve a substantial government interest.
but even if granite city had proffered sufficient evidence establishing that ordinance serves a substantial government interest,the city has not shown that the ordinance satisfies the remaining two elements of the time,place,and manner analysis.first,the ordinance is not narrowly tailored.a restriction on is narrowly tailored if it promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the restriction.weinberg,at quoting ward,at.but the city has not explained to us how the prevention of litter,intrusion,trespass,or harassment is achieved less effectively without the ordinance,and has thus waived the argument see aps sports collectibles,sports time,cir.and even if the city had raised the point,it still would not have prevailed.as we alluded to earlier,the city already proscribes in some form litter,intrusion,trespass,or harassment,see granite city,municipal code tit.viii,ch.granite city,municipal code tit.ix,chs,leading us to believe that the city can currently combat those problems very effectively without resorting to a broad prohibition on handbilling,watseka,at stating that solicitation ban is not narrowly tailored when a city can enforce its trespass law against solicitors who enter or remain on private property after the owner has indicated the solicitor is not welcome.action coalition kenosha,cir discussing less restrictive alternatives to speech regulations of which supreme court has approved see also schneider,at.there are obvious methods of preventing littering.amongst these is the punishment of those who actually throw papers on the streets t he public convenience in respect of cleanliness of the streets does not justify an exertion of the police power which invades the free communication of information and opinion secured by the constitution.
likewise,ordinance fails to leave open ample alternative channels of communication to allow individuals handbilling other ways to convey their message.granite city argues that such alternative channels are available because,despite the ordinance specific proscriptions on handbilling,individuals may still distribute handbills to people who wish to accept them,including the drivers of automobiles and the residents of homes and send their literature through the mail.
we disagree.an adequate alternative does not have to be the speaker first or best choice,see heffron int l soc.for krishna consciousness,d gresham peterson,cir,or one that provides the same audience or impact for the speech,see ward,at.but the alternative must be more than merely theoretically available it must be realistic as well.gresham,at see also linmark,township of willingboro,d.as such,we have shown special solicitude for forms of expression that involve less cost and more autonomy for the speaker than the potentially feasible alternatives.gresham,at quoting taxpayers for vincent,d see also linmark,at.
with this in mind,we believe that the alternative methods of communication forwarded by granite city simply are not feasible.forcing an individual to limit handbilling activities to solicitation is extremely time consuming and burdensome,particularly when the individual intends to convey a message to people who park their automobiles in a certain area of the city or who live in a certain neighborhood.for instance,with b and c of ordinance in effect,the individual would not be able to leave literature on the windshields of automobiles or the doorsteps of homes.instead,the individual would be forced to distribute literature by hand to passersby,to people who are sitting in their parked automobiles when the individual happened upon them,or to people who are at home when the individual knocks on their front door.because of these limitations,the time it would take the individual to convey the message to the intended audience would increase from perhaps under an hour to conceivably several days.and we can not say that an alternative channel of communication is realistic when it requires a speaker perhaps time to reach the same audience.see gresham,at see also city of ladue gilleo,d concluding that proposed alternative channels of communication were unacceptable because of,among other things,the added costs in money or time the alternatives required.
similarly,the fact that an individual could mail the literature is no alternative to handbilling.we have already rejected the notion that using the mail to disseminate literature provides a suitable alternative to,see watseka,at,and we see no reason to depart from that determination here.after all,the mail system is both an expensive and unwieldily method for individuals to distribute handbills to their neighbors,see gresham,at taxpayers for vincent,at,and a completely ineffective method to distribute literature to people who have parked their automobiles nearby,weinberg,at a n alternative is not adequate if it forecloses a speaker ability to reach one audience even if it allows the speaker to reach other groups.quoting gresham,at.we thus reject granite city contention that ordinance allows individuals who seek to handbill ample alternative methods to convey their messages.
to recap,the district court was correct to strike down ordinance.granite city proffered no evidence showing that the ordinance is needed to combat litter,intrusion,trespass,or harassment.moreover,the ordinance neither is narrowly tailored to combat those problems,nor does it leave open ample alternative methods for those seeking to distribute literature to convey their message.as such,the ordinance can not survive constitutional scrutiny.see ward,at.weinberg,at.
b.the district court award of compensatory damages to horina 
granite city also argues that the district court award of in compensatory damages to horina was improper.specifically,the city contends that the district court award of for horina expenses is not supported by the record.instead,the city continues,the award was impermissibly based only on vague estimates of horina expenses.the city also argues that the district court award of for horina humiliation,emotional distress,and loss of first amendment rights was not based on any evidence that horina actually suffered those injuries.we review the district court legal determinations de novo and its factual determinations for clear error.see alexander city of milwaukee,cir.
we agree with the city that the district court award of is not supported by the record.when calculating compensatory damages,district courts may make a just and reasonable estimate of the damages due,but those estimates must nevertheless be consistent with the evidence presented regarding damages.zazu designs,cir quoting bigelow rko radio pictures.see also sulzer carbomedics or,cir stating that district court may not determine damages by speculation or guess internal citation omitted.
but here,the evidence relevant to the calculation of the award was lacking.the only evidence regarding horina expenses was his guess that he spent u nder on meals on each of the six or eight times he traveled to court.and there was no evidence supporting an award of for horina meals,for his time,or for his mileage.see fitzgerald mountain states,cir amounts that are speculative,remote,imaginary,or impossible of ascertainment are not recoverable.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the district court thus erred in awarding horina for his expenses.see zazu designs,at see also united states roman,cir stating that district court factual findings are clearly erroneous if they are unsupported by substantial evidence,lack adequate evidentiary support,are against clear weight of the evidence,or if court has misapprehended weight of evidence.
the district court likewise erred when awarding horina for his humiliation,emotional distress,and loss of first amendment rights.although a district court may award compensatory damages to a successful plaintiff,it may not award damages to account for the abstract value of a constitutional right.watseka,at.therefore,a district court may award the plaintiff damages only if he can prove that the denial of his constitutional rights resulted in an actual injury.see memphis cmty.sch.dist.stachura,d see also watseka,at.the fact that the monetary value of the particular injury is difficult to ascertain as is often the case when the injuries asserted are humiliation,distress,and other harms associated with the denial of a not preclude an award of damages.watseka,at see also stachura,at.gilpin am.fed of state,county,and mun.employees,cir.but the plaintiff must nevertheless show that he actually suffered those injuries,and w here no injury is present,no compensatory damages may be awarded.stachura,at.see also carey piphus,d stating that some actual,if intangible,injury must be proved before compensatory damages may be recovered.
however,we can not tell whether horina suffered any actual injury,much less the humiliation,emotional distress,and loss of first amendment rights he contends to have suffered.horina testimony before the district court regarding the extent to which he was forced to curtail his handbilling was unclear at best and contradictory at worst,particularly when he admitted that he continued to distribute his gospel tracts in other cities,and that he eventually resumed distributing his tracts in granite city without incident.
moreover,the fact that horina resumed distributing his tracts in granite city after a brief hiatus contradicts his assertion that he suffered humiliation from having to conspicuously avoid being in granite city for fear of being ticketed arrested.and although horina claimed that he endured emotional distress from distributing his tracts in fear,he also acknowledged that his fear subsided when the city chief of police stated in court that he would not be cited for his activities.based on this record,we are unable to determine whether horina suffered humiliation,emotional distress,and loss of first amendment rights,nor can we ascertain whether represented adequate compensation for those purported injuries.see watseka,at affirming award of compensatory damages where plaintiff sufficiently explained the harms and specific injuries it suffered from denial of first amendment rights.as such,the award of damages can not stand.see everaard hartford accident indem,cir reversing award of compensatory damages where basis for award was unclear from both record and district court decision.
on remand,horina may be able to proffer something more than vague testimony to clarify the injuries he allegedly sustained.if not,the district court may be unable to award him anything but nominal damages.see carey,at.stating that nominal damages are available to prevailing plaintiff when no actual injury is proven.
c.the district court award of attorneys fees to horina 
granite city also challenges the district court award of in attorneys fees and costs to horina.but we need not address the point because both parties have agreed in their briefs that,if we were to reverse only the district court judgment awarding compensatory damages,the amount awarded to horina for attorneys fees and costs should be reduced by the amount incurred in connection with the bench trial on the issue of damages that horina would be due.and because we have reversed only the district court judgment awarding compensatory damages,we will allow the parties the benefit of their stipulation.
iii.conclusion 
we affirm the district court judgment that ordinance is unconstitutional.however,we reverse the district court judgment awarding in compensatory damages to horina,and remand this case to allow the district court to revisit the issue of damages.finally,consistent with the parties stipulation on appeal,we order the district court to reduce the attorneys fees and costs due to horina to.
the granite city ordinance allows for the distribution of handbills directly to people or to homes and businesses which are currently occupied.it prohibits the placing of handbills on parked vehicles and unoccupied private premises.clearly the ordinance regulates speech,but only the manner of speech.thus,as the court concludes,the ordinance is properly reviewed as a time,place,and manner regulation,and not a regulation of a forum.accordingly,i concur with the court conclusion that the ordinance does not regulate a nonpublic forum.rather,it requires a time,place and manner analysis of any restriction on speech.for the reasons explained below,i disagree with the court determination that the ordinance is unconstitutional and conclude that the ordinance is a valid time,place and manner regulation of speech.no further evidence from the city is needed to reach this conclusion.because i believe the ordinance is valid,i would overturn the damage award and award of attorneys fees as well.
section b of the ordinance provides that n o person shall deposit or throw any handbill in or upon any vehicle.horina wishes to place handbills on automobiles that are parked on public places and claims section b is unconstitutional.appellee br.at.because the ordinance is a restriction on the manner of speech to survive constitutional scrutiny,the restriction must be and the regulation must serve a substantial governmental interest be narrowly tailored to advance that interest and leave open ample alternative channels of communication.see ward rock against racism,d weinberg city of,cir.
it is undisputed that the ordinance is.the ordinance also serves a substantial governmental interest.specifically,as set out in the preamble,the ordinance was enacted to protect the city residents desire to be free from unwanted intrusion,trespass,harassment,and litter.the court concludes that the prevention of litter,intrusion,trespass,and harassment is a substantial government interest that would justify a restriction on handbilling,opinion at,but because granite city failed to proffer any evidence showing that handbilling caused litter,intrusion,trespass,or harassment in the city,the ordinance is unconstitutional opinion at.however,when evaluating the constitutionality of a statute,common sense must not be and should not be suspended anderson milwaukee county,cir.common sense dictates that the ordinance serves the interests noted.it would be the rare driver indeed who has not experienced the intrusion of a flyer placed under a car windshield and the annoyance of removing the flyer,especially in inclement weather or when the driver does notice it tucked under the passenger side windshield wiper until after fastening his seatbelt and starting his car.while the more thoughtful drivers dispose of such flyers properly,common sense tells us that at least some of the unwanted flyers become litter,even without evidence from the city.
our sister circuit found common sense enough to establish the city substantial governmental interest in jobe city of catlettsburg,cir,which is directly on point.in jobe,the plaintiff challenged the city of catlettsburg ordinance which prohibited individuals from placing leaflets on vehicles.in analyzing this time,place and manner regulation,the sixth circuit stated that the ordinance advances two significant government interests it furthers the government interest in prohibiting litter and visual blight and it furthers individuals interests in having their private property left alone by those who do not have permission to use it.id.at.the court added allowing individuals to decide for themselves how,when or whether their private property is used as a container for an advertisement,placing a leaflet under the car windshield wipers is a legitimate,if not compelling government interest.id.significantly,the sixth circuit then stated 
nor does catlettsburg stand alone in seeking to advance these government interests.that at least one state new york and at least other philadelphia and atlanta to san antonio and portland oregon to mishawaka indiana and albany georgia have passed similar laws suggests that the policy behind them is premised on legitimate rather than contrived concerns.in view of the explanations for these types of laws,they do not invariably require proof that the problem has occurred in the past a daunting task in view of the vintage of this law and the understandable absence of information about why the law was passed or an elaborate study of their necessity an equally daunting task in view of the difficulty of showing the empirical necessity for a law that has been in place for more than years.while governments normally should be expected to weigh the costs and benefits of regulating methods of speech as well as the alternative to regulating speech at all before enacting such laws,it hardly amounts to speculation to conclude that the first amendment costs of this law are quite modest given the inexpensive alternatives available for distributing literature and advertisements and the benefits of the law are quite legitimate given the and aesthetic interests advanced by the law.nor,at any rate,has the plainti
