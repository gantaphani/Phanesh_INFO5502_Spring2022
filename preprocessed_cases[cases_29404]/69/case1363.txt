weyerhaeuser company appeals the dismissal of its federal suit to enjoin state court proceedings for breach of contract against it.we conclude that,because the parties actually litigated and the district court decided the claim for breach of contract in prior litigation,the act,did not deprive the court below of authority to enjoin the state proceedings and that the court erred in granting the motion to dismiss.
background 
weyerhaeuser company owns and operates a mill facility in valliant,oklahoma,where jimmie wyatt served as an employee.in the fall of,weyerhaeuser became concerned about possible substance abuse problems among mill workers and arranged for canine inspections of the facility.while a search of the parking lot was occurring,wyatt attempted to leave the mill.weyerhaeuser personnel informed him that he could not depart until his vehicle was searched,at which point wyatt told them that he had a firearm in the vehicle.an ensuing search of his vehicle uncovered the firearm,and weyerhaeuser subsequently dismissed wyatt for violating a company policy banning firearm possession on company grounds.the issue in this appeal arises from a series of lawsuits filed in relation to this dismissal.
after his dismissal,wyatt sued weyerhaeuser in oklahoma state court,alleging both state and federal claims.weyerhaeuser removed the case to the united states district court for the eastern district of oklahoma,where it became case and was assigned to a magistrate judge upon consent of the parties.the original complaint contained a number of claims,but did not contain a breach of contract claim.on december,the parties submitted a report on planning meeting,which listed as one of the causes of action in the case a breach of contract claim based on severance payments weyerhaeuser allegedly owed to wyatt.on march,wyatt served an amended complaint,which included the breach of contract claim on july,weyerhaeuser moved for summary judgment,though it did not include the contract claim in its motion.the district judge ordered the parties to address the contract claim,as well as other issues,in supplemental briefing.the parties completed that briefing on december.
on march,the magistrate judge issued an order granting summary judgment for weyerhaeuser,declaring that weyerhaeuser company motion for summary judgment filed july,is hereby granted.accordingly,all claims asserted against defendant in this action are hereby dismissed.appellant app.the order explicitly delineated and discussed some of the claims raised by wyatt,but did not discuss the breach of contract claim wyatt appealed the grant of summary judgment to this court without listing the contract issue in his questions presented or discussing it in his brief.we affirmed the grant of summary judgment in its entirety,without making reference to any breach of contract claim.see bastible weyerhaeuser,cir.
on march,wyatt filed a motion to reopen the case on the breach of contract claim.a few weeks later,on april,he withdrew the motion and elect ed to proceed in state court.appellant app.
also on april,wyatt filed a second suit against weyerhaeuser in oklahoma state court,asserting only his breach of contract claim case no.weyerhaeuser again removed the case to federal court,and then moved to consolidate it with case.the magistrate judge denied the motion on the grounds that was already closed.because wyatt thereafter stipulated that the amount in controversy was less than,the district court found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction and remanded the case to state court.
on july,weyerhaeuser filed the complaint in the present the federal district court to issue a declaratory judgment stating that the march,order disposed of the contract claim,and use its power to protect and effectuate its judgments to enjoin the pending state suit and all future litigation by wyatt arising from his termination.wyatt responded by filing a motion to dismiss,which the district court granted.the court noted that under the act aia a federal court may enjoin state court proceedings to protect or effectuate its judgments.citing to this court decision in brooks barbour energy,cir,the district court found that this power extends only to state court proceedings involv ing issues which the federal court fully adjudicated on the merits.appellant app.quoting brooks,at.the court found it abundantly clear that wyatt breach of contract claim was never adjudicated on its merits.id.at.rejecting weyerhaeuser argument that the magistrate judge statement dismissing all claims asserted against the defendant meant all claims,the court found instead that the statement referred to all claims that the magistrate judge had painstakingly set forth in her detailed order and could not be said to encompass the breach of contract claim.id.the court concluded that the contract claim simply fell through the cracks.id.

ii.discussion 
a.the scope of the act relitigation exception 
the act provides that a federal court may not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a state court except in three circumstances as expressly authorized by act of congress,or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,or to protect or effectuate its judgments.this case concerns the scope of the third circumstance,commonly known as the relitigation exception.specifically,the question presented is whether the relitigation exception permits a federal court to protect and effectuate the full res judicata effect of its is,to bar state litigation of both claims actually raised in a prior federal action and those that could have been raised or whether it covers only issues that the federal court actually decided.
for enlightenment on this question,we turn to the supreme court opinion in chick kam choo exxon,d.the case began when leong chong,a singapore resident,was accidentally killed in that country while repairing a ship owned by exxon.chick kam choo,chong widow,sued exxon in federal district court,asserting claims under the jones act,the death on the high seas act,general federal maritime law,and the texas wrongful death statute.id.at.the district court granted summary judgment in exxon favor on the federal statutory claims,finding them inapplicable to chong.id.at.the court further concluded that,under federal principles,singapore law must control the lawsuit.accordingly,the court granted summary judgment on the general maritime law claim and dismissed the remainder of the case on forum non conveniens grounds.id.but instead of refiling the unadjudicated claims in singapore,choo filed suit in texas state court,alleging the state law claim and a claim under singapore law.id.in response,exxon brought a new action in federal court,wherein it procured an injunction barring choo from commencing any claims against defendant in the courts of any.state arising out of or related to the alleged wrongful death of her husband.id.at.choo appealed,contending that the injunction ran afoul of the act.
in deciding the case,the supreme court first explained the purpose of the aia.the law is a necessary concomitant of the framers decision to authorize,and congress decision to implement,a dual system of federal and state courts.id.at.by prohibiting frequent federal court intervention in state court proceedings,the aia forestalls friction between the state and federal courts.id.quoting vendo,d.but given the ultimate need to ensure the effectiveness and supremacy of federal law within this dual system,the aia contains the exceptions.id.specifically,t he relitigation exception was designed to permit a federal court to prevent state litigation of an issue that previously was presented to and decided by the federal court.it is founded in the concepts of res judicata and collateral estoppel.id.at.
the court turned to its prior decision in atlantic coast line railroad brotherhood of locomotive engineers,d,as the best illustrat ion of the relitigation exception proper scope.chick kam choo,at.in that case a railroad sought a federal injunction to prevent union picket activities.id.the federal court refused,holding that the unions were free to engage in.id.
