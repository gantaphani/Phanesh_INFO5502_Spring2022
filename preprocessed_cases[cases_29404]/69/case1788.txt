factual and procedural background 
gunderson lawsuits against christopher gruys,richard wall and welded fixtures.
in march,respondent jon gunderson filed a complaint against his former tax accountant,christopher gruys,for fraud,breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty and conversion gruys action.the case proceeded to trial and,in december,a jury awarded gunderson approximately million.gunderson attempted to collect on the judgment,but was unable to recover a significant portion of his award.
while the gruys action was still pending,gunderson filed a second action against gruys,richard wall and wall company,welded fixtures.the complaint alleged that,to evade paying a judgment in the gruys action,gruys fraudulently transferred million to welded fixtures.on october,a jury entered a verdict in favor of gunderson and awarded compensatory damages in the amount of million.in addition,the jury found the defendants acted with malice,fraud,or oppression,and awarded punitive damages in the amount of million against gruys,against wall and against welded fixtures.wall and welded fixtures appealed the judgment.
while the appeal was pending,gunderson attempted to execute on the judgment.after unsuccessfully attempting to serve appellants with writs of execution,gunderson successfully moved to install a receiver at welded fixtures.when the receiver arrived at the company,it discovered that computers and financial documents had been removed from the premises.the receiver notified the court,which entered a writ of body attachment requiring wall to personally appear to answer questions regarding the apparent theft.although the missing items were anonymously returned to welded fixtures,wall refused to appear before the court.
approximately four months after the judgment was issued,wall agreed to provide gunderson a million check,which was intended to cover the judgment,interest and costs.in exchange,gunderson agreed to stop his collection efforts,withdraw the receiver from welder fixtures and refrain from seeking enforcement of the court writ of body attachment.gunderson also agreed that statutory interest on the judgment would cease upon delivery of the check.when gunderson received the check,he refused to issue a satisfaction of judgment,asserting that wall was still liable for various collection costs and receiver fees.
reversal of punitive damages and appellant motion to pay interest 
on november,we affirmed the jury finding that wall and welded fixtures engaged in fraudulent transfers,but held that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury award of punitive damages.in our disposition,we reversed the award of punitive damages,but affirmed the judgment in all other respects.the case was remitted to the trial court on january.
on january,appellants counsel requested that gunderson repay the punitive damages award,along with interest that had accrued on that sum during the pendency of the appeal.gunderson voluntarily returned,but declined to pay interest.
on march,appellants moved for restitution from gunderson for interest on the punitive damages award.gunderson opposed the motion,arguing that it would be inequitable to require him to pay interest because he had been forced to spend a significant amount of time and money to execute the judgment.
gunderson opposition was accompanied by a declaration describing numerous acts appellants had committed to avoid paying the judgment.gunderson alleged that shortly after the judgment was entered,wall resigned as welded fixture agent for service and refused to name a replacement.in addition,wall went into hiding to avoid personal service of process.as a result of these acts,gunderson was forced to obtain an order appointing a receiver to take possession of welded fixtures.gunderson declaration also cited the fact that wall had ignored the trial court writ of body attachment,which ordered him to appear before the court to answer questions about the removal of computers and other property from welded fixture premises.gunderson alleged that,in total,he had spent over on attorney fees and costs that were related solely to efforts to enforce his judgment.
in their response brief,appellants did not dispute that they had engaged in evasive conduct to avoid paying the judgment or that gunderson had expended a significant sum to collect the judgment.instead,appellants argued that,in properly deciding whether to award interest,the trial court was not permitted to consider the parties conduct.
at the hearing,appellants counsel argued that any attempts appellants made to avoid execution on the punitive damage portion of the judgment were justified,in part because the appellate court found there was insufficient evidence to support punitive damages.the trial court denied the motion,stating i exercising my discretion to deny the motion.a subsequently issued minute order stated that defendant motion is denied as it would be inequitable to grant it.the court bases its decision on some of the equitable issues raised in the opposition.appellants filed a timely appeal.
