in,in the midst of a nationwide energy crisis,congress passed purpa,a series of measures designed to reduce the nation dependence on fossil fuels.see ferc mississippi,d.section of purpa sought to encourage the development of cogeneration and small power production facilities.id.at.see a.congress felt that two problems impeded the development of nontraditional generating facilities traditional electricity utilities were reluctant to purchase power from,and to sell power to,the nontraditional facilities,and the regulation of these alternative energy sources by state and federal utility authorities imposed financial burdens upon the nontraditional facilities and thus discouraged their development.ferc,at.the act required the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or the commission to promulgate rules implementing the statute,in particular,rules requiring utilities to enter into purchase and sale agreements with qualifying cogeneration and small power production facilities qfs.a see id.defining qfs.these rules,which regulate the rates of purchase and sale,are to be implemented by state utilities commissions.id.f see ferc,at.purpa requires ferc to prescribe rules exempting qfs from certain state and federal energy regulations.e ferc,at.
the constitutionality of purpa,including specifically the role of state agencies in implementing the ferc rules,was upheld by the supreme court.see ferc,at.
in,in order to fulfill the puc responsibility under purpa to set just and reasonable rates for sales of electric power to public utilities,the new hampshire puc issued a generic rate order updating and establishing the short term and long term rates to be paid by public service company of new hampshire to small power producers and cogenerators.re small energy producers and cogenerators order,july,hereinafter generic rate order.
in august,the puc approved greenwood application under the generic rate order for a,avoided cost rate structure,from september,through september,for greenwood three hydroelectric plants waterloom falls,otis falls,and chamberlain falls.alden greenwood alden eng g order.all three plants are qfs for the purposes of purpa.as a result of this rate approval,greenwood and the public service company of new hampshire psnh entered into interconnection agreements under which psnh agreed to compensate greenwood for electricity produced by those three plants at the rate provided in the puc generic rate order and greenwood approval order.this meant psnh would pay greenwood approximately per of electricity generated by his three plants in the first year,and that rate would increase each year,culminating in a rate of per in the thirtieth year psnh would also pay capacity charges increasing from per in the first year to per in the final year.
in may of,the puc reconsidered its order.re alden greenwood order,may.it concluded that it had made a mistake in the order,and that it had not,as purpa and the ferc rules required,treated greenwood three qfs in a manner consistent for facilities that are similarly circumstanced.id.at.in addition,its rate design was not just and reasonable to the electric consumers of the electric utility and in the public interest,as required by purpa and the ferc rules.id.thus,the puc stated reason for altering the earlier order was that it was required to do so to comply with the federal purpa statute and the ferc regulations.the puc rescinded the final ten years of the rate order applicable to greenwood three plants,reducing it to twenty years.id.this meant greenwood lost the previously approved rate for the period from september through september in his contract with psnh.greenwood,of course,had no contract with the puc.
when greenwood learned of the rescission order,he moved for reconsideration before the puc and was given a hearing on november.following that hearing,the puc on december,issued order number,denying greenwood motion for reconsideration.re alden greenwood,alden eng g order.greenwood did not at that time challenge the authority of the puc to enter the rescission order.nor did he claim the order was preempted by or inconsistent with purpa.to the contrary,the puc found that at the hearing greenwood conceded that the commission had acted within its authority in issuing the rescission order,and did not contest the merits of the order.id.accordingly,the puc let stand its order rescinding the last ten years of greenwood rate order.
greenwood did not appeal that decision to the new hampshire supreme court,as he was permitted to do.see g.ann.nor did he petition ferc to bring an enforcement proceeding,see h b,or file suit in federal court asserting that the puc order was preempted by purpa,a claim the plaintiff now makes in this suit.
nearly seventeen years later,on september,as the first twenty years of his rate schedule were about to expire,greenwood filed a petition with the puc seeking a declaratory ruling that the puc rescission order violated the provisions of purpa and the pertinent ferc regulations and the puc original approval of his rate schedule remains in full force and effect for its entire term.he asserted that purpa and pertinent ferc regulations divested the puc of the authority it exercised in to rescind the generic rate order of.the puc on april,denied greenwood petition,concluding that the doctrine of res judicata prevented him from revisiting the issues the puc resolved against him nearly seventeen years earlier.re alden greenwood dba alden eng g order.
greenwood moved for reconsideration,asserting that res judicata was inapplicable because the puc had lacked the authority in to act as it did.on june,the puc rejected that argument,concluding that greenwood had waived his right to pursue his claim in a federal forum and had voluntarily submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the puc.re alden greenwood dba alden eng g order,june.greenwood did not appeal that decision to the new hampshire supreme court.instead,greenwood filed a petition for declaratory and injunctive relief in federal court on july.
plaintiff brought this suit,asserting general federal question jurisdiction under.the suit claims that the four puc orders,from the rescission order on,were expressly preempted by purpa section e,e,and ferc implementing rules.the four orders are the order which modified the rate order by limiting greenwood rate to twenty years from the original thirty years the order upholding that decision after a hearing on greenwood petition for reconsideration,the order denying greenwood petition for declaratory judgment on the basis of res judicata,and the order denying greenwood motion for reconsideration.
the district court,in a written order on july,granted summary judgment to plaintiff and enjoined the puc from enforcing its order and the subsequent orders denying reconsideration.greenwood,wl,at.thus the court order effectively reinstated the final ten years of the original rate order,favorable to greenwood,which the puc had rescinded in.the court held that purpa divested the puc of authority to issue the rescission order,and consequently,since the rescission order was void ab initio,res judicata did not bar the plaintiff claim.id.at.
the district court also held that,even though plaintiff had waited over seventeen years afte
