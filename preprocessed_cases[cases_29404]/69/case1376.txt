janet edwards,who has hepatitis c,was fired from her job at a nursing home.the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc thereafter sued the nursing home,claiming that edwards termination violated the americans with disabilities act ada.after the district court partially granted with respect to the eeoc punitive damages claim and partially denied the nursing home motion for judgment as a matter of law,a jury returned a verdict in favor of the eeoc.in this appeal,we conclude that the district court did not err in partially denying the nursing home motion for judgment as a matter of law but that it should not have granted the motion with regard to punitive damages.we therefore affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
janet edwards has been diagnosed with hepatitis c,a viral disease that is transmitted by contact.edwards began regular medical treatment in and by january there was no detectable amount of the hepatitis c virus in her blood,although according to her physician she will always have chronic hepatitis.edwards continued to be treated and monitored for hepatitis through at least july.
on august,edwards applied for a job at york manor nursing center,a nursing home in muskogee,oklahoma the application process included completing a physical requirements questionnaire that included the following item in order that we may protect our residents from disease,please indicate if you are under a doctor care or taking medications now.despite the ongoing monitoring of her hepatitis,edwards checked the no box.she was subsequently hired as a dietary aide and eventually became a cook for the york manor residents and employees.
york manor first learned that edwards had hepatitis on april.that day,edwards accidentally cut her hand at work.edwards also worked at york out theresa raines,york manor director of nursing,and told her both that edwards had cut herself and that edwards had hepatitis.after work,edwards herself asked to talk to raines,off the record,and told raines about her hepatitis.two days later,raines called edwards and informed her that she would not be allowed to return to work without a doctor permission.edwards promptly asked her doctor for a letter clearing her to return to work he mailed her such a letter,which arrived at her house on april.however,that evening,before edwards had a chance to bring the letter to york manor,edwards kitchen supervisor called to tell her that she was fired.
the next week,edwards took her doctor note to mitchell townsend,york manor facility administrator,and asked to be reinstated as a cook.according to edwards,townsend refused,saying well,janet,you having hepatitis c,you will not work in our kitchen.when edwards asked him if she was being terminated because of her hepatitis,according to edwards he replied,no,i firing you because you falsified information on your job application.townsend then ended the conversation.
in june,edwards filed a discrimination charge with the eeoc.an eeoc investigator recorded that when he called townsend to discuss edwards complaint,townsend responded by asking how would you like to eat food containing her blood,if she ever cut her finger the investigator also reported that townsend stated that if this got out to their clients they would have a mass exodus from their nursing home.
in september,the eeoc filed a complaint on edwards behalf against heartway corporation.the complaint alleged that heartway violated title i of the ada by firing edwards because it regarded her as disabled.the case was eventually tried to a jury.at the close of the eeoc case in chief,heartway moved for judgment as a matter of law.part of heartway motion was a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence showing that heartway discriminated against edwards.the district court denied this part of the motion.heartway motion also sought judgment as a matter of law on the issue of punitive damages,claiming that there was no evidence that heartway exhibited malice or reckless indifference.over the eeoc objection,the court granted this portion of heartway motion,saying that it saw no basis under supreme court precedent or under the ada or under the evidence to send the issue of punitive damages to the jury.
the case was then submitted to the jury,which found by a preponderance of the evidence that heartway discriminated against janet edwards due to perceived disability.the jury awarded edwards in compensatory damages and recommended an award of back pay,which the district court awarded in the amount of following the jury verdict,heartway renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law,again contending that the evidence was insufficient to prove the eeoc prima facie case.the district court denied heartway renewed motion.
the eeoc timely filed a notice of appeal and now argues that the district court erred in withholding the issue of punitive damages from the jury.heartway timely the district court denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law as to the claim of discrimination.
ii.discussion 
heartway appeal 
we first address heartway because if heartway is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,there is no need to address the eeoc appeal.heartway asserts that the district court partial denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law was erroneous in two respects.first,heartway claims that the eeoc failed to produce sufficient evidence that it regarded edwards as disabled.second,heartway claims that the evidence showed that edwards was terminated for lying on her job application,not because of a disability.we conclude that heartway was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on either ground.
standard of review 
we review the district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo,applying the same legal standard as the district court.hampton dillard dep t stores,cir quotation omitted.
a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law only if the evidence points but one way and is susceptible to no reasonable inferences which may support the opposing party position.it is important to note that,in reviewing the record,we will not weigh evidence,judge witness credibility,or challenge the factual conclusions of the jury.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate only if there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a claim under the controlling law.we consider the evidence,and any inferences drawn therefrom,in favor of the party.

whether edwards was regarded as disabled 
a.the applicable law 
to prove that heartway violated the ada by firing edwards,the eeoc was required to prove,inter alia,that edwards had a disability.see a no covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to discharge of employees emphasis added the ada broadly defines disability as follows 
the term disability means,with respect to an individual 
a a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual 
b a record of such an impairment or 
c being regarded as having such an impairment.
in claiming that edwards had a disability,the eeoc has never asserted that either of the first two parts of the above definition apply,that edwards actually had a qualifying impairment or record of impairment rather,it has consistently argued only that heartway regarded edwards as having a substantially limiting impairment the applicable eeoc regulations specify that the regarded as standard may be met when a person h as a physical or mental impairment that does not substantially limit major life activities but is treated by a covered entity as constituting such limitation.l see also sutton united air lines,d stating that the regarded as standard is met when a covered entity mistakenly believes that an actual,nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities.heartway apparently does not dispute that edwards hepatitis is a physical impairment that does not substantially limit her major life activities.thus,the question is whether heartway nonetheless treated edwards hepatitis as substantially limiting one or more of her major life activities.
the only major life activity at issue in this case is the activity of working.see i major life activities means functions such as working.the eeoc regulations state that w ith respect to the major life activity of working,
t he term substantially limit ed means significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training,skills and abilities.the inability to perform a single,particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.
id.j i quotation marks added see also bolton scrivner,cir applying this regulation.thus,to prevail on its regarded as claim,the eeoc was required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that heartway treated edwards hepatitis as significantly restrict ing her ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs as compared to similarly trained persons.see,doebele mgmt,cir.
the sixth circuit has explained that it is particularly difficult for a plaintiff to prevail on this type of claim 
proving that an employee is regarded as disabled in the major life activity of working takes a plaintiff to the farthest reaches of the ada.it is a question embedded almost entirely in the employer subjective state of mind.thus,proving the case becomes extraordinarily difficult.not only must a plaintiff demonstrate that an employer thought he was disabled,he must also show that the employer thought that his disability would prevent him from performing a broad class of jobs.as it is safe to assume employers do not regularly consider the panoply of other jobs their employees could perform,and certainly do not often create direct evidence of such considerations,the plaintiff task becomes even more difficult.
ross campbell soup,cir.our cases agree that there is a strong subjective component to this inquiry.in nielsen moroni feed,cir,the former president of a farming cooperative sued the cooperative after he was fired by its board of directors.id.at.he claimed that comments made by the board members showed that they had fired him because they regarded him as disabled because he was illegally using drugs.id.at.this,he claimed,violated the ada since the board members had treated his drug addiction as substantially limiting him in the major life activity of working.id.we affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the cooperative 
b ecause nielsen merely presented evidence suggesting that moroni feed no longer believed him capable of performing his duties as president of the,but presented no evidence whatsoever that moroni feed believed any perceived illegal drug addiction on his part significantly restricted his ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes.
id.at quoting bolton,at.as this quote indicates,for an employee to prevail on a regarded as claim with respect to the major life activity of working,there must be sufficient evidence that the employer subjectively believed the employee to be significantly restricted as to a class of jobs or broad range of jobs in various classes.see also doebele,at tate farmland industries,cir mckenzie dovala,cir sullivan neiman marcus group,cir.there will often not be evidence on this point,but it is not an insurmountable showing.
furthermore,although the above inquiry is strongly subjective,the question of what constitutes a class of jobs or broad range of jobs in various classes is an objective question.that is,there need not be evidence that the employer knew or believed that the group of jobs from which the employer viewed the employee as restricted constituted or included a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes.however,that the inquiry is an objective one does not mean that there are standards as to what a class of jobs is the supreme court,in addressing the meaning of the terms class of jobs and broad range of jobs,has only spoken in generalities thus far.rossbach city of miami,cir per curiam.the court has said the following 
to be substantially limited in the major life activity of working,an employee must be precluded from more than one type of job,a specialized job,or a particular job of choice.if jobs utilizing an individual skills but perhaps not his or her unique talents are available,one is not precluded from a substantial class of jobs.similarly,if a host of different types of jobs are available,one is not precluded from a broad range of jobs.
sutton,at.looking to similarly broad language from the eeoc regulations,we have noted that 
a class of jobs is defined as t he job from which the individual has been disqualified because of an impairment,and the number and types of jobs utilizing similar training,knowledge,skills or abilities,within that geographical area,from which the individual is also disqualified because of the impairment.j ii b.a broad range of jobs in various classes is defined as t he job from which the individual has been disqualified because of an impairment,and the number and types of other jobs not utilizing similar training,knowledge,skills or abilities,within that geographical area,from which the individual is also disqualified because of the impairment.j ii c.

based on this authority,it is apparent that the eeoc was required to prove that heartway treated edwards disease as significantly restricting her ability to perform both the job from which she was disqualified,as well as either a jobs utilizing similar training,knowledge,skills or abilities within her geographical area or b a broad range of jobs not utilizing similar training,knowledge,skills or abilities within the geographical area.see siemon v.at t,cir.of course,the eeoc has repeatedly emphasized that the requirement that the relevant jobs constitute a class or broad range of jobs 
is not meant to require an onerous evidentiary showing a n individual need not identify the exact number of jobs using similar or dissimilar skills in a certain geographic area.further,an individual need not count positions or otherwise present a precise number of jobs from which s he is disqualified because of an impairment.instead,the reference to the number and types of jobs only require s the presentation of evidence of general employment demographics of recognized occupational classifications that indicate the approximate number of jobs,few,many,most from which an individual would be excluded because of an impairment.furthermore,in cases where it is clear that an individual is excluded from a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes,only minimal evidence will be required.
eeoc compliance manual quoting pt.app.eeoc rockwell int l,cir favorably quoting the regulation quint staley,cir same foreman babcock wilcox,cir same.however,the eeoc retains the burden to relate the characteristics of the class or broad range of jobs to the consequences of her perceived impairment.see j ii b c.
the question we face in applying the above standards is whether or not there was a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to conclude that heartway treated edwards hepatitis as significantly restricting her ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes.hampton,at.we conclude that there was.
because townsend was the one who made the decision to fire edwards,his beliefs regarding edwards hepatitis is the relevant inquiry.the evidence supporting the eeoc claim that townsend treated edwards hepatitis as restricting her ability to work boils down to four items 
when edwards asked townsend for her job back,he told her you having hepatitis c,you will not work in our kitchen.
townsend asked the eeoc investigator how would you like to eat food containing her blood,if she ever cut her finger 
townsend stated to the eeoc investigator that if this got out to their clients they would have a mass exodus from their nursing home.
an eeoc economist,elvira sisolak,testified that the tasks,education,and experience relevant to the job of dietary aide correspond to two job groups that,in her opinion,account for about percent of all jobs in the service worker category in the relevant geographic area 
as to the first part of our inquiry,there was sufficient evidence to show that townsend viewed edwards as substantially limited in her ability to perform her job at york manor.his comments to edwards you having hepatatis c,you will not work in our kitchen and the eeoc investigator how would you like to eat food containing her blood could be taken by a reasonable jury to indicate that townsend thought it would be unsafe or unsanitary for edwards to continue cooking food for the nursing home residents and staff this is evidence that townsend treated edwards as limited in her ability to perform the job of nursing home cook.tate,at finding a genuine issue of material fact as to whether farmland regarded tate as significantly restricted in his ability to perform his job because farmland manager stated that he believed it would have been unsafe for tate to drive one of the company trucks emphasis added gowesky singing river hosp,cir indicating that administrators discriminatory comments about an employee with hepatitis could perhaps be taken as question ing her fitness to practice emergency room medicine,a professional calling in which routine exposure to blood and bodily fluids might allow the hepatitis c virus to spread.similarly,townsend expression of concern about a mass exodus is evidence that he thought that edwards could not properly perform her job because of how others might react to her perceived disability.see pt.app.a lthough an individual may have an impairment that does not in fact substantially limit a major life activity,the reaction of others may prove just as disabling.such an impairment might not diminish a person physical or mental capabilities,but could nevertheless substantially limit that person ability to work as a result of the negative reactions of others to the impairment.quoting arline,at.see also eeoc compliance manual common attitudinal barriers include,but are not limited to,concerns about safety,insurance,liability,and acceptance by and customers.emphases added quotation omitted.therefore,there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that townsend viewed edwards as significantly restricted in her ability to perform her job at york manor.
this evidence was also sufficient for a jury to conclude that townsend treated edwards as significantly restricted in her ability to perform other jobs,in addition to the job she held at york manor.specifically,a jury could reasonably view the testimony as showing that townsend believed edwards was restricted in her ability to do any kitchen job you have hepatitis c,you will not work in our kitchen and any other job where there is a chance of bleeding and thereby transmitting hepatitis how would you like to eat food containing her blood,if she ever cut her finger.mckenzie,at,evidence that an employer rejected a job application because members of his staff told him that the applicant would be better off in some other field supported the conclusion that the employer considered the applicant to be unfit for a broad range of jobs 
finally,we conclude that the jobs from which edwards was regarded as restricted constituted a class of jobs.as noted earlier,the eeoc regulations define a class of jobs as the job from which one is disqualified and jobs utilizing similar training,knowledge,skills or abilities,within that geographical area.j ii b see also siemon,at.the seventh circuit has explained the inquiry this way 
i n order to define a meaningful class of jobs,we must look to the training,knowledge,skills,and ability required to perform the particular work,as well as the geographic area reasonably available to the plaintiff.common job groupings within a particular industry would also be relevant,just as they are in the somewhat analogous area of defining relevant markets in antitrust cases.
depaoli,at.the eeoc expert witness,elvira sisolak,testified that jobs in the health care support and food preparation and food serving census job the geographical training,knowledge,and skills similar to those utilized in edwards job at york manor.not these jobs,operating room assistant,first aid nurse,cook,waitress would require kitchen work present the risk of cuts and contamination it is reasonable to conclude,based on this expert evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from townsend comments,that townsend viewed edwards as significantly restricted in her ability to perform a class of such jobs.
therefore,we hold that there was a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a jury to conclude that edwards had a disability as defined by the ada.
whether edwards was terminated because of a disability 
to prove that heartway violated the ada,the eeoc was also required to prove that edwards was terminated because of her disability.see a no covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to discharge of employees emphasis added.we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury conclusion that heartway did indeed terminate edwards because of her disability.
edwards testified that townsend told her you having hepatitis c,you will not work in our kitchen.although this is arguably an ambiguous statement a jury could reasonably take it to mean that edwards was being fired because she had hepatitis and was therefore in townsend mind unable to perform her job or other jobs in the same class.similarly,townsend expression of concern to the eeoc investigator that there would be mass exodus if the clients found out that the cook had hepatitis supports a finding that edwards was therefore fired because she had that disease and was thus restricted in her ability to perform her job and other jobs in the same class.
heartway spends several pages of its brief trying to show that edwards actually did lie on her job application and that this provided a sufficient justification for terminating her.however,even assuming that edwards did indeed lie and even assuming that this would have provided a valid reason for terminating her under the applicable law,a reasonable jury could have nonetheless concluded that she was actually fired because of her disability.
heartway points to the allegedly uncontroverted testimony that townsend fired edwards for dishonesty,not for having a disability.at trial,townsend stated i fired her for being untruthful on her application for employment.when asked did you fire miss edwards because you thought she was disabled he responded no.his testimony also included this exchange 
is untruthfulness a basis for termination at heartway 
and if you discover any untruthfulness,your common practice is to terminate that employee 
similarly,edwards testified that when she asked townsend if she was being fired for having hepatitis,townsend replied no,i firing you because you falsified information on your application.although this testimony certainly could lead a jury to agree with heartway version of the facts,the jury was also entitled to conclude that townsend was not entirely truthful at trial and that he misled edwards when he told her that she was being fired for lying on her application.see reeves sanderson plumbing,d a lthough in considering a motion for judgment as a matter of law the court should review the record as a whole,it must disregard all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe and give credence to the evidence favoring the nonmovant as well as that evidence supporting the moving party that is uncontradicted and unimpeached,at least to the extent that that evidence comes from disinterested witnesses.quotation omitted.heartway is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law just because there was evidence that,if believed,would have weighed heavily in favor of heartway.based on townsend statements to edwards and to the eeoc investigator,and despite the contrary testimony at trial,a reasonable jury could conclude that
