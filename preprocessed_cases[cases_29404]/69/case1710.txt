this appeal is the latest attempt by various hospitals to recoup financial reimbursement from the department of health care services the department following their successful petition for writ of mandate to have sb invalidated.although the hospitals failed to seek monetary damages in that original petition for writ of mandate,they did request financial reimbursement in administrative proceedings,which were stayed at the hospitals request pending resolution of court proceedings they also sought monetary relief from the trial court in a motion to amend their original petition for writ of mandate and in a new court proceeding,which they later dismissed.after all of the court proceedings terminated,the administrative law judges alj dismissed the administrative proceedings,prompting the underlying petitions for writ of mandate.at issue is whether the aljs properly dismissed the administrative proceedings on the grounds that the hospitals requests for financial reimbursement are barred by the doctrine of res judicata.
we conclude that dignity health,hi desert,and mee requests are all barred by the doctrine of res judicata.the hospitals could have requested monetary damages in their original petition for writ of mandate,as has already been pointed out to the parties by the court of appeal,third appellate district,but they failed to do so.the parties are bound by that decision and can not circumvent it by seeking writ relief here.
regarding modoc,we conclude that its request is barred by the doctrine of forfeiture given its failure to object or otherwise oppose the department motion to dismiss in front of the alj.

challenge to sb sacramento superior court denies writ to the hospitals 
dignity health,hi desert,and mee collectively the petitioners along with other noncontract hospitals,challenged sb in september via a petition for writ of mandate pursuant to code of civil procedure section in sacramento superior court.the petitioners specifically alleged that sb was invalid,with some expecting losses of million or more as a result of the reimbursement freeze.while the writ petition prayed for declaratory and injunctive relief,it did not request monetary relief.
on december,the sacramento superior court rejected most of the petitioners allegations.the petitioners filed an appeal.mission i,supra,th at.
administrative action and stay pending resolution of mission i 
meanwhile in early and,the department issued its audited cost reports for the fiscal year to the hospitals.while mission i was pending,the hospitals each filed an administrative action challenging their audit reports on the grounds that the reimbursement cap sb was illegal.dignity health,hi desert,and mee separately advised each alj that it was a plaintiff in the pending mission action.each of these hospitals represented since this issue should be resolved in the pending court of appeal decision,the hospital hereby requests that this appeal be put in abeyance pending the outcome of the mission appeal.
although it was not a petitioner in the original mission petition,modoc requested that the hearing set on its audit report be taken off calendar because the same issues involved in this case are being heard in a pending state court action,and the upcoming decision in mission i would impact its case.
each alj granted each hospital request for abeyance to await a decision in mission

motion to enforce the writ writ granted as requested by the hospitals 
after remand,on april,the sacramento superior court issued a writ of mandate prohibiting the department from applying sb in computing reimbursement rates for the fiscal year.see mission hospital regional medical center douglas may.lexis,at mission ii.the parties disputed whether this decision applied retroactively.the department believed that,by this time,it had already applied sb and reimbursed most of the noncontract hospitals.the hospitals,on the other hand,claimed that mission i holding entitled them to both retroactive and prospective relief.mission ii,supra,at.thus,the petitioners filed a motion to enforce the writ of mandate,asking the trial court to order the department to recalculate the reimbursement amounts for for all plaintiffs and to reimburse them the amounts they would have received for that fiscal year had stats.section not been applied.mission ii,supra,at pp.

court of appeal reverses trial court mission ii 
the court of appeal,third appellate district,reversed the trial court order enforcing the writ,holding that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to authorize additional relief beyond what had been ordered.mission ii,supra.lexis,at.the court of appeal reasoned as follows in mission i,the petitioners only sought prospective declaratory and mandamus relief they did not request any other type of relief,including financial reimbursement.mission ii,supra,at.while the court of appeal was expressly sympathetic to plaintiffs and the trial court efforts to ensure the state does not enrich itself pursuant to its unlawful acts,which are here established by the legislature and the department decision not to challenge mission i substantively in their petition for review,the enforcement burden rested on plaintiffs.if they wanted to be reimbursed for monies wrongfully withheld or taken,they were burdened to make all appropriate allegations and pleadings for that to occur.they did not do this in mission mission ii,supra,at.
motion to amend the petition and the new petition 
following mission ii,on november,the hospitals moved to amend the original petition in sacramento superior court to allege a request for reimbursement.on the same day that the motion for leave to amend was filed,the hospitals filed a new petition in sacramento superior court mission iii mirroring the petition,but expressly praying for reimbursement in a manner similar to their proposed amended petition.the sacramento superior court denied the motion to amend the petition on the grounds that the pleading was substantively identical to the mission iii petition.the hospitals did not appeal that ruling.
in april,the department and some of the hospitals settled the original petition.later,the hospitals filed a notice of dismissal of the mission iii petition without prejudice.
dismissal of administrative appeal 
after mission ii,the department filed motions to dismiss the various administrative appeals.
the aljs granted the department motions.
regarding mee,the alj found that the issue raised in this tribunal is identical to the issue litigated in the sacramento superior court and the third district court of appeals,the validity of the rate freeze mandated by section of,the implementation of which limited the amount of mee medi cal reimbursement for fiscal year.in both its civil and administrative actions,mee alleges that section violates sections a and a,california medicaid state plan,and the due process and impairment of contract clauses of action of the united states and california constitutions.mee acknowledges the fact that the issues are the same in its june,statement of disputed issues wherein it states that the mission litigation addresses the same issue that is raised in this administrative appeal.mee requested the administrative appeal be put in abeyance because the issues were the same.in both actions,mee seeks redress for harm resulting from the enactment and implementation of section of.accordingly,this tribunal finds that mee civil and administrative actions arise out of the same primary right.fn.omitted.
the alj then cited mission ii and found that mee was obligated to seek all relief from its claim that section is invalid in the prior litigation.mee failed to do so.in so ruling,the alj expressly noted the hospital acknowledgement that it sought monetary relief in that tribunal because it failed to ask for such relief in the superior court.in sum as outlined by the third district court of appeals,the petitioners were permitted to seek retroactive monetary relief from through their writ petition,but failed to request said relief.under the doctrine of res judicata claim preclusion,it can not seek this relief in this forum.res judicata bars this action.
dignity health 
regarding dignity health,the alj found that the order dignity health sought ask ed for the same,or substantially the same,retroactive relief that dignity health was unable to obtain in mission i.the petitioners in mission i did not ask for retroactive relief they requested only prospective declaratory and mandamus relief.based on both the published and unpublished court of appeal decisions in mission i and the doctrine of res judicata,the alj did not have the authority to grant the relief requested.after summarizing the primary rights theory and the doctrine against claim splitting,the alj determined because both suits the mission litigation and the administrative action challenge the same action by the state and involve the same harm to dignity health,both implicate the same primary right and constitute the same cause of action under california law.
the alj continued while conceding that the doctrine of res judicata bars relitigation of issues that were previously decided in other proceedings involving the same parties,dignity health points out that mission i merely held that the petitioners in mission i had not requested retrospective relief and t hat is a far cry from a broad ruling that they are not entitled to retrospective relief under any circumstances,whether in court or through statutorily authorized administrative proceedings.citation.however,as noted,res judicata applies not only to all matters actually raised in the first suit but also all matters which could have been raised.indeed,the very essence of improper claim splitting is asking for relief,or asserting grounds,in a second action that should have been brought in an earlier proceeding.a litigant may not pursue a remedy in one lawsuit and another remedy for the same wrong in a second action.citation.
the alj concluded the court of appeal may unpublished decision makes clear that petitioners in mission i could have asserted a claim for monetary relief in that action.they did not do so.consequently,dignity health request for an order of retroactive monetary relief in this proceeding is barred by,or merged in,mission fns.omitted.
later,in may,the alj considered the hospital challenge to the method in which sb was applied to it after consideration of the briefs,the alj was unconvinced.it thus dismissed the hospital administrative appeal in its entirety,reasoning,inter alia,that the department instructions in how to apply the sb reimbursement limitation were reasonable.
the alj granted the department motion to dismiss hi desert appeal on various grounds.regarding res judicata,the alj noted that hi desert made no argument in opposition.on the merits,all elements of res judicata had been satisfied.specifically,the issue raised in this tribunal is identical to the issue litigated in the superior court,the validity of the rate freeze mandated by section of,the implementation of which limited hi desert medi cal reimbursement for fiscal year hi desert acknowledges this in its october,statement of disputed issues,and it was the basis for hi desert request that the matter be placed in abeyance.in both actions,hi desert seeks redress for harm resulting from the law enactment and implementation.accordingly,this tribunal finds that hi desert civil and administrative actions arise out of the same issue or cause of action.
in the motion to dismiss modoc appeal,the department argued that the office of administrative hearings and appeals lacked jurisdiction over the issues raised in the administrative appeal.specifically the alj is prohibited by the california constitution from declaring a law invalid,illegal,or unconstitutional and the issues raised in the hospital appeal were not audit adjustments rather,they were mandatory payment reductions.thus,without any audit adjustment being placed at issue in this audit appeal,the administrative law judge is without jurisdiction to fashion the remedy sought by modoc.
despite being given ample notice and opportunity,modoc never filed an opposition to the department motion to dismiss.
ultimately,the alj issued an order granting the department motion to dismiss,finding that tribunal lacks jurisdiction to grant the relief requested by modoc.
dignity health request to amend the audit report 
in february,while both its administrative appeal and the mission litigation were pending,dignity health requested that the department amend its audit report and recalculate the fiscal period without applying sb.the department denied this request.
procedural background 
in,the hospitals timely filed petitions for writ of mandate pursuant to section,seeking an order reversing the decision dismissing their administrative appeals,and pursuant to section,declaring that the director of the department abused his discretion by declining to issue an amended audit report for the fiscal period at issue that calculated the hospitals reimbursement without application of the sb limit.
the hospitals filed a motion in support of their requests for a writ of mandate.
judge chalfant order 
the trial court james chalfant determined that the alj erred in finding that mee request was barred by the doctrine of res judicata.according to the trial court,the issue was whether the reimbursement relief was within the scope of mee primary right and should have been raised in the mission litigation.the answer to that question is yes only if damages could have been pled and proved in the mission litigation if mee could not have obtained damages in the mission litigation,then they were not within the scope of that litigation and res judicata does not apply.
the trial court went on to consider mission ii although mission ii touched on the issue of mandamus damages,it did not conclude that damages were available to the mission petitioners.rather,the mission ii decision concluded that damages generally are available in mandamus,but the mission petitioners did not allege and prove damages.consequently,damages were not within the scope of the court of appeals writ to the trial court,which lacked authority to award them.
the trial court framed the issue as follows t he issue of whether mee could have pled and proved damages in the mission litigation turns on whether the department could exercise discretion in awarding them or they necessarily follow from its breach of ministerial duty.the trial court believed that various provisions of welfare and institutions code section demonstrate that mee has a statutory right to an administrative appeal from a department decision.the director was required to apply his special expertise to mee administrative appeal before a decision on damages would be ripe for judicial review.mee did not exhaust its administrative remedies before the mission litigation it was pending.if mee failed to permit the director to exercise his or her discretion in the administrative appeal on the damages issue,and instead sought damages in mission,the department could have demurred for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.citation.because mee damages remedy could not properly have been raised,it was not within the scope of the mission litigation.
in sum,d amages were not within the scope of the mission petitioners traditional mandamus claim because they were subject to statutory administrative mandamus,and a jurisdictional defense of failure to exhaust administrative remedies.mee claim for reimbursement damages is not barred by res judicata.the department did not proceed in the manner required by law in dismissing mee administrative appeal,and the petition is granted.
judgment was entered,and this timely appeal by the department ensued.
judge lavin orders 
dignity health 
the trial court luis lavin agreed with the alj determination that the administrative appeal was barred by the doctrine of res judicata.as the trial court noted,it was undisputed that the mission litigation and the instant litigation involved the same parties the decisions in mission i and mission ii were on the merits and final and the mission litigation and this lawsuit involve the same primary right.in fact,when it initiated the underlying administrative appeal,the hospital admitted that the issue raised below was the same issue sought to be resolved in the mission litigation this admission is fatal.
in so ruling,the trial court rejected dignity health contention that it could pursue this lawsuit because it was seeking a different remedy than that sought in the mission litigation.the trial court stated w hile dignity health may not have been aware of the extent of sb monetary impact,the initial petition anticipated the department application of the rate freeze would cause monetary damage,as the petition alleges a ll petitioner hospitals will be affected by this reimbursement freeze,with some expecting losses of million or more as a result of the reimbursement freeze.thus,dignity health,along with the other petitioning hospitals,was aware of the potential for the injury sought to be recovered in the instant action at the time the mission litigation was initiated.
the trial court also took note of dignity health litigation strategy furthermore,in mission ii,dignity health actually argued that it was entitled to retrospective monetary relief.as stated by the court of appeal if dignity health wanted to be reimbursed for monies wrongfully withheld or taken,they were burdened to make all appropriate allegations and pleadings for that to occur.they did not do this in mission i.the fact that dignity health subsequent attempt to amend its pleading in the underlying mission i trial court proceeding to include a request for monetary relief to address the mission ii decision was not successful does not entitle it to seek the same relief in a new lawsuit.to hold otherwise would allow an unsuccessful party to keep filing separate lawsuits until it obtains a desired outcome.citation.put another way,dignity health may not collaterally challenge the trial court denial of its request to amend the pleading in mission i by filing this action.
the trial court also rejected dignity health reliance upon daugherty board of trustees d daugherty.and,it found dignity health equitable arguments unavailing.
finally,the trial court found that dignity health failed to demonstrate that the department abused its discretion in refusing to issue an amended audit report for the fiscal year.
the trial court order denying hi desert petition for writ of mandate is nearly identical to the one filed regarding dignity health petition.notably,the trial court rejected hi desert reliance upon mata city of los angeles th mata and other authorities for the proposition that a judgment in a mandamus proceeding can not have a res judicata effect because a mandamus proceeding is a special proceeding rather than an ordinary action.
the trial court order denying modoc petition for writ of mandate closely mirrors the ones filed regarding dignity health and hi desert petitions.importantly,the trial court found that modoc failed to oppose the department motion to dismiss that was brought before the alj.as a result,modoc did not raise any of its challenges to the merits of the department motion or its contentions that the department misinterpreted the nature of the issues raised in modoc administrative appeal.modoc has offered no explanation for why it failed to oppose the department motion below and it has made no showing that filing an opposition to the department motion would have been futile or would otherwise be excused under a recognized exception to the exhaustion doctrine.
further,it found that the legal question exception did not apply.
even though the trial court determined that modoc had forfeited various arguments,it reached the merits and found that modoc was not entitled to the requested relief,namely retroactive application of mission 
judgment and appeal 
judgment was entered in favor of the department in all three cases,and these timely appeals by hi desert,modoc,and dignity health ensued.
discussion 
standard of review 
when reviewing the denial of a petition for writ of administrative mandate under code of civil procedure section,we ask whether the public agency committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion.abuse of discretion is established if the public agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law,the order or decision is not supported by the findings,or the findings are not supported by the evidence.citations.county of kern state of health care services th.like the trial court,our task is to determine whether the department decision is supported by substantial evidence.pacific coast medical enterprises department of benefit payments d.
as to questions of law,appellate courts perform essentially the same function as trial courts in an administrative mandate proceeding,and the trial court conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.citation.jenron department of social services th.
additionally,as the department and dignity health agree,i n traditional mandamus actions,the agency action must be upheld upon review unless it constitutes an abuse of discretion.citation.when reviewing the exercise of discretion,t he scope of review is limited,out of deference to the agency authority and presumed expertise the court may not reweigh the evidence or substitute its judgment for that of the agency.citation.citation.in general the inquiry is limited to whether the decision was arbitrary,capricious,or entirely lacking in evidentiary support citation.when making that inquiry,the court must ensure that an agency has adequately considered all relevant factors,and has demonstrated a rational connection between those factors,the choice made,and the purposes of the enabling statute.citation.citation.citation.foundation city of rohnert park th.
ii.because modoc failed to oppose the department motion to dismiss,it forfeited its right to judicial review 
the department served modoc with its motion to dismiss.thereafter,the alj gave modoc ample opportunity to oppose it.nevertheless,at no time did modoc respond to the department motion.it has also never offered an explanation for why it failed to file an opposition to the department motion.whether characterized as a failure to exhaust administrative remedies niles freeman equipment joseph th,or traditional forfeiture see,dietz meisenheimer herron th,the appellate record establishes that modoc abandoned its administrative proceedings.because modoc can not advance arguments that it failed to raise in the administrative action below,the trial court properly denied modoc request for a writ of mandate.
modoc argues that the alj lacked the authority to dismiss its administrative appeal.but,modoc fails to offer any legal authority to support this contention.benach county of los angeles th.and,as the trial court correctly recognized,an agency is presumed to have regularly performed its official duties,and modoc had the burden of establishing that the alj prejudicially erred against it,alford pierno d.modoc had the burden to establish that the alj lacked the authority to dismiss the administrative proceeding,and it did not meet this burden.
iii.dignity health,hi desert,and mee administrative actions are barred by the doctrine of res judicata 
the critical question presented in these appeals is whether the administrative actions are barred by the doctrine of res judicata.the answer is yes as recognized in mission ii,the hospitals could have sought monetary damages in their original mission i petition.they did not do so.pursuant to the doctrine of res judicata and related policy considerations,they can not do so now.
res judicata describes the preclusive effect of a final judgment on the merits.res judicata,or claim preclusion,prevents relitigation of the same cause of action in a second suit between the same parties or parties in privity with them citation.under the doctrine of res judicata,a judgment for the defendant serves as a bar to further litigation of the same cause of action.mycogen monsanto cal th,fn.omitted mycogen.to operate as a bar,a judgment must be final,on the same claim or cause of action,between the same parties,and must be an adjudication on the merits.mckinney county of santa clara d.
here,all the elements of res judicata are met 
same parties 
the same parties are involved in the instant case as in the mission litigation 
final judgment on the merits 
mission i and mission ii resulted in final judgments on the merits.
in its opening brief,dignity health asserts that there has never been a final judgment on the merits of the relevant issue.according to dignity health,the court in mission ii concluded that the complaint in that case did not tender the issue of retroactive relief,so that the judgment in that case may not be conclusive on this issue.citation.further,a decision by a court that it did not have jurisdiction to reach a particular issue is not considered a determination on the merits for res judicata purposes.italics added.while the mission ii court stated that the trial court lacked jurisdiction in this instance to enforce the writ of mandate,we do not believe that the mission ii court intended to hold that the trial court lacked the power or authority to hear the case.mission ii,supra.lexis,at.rather,mission ii held that the trial court could not grant monetary relief because the petitioners failed to meet their burden of placing the issue of reimbursement in front of the court.in other words,the use of the word jurisdiction does not reflect the trial court power to render judgment in the action.see,witkin,cal.procedure ed.jurisdiction.for this reason,robinson superior court cal d,holding that a dismissal of a proceeding or a denial of relief on the sole ground of lack of jurisdiction is not a decision on the merits and maddern superior court d,reiterating that a determination that the court has no jurisdiction to act is not a decision on the merits are distinguishable.in those cases,the courts recognized that dismissing a case solely for lack of jurisdiction does not amount to a decision on the merits for res judicata purposes as set forth above,that is not what occurred here.
same claim 
both the mission litigation and the instant case revolve around the same claim.
claim preclusion and res judicata apply to a pending proceeding only when a prior adjudication resolved,or could have resolved,the same cause of action pending in the current proceeding.citation.fujifilm yang th,fujifilm.in california,the phrase cause of action is often used indiscriminately to mean counts which state according to different legal theories the same cause of action citation.but for purposes of applying the doctrine of res judicata,the phrase cause of action has a more precise meaning the cause of action is the right to obtain redress for a harm suffered,regardless of the specific remedy sought or the legal theory common law or statutory advanced.boeken philip morris usa,cal th,boeken.causes of action are considered the same if based on the same primary right.citizens for open government city of lodi th.t he primary right is simply the plaintiff right to be free from the particular injury suffered.mycogen,supra,cal th at.thus,under the primary rights theory,the determinative factor is the harm suffered.when two actions involving the same parties seek compensation for the same harm,they generally involve the same primary right.boeken,supra,at.
boeken,supra,cal th is instructive.in that case,the plaintiff brought a loss of consortium action against a cigarette manufacturer after her husband was diagnosed with lung cancer.she sought compensation for the loss of her husband companionship and affection.id.at.about four months after filing that action,she dismissed it with prejudice.id.at.
a year after the dismissal of her loss of consortium action,the plaintiff husband died from the effects of lung cancer.she then filed a wrongful death action against the cigarette manufacturer,again seeking compensation for the loss of her husband companionship.boeken,supra,cal th at.the cigarette manufacturer demurred on the grounds that the plaintiff claim was barred by the doctrine of res judicata the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,and the court of appeal affirmed.ibid.
applying the primary rights theory,the supreme court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeal.boeken,supra,cal th at.the supreme court reasoned that the primary right at issue in both actions,namely the right not to be permanently and wrongfully deprived of spousal companionship and affection,was the same.id.at.
the same holds true in this appeal.the hospitals actions here were based upon the same primary right,namely sb alleged deprivation of a higher level of medi cal reimbursements to noncontract hospitals.granted,the hospitals sought a different remedy in mission i declaratory and injunctive relief as opposed to what they later sought,but that was their litigation choice.the same primary right is at stake in both cases.
for this reason,dignity health reliance upon fujifilm,supra,th is misplaced.in fujifilm,the court of appeal determined that a plaintiff second lawsuit was not barred by res judicata because the claims at issue in the two actions breach of contract and fraudulent transfer characterized by the court as tortious conduct that renders uncollectable a judgment arising from the breach of contract were not based upon the same primary rights.fujifilm,supra,at.in contrast,the hospitals claim in both the mission litigation and the instant litigation is based upon the same primary right the harm they allegedly suffered as a result of the legislature enactment,and the department enforcement,of sb.
in this vein,the hospitals assert that separate wrongs are at stake they contend that the enactment of sb is distinct from the application of that legislation.in other words,according to the hospitals,the mission litigation considered the petitioners collective right to challenge legislation whereas the issue in the underlying administrative appeal is the hospitals right to money.because separate wrongs are at issue,res judicata does not apply.again,while styled differently,the hospitals are making the same challenge,namely that they were or would be deprived of financial reimbursements as a result of sb.the fact that the hospitals may be pursuing or adding a different remedy for the same injury does not create a new primary right.villacres abm industries th,villacres.the petitioners knew when they filed their original petition for writ of mandate in mission i that they would lose monies under sb after all,that is why they sought to invalidate the law.the amount of monies that they would be denied was irrelevant.
it follows that the hospitals administrative claim merged into the mission litigation.see busick workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,by prosecuting the superior court action to final judgment before the board action was final,the plaintiff allowed her cause of action to merge in that judgment,regardless of whether the superior court judgment is based upon an erroneous conclusion.once the courts in the mission litigation invalidated sb and then determined that the hospitals were not entitled to financial reimbursement because they never requested those monies,there was nothing left for the aljs to decide,regardless of
