the dispute in this case arises out of a contract between an insurance adjuster and a condominium located on singer island in palm beach county,florida.the condominium was heavily damaged in back to back hurricanes in september,and it hired an insurance adjuster to assess the loss and present its claims to its insurance company.the condominium loss exceeded both the insurance recovery and the policy limit.
contending that the adjuster caused part of its loss by failing properly to supervise the contractor hired to restore the building,the condominium refused to pay the adjuster fee.the adjuster therefore sued the condominium.the condominium counterclaimed,seeking recovery of the expenses the adjuster negligence had allegedly caused.the case proceeded to trial,and the condominium changed the theory of its counterclaim.it contended that the adjuster was theories of fraudulent misrepresentation and delay in the sums the condominium spent drying out the building.on the adjuster motion,the district court struck the evidence the condominium attempted to introduce to support these theories,and granted the adjuster judgment as a matter of law on the counterclaim.the jury then found for the adjuster on its claim and awarded it the fee it was seeking.the district court thereafter entered judgment for the adjuster in conformance with the jury verdict.
the condominium now appeals,challenging both the district court evidentiary and judgment as a matter of law rulings and requesting a new trial.we affirm.
on september,hurricane frances hit singer island,seriously damaging the tiara condominium tiara,a,oceanfront condominium tower.tiara had an insurance policy with citizens property insurance corporation citizens having a per occurrence limit of approximately million.in the following days,tiara retained southern services,southern to restore its building and ggg to adjust its loss.pursuant to a september,contract the services agreement,ggg undertook to measure and document tiara loss,and present tiara claim to the insurance company s for damage occurring on or about.tiara agreed to pay ggg a percentage of the amount it recovered from citizens on a sliding scale,based on the total amount of recovery.
three weeks later,on september,hurricane jeanne hit singer island,rendering the tiara uninhabitable.the services agreement was orally modified to include adjusting services for jeanne,and ggg fee was proportionately reduced to reflect the increased potential recovery.ggg and tiara considered hurricane jeanne a separate occurrence,such that the insurance policy provided a maximum coverage of million.
with the building uninhabitable,tiara had the options of drying it out or gutting it.tiara had southern dry out the building at a cost of about per day.southern continued the effort from at least october,until august,charging tiara million for the work.tiara had southern cease the process when citizens announced that it intended to treat the hurricanes as one occurrence with a coverage limit of million.
tiara responded to citizens announcement by seeking a declaratory judgment in a florida state court that the hurricanes were separate occurrences and that citizens exposure was million,a sum insufficient to cover tiara losses the lawsuit was resolved through mediation in early march tiara received about million.
after the lawsuit settled,ggg presented tiara with its final statement,which showed a balance of due on its fee.tiara refused to pay it,and,on may,ggg brought the present action.
ggg complaint alleged that ggg had fully performed the services agreement and that tiara refusal to pay the outstanding balance on its fee amounted to breach of contract tiara answered the complaint with a general denial and twenty affirmative defenses and a counterclaim for breach of contract the services agreement and professional negligence both counts centered on southern performance of the restoration work.tiara alleged that,under the services agreement,ggg was responsible for southern proper performance of the restoration work,that southern overcharged for the work,engaged in price gouging,and that ggg breached its duty to tiara by allowing southern to do so the price gouging theory 
ggg replied to tiara counterclaim by denying the material allegations of the breach of contract claim and by moving for judgment on the pleadings on the negligence claim.the district court granted the motion and struck the negligence claim from tiara counterclaim.the case therefore proceeded to trial before a jury on the issues framed by ggg complaint,tiara answer and tiara breach of contract counterclaim.
the trial began may.ggg case consisted of testimony and documentary evidence of the work it had performed under the services agreement.after ggg rested its case on may tiara proceeded with its counterclaim for breach of contract.it abandoned the theory of liability it had ggg was liable for southern price advanced two new theories of contract liability.the first was that ggg failed to perform timely its contractual obligations,causing tiara damages the delay theory.the services agreement provided that ggg would measure,document,and present tiara loss to citizens.tiara claimed that the presentation of the loss should have occurred through the submission of a proof of loss.tiara articulated the claim this way ggg should have filed a proof of loss with citizens within weeks after the second hurricane if timely filed,the proof of loss would have triggered a deadline for citizens to inform tiara whether it would treat tiara loss as stemming from one or two occurrences and had tiara timely received the information that citizens would only pay for one occurrence,it would have ceased the efforts immediately and did so when it received that information in august.instead,ggg did not start working on tiara claim until january because it was busy on other projects.
tiara second theory of contract liability was that ggg improperly advised tiara regarding drying out the building.the district court labeled this theory a misrepresentation theory with three permutations first,citizens never required that the building be dried out,but ggg nonetheless represented to tiara that citizens required the dry out.this representation forced tiara to spend more money to restore the building,which in turn increased the amounts of its loss,its recovery from citizens,and ggg fee second,citizens recommended a dry out,but ggg failed to inform tiara that gutting the building instead would be less expensive and just as effective third,regardless of whether citizens required or merely recommended that the building be dried out,ggg failed to inform tiara that drying the building would be a waste of money.tiara sought the recovery of its expenses under both of its new theories of breach of contract liability the delay theory and the misrepresentation theory.
when tiara began introducing evidence in support of its misrepresentation theory,ggg immediately objected pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c on the ground that tiara had not disclosed the facts constituting the misrepresentations in response to ggg interrogatories.ggg argued that rule c authorized the court to exclude the introduction of evidence not properly disclosed in accordance with federal rule of civil procedure,and urged the court to impose that sanction the district court sustained ggg objection and excluded tiara misrepresentation evidence the next morning,may.the court noted that although ggg motion was grounded in rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,the basis of the motion,as the court understood it,was somewhat broader than that because there was an answer and a counterclaim,both of which were very specific only on the price gouging theory.the court therefore excluded the misrepresentation evidence on the additional ground that the misrepresentation theory ha d not been pled,that it ha d not been disclosed,that there is extraordinary prejudice to the plaintiff,that the case has totally changed complexion.
its misrepresentation theory having been foreclosed,tiara proceeded with its delay theory,presenting evidence of the expenses it incurred in drying out the building,million.after it rested its case and the evidence closed,on may,ggg moved the court to strike the evidence of the expenses.ggg also moved the court to grant it judgment as a matter of law,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a,on tiara counterclaim for breach of contract.the court granted both motions the court found that the issue of the dryout expenses ha d never been pled initially in the counterclaim nor was appropriate disclosure made about that by tiara in its first answers to ggg interrogatories or in the supplemental answers to the interrogatories.allowing tiara to present evidence of expenses would constitute a violation of due process,a failure to comply with federal rule of civil procedure a,a failure to properly disclose information as required in answers to interrogatories,et cetera.finding that but for the dryout issue,there are no damages before the court,the court determined that tiara had failed to establish an essential element of its breach of contract counterclaim.accordingly,it granted ggg rule a motion and dismissed the counterclaim 
on may,the jury returned a verdict in favor of ggg for.on june,the district court entered a final judgment in that amount this appeal followed 
tiara raises four arguments on appeal.two merit discussion first,the district court abused its discretion in granting ggg rule c motions to exclude evidence based on tiara discovery violations.second,the district court erred in granting ggg rule motion for judgment as a matter of law on tiara breach of contract counterclaim.we consider these arguments in turn.
a.the district court excluded tiara evidence of the misrepresentation theory and the expenses because the evidence had not been discovered.a district court evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion.proctor fluor,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when it misapplies the law in reaching its decision or bases its decision on findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.arce garcia,cir.
the ruling on the misrepresentation theory was explicitly granted under rule c.under that rule,a district court may preclude a party from introducing evidence that was not disclosed as required by rule a,e,or e unless the failure was harmless or there was substantial justification for the failure here,the alleged discovery violation was of rule e,which,at the time discovery was conducted in this case,provided that 
a party is under a duty seasonably to amend a prior response to an interrogatory,request for production,or request for admission if the party learns that the response is in some material respect incomplete or incorrect and if the additional or corrective information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties during the discovery process or in writing.
in granting the rule c motion to exclude evidence on tiara misrepresentation theory,the court initially observed that tiara did not disclose the misrepresentation theory in the allegations of its counterclaim.the court then stated that 
when the first interrogatories were served on tiara,tiara was asked to list with particularity how ggg failed in their contractual obligations,and tiara was asked to identify all witnesses to the same.
now,tiara did not comply with listing the witnesses however,when tiara filed supplemental answers to its 
interrogatories on april,which parenthetically happened to be the last day for discovery,tiara listed various people who would testify and also specified in a shorthand fashion what they would testify about.
nowhere in that is there any mention of either a misrepresentation by ggg that citizens never said to dry out the building,but ggg made that misrepresentation,either because they made a mistake,or worse,that they were doing it simply to pad their own pockets.that is just not there.
also,nowhere in any of this information is there a suggestion that ggg failed to explain to the board that they had an option.
record,vol.at.
the district court also granted ggg motion to strike the evidence of tiara expenses for the same reason it struck the misrepresentation evidence it found that the issue of the dryout expenses has never been pled either initially in the counterclaim nor was appropriate disclosure made about that in tiara first answers to interrogatories or in the supplemental answers to interrogatories.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence tiara sought to introduce at trial on its misrepresentation theory and the expenses based on tiara discovery violations in its initial response to ggg interrogatories on november,tiara only disclosed the price gouging theory.tiara did not mention the misrepresentation theory or expenses thus,tiara had a duty to supplement these answers if it would introduce evidence on the misrepresentation and theories at trial.
tiara argues that through the deposition of its corporate representative,louis brandisi,and its supplemental responses to ggg interrogatories,it put ggg on notice that it planned to proceed with its misrepresentation theory.we agree with the district court that while it is true that one can garner a phrase here or there from brandisi deposition where he mentions these issues,many times they are phrased in the brandisi deposition in terms of his sense of upset as to the excessive costs that were being generated by southern construction,and others.in tiara supplemental responses to ggg interrogatories,submitted on the final day of discovery,tiara noted the identity and planned testimony of its witnesses.these responses reveal no indication that tiara had abandoned the price gouging theory in favor of the misrepresentation and delay theories.most of the witness and testimony disclosures do not even tangentially relate to the misrepresentation theory 
in the supplemental responses,tiara alleged that ggg failed to advise tiara of the claims options available under the policy.when listing the damages it suffered,it included 
the incurrence of excessive unnecessary costs submitted by southern construction other subcontractors,including but not limited to 
dryout excess of million was wasted in a failed attempt to the building.the drying out process should have been between days at a cost of million.standards establish that the building should have been dry in that one month time frame,and if it was not,then the dryout attempts should have ceased.instead,ggg allowed southern to bill tiara over million in a failed dryout that lasted for over six months.
although tiara finally refers to the expenses in this response,given the context in which tiara identified them,ggg could reasonably infer that tiara was merely complaining that ggg allowed southern to charge tiara too much for the dry out in accordance with the price gouging theory.therefore,we conclude that tiara did not mention the misrepresentation theories or expenses in its answer,counterclaim,and initial interrogatory responses,nor did it ever supplement its initial disclosures to indicate to ggg that it was abandoning the price gouging theory in favor of the misrepresentation and delay theories and seeking expenses as damages.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting ggg rule c motions to exclude evidence supporting tiara misrepresentation theory or the claim for expenses 
having concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting ggg motions to exclude evidence on the misrepresentation and issues,we turn next to the question of whether the district court erred in granting ggg rule motion for judgment as a matter of law on tiara counterclaim for breach of contract.rule a authorizes a district court,in a jury trial,to grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law on a claim if a party has been fully heard on the claim and the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on the claim.
the district court granted ggg motion at the close of all the evidence,after granting ggg motions to exclude the evidence regarding tiara misrepresentation theory and expenses.the court found that but for the dryout issue,there are no damages before the court,and therefore the counter plaintiff has failed to establish an essential element of its counterclaim.accordingly,i grant judgment as a matter of law on the counterclaim in favor of the counter defendants.
on appeal,tiara argues that the district court erred in granting the rule motion because it had introduced sufficient evidence on both of its theories of ggg misrepresentation theory and the delay reach the jury.the only damages claimed under these theories,however,were the expenses.because the court excluded the evidence of these rightfully so,as discussed in part,damages were proven,and there was nothing for the jury to decide.the court therefore ruled correctly in dismissing the breach of contract counterclaim from the case.
for the foregoing reasons,the district court judgment is

tiara two other arguments are meritless and therefore require only brief discussion.first,tiara argues that the district court erred in denying its motion to dismiss ggg complaint under.b because the services agreement failed to comply with consumer protections provisions of florida law and was therefore unenforceable.florida law requires public adjusting contracts to be in writing and include,among other terms,the adjuster florida department license number,the address and a brief description of the loss,the insured insurance company name and policy number,if available,the date the contract was signed,and compensation.admin.code ann.emergency rule e also requires that a public adjuster contract with a client shall be revocable or cancelable by the insured or claimant,without penalty or obligation,for at least business days after the contract is entered into and that the public adjuster disclose this claims the services agreement is unenforceable because it fails to identify the insurer of the condominium and the policy number and to state that tiara had the right to revoke or cancel the services agreement within business days.this argument fails because the insured insurance company name and policy number are only required if available and because the services agreement stated that ggg complies with all terms and provisions of any emergency orders or rules issued by the florida department of financial services all of which have been disclosed to tiara and are incorporated therein.tiara also claims that because the services agreement has to be in writing,the oral modification of the contract to also include adjusting services for the second hurricane,hurricane jeanne,is unenforceable.the regulation,however,does not specify that modifications must be in writing,and more importantly,neither party disputes that ggg rendered services for hurricane,tiara argues that the district court abused its discretion by mismanaging the litigation,substantially prejudicing tiara ability to defend itself and to prove its counterclaim.in particular,tiara complains that it was not given sufficient time for discovery because the district court scheduling order was issued during the five months its motion to dismiss ggg complaint was pending and that the court abused its discretion in refusing to grant its motion to extend the discovery deadline.tiara ignores the fact that the motion to dismiss was decided only one month after the scheduling order was entered,still permitting tiara over six months discovery.tiara two other

at the time discovery was conducted in this case,rule c provided c failure to disclose false or misleading disclosure failure to admit a party that without substantial justification fails to disclose information required by rule a or e,or to amend a prior response to discovery as required by rule e,is not,unless such failure is harmless,permitted to use evidence at a trial,at a hearing,or on a motion any witness or information not so disclosed.in addition to or in lieu of this sanction,the court may impose other appropriate sanctions.in addition to requiring payment of reasonable expenses,including attorney fees,caused by the failure,these sanctions may include any of the actions authorized under rule
