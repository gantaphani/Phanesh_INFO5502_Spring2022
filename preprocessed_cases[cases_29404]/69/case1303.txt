appellant dennis bright pled guilty to five counts of mail fraud arising of a scheme in which bright falsely offered nurses the opportunity to work at home processing medical surveys.bright now appeals his sentence,claiming that the district court improperly calculated the amount of his victims total losses,resulting in a rather than a adjustment of his base offense.bright also challenges the district court restitution order,arguing that the court improperly ordered restitution for dismissed counts and that the court should have made forfeited funds available for restitution.
we conclude that the district did not err in calculating the total loss or in ordering restitution for dismissed counts.we also hold that the district court was not required to attempt to transfer forfeited funds to bright victims.therefore,we affirm the district court.
beginning in july,bright,a registered nurse,owned and operated five businesses that purported to offer nurses the opportunity to earn extra income by processing medical surveys out of their homes.bright sent letters to nurses throughout the united states,representing that one of his five companies would pay the nurses between and for each survey processed the surveys would come directly from the company participating nurses would have to sell nothing and the companies were conducting a medically supervised clinical trial.codefendant stephen chandler assisted bright in operating the companies and in carrying out the mail order scheme.nurses who chose to participate in bright programs paid a registration fee of approximately.upon receipt of the fee,bright would send letters to the nurses advising them that they would have to post signs soliciting customers for a product that bright was selling.the nurses would be paid only if customers purchased the products from bright.the medical surveys to be processed by the nurses would come from people who purchased the weight loss directly from bright companies,as stated in the initial solicitation letter.moreover,none of the five companies was conducting a medically supervised clinical trial.in response to the solicitations,bright companies received a total of in registration fees.
in october,federal agents investigating bright mail order businesses searched bright home and seized in cash.agents also seized from the bank account of one of bright companies.the united states postal inspection service subsequently forfeited the in seized funds.
in march,bright was indicted on counts of mail fraud and nine counts of money laundering.a superseding indictment narrowed the charges to the counts of mail fraud.bright pled guilty without a plea agreement to five counts of the indictment,under.
bright presentence report recommended a base offense level of.the presentence report valued the total amount of loss at.accordingly,the report recommended a enhancement under united states sentencing guidelines b k,for an offense involving victim loss of more than.other adjustments not at issue here brought bright total offense level to.
at sentencing,the district court deducted that bright had paid to victims for completed surveys from the total amount of loss.bright asked the court to make further deductions for refunds paid to the victims,victim payments allegedly diverted by chandler for his own personal use and the seized by the postal inspection service.the court refused.because the deduction for the completed surveys was not enough to bring the victim loss below,the district court imposed the adjustment under b k,resulting in a total offense level of.the court then granted bright request for a downward departure,reduced his offense level to and imposed a sentence of months.
the district court ordered bright to pay a fine of,a special assessment and in restitution.before doing so,the court asked the prosecutor about the availability of the forfeited funds,but was informed that they were not available for restitution.
bright contends that the district court erred by failing to make three deductions from its calculation of a total victim loss of approximately in customer refunds,approximately of program funds that codefendant chandler allegedly stole without bright knowledge and the in seized funds.if these funds were deducted,the total loss would be approximately,which would result in only a enhancement for amount of loss,rather than the enhancement the district court applied.b j.the total amount of loss will not fall below thus bright offense level will not we conclude that the district court erred in refusing to make each one of the three proposed deductions.
we review for clear error the district court factual findings with respect to monetary loss to victims.see united states lawrence,cir.findings of fact must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence.id.we review de novo the district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines.see united states,cir.
a fraud defendant is entitled to credit for refunds paid prior to the discovery of the offense.united states stoddard,cir applying the economic reality approach of united states allison,cir.stoddard concerned the defendant misappropriation of escrow funds at a bank.there,we held that the offense was discovered when the bank chief financial officer notified stoddard of discrepancies in his escrow accounts,resulting from stoddard illicit activity.accordingly,we refused to credit against the actual loss calculation the escrow repayments stoddard made after that discovery.id.at.repayments before detection show an untainted intent to reduce any loss,whereas r epayments after detection may show no more than an effort to reduce accountability.see also united states blitz,cir refusing to deduct refunded amounts from calculation of loss because refunds were paid to avoid detection and to mak e the operation look legitimate.
here,bright paid refunds to certain nurses who discovered his fraud and wrote to him demanding their money back.bright claims that he is entitled to credit for such refunds because he paid them before his crimes were detected by law enforcement.bright also claims that there is insufficient evidence in the record that he paid refunds to escape detection.but stoddard held that a defendant is not entitled to credit for refunds paid after detection by a victim,regardless of any evidence that the refunds were in fact paid to avoid detection by law enforcement.therefore,even if bright were correct that there is insufficient evidence regarding his motive for paying the refunds,the district court did not err in refusing to deduct the refunded amounts from its calculation of total loss.
the district court also did not err in refusing to deduct from the total loss amount the that chandler allegedly stole.bright was not aware of these funds or of the specific nurses who supplied them.however,the sentencing guidelines provide that a defendant shall be held responsible for all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of jointly undertaken criminal activity.a b.
chandler,who pled guilty to three counts of mail fraud arising out of his role in the scheme,plainly was involved in a jointly undertaken criminal activity with bright.according to the presentence report,chandler helped bright operate several of the companies.at bright direction,chandler filed fictitious business name statements,opened bank accounts and made deposits,retrieved mail from commercial mail drops,assisted with the mailing of solicitation letters and supervised the activities of other participants in the scheme.moreover,the money chandler allegedly misappropriated came from of this jointly undertaken scheme.
it is reasonably foreseeable that a participant in a jointly undertaken criminal venture may obtain funds from the targets of that venture.here,chandler allegedly siphoned off through his and bright fraudulent scheme.that chandler may not have shared this money with bright or told bright which victims supplied it does not mean that chandler was involved in a separate venture.see blitz,at holding telemarketer defendants responsible under for losses caused to other victims by other telemarketers in defendants fraudulent company.the district court,therefore,properly refused to deduct the amounts that chandler allegedly diverted to himself,even if bright was unaware of those funds.
finally,the district court did not err in refusing to deduct from the total loss amount the the federal agents initially seized and later forfeited.although the civil forfeiture deprived bright of his gain,in making a reasonable estimate of the loss which is all that the guidelines require,see,application note district court is not obliged to measure the loss by the gain to the defendant.see united states sayakhom,cir.instead,the district court may calculate loss as the value of money unlawfully taken.id.
bright does not dispute that he unlawfully took the seized funds from the victims nor does he claim that any seized funds have been restored to the victims.that the government recovered the funds through seizure and forfeiture does not mean that the victims never lost them.moreover,bright has offered no authority for the proposition that funds the government seizes must be or can be deducted from the court loss calculation indeed,even if the money were eventually restored to the victims,reducing bright loss calculation by the amount seized would distort the magnitude of his crime.if refunds paid voluntarily by a defendant after discovery of the offense can not be credited against total loss,then surely amounts recovered from the defendant through the involuntary forfeiture of fraud proceeds can not be credited against loss.accordingly,the district court properly refused to deduct the seized funds from its calculation of total loss.
in sum,the district court made no errors that,together or separately,would cause bright total loss calculation to fall below.the court correctly calculated bright offense level.
the district court ordered bright to pay restitution pursuant to the mandatory victims restitution act of mvra.bright does not contest the applicability of the mvra to his crime.he challenges the restitution order on two grounds.first,he claims that the amount of restitution imposed was excessive because the court was authorized to order restitution only for the counts of conviction.second,bright contends that the district court improperly failed to offset his forfeited funds against his restitution obligation,or at least should have ordered the government to return those funds to bright victims.
instead of basing restitution only on the losses caused by the specific counts of conviction,the district court included losses relating to both the counts of conviction and the dismissed counts,which involved numerous additional victims.accordingly,although the losses caused by the counts to which bright pled guilty totaled only,he was ordered to pay more than in restitution.bright did not challenge the amount of the restitution order before the district court,so we review his first claim for plain error.see united states jackson,cir.
as bright conceded at oral argument,the mvra authorizes orders of restitution for losses caused by related but uncharged conduct that is part of a mail fraud scheme.united states grice,cir.the district court in grice found the defendant crimes to be part of a scheme.id.at emphasis added.grice recognized that a scheme to defraud is in fact one of the elements of mail fraud,and that by pleading guilty to four counts of mail fraud,the defendant admitted her involvement in a scheme.id.at.
here,bright similarly pled guilty to multiple counts of mail fraud,thus acknowledging his participation in a scheme to defraud.the district court therefore properly ordered restitution for losses caused by the dismissed conduct related to this scheme.id.at.
the mvra makes restitution mandatory for certain offenses involving fraud,including bright mail fraud.see a,c a ii.bright claims that the district court should have offset his restitution obligation by the amount of funds the government seized from his house and bank account and ultimately forfeited.although the district court did not make such an offset,the court did ask the prosecutor about the status of the forfeited funds and whether they were segregated for restitution purposes.the prosecutor replied that the funds would have gone into the postal service general pot and were apparently not,in any event,available for restitution to bright victims.bright contends that this inquiry was insufficient because the court was obligated to seek out the funds and order that they be transferred to bright victims.bright arguments require us to evaluate the extent of the district court obligations in fashioning restitution,a legal question that we review de novo.see united states stanley,cir.we conclude that under the mvra the district court could not have reduced or offset bright not for forfeited funds not paid over to his victims nor was the court required to pursue those funds,even though it may have had discretion to do so.
we first examine the mvra statutory framework,and in particular provisions that address the relationship between restitution orders and various other sources of compensation for victims.before congress passed the mvra,restitution would have been discretionary in a case like this,under the victim and witness protection act of vwpa a,a west.the mvra,however,created a mandatory category of restitution for specified crimes,and also amended the vwpa in certain respects.under the pre mvra version of the vwpa,district courts had no authority to impose restitution with respect to a loss for which the victim has received or is to receive compensation.e.moreover,in setting the amount of a defendant restitution obligation a district court was required to consider the amount of the loss sustained by any victim as a result of the offense,the financial resources of the defendant,the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the defendant dependents,and such other factors as the court deem ed appropriate.id.a emphasis added.
in passing the mvra in,congress modified the manner in which a district court is to fashion restitution orders and significantly limited the court discretion in setting the amount of such restitution.first,the mvra created which makes restitution mandatory for certain crimes,including mail fraud.second,the mvra amended vwpa key section.after these amendments,the vwpa still provides for discretionary orders of restitution for several crimes not covered by the mvra,but now with different constraints.significantly,no longer prohibits courts from ordering restitution for a loss for which the victim has received or is entitled to receive compensation.
third,the mvra modified.the previous version of that section set forth the procedure for issuing and enforcing restitution orders under the vwpa.the modified version now applies to restitution orders under the new mvra and the revamped vwpa.see d,d.in its current form,directs the court to order restitution of the full amount of a victim loss without regard to the defendant economic circumstances vwpa regard to other sources of compensation for the victims.any such offsets are instead to be handled separately as potential credits against the defendant restitution as reductions in the amount of that obligation in the first instance 
specifically,provides that the court shall order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim losses as determined by the court and without consideration of the economic circumstances of the defendant.f a.the defendant economic circumstances factor in only in fashioning the manner of and schedule for paying restitution.see f.further,although the mvra does not mention the relationship between restitution and forfeited funds specifically,it does address the relationship between restitution and other sources of funds in general in no case shall the fact that a victim has received or is entitled to receive compensation with respect to a loss from insurance or any other source be considered in determining the amount of restitution.f b emphasis added.thus it is clear from the plain language of the statute that the district court was required in the first instance to set the amount of bright restitution
