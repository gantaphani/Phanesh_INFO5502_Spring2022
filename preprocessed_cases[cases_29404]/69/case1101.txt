in this consolidated appeal,we determine whether the state of oregon and jackson county collectively oregon committed a constitutional taking,violated plaintiffs due process rights,or violated plaintiffs equal protection rights when oregon voters enacted measure to replace and modify remedies available under the previous measure.we conclude that oregon did not commit a constitutional taking when it modified the remedies available under measure,because any potential property interest that plaintiffs had for compensation or a specific type of land use under measure had not vested.measure also does not contravene substantive due process,because it does not implicate fundamental rights.for this reason,and also because the regulatory classification under measure is not based on a suspect class,measure also survives rational basis scrutiny and has not violated plaintiffs equal protection rights.therefore,we affirm the district court.
in,oregon voters passed measure,originally codified at,through the initiative process.measure required state and local governments to compensate private property owners for the reduction in the fair market value of their real property that results from any land use regulations of those governmental entities that restrict the use of the subject properties.macpherson dep t of admin,or.thus,for those who qualified,section one of measure authorized a public entity to award just compensation to landowners if that entity enforced land use regulations that reduced the fair market value of the landowners property,even if such reduction did not constitute a taking.
section six provided the claimant with a statutory cause of action in state court for the recovery of that compensation,if the subject land use regulation continued in force for days after claim was made.sections eight and ten of the act provided to the entity an ability to avoid payment of monetary compensation by granting that entity the authority to modify,remove,or not apply the subject land use regulation.if a public entity chose this option within days of a property owner submitting a demand,no entitlement to monetary compensation arose under the statute.the second option,to exempt property from otherwise applicable regulations and allow a specified use,colloquially became known as a measure waiver.damman bd.of comm rs of yamhill,these measure waivers allow ed the owner to use the property for a use permitted at the time the owner acquired the property.
thousands of such claims were filed statewide,with jackson county alone validating approximately such claims.most property owners in oregon,who pursued a remedy under measure,received measure waivers from their local governments,not monetary compensation.a measure waiver provided that the regulations at issue in the property owners claims would not be applied to their property.
during the legislative session,the state legislature referred measure to the voters.this measure also passed and has been codified as the current.to.the oregon supreme court examined the text and context of measure and found that it conveys a clear intent to extinguish and replace the benefits and procedures that measure granted to landowners.corey dep t of land conservation,or.the court went on to observe that measure extensively amends measure in a way that wholly supersedes the provisions of measure pertaining to monetary compensation for and waivers from the burdens of certain land use regulations under that earlier measure.id.
of greatest importance to this case,measure undertook to change the remedies available to property owners who had already begun the process of pursuing relief under measure.measure replaced the process,the approval standards,and the extent of the relief if any.measure also removed some of the benefits previously available,including monetary relief and waivers allowing commercial or industrial development.measure,however,exempted a property owner from pursuing compensation pursuant to the new provisions in measure if the property owner had a common law vested right to complete and continue the use described in the waiver.compiled as a note after.measure does not mandate any particular process for establishing vested rights.claimants seeking a vested rights determination generally either applied for a local decision or sued for a declaratory judgment.
according to oregon,whether a landowner has a vested right to complete development of property even though the law has changed turns on whether the landowner commencement of the construction has been substantial,or substantial costs toward completion of the job have been incurred.clackamas cnty.holmes,or.in holmes,the oregon supreme court held that whether a landowner right vests turns on the facts of each case,and the court set forth a list of factors for analyzing those facts.id.
plaintiffs claims 
all of the citizens for constitutional fairness et.plaintiffs and the bowers et.plaintiffs collectively plaintiffs are owners of real property in the state of oregon,who submitted written demands for compensation under measure and received timely waivers.none of these individual plaintiffs have recovered any monetary compensation,and,because of measure,none have been able to proceed with any development of their land under the waivers granted.
procedural history 
citizens case 
citizens plaintiffs initially brought this action against jackson county in relation to measure,which amended prior ballot measure and replaced the relief previously available to citizens under that statute.citizens plaintiffs complaint raised several causes of action,two of which are relevant to this appeal.in their fifth cause of action,citizens plaintiffs asserted that waivers granted to them by the county under measure constituted binding contracts,protected by the contracts clause of the united states constitution.citizens plaintiffs sixth cause of action asserted that,pursuant to measure,they had gained an accrued cause of action for monetary compensation,which was a property interest protected by the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.
on summary judgment,the district court held that the measure waivers were contracts that could not be impaired pursuant to the contracts clause and,in the alternative,they were judgments that could not be impaired under the doctrine of the separation of powers.the county appealed,and we reversed,ruling that measure waivers are neither contracts nor court judgments implicating separation of powers issues.citizens for constitutional fairness jackson,cir.the district court then concluded that our decision disposed of the remainder of the citizens plaintiffs claims and dismissed the case.the citizens appeal promptly followed.
bowers case 
before any decision was rendered on the first citizens appeal,different claimants brought another suit in the district court in the bowers case.the bowers plaintiffs are all measure claimants.they sued the department of conservation and development commission and director whitman,seeking damages and declaratory relief against enforcement of measure.bowers plaintiffs alleged five causes of action,the first three of which remain at issue in this appeal.
first,bowers plaintiffs alleged that there had been a taking of protected property in violation of the fifth amendment due process clause.bowers plaintiffs asserted that those property interests were statutory rights to monetary compensation,vested and accrued claim s for compensation,legal entitlements in lieu of monetary compensation,or measure waivers and the entitlement to monetary compensation.second,bowers plaintiffs alleged that measure violates equal protection guarantees under the fourteenth amendment.third,bowers plaintiffs alleged that measure violates substantive due process under the amendment.
after bowers was filed,this court issued its opinion in the first citizens appeal,holding that the measure waivers were not court judgments or contracts.relying on our decision,the district court granted the motion for summary judgment in the bowers case and dismissed the remaining claims against whitman in an order and judgment.the bowers appeal followed.
in these cases,the plaintiffs do not identify any disputed facts below in their briefs.accordingly,these cases appeal only the district court conclusions of law,which we review de novo.directv,webb,cir.
a.the enactment of measure did not effect a constitutional taking of plaintiffs potential property interests created under measure.
we use a analysis to determine whether a constitutional taking has occurred first,we determine whether the subject matter is property within the meaning of the fifth amendment and,second,we establish whether there has been a taking of that property,for which compensation is due.engquist or.dep t of,cir,aff,d.
property interests are not created by the constitution.rather they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.bd.of regents roth,d.
in some cases,the supreme court has recognized property rights that were constitutionally protected,such that they were safeguarded by due process,but still not vested,and thus the government could take away these interests so long as it provided proper procedures.see,perry sindermann,d goldberg kelly,d.but in other cases,constitutionally protected property rights were held to have vested and thus became cognizable under the takings clause,such that the government could not remove the right without providing just compensation.see united states sioux nation,d holding that the government could not enact legislation to take back land it had expressly given to the sioux nation without committing a constitutional taking webb fabulous pharmacies,beckwith,d holding that the state confiscation of the interest accrued on interpleader funds was a constitutional taking lynch united states.holding that the government could not avoid payment of its commitment to pay disability and life insurance by enacting a statute repealing the laws granting the benefit without committing a constitutional taking see also black law dictionary ed.defining a vested right as a right that so completely and definitely belongs to a person that it can not be impaired or taken away without the person consent.
in the present case,we assume without deciding that the procedure provided through the ballot initiative was sufficient to satisfy any procedural due process requirements,because this issue is not contested by the plaintiffs thus,the critical issue is whether plaintiffs measure property interests have vested such that oregon could not remove or modify the right without committing a constitutional taking.after review,we conclude that such property interests have not vested.
to determine whether a property interest has vested for takings clause purposes,the relevant inquiry is the certainty of one expectation in the property interest at issue.engquist,at.we noted in engquist that,if the property interest is contingent and uncertain or the receipt of the interest is speculative or discretionary,then the government modification or removal of the interest will not constitute a constitutional taking.id.at.for multiple reasons,plaintiffs have not sufficiently demonstrated certain expectations in their measure property interests to trigger takings clause protection.
at the outset,we emphasize that plaintiffs failed to articulate any clear characterization of the exact property interest to which they are entitled.their descriptions range from an accrued cause of action to a right to monetary compensation derived from a statutory entitlement to the right to use their land consistent with oregon decision to not regulate their property under measure.when pressed at oral argument on whether a ruling in the plaintiffs favor would have entitled them to money or to land use rights,the plaintiffs were unable to provide a clear answer and argued essentially for both.the plaintiffs inability to characterize their requested relief reflects the uncertainty of the property interests upon which they rely.neither have plaintiffs claims vested under any of the various characterizations of the measure waiver that the plaintiffs set forth.
accrued cause of action 
plaintiffs,at some junctures,have maintained that their measure property interest is an accrued cause of action that has been unconstitutionally taken from them by measure.we have squarely held that although a cause of action is a species of property,a party property right in any cause of action does not vest until a final unreviewable judgment is obtained.ileto glock,cir quoting lyon agusta,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also fields legacy health,cir causes of action are a species of property protected by the fourteenth amendment due process clause.however,a party property right in any cause of action does not vest until a final unreviewable judgment is obtained.citation,internal quotation marks,and emphasis omitted.the reason an accrued cause of action is not a vested property interest for takings clause purposes until it results in a final unreviewable judgment,is that it is inchoate and does not provide a certain expectation in that property interest.id.citing austin city of bisbee,cir explaining that,although a cause of action is a species of property,it is inchoate and affords no definite or enforceable property right until reduced to final judgment internal quotation marks omitted.
as we held in the previous interlocutory appeal in the citizens case,the waivers provided under measure were administrative decisions,not court judgments.citizens for constitutional fairness jackson.at.the question,then,is whether those decisions imparted a certainty that property owners were entitled to a particular use of their property,to compensation,or to some other property interest cognizable under the takings clause.engquist,at.we conclude that they did not.
the waivers stated that particular land use regulations would not be applied,but this statement did not entitle waiver recipients to develop their property in any particular way.any development required approval from the requisite governmental bodies as well as,in many,if not all,cases,a waiver from the state of oregon.indeed,all of the waivers in the record state that jackson county does not promise claimant s that claimant s will eventually be able to put the property to any particular use.
further,the waivers were not.they did not,for example,specify a particular amount of compensation to be paid if a municipality continued to apply a waived land use regulation.instead,in such a circumstance,a property owner only recourse was a cause of action in oregon state court.thus,plaintiffs here had,at most,a cause of action,not a final judgment.their right to sue was therefore not a property interest protected by the takings clause.
statutory entitlement 
plaintiffs have also characterized their property right as a vested statutory entitlement to compensation,or the equivalent of compensation.we have recognized that t here is no question that claims for compensation are property interests that can not be taken for public use without compensation.in re aircrash in bali,cir.but in that case,we held that whether the claim had vested,such that the government interference with the claim constituted a taking,turn ed on questions of degree.id.this echoes the rule in engquist,that vesting is determined based on certainty of expectations.at.
the supreme court has required a high threshold of certainty before finding that an entitlement had vested.for instance,the court has recognized this certainty where the plaintiffs had paid consideration for their entitlement,lynch,or where the government made an explicit promise that the property interest would not be taken away,sioux nation.however,the supreme court has not recognized a vested right in the area of social security benefits or retirement benefits benevolently given.see ret.bd.fritz,d upholding the government ability to alter benefits under a railroad retirement plan hisquierdo hisquierdo,d finding that congress may alter,and even eliminate railroad retirement and social
