this case involves an infringement action by altera corporation altera against clear logic incorporated clear logic under the semiconductor chip protection act of,scpa.altera also brought state law claims against clear logic for intentionally inducing altera customers to breach their software license agreements with altera and also for intentional interference with those contractual relations.a jury found for altera on all claims and a judgment was entered for million in damages,million in prejudgment interest and in costs.the district court judge also entered an injunction preventing clear logic from engaging in those activities against altera.we affirm the judgment and the injunction.
filling the gap between copyright law and patent law,the scpa aims to protect the substantial investment of innovative firms in creating the semiconductor chips that are at the vortex of the modern information age,at,cong.at.these chips operate microwave ovens,televisions,computers,robots,xray machines,and countless other now indispensable apparatuses.at.each chip carries its own blueprint.pirate firms can strip the layers of a semiconductor chip and replicate the design at a cost substantially lower than the original firm investment.id.
altera and clear logic are competitors in the semiconductor industry.altera manufactures programmable logic devices plds,which are chips that can be programmed to perform various logic functions.a customer uses altera ii software to program the pld to perform the desired function the software helps to route the functions through the thousands of transistors that make up the pld,ideally achieving the maximum functionality for the particular function desired.because the pld can be programmed and reprogrammed,the customer,working with altera,can continue to work with the pld and the software until the pld meets the customer exact needs.this process can take months.
clear logic manufactures a different type of chip integrated circuits asics.these chips are designed to perform one specific function and can not be programmed by the customer.they use less power,are smaller and,for a customer with a large order,are often cheaper.customers will sometimes start with plds and switch to asics once they have determined exactly what they need the chips to do.traditionally,a company that converts from plds to asics must again start from a high level of description and work toward the end product,the asic.this can take a few months and there is a substantial risk that even after the initial attempt,the first chip will not work and more time and money will have to be invested in perfecting the product.
clear logic works from a different business model.when customers program altera devices,using the altera software,a file called a bitstream is generated.clear logic asks customers to send the bitstream to clear logic,and clear logic uses the bitstream to create an asic for the customer.clear logic only produces asics that are compatible with altera chips.the laser process clear logic uses to create chips with the bitstream allows for a turnaround time of just a few weeks,and rarely produces an incompatible chip.
faced with the loss of millions of dollars in business,altera has challenged clear logic business model.in the district court,altera argued that clear logic infringed its rights under the scpa by copying the layout design of its registered mask works for three families of chip products.clear logic denied the infringement and asserted an affirmative defense of reverse engineering.the jury returned a verdict in favor of altera on the infringement claim.
in addition,altera alleged state law claims based on a permitted use provision in its software licensing agreement.customers can access two versions of the altera software one is a free version available on the internet,the other requires a subscription fee but includes additional benefits.in either case,the user must agree to the terms of a license before using the software.the license agreement has taken several forms,but altera vice president of software and tools marketing,timothy southgate,testified that it was unlikely any customers were still using older versions of the software because it is not compatible with some of the newer products.each time the software is updated,the customer must agree to the latest version of the licensing provision.a provision was added to the software license agreement in the early to prevent competitors from taking advantage of the software.the current version of the use provision,added to the agreement in,provides that customers may use the licensed programs for the sole purpose of programming logic devices manufactured by altera and sold by altera or its authorized distributors the permitted use.the earlier version did not include the word sole,but was otherwise similar.
based on that provision,altera asserted state law claims for inducing altera customers to intentionally breach their license agreements with altera and also for intentionally interfering with those contractual relations.clear logic argued that those claims were preempted by federal copyright law and additionally alleged that the licensing agreements constitute copyright misuse.the district court found as a matter of law that the claims were not preempted and also denied as a matter of law the copyright misuse defense because there was no allegation of copyright infringement.the jury found for altera on these claims as well.
after the jury trial,pursuant to a stipulation of the parties,the district court determined damages,awarding altera million in damages,million in prejudgment interest,and in costs.in addition,the court issued a permanent injunction preventing clear logic activities that were found to violate altera rights under the scpa and to induce the breach of altera software licenses with its customers.
on appeal clear logic does not contest the amount of the damage award,only its liability for those damages.it also does not contest the specific terms of the injunction.it contends that the district judge misinterpreted the application of the scpa,and improperly instructed the jury concerning the defense of reverse engineering.clear logic also contests liability under the state law claims.
the semiconductor chip design process and the semiconductor chip protection act 
clear logic and altera define the stages and terms relating to the chip design process differently according to altera,the layout is the physical arrangement of the components on the chip.the architecture is comprised of the components and the structures that are physically arranged within the chip.clear logic argues that the architecture is essentially a block diagram showing the basic arrangement of the chip.from this conceptual plan,the designer creates floor plans that show the arrangement of functional modules,focusing on how the designer will group major components.the floor plan and the architecture are both at high levels of abstraction.the designer next creates an electrical schematic,which is a abstract drawing.after this,a layout designer creates a layout design which includes the specific placement of all of the elements of the chip and is used to make the glass masks that are printed onto the chip.
despite their disagreement over the specific definitions of industry terms and the specific steps in the process of chip design,altera and clear logic agree that chip design starts with a high level idea and moves toward the placement of individual transistors on a chip in several layers.ultimately,the schematics and floor plans are used to develop the specific placement of every transistor that will eventually go on the chip.glass disks are etched with the pattern for each layer of the chip,and these glass disks,called masks,are printed onto the semiconductor chip,one layer at a time,by photolithography.at.generally,there are eight to twelve layers to the chip,each of which requires a separate mask.id.the series of all of the masks is the mask work.
reverse engineering has long been an accepted practice in the semiconductor chip industry.by photographing and chemically dissolving each layer of the chip,a second company can recreate the entire mask work for any chip.the process allows legitimate analysis of chips to spur innovation and improvement on existing designs,but also makes direct copying of chips feasible.at.at the behest of the semiconductor industry,congress sought to protect this important facet of the american economy,and indeed of modern american society,while preserving the validity of reverse engineering as an appropriate form of competition.
after extensive debates,congress passed the semiconductor chip protection act in,creating sui generis protection for mask works embodied in semiconductor chip products.the act borrows heavily from copyright law,and was initially proposed as an extension of existing copyright protection.at.at analogizing mask works to technical drawings or audiovisual works subject to copyright protection.in analogizing semiconductor chips to traditional areas of copyright law,the legislative history notes that,just as a plagiarist who copies only one chapter of a book may be held liable for infringement,a person may be liable for copying a part of a mask work if it is a qualitatively important portion that results in substantial similarity.at.the realities of the business world,however,would purportedly make it impractical for a copyist to copy a part of a chip but create the rest of the chip independently.id.where chips appeared to be similar,congress assumed that admitting expert testimony to assist in determining whether subtle changes in a mask work layout were significant would resolve the problem of distinguishing a copy from a legitimate reverse engineering attempt in most cases.id.
the scpa defines a mask work as 
a series of related images,however fixed or encoded 
a having or representing the predetermined,pattern of metallic,insulating,or semiconductor material present or removed from the layers of a semiconductor chip product and 
b in which series the relation of the images to one another is that each image has the pattern of the surface of one form of the semiconductor chip product.
a.a semiconductor chip product,in turn,is 
the final or intermediate form of any product 
a having two or more layers of metallic,insulating,or semiconductor material,deposited or otherwise placed on,or etched away or otherwise removed from,a piece of semiconductor material in accordance with a predetermined pattern and 
b intended to perform electronic circuitry functions.
the scpa grants the owner of a mask work the exclusive rights to reproduce the mask work and to import or distribute a semiconductor chip product in which the mask work is embodied.the act does not,however,extend protection to any idea,procedure,process,system,method of operation,concept,principle,or discovery,regardless of the form in which it is described,explained,illustrated,or embodied in such work.c.
before trial,the district court granted in part altera summary judgment motion regarding the scope of the scpa.the court held that altera layout is fixed in the final chip product the placement of the components and their interconnection lines on the actual chip are created using masks which are the physical embodiment of the layout design chosen by altera design engineers.thus altera layout design is more than a mere idea.it is the blueprint for the layout of the semiconductor chip.the court concluded that the act is broad enough to cover the type of claims made by altera,but left for the jury the factual question of whether altera had proven infringement.relying on brooktree advanced micro devices,the only case to date to examine the scpa,the court explained that copying groupings of transistors and interconnection lines may constitute a violation of the act.the ruling on altera motion for summary judgment involved a purely legal issue which we review de novo.
in brooktree,the plaintiff alleged that the defendant company had copied its sram cell.at.the court stated that if the copied portion of the mask work is qualitatively important,the finder of fact may properly find substantial similarity under copyright law and under the semiconductor chip protection act,even if other portions of the chip were not copied.id.at citations omitted.the district court had appropriately allowed the jury to determine whether the copying of the layout of a cell within the chip was an infringement of the act.id.at.
altera asserts that the placement of groupings of transistors on the chip was copied,and does not specifically address the layout of the transistors within those groupings.clear logic argues that the placement of the groupings is a system or an idea and is not entitled to protection under the scpa.we reject this contention the boundaries and organization of these groupings are more than conceptual.as both john reed and john turner testified,these groupings are physically present in the mask work.
commentators have suggested analyzing the levels of abstraction in the production of a computer program or a mask work to identify the distinction between ideas and expression,and the degree of similarity,in these formats.see nimmer on copyrights comparing the analysis of broad ideas,plots,structure,dialogue,or sequence of events in a novel or play to the levels of abstraction in creating a computer program copyright protection for semiconductor chips hearings on before the house subcomm.on courts,civil liberties,and the administration of justice of the comm.on the judiciary,cong.letter and article submitted by eric petraske,patent attorney identifying ideas from electrical information,geometric information about component placement,size,shape,circuit design within the mask level.our own cases have suggested such an approach is appropriate.see data east usa,epyx,cir.under this approach,we identify the broad idea behind the design and assess each successive step in the design process,identifying the point at which the idea becomes protectable expression.see computer assocs.int l,altai,cir as amended explaining the test for computer programs.
in considering the chip design process,we recognize,as do the parties,that with each step,the ideas become more concrete until they are finally expressed in the layout of the transistors in the mask work.the customer idea is at the highest level of abstraction,and the schematics and floor plans convey more concrete ideas,designating how the chip may be structured or organized.these drawings are preliminary sketches that would not be protected under traditional copyright principles.copyright protection for semiconductor chips hearings on before the house subcomm.on courts,civil liberties,and the administration of justice of the comm.on the judiciary,cong.statement of dorothy schrader,copyright office.it is not until the level of the mask work,the piece of the process that congress chose to protect,that there is an expression of that idea.those ideas that are physically expressed in the mask work are subject to protection under the scpa.
the district court correctly determined that the organization of the groupings is physically a part of the mask work.the mask work is structured according to the groupings that altera highlighted and the district court correctly allowed the jury to determine whether those similarities constituted an infringement of the act.unlike the outline of an article or the chapters in a book,these groupings physically dictate where certain functions will occur on a chip and describe the interaction of parts of the chip.the placement of logic groupings in a mask work is not an abstract concept it is embodied in the chip and affects the chip performance and efficiency as well as the chip timing.in accordance with the federal circuit holding in brooktree,it is the province of the jury to determine whether those aspects of the mask work are material,and whether the similarity between the mask works is substantial.at.the district court did not err in finding that the organization of the groupings of logic functions on altera mask works,and the interconnections between them,was protected under the scpa.the arrangement of the transistors within those blocks is also entitled to protection under the scpa,but,as in brooktree,the jury determines whether the similarities are more important than the differences.id.
reverse engineering 
the scpa specifically protects the right of 
a person to reproduce the mask work solely for the purpose of teaching,analyzing,or evaluating the concepts or techniques embodied in the mask work or the circuitry,logic flow,or organization of components used in the mask work or 
a person who performs the analysis or evaluation described in paragraph to incorporate the results of such conduct in an original mask work which is made to be distributed.
this reverse engineering provision explicitly protects industry practices and encourages innovation.the second mask work must not be substantially identical to the original,and as long as there is evidence of substantial toil and investment in creating the second mask work,rather than mere plagiarism,the second chip will not infringe the original chip,even if the layout of the two chips is,in substantial part,similar.brooktree,at quoting memorandum at.the legislative history,relying on the testimony of industry representatives,indicated that most cases would probably present clear cut evidence of direct copying or of innovation and that in cases falling into the gray area between outright copying and complete originality,the courts should consider the presence or absence of a paper trail by the second firm.see id.summarizing relevant statements from the legislative history discussing reverse engineering and paper trails.a firm that simply copied another firm mask work would have no evidence of its own investment and labor,whereas a legitimate reverse engineering job would require a trail of paper work documenting the analysis of the original chip as well as the development of an independent design.id.the district court in this case instructed the jury that this was a factor to be considered in determining whether clear logic had proven a valid reverse engineering defense.
in brooktree,the federal circuit analyzed the defendant paper trail,but held that the sheer volume of paper was not dispositive.id.at.the trail in that case was susceptible to the interpretation that the defendant copied the chip.the court held that the jury was entitled to weigh the evidence and consider the differences in the chips as well as the similarities,and could find the similarities sufficient to invalidate the reverse engineering defense.id.
in this case,clear logic challenges the district court formulation of one of the reverse engineering jury instructions.we look to the instructions as a whole to determine whether they fairly and accurately cover the substance of the law.swinton potomac,cir.we do not reverse the judgment if the alleged error in the jury instructions is harmless.tritchler county of lake,cir.
the district court instructed the jury that 
a defendant does not infringe the mask works of a plaintiff if the defendant can prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it has engaged in legitimate reverse engineering.a question on the verdict form asks you to indicate whether you find that the defendant has proved that it it engaged in legitimate reverse engineering.to establish a legitimate reverse engineering defense,clear logic must prove by a preponderance of the evidence,the following requirements 
number.that clear logic reproduced altera mask works solely for the purpose of teaching,substantially analyzing,or substantially evaluating concepts or techniques embodied in altera mask works and,
that clear logic did not use or copy any of altera protectable expression in the clear logic chips,but rather used only the concepts or techniques embodied in altera mask works in developing clear logic own chips,which contain an original layout design.
tr.emphasis added.the judge continued to instruct the jury that 
the law actually permits a competitor to reproduce the mask work if that reproduction is done solely as a step in a process of creating its own original mask work.a mask work is original as long as it exhibits any minimal degree of creativity in any aspect of the mask work layout.the requisite level of creativity for originality is extremely low even a slight amount will suffice.
notice that i use the term legitimate reverse engineering.in the process of reverse engineering,the competitor is allowed to photograph and reproduce a registered mask work.if the competitor uses this information to reproduce a substantially identical mask work,as for example a virtual photocopy,the competitor has not engaged in legitimate reverse engineering.
legitimate reverse engineering would start with photographing and reproducing the mask work,but the photograph and reproduction is used for the purpose of study and analysis,and then the competitor must combine this study and analysis with its own engineers engineering efforts to yield its own original mask work.
because the new mask work is designed to be interchangeable with the registered mask,it may be substantially similar to the registered mask work.
the question on the verdict form pertinent to the defense of reverse engineering stated 
did clear logic prove that it reproduced altera mask works solely for the purpose of analysis to develop its own original layout design,namely one which is not substantially identical to components or groupings of components or interconnections on the corresponding altera mask work which are material and original 
answer as to each mask works which is the subject of this action.a yes.answer is a finding that the defense of legitimate reverse engineering was proved.a no.answer is a finding that the defense of legitimate reverse engineering was not proved.
the jury responded no with respect to each mask work,finding that clear logic had not established a reverse engineering defense for any of the chip families.
the scpa reverse engineering provision allows copying the entire mask work.it does not distinguish between the protectable and elements of the chip as long as the copying is for the purpose of teaching,evaluating,or analyzing the chip.although the product created from that analysis must be original,the process of studying the chip is not limited to copying ideas or concepts.the district court instructions initially define legitimate reverse engineering to allow copying and analyzing only concepts or techniques.this is an incorrect statement of the law.
the district judge instructions in this case were extremely thorough he made a real effort to make the instructions on this complex subject understandable to the jury.the instructions on the reverse engineering defense extend for several pages of the transcript.the later instructions correctly state the law applicable to the defense of reverse engineering and remedy the initial incorrect statement.they explain that it is permissible to reproduce a registered mask work as a step in the process of creating an original chip,so long as the purpose of reproducing the chip is appropriate.the district judge correctly explained that only minimal ingenuity is necessary for a second chip to qualify as original,and he emphasized the distinction between substantial identity and substantial similarity.as the court in brooktree discussed,the similarities in a chip may outweigh the differences.at.in this case,there was sufficient testimony about both the similarities and the differences in the mask works to allow a jury to determine whether the clear logic mask works were original as defined under the act.the incorrect statement in the instructions was not prejudicial error.
as our opinion in in re asbestos cases stated 
prejudicial error results when looking to the instructions as a whole,the substance of the applicable law was not fairly and correctly covered.the instructions and interrogatories must fairly present the issues to the jury.if the issues are fairly presented,the district court has broad discretion regarding the precise wording.
