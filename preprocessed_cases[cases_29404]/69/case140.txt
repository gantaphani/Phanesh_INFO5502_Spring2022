attrezzi,llc attrezzi llc,a new hampshire limited liability company,operates a single retail store of the same name in portsmouth,new hampshire,specializing in fine kitchen products and services.the proprietor,jennifer slade,opened her shop doors in june,and at the same time launched a website to support an anticipated business.slade obtained a new hampshire trademark registration for attrezzi in november.
maytag,a appliance maker,selected the same word,attrezzi,in the spring of as the name for a new line of small electric kitchen appliances that maytag was preparing to launch.attrezzi llc line of products includes such appliances although it does not carry maytag products.before launching its line,maytag learned through the customary trademark investigation that attrezzi llc was using the term for its business,and maytag trademark counsel warned that this created a problem.
after higher management asked its counsel to take another look,counsel reversed his position,and in march maytag filed an application with the patent and trademark office pto to register attrezzi as its trademark for small electric appliances.the next month maytag began to promote the name as a of,its house mark it announced that its attrezzi line would include small electric kitchen appliances and might extend to our own coffee,b ar ware,cups,glasses,and cutlery.
the pto eventually approved maytag application subject to opposition and gave public notice of this action.attrezzi llc wrote to maytag complaining of maytag use of the term attrezzi and filed a use service mark application of its own,with the pto,to register the term for retail store and online use for the sale of kitchen and dining goods.maytag responded to attrezzi llc that there was no likelihood of customers confusing the source of attrezzi branded products with the attrezzi store.
in turn,attrezzi llc filed suit,in october,in federal district court in new hampshire,charging maytag with violating the unfair competition provision of the lanham act,a and new hampshire trademark infringement,unfair competition,and trademark dilution statutes.ann,supp.attrezzi llc requested a jury trial and sought declaratory relief,a permanent injunction against the use of the term attrezzi,and enhanced damages,attorneys fees and costs.
prior to trial,the district court denied attrezzi llc motion for a preliminary injunction and maytag motion for summary judgment.it also denied maytag motion to strike attrezzi llc jury demand,reserving the question until after the case has been completed,at which point,i f the court determine s that plaintiff does not have a right to a jury trial,it w ould treat the jury verdict as advisory pursuant to.c.in the meantime,in september,attrezzi llc filed an opposition before the pto to maytag application to register attrezzi.
after a trial in february,the jury found maytag to have willfully infringed attrezzi llc trademark and to have caused damages of the cost of attrezzi llc opposition to maytag application before the pto.after proceedings,the district court granted a permanent injunction against maytag use of the mark attrezzi but allowed it a period to sell off stock so marked and awarded double damages and attorneys fees.
maytag now appeals from the judgment against it.attrezzi llc,opposing the period and the denial of certain litigation expenses.this court granted unopposed motions for a stay of the injunction pending appeal and for expedited consideration of the appeals.we begin with maytag claims of there was no right to a jury trial that even if there were,the evidence did not permit findings necessary to liability and that the provision of the new hampshire statute providing for the award of attorneys fees and enhanced damages is preempted by the lanham act.
the jury trial issue deserves attention first because,in its proceedings,the district judge said that in a bench trial,he would have decided the case in maytag favor.his reason was that,if he were the trier of fact,he would have found the evidence insufficient in the present circumstances to establish a likelihood of customer confusion as between attrezzi and attrezzi.had the jury trial been disallowed,we would be reviewing the evidence from the opposite perspective.
maytag made a timely objection to a jury trial,which it renewed in its motions for judgment as a matter of law.its main argument was that the injunctive action was equitable and that no evidence supported a claim for damages.an infringement claim for damages is a rather than an equitable claim and such a claim would be triable to a jury even if joined,as here,with a request for equitable relief.beacon theatres,westover,d.
here,maytag attack is solely on the sufficiency of the evidence presented at trial to show monetary damages.we are thus spared any consideration of how matters stood at the pleading and summary judgment stages.compare laskaris thornburgh,cir,cert.denied,d,with hildebrand bd.of trs.of.state,cir.
since the jury in this case found damages,maytag attack must fail unless reasonable persons could not have reached the conclusion that the jury embraced.sanchez oil,cir.as we have said elsewhere,the test is a stringent one 
w e must examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and determine whether there are facts and inferences reasonably drawn from those facts which lead to but one there is a total failure of evidence to prove plaintiff case.mayo schooner capital,cir quotation and citation omitted.in reviewing the record,we will evaluate neither the credibility of the witnesses nor the weight of the evidence,cir.

in this instance,maytag argues that there was never any basis for attrezzi llc claim of monetary damages because attrezzi llc introduced no evidence of lost profits or damage to its goodwill.and,although attrezzi llc did claim and obtained damages reflecting the expense of opposing maytag pto application,maytag says that this expense was unrecoverable because full relief including an injunction could have been granted by the district court,making it unnecessary for attrezzi llc to oppose maytag pto application 
it is true as a general matter that a patently unnecessary expense would be avoidable damage and so not collectible.see restatement second of torts.maytag argues that the opposition was unnecessary because the district court could have granted injunctive relief.however,fearing the repercussions of a pto grant for the infringement claim in district court,a competent lawyer could sensibly oppose maytag pto application.it is a matter of reasonable judgment whether the precaution was legitimate nothing indicates that attrezzi llc choice was unreasonable.
this brings us to the central issue on the appeal,namely,maytag claim that at trial there was insufficient evidence of a protectable mark and of likely customer confusion to permit a verdict for attrezzi llc.although our review of the district court rejection of the rule b motions is de novo,the question is whether any rational jury could have found for attrezzi llc on the evidence presented.sanchez,at.
under governing case law,a trade name is safeguarded by the lanham act only if the mark is distinctive,a term of art meaning that the mark must be arbitrary or suggestive or,if merely descriptive,must have acquired secondary meaning.an arbitrary or suggestive term,being inherently distinctive,can be appropriated by a first user,while a descriptive term is subject to such appropriation only if it has acquired secondary meaning by which consumers associate it with a particular producer or source.boston beer.slesar.brewing,cir.
the jury found specially that attrezzi llc use of the name attrezzi for its goods was a suggestive,rather than a descriptive use,and that in any event the name had acquired secondary meaning.both findings are treated as determinations of fact,boston beer,at,and it is enough to qualify the name for protection if either one is established.here,a rational jury could find the attrezzi mark,as used to identify a service selling kitchen appliances,utensils,and dinnerware,to be suggestive.
under the doctrine of foreign equivalents,a foreign word is ordinarily translated into english to determine whether it is suggestive or descriptive.see,pizzeria uno temple,cir see also mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,at ed.the district court so charged the jury and neither side contests the instruction.attrezzi is an italian word meaning tools.maytag argues that the term is merely descriptive as it relates to attrezzi llc business,which consists of selling,among other things,chef tools.
but attrezzi translates as tools,not chef tools as applied to kitchen implements and appliances,the term can easily be viewed as suggesting a similarity,not an identity,between ordinary workman tools and electrical appliances or the like used by a chef.it does not help maytag that the pto had originally balked at maytag own application and then given way when maytag urged the pto that attrezzi was suggestive rather than descriptive as applied to maytag kitchen appliances.
alternatively,maytag argues that the evidence did not permit a rational jury to find likelihood of confusion,as required for trademark infringement and unfair competition actions.the precise showing is proof that the allegedly infringing conduct here,maytag use of the mark attrezzi carries with it a likelihood of confounding an appreciable number of reasonably prudent purchasers exercising ordinary care.int l ass of machinists aerospace workers,winship green nursing,cir.the question of confusion of,beacon mut.ins.onebeacon ins.group,cir,is not at issue here.
attrezzi llc did not advance an ordinary confusion claim,one in which the claimant asserts that the infringer is diverting the claimant customers and on the claimant reputation and goodwill.rather,its claim was one of reverse confusion,by which attrezzi llc might be harmed by purchasers misperceiving that of its use of the term attrezzi in its own the source or sponsor of attrezzi llc goods and services.see decosta viacom int l,cir endorsing the reverse confusion concept,cert.denied,d.
in such a case,damage can result either because current or prospective customers of the claimant associate the claimant product with an inferior product offered by the infringer,or because the latter use of the mark saturates the market and overwhelms the senior user,such that the senior user loses the value of the trademark,its product identity,corporate identity,control over its goodwill and reputation,and ability to move into new markets.mccarthy,supra,at quoting ameritech,am.info.techs,cir.attrezzi llc in fact argued at trial that difficulties with maytag the complaints were atypical goes only to acknowledged internally within maytag and reinforced the danger that attrezzi llc might be tarred with the same brush to the extent that confusion existed.
whatever the source or extent of such damage,the requirement of likely confusion is common both to the ordinary forward confusion claim and the reverse confusion variant urged in this case.in assessing confusion,this circuit has resorted to the consultation of a series of factors rather than any mechanical formula.a representative list includes 
the similarity of the marks the similarity of the goods or,in a service mark case,the services the relationship between the parties channels of trade the juxtaposition of their advertising the classes of prospective purchasers the evidence of actual confusion the defendant intent in adopting its allegedly infringing mark and the strength of the plaintiff mark.

here,both sides have points in their favor.both use the word attrezzi and to this extent the marks are identical rather than merely similar.on the other hand,maytag uses the word only in conjunction with the term,attrezzi,which could help diminish the chance of confusion.see pignons,at.yet since the alleged harm is reverse confusion,to the extent is itself the more recognized label the linkage could actually aggravate the threat to attrezzi llc.a h sportswear,victoria secret stores,cir.
turning to the overlap of products,maytag fairly points out that its attrezzi products are appliances while attrezzi llc uses the attrezzi term to represent its entire retail business.but attrezzi llc itself sells small electric appliances alongside its gourmet foods and dinnerware.this is not a case in which two products are so dissimilar as to make confusion highly unlikely and the more similar the marks are,the less necessary it is that the products themselves be very similar to create confusion.mccarthy,supra,at to nn.collecting cases.
channels of trade,advertising modes,and prospective set of factors often considered together,see winship green,at cut both ways.maytag is a national manufacturer selling through stores and catalogues while attrezzi llc operates a single retail store engaged in local sales.but both use llc has customers in many searches using the terms attrezzi or attrezzi turn up both companies websites.both parties aim at basically the same customers,a point in favor of attrezzi llc,but conceivably customer sophistication could also ameliorate confusion,pignons,at.
attrezzi llc evidence of actual confusion,often deemed the best evidence of possible future confusion,beacon,at,is limited but real eight mistakenly sent to it rather than maytag through attrezzi llc website complaining of problems with attrezzi products testimony that the new hampshire store had received a dozen or so calls intended for maytag and written declarations from two attrezzi llc customers that they had been example 
i thought that maytag operated attrezzi as one of a chain of retail shops.part of the reason for this belief is the distinctiveness of the attrezzi name.i figured that because both companies were using the same name in the kitchen products market,they must be related.
the good faith of the alleged infringer is yet another factor.here,although maytag offered an innocent explanation for disregarding the initial advice of its counsel,the jury seemingly concluded in its willfulness finding that maytag was well aware of a substantial risk of confusion and nonetheless decided to gamble.on the other hand,there is some distance in a case like this one between a company knowing decision to risk a law suit and a factual inference that customer confusion is likely.
finally,the respective strengths of the junior and senior a nutshell,their respective regarded as relevant.attrezzi llc offered some evidence of regional success,showing that its retail business has been mentioned or featured in publications such as the boston globe and accent magazine,and that it received an award from business nh magazine in for its attrezzi branding campaign.maytag showed large national expenditures to promote attrezzi yet in a reverse confusion case,the relatively greater strength of a junior user like maytag may hurt,rather than help,its defense.see a h sportswear,at.
maytag appears to argue on appeal that because the attrezzi mark was suggestive rather than arbitrary,it was therefore inherently weak.this is not a proposition supported by any first circuit case law and its logic is not apparent to us.the factors commonly considered as to,wide recognition,efforts to promote,see beacon,at concerned with practical matters and not the legal classification of the mark.
in sum,this is not a case as to confusion.perhaps,like the district judge,we might as factfinders have come out the other way,but we see no way to describe the jury liability verdict as irrational.civil juries have their benefits and their risks.nor is there any hint of a strongly partisan jury in this case in the end,no vast damages were awarded maytag will simply have to find another word than attrezzi to couple to its brand.
maytag final the award of attorneys fees and double on the fact that the federal statute provides for attorneys fees only in exceptional cases,and permits the court in its discretion to award enhanced damages subject to principles of equity.a.new hampshire,by contrast,provides attorneys fees as a matter of course and only to plaintiffs,and offers enhanced damages automatically upon a showing that the violatio
