certified for publication 
neil kadisha served as the trustee of two trusts.the beneficiaries,dafna uzyel and her children izzet and joelle uzyel collectively the uzyels,filed petitions for breach of trust against kadisha and terminated the trusts.after a nonjury trial,the trial court awarded the uzyels over million in compensatory damages and disgorgement of profits,plus million in punitive damages and over million in attorney fees.kadisha appeals the judgment,challenging the awards on several claims,the punitive damages,and the attorney fee award.the uzyels also appeal,challenging the denial of relief on some of their claims,the denial of prejudgment interest on some claims,the punitive damages,and the costs award.
these consolidated appeals raise several questions concerning a trustee liability for breach of trust under probate code section,subdivision a with respect to these questions,we conclude as follows tracing is not required for the disgorgement of profits made by the trustee through the breach of trust under section,subdivision a the fact that an act is consistent with or even compelled by the duty of prudent investing does not excuse a trustee from liability for breach of the duty of loyalty,including liability for appreciation damages as lost profits under section,subdivision a the determination as to which of the statutory measures of liability is appropriate under the circumstances under section,subdivision a is reviewed for abuse of discretion an investment loss resulting from a breach of trust should be offset against a profit resulting from a breach of trust only if the breaches were not separate and distinct prejudgment interest is mandatory on an award of damages under section,subdivision a and the absence of an express provision for prejudgment interest under section,subdivision a does not preclude an award of prejudgment interest under civil code section,subdivision a on damages awarded under that provision.
in addition,with respect to two other issues,we conclude that a plaintiff is not entitled to the reversal of a punitive damages award for redetermination of the amount of punitive damages just because the compensatory award is increased on appeal and reasonable cause to oppose a contest of an account,within the meaning of section,subdivision b,means an objectively reasonable belief,based on the facts then known to the trustee,either that the claims are legally or factually unfounded or that the petitioner is not entitled to the requested remedies.

dafna uzyel notified kadisha in writing in june that the trusts were terminated and directed him to turn over all trust assets to whittier trust company.she petitioned for orders compelling kadisha to turn over the trust assets.the uzyels also applied ex parte for a temporary restraining order to prevent kadisha from spending any of the trust funds held by his attorney.kadisha objected to the petitions and opposed the ex parte application.the trial court granted temporary restraining orders and later preliminary injunctions prohibiting the use of any trust assets to pay for kadisha defense in any trust litigation.on august,the court ordered kadisha to return the held in trust by his attorney and turn over all trust assets to whittier trust company.kadisha began to turn over the assets in and completed the task with the exception of the still held in trust by his attorney on september.

trial and amended and consolidated petition for breach of trust 
the trial court consolidated the two proceedings for trial.the nonjury trial commenced in may.the presentation of evidence concluded in july,after approximately full or partial days of trial testimony.the uzyels filed an amended and consolidated petition in september,with leave of court.the court filed a tentative decision in september,an amended tentative decision in july,and a statement of decision in october.
statement of decision 
the statement of decision characterized kadisha conduct as trustee as egregious,stating throughout kadisha trusteeship,he acted in bad faith and in total derogation of his fiduciary duties.there can be no doubt that kadisha knew that what he did was did exactly what decastro advised him not to do and then tried to cover up his misconduct.a lthough the evidence shows numerous egregious instances in which kadisha used trust assets or his position as trustee for his own benefit,there is no evidence of any instances in which kadisha acted in the beneficiaries interests.in short,kadisha did precisely the opposite of what the duty of loyalty compelled him to do.rather than administering the trust and dealing with the trust assets solely for the interest of the beneficiaries,he administered the trust and dealt with the trust assets solely for his own benefit.the trial court found that kadisha had breached his fiduciary duties in many instances,but concluded that the uzyels were entitled to recover compensatory damages or the disgorgement of profits arising from only five specific events.
the statement of decision stated that the uzyels were entitled to the disgorgement of in profits arising from kadisha stock purchase from farahnik in may in compensatory damages arising from the sale of trust qualcomm stock in may the disgorgement of in profits arising from kadisha purchase of trust interest in carson in compensatory damages arising from kadisha failure to protect the value of trust investment in qualcomm stock in and after january in compensatory damages arising from kadisha use of trust funds to pay his legal expenses prejudgment interest on all of these amounts from september,and in punitive damages.
the statement of decision denied the uzyels relief on their other claims,including claims for disgorgement of some of the profits earned by kadisha from his purchase of qualcomm stock in august and from his exercise of the warrants for the purchase of shares of qualcomm stock in september damages for the misappropriation of trust funds lost profits resulting from the sale of trust qualcomm stock in april and other claims.the statement of decision also stated that the uzyels were entitled to recover their attorney fees pursuant to section,subdivision b.
the court filed an order on november,modifying the statement of decision by increasing the amount awarded for kadisha failure to protect the value of trust investment in qualcomm stock in and after january,from to,plus prejudgment interest on that amount from september.
judgment and amended judgment 
the court filed a judgment on november,awarding the uzyels in compensatory damages and disgorgement of profits,including prejudgment interest million in punitive damages and attorney fees in an amount to be determined.the court vacated the judgment sua sponte on november,stating that it had mistakenly entered judgment before the expiration of the time for kadisha to file objections to the proposed judgment.the court stated that this was a clerical error 
the court filed a new judgment on december,awarding the uzyels in compensatory damages and disgorgement of profits,including prejudgment interest million in punitive damages and attorney fees in an amount to be determined.the uzyels served a notice of entry of judgment on that same date.kadisha filed a notice of appeal from the new judgment on december,no.
new trial motions and amended judgment 
kadisha filed a notice of intention to move for a new trial on december,on several grounds,including excessive damages.the uzyels moved for a new trial on the grounds of inadequate damages and error in law.the court denied both motions in an order filed on february.in denying the motions,the court reduced the award on the farahnik stock purchase claim,and denied prejudgment interest on the damages arising from the sale of trust qualcomm stock in may and on the damages arising from the kadisha failure to protect the value of trust investment in qualcomm stock in and after january.the court invited the parties to file proposed amendments to the statement of decision in accordance with its order.
after considering the proposed amendments to the statement of decision,the trial court filed a minute order on march,stating that it had reconsidered its prior ruling of february,and was separately filing a signed order modifying its ruling on the new trial motions.the signed order filed on march,modified the order of february,by striking the reduction in the award on the farahnik stock purchase claim,correcting a misstated date,and adding language explaining its decision.the order of march explained that the court had denied prejudgment interest in its order of february on the amounts awarded on two claims on equitable grounds so as to avoid an undue penalty.the court filed another order on march,modifying its order denying the new trial motions and its order of march,by denying prejudgment interest on the farahnik stock purchase claim as well.
the court entered an amended judgment on march,reflecting these rulings.the amended judgment awards the uzyels in compensatory damages and the disgorgement of profits,including prejudgment interest on only the award for the disgorgement of profits arising from kadisha purchase of trust interest in carson and the award of damages arising from his use of trust funds to pay his legal expenses million in punitive damages and attorney fees in an amount to be determined.kadisha timely filed a notice of appeal from the amended judgment no.the uzyels also appealed the amended judgment 
attorney fees and costs awards 
the uzyels moved for an award of million in attorney fees under section,subdivision b.the trial court found that kadisha had no reasonable cause to oppose the uzyels contest of his accounting,that he had opposed the contest in bad faith,and that the uzyels therefore were entitled to recover attorney fees under the statute.the court concluded that the uzyels had reasonably incurred more than million in attorney fees,applied a multiplier of two,and awarded them in fees,in an order filed on june.kadisha moved for a new trial with respect to the fee award.the court reduced the award to and denied the new trial motion.kadisha timely appealed the order awarding fees no.
the trial court awarded the uzyels in costs in an order filed on october.kadisha filed a notice of appeal from the order on november,no.the uzyels also appealed the order.the trial court corrected and reduced the award to in an order filed on november.
we have consolidated the five appeals.
contentions 
kadisha contends in his appeal that the award of the disgorgement of profits arising from kadisha stock purchase from farahnik in may was error the award of damages arising from the sale of trust qualcomm stock in may was error the award of damages arising from his failure to protect the value of trust investment in qualcomm stock in and after january was error the award of damages arising from his use of trust funds to pay for his legal defense includes excessive prejudgment interest the punitive damages are constitutionally excessive and the award of attorney fees under section,subdivision b is unauthorized and excessive 
the uzyels contend in their appeal that they are entitled to the disgorgement of some of the profits earned by kadisha on the qualcomm stock that he purchased in august and september they are entitled to recover lost profits arising from the sale of trust qualcomm stock in april they are entitled to prejudgment interest on all of the amounts awarded the punitive damages are inadequate and they are entitled to recover all of their reasonable litigation expenses as costs under section,subdivision b,notwithstanding any limitations on recoverable costs under code of civil procedure section.
discussion 
governing law 
the probate code sets forth the duties of a trustee administering a trust and the measure of liability for breach of those duties.those duties include,among others,a duty of loyalty,requiring the trustee to administer the trust solely in the interest of the beneficiaries,subd.a a duty not to use trust property for the trustee own profit or for any other purpose unconnected with the trust,subd.a and a duty to exercise reasonable care,skill,and prudence in administering the trust,subd.a,including a duty to diversify the investments unless it is prudent not to do so a trustee also has a fiduciary duty to act in good faith in the exercise of any discretionary powers conferred on the trustee by the trust instrument,subd.a.a trustee violation of any duty owed to the beneficiaries is a breach of trust.
section sets forth the measure of a trustee liability for a breach of trust 
a if the trustee commits a breach of trust,the trustee is chargeable with any of the following that is appropriate under the circumstances 
any loss or depreciation in value of the trust estate resulting from the breach of trust,with interest.
any profit made by the trustee through the breach of trust,with interest.
any profit that would have accrued to the trust estate if the loss of profit is the result of the breach of trust.
b if the trustee has acted reasonably and in good faith under the circumstances as known to the trustee,the court,in its discretion,may excuse the trustee in whole or in part from liability under subdivision a if it would be equitable to do so.
section does not preclude any other remedy for breach of trust that is available under statutory or common law.
the uzyels are not entitled to the disgorgement of profits made 
on qualcomm stock purchased by kadisha in august and 
trial court decision 
the uzyels sought the disgorgement of some of the profits earned by kadisha on shares of qualcomm stock that he purchased in august and on shares that he purchased in september by exercising warrants,or a constructive trust over some of those shares.they argued that they were entitled to those remedies because kadisha misappropriation of trust funds enabled those purchases,even if the misappropriated funds could not be traced to the purchases.specifically,they argued that although kadisha spent the misappropriated namco loan proceeds for other purposes,his failure to repay trust for those misappropriated funds made it possible for him to contribute of his own money toward the loan to qualcomm in august they argued alternatively that the misappropriated namco loan proceeds were commingled with other funds that were used to purchase the qualcomm stock and could be traced to the purchases.
the trial court stated that in august,kadisha still owed trust for the misappropriated namco loan proceeds and that he could not have both repaid that amount and contributed toward the loan to qualcomm the court rejected kadisha argument that misappropriated trust funds must be traced to the stock purchases in order to support an award of disgorgement of profits under section,subdivision a.the statement of decision stated in a section discussing the governing law 
kadisha incorrectly and throughout the trial steadfastly maintains that directly tracing the trustee personal profit to actual trust dollars is necessary to establish that the trustee profited from trust assets.this is tantamount to saying that causation requires tracing and that the only possible way a trustee can benefit from the trust assets or his position as trustee is where he uses actual trust dollars for a personal investment.kadisha has not,however,offered a single authority that supports his are there any.in fact,the only decision that directly discusses this bank of america cir,precisely the opposite,that under california law,t raceability and causation are not the same.emphasis added.
the statement of decision stated later in a section discussing this particular claim 
the uzyels make two contentions as foundational to claiming a portion of the qualcomm stock belongs to the beneficiaries,neither of which the court adopts.the first contention is that kadisha could not have both repaid the namco loan,as his fiduciary duties required him to do,and paid this.the second contention is that because kadisha used the namco loan proceeds for his expenses he freed up of his own funds for the qualcomm stock giving him the same benefit he would have had if he had applied the namco loan proceeds directly to the qualcomm stock purchase.
the court does not find,as the uzyels allege,that kadisha benefited from the use of trust funds in acquiring his qualcomm stock on august.
the court finds the uzyels have produced insufficient evidence more likely to be not true to trace qualcomm stock under probate code section a because kadisha commingled his funds in a common fund and purchased the qualcomm stock from the commingled fund.the common fund claim is not uninteresting but is as leaky as the new orleans levee when hit by katrina.
the uzyels contend that kadisha bank accounts in union bank and wells fargo bank should be considered as one fund,like having cash in your right pocket and also your left pocket.but kadisha purchase money came from the million deposited in the sanwa bank,the source of which did not include any trust money.
the uzyels position is sic that because kadisha had two different bank accounts,one with wells fargo and the other with the union bank,this created a single fund,and,as such was the source of acquisition by kadisha of his qualcomm stock from qualcomm is denied.
unfortunately,for the uzyels,kadisha dodges equity by showing exactly where the namco proceeds went.the uzyels claim this to be false insulation from the law which declares a trustee can not use trust assets for his own benefit whether direct or indirect.but the claimed nexus of direct or indirect benefit to kadisha is missing.hence,the uzyels claim that a constructive trust or damages be imposed upon kadisha acquisition of qualcomm stock based on the namco loan proceeds is denied.
b.the uzyels have shown no legal error with respect to tracing 
the uzyels contend the trial court erroneously required tracing in order to support an award of the disgorgement of profits made by kadisha through his breach of trust under section,subdivision a.the uzyels contend this was legal error.we conclude that tracing is not required to support an award of the disgorgement of profits under the statute and that the trial court did not conclude to the contrary,so the uyzels have shown no legal error.
we agree with the uzyels that an award under section,subdivision a in these circumstances would not necessarily require the tracing of misappropriated funds to kadisha stock purchases.subdivision a states that a trustee who commits a breach of trust is liable in the amount of a ny profit made by the trustee through the breach of trust,with interest.in our view,profits made through the misappropriation of trust funds are not limited to profits made by investing those particular funds or their proceeds,such as could be identified through tracing.the statutory language does not expressly impose a tracing requirement.
a plaintiff seeking a money judgment in personam,as distinguished from an equitable interest in a particular asset,as a remedy for unjust enrichment need only establish a causal connection between the wrongful conduct and the profits to be disgorged.the plaintiff need not trace the misappropriated funds to a particular asset as long as the plaintiff can establish a sufficient causal relationship between the wrongful conduct and the defendant profits.see sec banner fund intern,rest d restitution and unjust enrichment tent.draft,coms.b e,as in cases of securities fraud sec banner fund,supra,at,the tracing of assets is not required for the disgorgement of profits earned by a trustee through a breach of trust.see nickel bank of america,supra,at applying,subd.a.
we reject kadisha argument that section,subdivision a imposes a tracing requirement with respect to an award of the disgorgement of profits under section,subdivision a.section,subdivision a describes in general terms the basic remedies for a breach of trust.cal.law revision com,reprinted at west ann.ed.foll,see also recommendation proposing the trust law cal.law revision com.the proposed law seeks only to provide a brief description of the basic remedies for breach of trust as a guide to parties,without altering the basic principles of existing law.section does not limit the availability of any particular remedy or explain its application in particular circumstances.the availability of a particular remedy and its application in particular circumstances are governed by the common law.cal.law revision com,reprinted at west ann.ed.foll.the basic remedies include monetary relief,subd.a,an equitable lien or constructive trust,subd.a,and recovery of a specific asset through tracing,subd.a,among other remedies.a petitioner can seek the disgorgement of the trustee profits,subd.a through a money judgment against the trustee,subd.a or seek to establish an equitable interest in specific assets through a judgment in rem,subd.a,these are separate remedies one remedy does not limit the other.
the uzyels have shown no legal error,however,because they have not shown that the trial court required tracing.they argued both that they were entitled to recover a portion of the profits from kadisha stock purchases because kadisha benefited from the use of misappropriated funds even if the funds could not be traced to the purchases,and that the misappropriated funds could be traced to the purchases through a commingled fund.the statement of decision expressly stated that the uzyels need not trace trust funds to kadisha personal investments to show that he benefited from the use of those funds.in discussing this particular claim,the statement of decision first stated that kadisha did not benefit from the use of trust funds in acquiring the stock in august.it then stated that the uzyels had failed to trace the funds to the stock purchases.we construe these as two separate findings.contrary to uzyels argument,the court finding that kadisha did not benefit from the use of trust funds was not based solely on its finding that the uzyels had failed to establish tracing.
c.the uzyels have shown no error in the finding that kadisha 
profits are not attributable to trust funds 
the uzyels contend kadisha use of misappropriated funds to pay his personal expenses and obligations enabled him to purchase qualcomm stock using other money.they argue that he therefore earned profits on those purchases through the breach of trust,subd.a within the meaning of the statute.alternatively,they contend the misappropriated funds can be traced to the august stock purchase.the trial court found that kadisha did not benefit from the use of trust funds in purchasing the stock and that the misappropriated funds could not be traced to the purchases,as we have stated.
the disgorgement of profits is a remedy to prevent unjust enrichment.dobbs,law of remedies ed a.the determination of the amount of a defendant profits attributable to wrongful conduct can be a difficult task.the restatement third of restitution and unjust enrichment,describes this as the problem of attribution.it involves questions of causation and remoteness,that is,how far to follow a chain of causation before deciding that the causal connection is too attenuated to justify a recovery the presence or absence of causation is not necessarily determinative of unjust enrichment.moreover,in deciding whether the defendant profits are properly attributable to misconduct,the court should consider not only justice between the parties but also the incentives to be created for others.
the general rule stated in the tentative draft of the restatement,which we deem applicable under california law to a trustee who has committed a breach of trust,is that profits subject to disgorgement include any form of consequential gains or other secondary enrichment that is identifiable and measurable on the facts of the case and not unduly remote.rest d restitution and unjust enrichment tent.draft,a.the party seeking disgorgement has the burden of producing evidence permitting at least a reasonable approximation of the amount of the wrongful gain.residual risk of uncertainty in calculating net profit is assigned to the wrongdoer,d.
we believe that,in light of the balancing of equities involved,abuse of discretion is the appropriate standard of review of the decision whether particular profits are fairly attributable to the trustee misconduct or,on the other hand,too remote to justify disgorgement.city of barstow mojave water agency cal th,stating that the trial court exercise of its equitable powers in awarding a remedy is properly reviewed for abuse of discretion hirshfield schwartz th,same.an abuse of discretion occurs if,in light of the applicable law and considering all of the relevant circumstances,the court decision exceeds the bounds of reason and results in a miscarriage of justice.shamblin brattain cal d,new albertsons,superior court th.
in our view,kadisha misappropriation of of the namco loan proceeds in may and his failure to repay of that amount as of august were not so closely connected with his payment of toward the loan to qualcomm in august as to compel the conclusion that kadisha benefited from the use of trust funds in that transaction.the immediate source of the was kadisha personal wells fargo account into which he had deposited the paid to him by his family and friends in return for his purchase of qualcomm stock for them using the sanwa loan funds thus,the ultimate source of the was the sanwa loan funds.the misappropriated trust funds neither directly nor indirectly facilitated the payment.despite kadisha prior misappropriation and outstanding debt to the trust,we believe that the trial court conclusion that any connection between the payment and his prior misappropriation and continuing debt to the trust was too attenuated to justify the disgorgement of profits was sound.we conclude that the uzyels have shown no abuse of discretion.
d.the uzyels have shown no error in the finding that trust funds 
can not be traced to the stock purchase 
the uzyels contention that the misappropriated funds can be traced to the august stock purchase is based on their argument that the paid to kadisha by his family and friends in august and deposited in his union bank account was not reimbursement for sanwa loan funds that kadisha had used to purchase stock for his family and friends,but instead was a loan to kadisha from his family and friends.the uzyels argue that kadisha repaid the loan one year later using taken from trust.the deposited in kadisha union bank account in august was the immediate source of his contribution to the loan to qualcomm,as we have stated.the uzyels argue that because trust money repaid the purported loan from kadisha family and friends that funded the payment,trust money ultimately funded the payment and tracing was established.
the statement of decision expressly stated that kadisha friends and family paid him in august in reimbursement for the money that he had advanced them from the sanwa loan funds to purchase their own qualcomm stock.other language in the statement of decision,however,seems to suggest that the trial court disbelieved this explanation and that the payment to kadisha actually was a loan from his family and friends.contrary to the uzyels argument that the trial court so found,we must resolve any ambiguity in this regard in favor of the judgment.

the uzyels did not assert either before the entry of judgment or in conjunction with a new trial motion or a motion to vacate the judgment that the statement of decision failed to decide whether the payment to kadisha in august was a reimbursement or a loan or that the statement of decision was ambiguous in this regard.the uzyels argued in their new trial motion that kadisha payment toward the loan to qualcomm could be traced to the trusts through commingled funds,but did not argue that the statement of decision failed to decide the nature of the payment to kadisha or was ambiguous on this issue.we conclude that any ambiguity was not brought to the attention of the trial court either before the entry of judgment or in conjunction with a new trial motion or a motion to vacate the judgment,and that we therefore must resolve the ambiguity in favor of the judgment by inferring that the court decided that the payment to kadisha was a reimbursement rather than a loan 
the predicate for the uzyels tracing argument having failed,it follows that they have shown no error in the trial court finding that trust funds could not be traced to the stock purchase.we express no opinion as to whether the facts as argued by them could establish tracing.
the award of the disgorgement of profits arising from kadisha 
stock purchase from farahnik in may was proper,but the 
vacation of the modification of the award is void 
trial court decision 
the uzyels sought to recover the profits earned by kadisha on shares of qualcomm stock that he purchased from farahnik in may or,alternatively,to establish a constructive trust over those shares.they argued that they were entitled to those remedies because misappropriated trust funds had paid for kadisha loans to farahnik.according to the uzyels,kadisha drew on his union bank line of credit to lend a total of to farahnik,used of the namco loan proceeds belonging to trust to repay the line of credit,and then paid for the shares by canceling of farahnik debt to kadisha.the uzyels argued that kadisha had gained an advantage from his use of the trust funds and should be required to disgorge the profits earned through his use of the trust funds pursuant to section,subdivision a.they argued alternatively that shares of qualcomm stock acquired as a direct result of the purchase through subsequent stock splits should be subject to a constructive trust.
the trial court found that kadisha misappropriation of trust funds had enabled his acquisition of stock from farahnik,but found that kadisha did not use actual trust money in making the loans and did not ha ve his eye on trust probable assets at the time that he made the loans to farahnik.the statement of decision stated 
because kadisha used a portion of the namco loan proceeds the property of trust to wipe out his obligation to union bank,there was clearly substitute funding of of the farahnik loans by the use of trust money.kadisha,by his actions and conduct,had to know that what he was doing with trust money was wrongful.he abstained from making any note to trust concurrent with his taking of the namco loan proceeds.he never had a note signed by farahnik to trust concurrent with kadisha paying off union bank with trust money.he gave six different,incorrect explanations for what he did with the namco loan proceeds prior to trial to prevent the uzyels from discovering that he had used a portion of the proceeds to pay off his union bank line of credit for funds he had borrowed to loan to farahnik.kadisha must disgorge any profit,benefit or advantage he acquired through his dealings with trust assets.
the trial court found that kadisha union bank line of credit was the source of of the lent to farahnik,the court also found that kadisha had contributed of his own money,reduced by that amount,and determined that was percent of the purchase price for the shares of qualcomm stock purchased from farahnik in may.the court found that the shares held by kadisha had grown to shares by september due to stock splits,and concluded that the uzyels were entitled to recover the value of shares percent of upon the trusts termination.the court determined the value of those shares based on their lowest market price between september and september,per share,and awarded the uzyels a total of on this claim.
kadisha argued in his new trial motion that there was no causal connection between the misappropriation of trust funds and his purchase of qualcomm stock from farahnik.he also argued that the damages awarded on this claim were excessive and that any damages should be limited to a proportionate share of kadisha profits earned until the time that he purportedly fully repaid trust for all misappropriated funds,with interest,on november.in an order filed on february,the trial court denied kadisha new trial motion,but reduced the amount awarded on this claim from to an amount to be determined based on the value of the shares as of november.
the order of february,stated.the measure of damages and the amount thereof shall be modified to award damages based on the value of the number of farahnik shares referred to in the statement of decision as of the date the period of kadisha misappropriation ended,november,sic,less kadisha acquisition cost.it stated further,anything at variance herein with the filed statement of decision,shall be deemed incorporated in the said statement of decision.a minute order filed on february,directed the uzyels to submit a proposed amended judgment in accordance with the ruling on the new trial motion.
the uzyels filed a response to court order regarding amendments to the statement of decision on february,objecting to the reduction of the award.the trial court,in an order filed on february,requested further briefing on the issue.kadisha argued that the uzyels objections were improper and that the amount of damages based on the closing price of on november,minus the cost of acquiring the shares was.the trial court,in an order filed on march,stated that upon further consideration,its order of february,was modified to delete the reduction of the award the court explained that the misappropriated trust funds enabled kadisha to acquire a portion of the shares of qualcomm stock from kadisha and that the uzyels were entitled to the disgorgement of profits earned until the trusts termination.
b.the order vacating the modification of the award is void 
kadisha contends the trial court had no jurisdiction to restore the award after ruling on the new trial motion and modifying the judgment.we agree.
a trial court ruling on a new trial motion must do so within days after the earlier of the date of mailing by the court clerk or service by a party of a notice of entry of judgment or the date of filing of a notice of intention to move for a new trial.code civ,par.if the court fails to rule on the motion within that time period,the motion is denied by operation of law.ibid.an order ruling on a new trial motion after the period is beyond the court jurisdiction and is void.siegal superior court cal d.

a trial court has no authority to rule on a new trial motion by granting relief pursuant to code of civil procedure section after the expiration of the period to rule on a new trial motion.tuck tuck d,avery,supra,d at.a court that timely rules on a new trial motion by vacating the statement of decision or the judgment,however,may file a new statement of decision or judgment after the expiration of the period.taormino denny,supra,cal d,avery,supra,d at this is because an order vacating the statement of decision or the judgment necessarily contemplates further rulings by the court in the form of a new statement of decision or judgment,and code of civil procedure section imposes no limitation on the time to file a new statement of decision or judgment after the statement of decision or the judgment is timely vacated.avery,supra,d at.
an order modifying the statement of decision or the judgment without vacating either differs from an order vacating the statement of decision or the judgment in that a modification order does not necessarily contemplate further rulings by the trial court.the question arises whether a modification of the statement of decision or the judgment must be completed within the period to rule on a new trial motion.the california supreme court in spier lang,supra,cal d,held that a minute order filed within the period to rule on a new trial motion,denying the motion and modifying the judgment,satisfied the requirements of code of civil procedure section and that documents filed after the period more formally amending the findings and the judgment consistent with the prior ruling were properly deemed effective as of the date of the minute order.spier,supra,at.similarly,de arman connelly.held that,after ordering the denial of a new trial motion and modification of the judgment within the period to rule on the motion,the trial court properly filed documents formally amending the findings and the judgment consistent with the prior ruling after the expiration of the period.id.at see also medak cox d,holland superior court.
the trial court here did not vacate the statement of decision or the judgment.instead,the court in its order of february,specified particular modifications to its decision,including the reduction of the award on this claim.we construe the order as a modification of both the statement of decision and the judgment.the order was timely because it was filed within days after the service on kadisha of a notice of entry of judgment on december.code civ.then,after the expiration of the period to rule on the new trial motion,the court in its order of march,vacated its modification of the award.the later order was not consistent with the prior order and can not be viewed as implementing its prior modification of the award.instead,the later order vacated the prior modification of the award and constituted a new ruling on the new trial motion.we conclude that the order of march was untimely and therefore was beyond the court jurisdiction and void because it was made after the expiration of the period to rule on the new trial motion.
our conclusion that the trial court had no jurisdiction to vacate its prior modification of the award also is compelled by the rule that a final order granting or denying a new trial motion,regularly made,exhausts the trial court jurisdiction and can not be set aside or modified by the trial court except for clerical error or to grant relief under code of civil procedure section.wenzoski central banking system,cal d,wenzoski.this rule ordinarily is invoked where the court,having granted a new trial motion,later reconsiders its ruling and denies the motion,bloomquist haley cal,drinkhouse van ness cal,or the court,having denied a new trial motion,later reconsiders its ruling and grants the motion,stevens superior court cal d,hinrichs maloney d,we believe that the same principal applies where the court,having timely modified the statement of decision or the judgment,later reconsiders its ruling and substitutes a different ruling inconsistent with the initial ruling.we hold that such a later ruling is beyond the court jurisdiction and void.
clarke fiedler d,cited by the uzyels,is not on point.the trial court in that case vacated the findings and the judgment in a minute order timely ruling on a new trial motion.id.at.the minute order specifically referred to particular findings,but the new findings and new judgment apparently included changes not specifically identified in the minute order.id.at.clarke stated that having vacated the findings and the judgment,the trial court was authorized to file new findings and a new judgment,and it was not required that such new findings be limited to those expressly referred to in the valid minute order setting aside,within the statutory time,the original findings and judgment.ibid.here,in contrast,the trial court in its order of february,did not vacate the statement of decision or the judgment,but instead only modified the statement of decision and the judgment.the court had no jurisdiction to reconsider and set aside,in whole or in part,its timely ruling on the new trial motion.
we conclude that the order of march,restoring the award of is void and that the award set forth in the order of february,based on the value of the shares on november,is effective 
kadisha profits are attributable to trust funds 
kadisha lent a total of to farahnik from february to april,including drawn on his union bank line of credit.he used of the misappropriated namco loan proceeds to repay his line of credit in may,but the trial court found that kadisha did not ha ve his eye on trust assets,intend to use trust assets for this purpose at the time that he lent the money to farahnik.kadisha purchased shares of qualcomm stock from farahnik in may and paid for the shares by canceling of farahnik debt to kadisha.thus,kadisha union bank line of credit ultimately paid for the stock purchase,and the misappropriated trust funds repaid the funds the drawn on the line of credit.whether by choice,by carelessness,or by necessity,kadisha established a close connection between the trust funds and the stock purchase by using the trust funds in this manner.in our view,despite the absence of either a prior intent to use the trust funds in this manner or causation,this connection between the misappropriated trust funds and the stock purchase justifies the trial court conclusion that the profits earned on the stock are attributable to the trust funds.we therefore conclude that the award of the disgorgement of profits was proper.
the uzyels are entitled to an award of lost profits resulting from 
the sale of trust qualcomm stock in may 
trial court decision 
the uzyels sought to recover the profits that trust would have earned on shares of qualcomm stock if kadisha had not sold those shares in may.they argued that kadisha sold the shares solely for his own benefit and funneled the sale proceeds to himself through the fictitious loan to rahban,breaching his duty of loyalty,and that the sale was imprudent.they argued that they were entitled to recover the trust lost profits pursuant to section,subdivision a.
the uzyels argued that the lost profits should be calculated based on the value of the shares upon the termination of the trusts in september.they cited by analogy cases involving a fiduciary fraudulent inducement of the sale of an asset strebel brenlar investments,th mitchell texas gulf sulphur company cir and argued that those cases supported an award of lost profits based on the appreciation of the asset as of a reasonable time after the discovery of the fraud.the uzyels argued that the reason for such a rule was that the defrauded seller should be allowed a reasonable time after the discovery of the fraud to decide whether to reinvest the funds.they argued further that because kadisha controlled the trust funds and failed to provide accurate accountings,their first opportunity to reinvest the funds was upon the termination of the trusts in september.
the trial court found that kadisha sold the shares solely for his own benefit,that rahban was a fictitious borrower,and that kadisha used the in sale proceeds to repay his own debt to trust.the court therefore found that kadisha breached his duty of loyalty by selling the shares.the court also found that kadisha did not consult an investment advisor before selling the shares or invest the sale proceeds,that he sold the shares without any economic justification,and that selling the shares to raise cash for his own use was not prudent investing.thus,the court found that kadisha breached both his duty of loyalty and his duty to invest prudently.the court also found that by selling the shares and misappropriating the proceeds,kadisha avoided having to sell his own qualcomm stock and thus profited from its appreciation.the court declined to excuse kadisha from liability pursuant to section,subdivision b because it found that kadisha did not act reasonably or in good faith in selling trust qualcomm stock for his own purposes and attempting to conceal his wrongdoing in the fraudulent guise of the rahban loan.
the trial court concluded that the uzyels were entitled to treat the may stock sale as if it had never occurred and stated,therefore,the court must treat the sale as not having been made,and the stock should have been held until the termination of trust the court found that the shares had grown to shares by september due to stock splits,and concluded that the uzyels were entitled to recover the value of shares upon the trusts termination,minus the proceeds from the sale of the shares in may.the court determined the value of shares based on their lowest market price between september and september,per share.the court augmented the sale proceeds by percent interest from may through november,plus percent interest from december to september,the court calculated a total award of on this claim,and also awarded prejudgment interest on that amount from september.
kadisha argued in his new trial motion that the evidence did not support the finding that there was no economic justification for the sale,but he did not challenge the finding that he breached his duty of loyalty.he also argued that the damages resulting from a breach of trust depended on what would have occurred absent the breach of trust.he argued that in these circumstances,the measure of damages for selling the stock in breach of his duty to invest prudently should be based on what a prudent investment would have earned,and by that measure the damages should be zero.he also argued that even if the damages were based on the appreciation of qualcomm stock after may,the evidence indicated that it would have been prudent to sell the shares long before september.
the trial court denied the new trial motion with no change in the award of damages on this claim,except that the court denied prejudgment interest on the claim.
kadisha can not negate his breach of the duty of loyalty 
kadisha contends qualcomm stock was a very risky investment in may,particularly in light of the fact that qualcomm stock constituted a high percentage of trust assets.kadisha contends the stock was an inappropriate investment for the trust,so he had a duty to sell the shares and can not be held liable for discharging that duty with an improper motive.kadisha does not challenge the trial court finding that he sold the shares solely to raise cash for his own use.
the duty of loyalty,requiring a trustee to administer the trust solely in the interest of the beneficiaries,subd.a,is the most fundamental duty of a trustee.bogert bogert,the law of trusts and trustees ed,bogert scott fratcher,the law of trusts ed.its purpose is to protect the best interests of the beneficiaries.the duty of loyalty requires a trustee to subordinate his or her interests to those of the beneficiaries in every regard.bogert,supra.a trustee motive in administering the trust is of paramount importance,and ensuring that the trustee will act in the sole interests of the beneficiaries rather than with some other motive is the principal object of the duty of loyalty.hallgring,the uniform trustees powers act and the basic principles of fiduciary responsibility,hallgring.
trust beneficiaries are particularly vulnerable to and other abuses by trustees.beneficiaries typically lack the financial sophistication necessary to monitor the trustee investment decisions and discover abuses.the confidentiality of trust management decisions and lack of public information concerning the trust performance shield trustees from market forces and other external pressures that can curb the abuses of fiduciaries in other contexts.moreover,the cost and difficulty of ending the trust relationship,which ordinarily requires litigation to remove a trustee for cause,distinguish trusts from other confidential relationships that can be terminated more readily.leslie,in defense of the no further inquiry rule a response to professor john langbein,rest d trusts,com.b.these circumstances explain why the law is more protective of trust beneficiaries than of participants in other fiduciary relationships,such as corporate shareholders.leslie,supra,at sitkoff,trust law,corporate law,and capital market efficiency journal of.law.
a trustee is strictly prohibited from administering the trust with the motive or purpose of serving interests other than those of the beneficiaries.rest d trusts,com.f,see also,com.c,an abuse of discretion may result from the exercise of discretionary authority in bad faith or from improper motive.a trustee also is strictly prohibited from engaging in transactions in which the trustee personal interests may conflict with those of the beneficiaries without the express authorization of either the trust instrument,the court,or the beneficiaries.bogert,supra,rest d trusts,com.b.it is no defense that the trustee acted in good faith,that the terms of the transaction were fair,or that the trust suffered no loss or the trustee received no profit.this is known as the no further inquiry rule.bogert,supra,rest d trusts,coms.b d.such a transaction is voidable at the election of the beneficiaries,and other remedies may be available,including an award of profits that the trust would have made if not for the breach of trust.bogert,supra,v,rest d trusts prudent investor rule,com.a.this rule is prophylactic and is justified in part by its deterrent effect.bogert,supra,rest d trusts,com.b.if the original purchase of an asset was a breach of the duty of prudent investing,the beneficiaries are entitled to affirm that transaction,waiving the breach,and enforce their remedies for a separate breach of the duty of loyalty in connection with the sale of the asset.rest d trusts prudent investor rule,com.a,rest d trusts tent.draft.
kadisha breached his duty of loyalty by selling the shares solely for his own benefit and without regard to the interests of the beneficiaries.he breached his duty of loyalty regardless of whether a faithful trustee exercising reasonable care and acting in the best interests of the beneficiaries would have sold the shares at the same time in our view,to allow a trustee to attempt to justify a breach of the duty of loyalty by showing that the transaction was consistent with,or even compelled by,the duty to invest prudently would seriously undermine the duty of loyalty and impair its deterrent value.rest d,com.b,discussing the difficulty of the trustee exercise of discretion and the relative ease of concealing misconduct hallgring,supra.at same.a court may excuse a trustee from liability for a breach of trust if the trustee acted reasonably and in good faith under the circumstances known to the trustee,subd.b.but we are aware of no authority to excuse from the statutory measure of liability for a breach of trust,subd.a a trustee who acted in bad faith by serving his own interests.accordingly,we conclude that the fact that the sale might have been in the best interests of the trust,or even compelled by the duty to invest prudently,if true,does not excuse kadisha from liability for his breach of the duty of loyalty.
c.the award of appreciation damages was proper 
kadisha also challenges the calculation of damages based on the value of the shares in september.he argues that any damages resulting from his breach of trust must be determined by considering what would have occurred absent the breach of trust.he argues further that any damages must be based on what a prudent investor would have done with the shares,and that the evidence compels the conclusion that a prudent investor would have sold the shares in may or earlier,so there were no damages.as in his new trial motion,kadisha argument on appeal ignores the trial court finding that he breached not only his duty of prudent investing but also his duty of loyalty.
the calculation of damages based on what a prudent investor would have done would be appropriate for a breach of the duty of prudent investing.such a calculation would reflect what would have occurred if kadisha had complied with the duty of prudent investing,but for the breach of the duty of prudent investing and therefore would show the amount of profits lost as the result of the breach of trust,subd.a.the duty of loyalty,however,exists independently of the duty to invest prudently,and the damages resulting from a breach of the duty of loyalty are not necessarily the same as those resulting from a failure to invest prudently.damages for a breach of the duty of loyalty should be based on what would have occurred if the trustee had complied with the duty of loyalty,but for the breach of the duty of loyalty.only then would the damages reflect the amount of profits lost as a result of the breach of the duty of loyalty.accordingly,we reject kadisha argument that the damages for a breach of the duty of loyalty must be based on what a prudent investor would have done with the shares.
the remedy for a breach of trust should be adapted to fit the nature and gravity of the breach and the consequences to the beneficiaries and trustee.bogert,supra,v.the goals of the remedy are not only to compensate the beneficiaries for their loss,but also to deter the trustee in question and other trustees from committing similar acts.ibid.particularly with respect to the duty of loyalty,the principal object of the administration of the rule is preventative,to make the disobedience of the trustee to the rule so prejudicial to him that he and all other trustees will be induced to avoid disloyal transactions in the future.here,kadisha breached his duty of loyalty by selling shares of qualcomm stock in may solely for his own benefit and without regard to the interests of the beneficiaries.the stock value later appreciated dramatically.
the term appreciation damages refers to the amount of an asset appreciation from the date of sale generally to the date of trial or judgment estate of anderson d,bogert,supra,v.section,subdivision a states that damages for a breach of trust can include a ny profit that would have accrued to the trust estate if the loss of profit is the result of the breach of trust.such lost profits can include appreciation damages in some circumstances,particularly where the trustee breached the duty of loyalty.see estate of anderson,supra,at affirmed under prior law an award of appreciation damages against an executor that had breached its duty of loyalty in the sale of real property estate of talbot d,held under prior law that absent a breach of the duty of loyalty or breach of a duty to retain or acquire specific assets,a trustee could not be held liable for appreciation damages see also strebel brenlar investments,supra,th at affirmed an award of appreciation damages against a real estate agent based on fraud.damages measured by the lost appreciation of an asset may exceed the amount of the loss as of the date of sale,the difference between the value of the asset at the time of sale and the price paid and the trustee profit from the sale,if any,and may provide an appropriate deterrent to disloyalty.
an award of appreciation damages based on a breach of the duty of loyalty does not imply or require a finding that the trustee had an independent duty to retain the asset.instead,appreciation damages can be awarded as lost profits under section,subdivision a if the trustee sold the asset in breach of the duty of loyalty and the trust lost profits as a result.accordingly,we reject kadisha argument that he had no duty to retain the shares and therefore can not be liable for appreciation damages 
the uzyels are not entitled to lost profits resulting from the sale of 
trust qualcomm stock in april 
trial court decision 
the uzyels sought to recover the profits that trust would have earned on shares of qualcomm stock if kadisha had not sold those shares in april.they alleged in their amended and consolidated petition filed in september,after the close of evidence,that kadisha sold the shares in bad faith and without just cause and that the sale was imprudent.they argued in their closing trial brief filed in december that kadisha believed that the stock would increase in value and that he sold the shares solely to deprive dafna uzyel of the expected appreciation,breaching his duty of loyalty.
the statement of decision stated,t he court finds the evidence insufficient for the court to conclude that kadisha sold the subject shares to hurt dafna.the trial court found that kadisha testimony that he sold the shares pursuant to a investment strategy to acquire more conservative investments and that he believed that holding the stock of a publicly traded company was too risky for the trust was false.the court found,to the contrary,that kadisha was confident that the stock would appreciate and that he retained most of his own qualcomm stock at the time.the court also found that the purported sale of shares of qualcomm stock by trust to trust in october was a phony,backdated transaction,and that the sale actually occurred in april.
the statement of decision stated that it was difficult to determine why kadisha sold the shares and that there was no evidence that he acted as a prudent investor in selling the shares.in its statement of decision,the court stated 
it is difficult to glean just what kadisha had in mind when he made the sale.there is no evidence he considered or complied with probate code section a which provides 
a trustee shall invest and manage trust assets as a prudent investor would,by considering the purposes,terms,distribution requirements and other circumstances of the trust.
there is no evidence kadisha acted as a prudent investor.and he never sought professional advice about the sale.further,the phrase and other circumstances of the trust is of no help to kadisha.
kadisha unacceptable creativity as to the facts as to why he made the sale and what he did by altering the facts concerning the sale are of substantial concern to the court,certainly revealing some sort of character defect but not of such magnitude as to alone give cause for the court to award damages.
the statement of decision,in discussing the award of no compensatory damages on this claim,did not expressly state whether kadisha breached his duty of loyalty by selling the shares,but in later discussing punitive damages the statement of decision twice stated that kadisha sold the shares in april in bad faith.
implied findings support the judgment on this claim 
the uzyels contend the trial court found that kadisha breached his duty of prudent investing and his duty of loyalty in selling the shares of qualcomm stock in april.they argue that they therefore are entitled to an award of lost profits under section,subdivision a in the amount of.
we construe the trial court finding that there was no evidence that kadisha acted as a prudent investor as a finding that he breached his duty of prudent investing.we conclude that the statement of decision can not reasonably be construed to the contrary and that it is unambiguous in this regard the uzyels therefore are entitled to an award of damages under section,subdivision a,unless the court either found that they suffered no damages or found pursuant to section,subdivision b that kadisha acted reasonably and in good faith under the circumstances then known to him and exercised its discretion to excuse him from liability.
the statement of decision,however,did not expressly state that the uzyels suffered no damages as a result of the sale or state what the appropriate measure of liability would be.the question arises whether we can infer findings to support the judgment awarding no damages on this claim.
the uzyels did not assert either before the entry of judgment or in conjunction with a new trial motion or a motion to vacate the judgment that the statement of decision failed to decide whether they suffered any damages as a result of kadisha breach of his duty of prudent investing or that the statement of decision was ambiguous in this regard.they argued in their new trial motion only that the failure to award damages on the claim was error they did not argue that the statement of decision failed to decide the issue or was ambiguous or request clarification of the decision on this issue.we conclude that the statement of decision did not state why no damages were awarded for kadisha breach of his duty of prudent investing,that the omission was not brought to the attention of the trial court either before the entry of judgment or in conjunction with a new trial motion or a motion to vacate the judgment,and that we therefore must infer findings to support the judgment.code civ,in re marriage of arceneaux,supra,cal d at.
the trial court reasonably could have found that the sale of shares of trust qualcomm stock in april resulted in no loss to the trust under section,subdivision a and that an award of the trust lost profits under section,subdivision a was unwarranted.kadisha,as trustee,sold the stock for trust for approximately per share,having purchased it for the trust for per share trust therefore realized a significant gain more than million,rather than a loss,from the sale as of the date of the sale.accordingly,substantial evidence supports the implied finding that trust suffered no loss compensable under section,subdivision a as a result of the sale.moreover,there is no indication that kadisha personally profited from the sale so as to justify an award of the disgorgement of profits under section,subdivision a.
section,subdivision a expressly authorizes the trial court to determine which of the three measures of liability provided under the statute is appropriate under the circumstances.we construe this as a grant of discretion to the trial court and therefore review the trial court selection of the appropriate measure of liability for abuse of discretion.an abuse of discretion occurs only if the reviewing court,considering the applicable law and all of the relevant circumstances,concludes that the trial court decision exceeds the bounds of reason and results in a miscarriage of justice.shamblin brattain,supra,cal d at new albertsons,superior court,supra,th at.in our view,the trial court reasonably could have concluded that,in light of the tremendous appreciation in the value of the stock from the time of its purchase in january until its sale in april,an award of damages under section,subdivision a based on the appreciation of the stock after april was unwarranted.we presume that the trial court so concluded and find no error in this finding.
these same implied findings would support the judgment on this claim whether kadisha breached only his duty of prudent investing or also breached his duty of loyalty,so we need not decide whether the trial court found that kadisha breached his duty of loyalty as well.in light of our conclusion,we need not address kadisha other arguments in support of the judgment on this claim.
the uzyels are entitled to an award of damages resulting from the 
failure to protect the value of trust investment in qualcomm 
stock in and after january 
trial court decision 
the uzyels sought to recover damages for the depreciation in value of shares of trust qualcomm stock from january until kadisha turned over the trust assets to them in september.they argued that kadisha failure to protect their investment from price declines beginning in january was imprudent and that he held the shares rather than sell them in retaliation for this litigation against him.
the statement of decision stated that kadisha breached his duty of prudent investing by failing to diversify trust assets and that he failed to sell the qualcomm stock or take any measures to protect against a loss despite its precipitous decline in value in retaliation for the uzyels having sued him.the trial court found that kadisha breached his duty to preserve the trust assets by failing to take any action after the shares declined in value from at the market closing on january,to at the closing on january,and by failing to take any action thereafter.the court stated that kadisha was a skilled investor who knew how to collar stock,employ a put option,place a order,or take other measures to protect against a price decline.
the statement of decision stated further 
kadisha failure to take advantage of any of the price increases after january,to minimize the beneficiaries losses adds to the deplorability of his conduct rather than excusing it.it also supports the uzyels claim that he was intentionally retaliating against them for suing him.
ordinarily,in cases where the trustee has acted in good faith and with undivided loyalty to the beneficiaries,courts are reluctant to second guess his investment decisions.kadisha was not such a trustee.he never served the interests of the beneficiaries,and his retaliation against them for suing him is just another demonstration of his consistent and overwhelming bad faith.
the statement of decision,as modified on november,awarded the uzyels on this claim,calculated as the difference between the amount the trust would have received if kadisha had sold the shares on january,and the value of the shares on september,when kadisha turned over the shares to the uzyels.the court also awarded prejudgment interest on that amount from september,but later in denying kadisha new trial motion modified the judgment by awarding no prejudgment interest on that amount.
kadisha has shown no error in the award of damages 
kadisha contends trust realized a significant gain on the shares,based on either their original purchase price or their value at the time the trust first took possession of the shares compared with their value on september,when he turned over the trust assets to the uzyels he contends that gain precludes any liability for a loss based on the stock interim value.he cites authorities for the proposition that an investment decision must be evaluated based on the investment performance and that the failure to sell an asset for what in hindsight is later determined to be a high intermediate market price is not imprudent.
the pennsylvania intermediate appellate court in estate of pew,cited by kadisha,held that the propriety of the trustee investment decision must be evaluated based on the performance of the investment and that a decline in value provided no basis for a surcharge when the overall performance was strong.the trust held the stock for years,and the stock had provided income during that period and had appreciated in value by a factor of five by the end of the period,despite a decline in value during the last three years of that period.ibid.estate of pew rejected the argument that the recent decline in value constituted a loss,stating it would be manifestly unfair of this court to permit trust beneficiaries,armed with the vision of hindsight,to focus in upon any short term time period during the course of the trust administration when the price of the stocks forming the trust principal had declined as a basis for subjecting the trustees to a surcharge for failing to sell the stocks,when the overall performance of the same stocks led to a growth in the value of the trust principal.ibid.
the restatement rule is similar.section of the restatement third of trusts prudent investor rule provides that an investment loss resulting from a breach of trust should not be offset against a profit resulting from a separate and distinct breach of trust.but if the trust incurs a loss and also makes a profit as a result of breaches of trust that are not separate and distinct,the trustee liability should be measured by the overall net performance of the investment,including both profits and losses resulting from what is essentially the same breach of trust.section states 
a trustee who is liable for a loss caused by a breach of trust may not reduce the amount of the liability by deducting the amount of a profit that accrued through another and distinct breach of trust but if the breaches of trust are not separate and distinct,the trustee is accountable only for the net gain or chargeable only with the net loss resulting therefrom.
the comments to this section explain that if a trustee incurs a loss and also makes a profit as a result of breaches of trust that are not separate and distinct,the trustee is liable for the net loss calculated by reducing the loss by the amount of the profits.rest d trusts prudent investor rule,coms.d e.whether two or more breaches of trust are separate and distinct depends on factors such as 
whether the breaches of trust are the result of a single policy,judgment,or set of interrelated decisions 
the amount of time elapsing between the breaches of trust and 
whether,between the breaches of trust,the trustee had become aware of the earlier breach,and particularly of a resulting loss or profit.
also properly relevant to the law treatment of multiple breaches may be such factors as 
whether the trustee intended to misappropriate trust property,or intended to commit a breach of trust but not to misappropriate trust property,or had no intention to commit a breach of trust and 
whether the profits and losses from the breaches of trust affect different beneficial interests differently in a way that would have inequitable consequences if gains were to be offset against losses.rest d trusts prudent investor rule,com.f.
comment f states further that no definite rules can be stated as to the relative weight to be given to the different factors,and that the distinction upon which these cases turn is justified primarily by concern that allowing profits to be offset against losses may have a tendency to encourage multiple breaches of trust.rest d trusts prudent investor rule,com.f.
the trial court found that trust initially purchased the qualcomm stock then shares from trust in april.the aggregate value of the shares on that date was approximately million.the evidence suggests that the qualcomm stock then constituted more than of the value of trust assets and that a lack of diversification arose immediately upon trust initial purchase of the stock,although the trial court made no express findings on these issues if kadisha breached his duty of prudent investing by failing to diversify the trust assets upon trust initial purchase of the stock in april,such a breach of trust would be closely related to the failure to diversify the trust assets in january and thereafter.this,together with the relatively short period of time from the initial purchase in april to january,would tend to show that the two breaches of trust were not separate and distinct and that kadisha liability should be limited to the net loss,if any,from the investment 
other circumstances,however,suggest that the breach of trust occurring in january and thereafter was separate and distinct from any prior breach of trust.the trial court found that kadisha breached his duty of prudent investing not only by failing to diversify the trust assets,but also by failing to take any measures to protect the principal at any time during a substantial decline in value beginning in january.despite the dramatic increase in the aggregate value of the shares from approximately million upon trust acquisition of the shares in april to more than million as of the market closing on january,kadisha failed to take any measures to protect the principal from price declines.the court found that kadisha was a skilled investor with the knowledge to employ measures such as a collar,a put option,a order,or other measures to protect against a price decline.kadisha does not contend there was no substantial evidence to support these findings.
we believe that kadisha awareness of the dramatic increase in the value of the stock from april to january distinguishes his failure to employ any of the means available to him to protect the investment in january or thereafter from his prior failure to diversify the trust assets.considering the factors set forth above,we conclude that the breach of trust occurring in january and thereafter was separate and distinct from any prior breach of trust so as to justify holding him liable for the depreciation in value of the trust assets resulting from the later breach.in light of our conclusion,we need not decide whether substantial evidence supports the finding of retaliation.
kadisha also cites in re pate estate,affirmed,and other cases for the proposition that a trustee investment decisions can not be viewed in hindsight.those cases are distinguishable because the trial court here found that kadisha breached his duty to invest prudently based on contemporaneous events and information known to him at the time that he failed to protect the investment.whether the decline in the market value of qualcomm stock beginning in january should have caused kadisha to take measures to protect the value of the trust investment is a question of fact.the uzyels expert,irwin goldring,testified that a prudent trustee would have taken some measures to protect the value of the trust assets in light of the falling market price.kadisha has not shown that the trial court finding in this regard was based on hindsight and has not otherwise shown a lack of substantial evidence to support that finding.
kadisha also contends the award of damages is based on a finding that he had a duty to sell all of the shares on january,and argues that he had no such duty as a matter of law.we believe that this mischaracterizes the trial court decision.the court did not find that kadisha had a duty to sell the shares on january,and breached that duty by failing to sell the shares.instead,the court found that kadisha failure to sell the shares on or after that date or take any measures to preserve the investment was a breach of his duty to invest prudently.kadisha has shown no error in this finding.
the award of damages resulting from kadisha use of trust funds 
to pay for his legal defense includes excessive prejudgment interest 
trial court decision 
the trial court found that kadisha taking of from the trusts to pay his legal fees and his use of an additional from trust for the same purpose were unauthorized and that kadisha failed to return the as ordered by the court.the court rejected kadisha argument that language in our prior opinion precluded an award of prejudgment interest on the deposited in his attorney trust account.the court stated that although we had stated in our opinion that the return of to each trust shall be deemed accomplished as of this date and the funds shall remain on deposit in the bank account of the trustee attorney,the uzyels continued to be deprived of use of the funds and therefore were entitled to prejudgment interest.the court awarded the uzyels on this claim,including with interest from february,until september,plus with interest from january,until september,and also awarded percent prejudgment interest on the from september,until the entry of judgment.
b.the uzyels are not entitled to prejudgment interest at the 
legal rate on the deposited funds after august,
kadisha contends our modification of the appealed orders to state that the return of the shall be deemed accomplished as of this date compels the conclusion that those funds were deemed returned as of august,that the uzyels are not entitled to prejudgment interest at the legal rate on those funds after that date,and that the only prejudgment interest that they are entitled to on those funds after august,is any interest that was actually earned on the deposited funds 
the purpose of the parties stipulation and our opinion was to provide kadisha the same security that an undertaking would have provided,by ensuring that the funds would remain on deposit in his attorney trust account except as authorized by the trial court,while relieving the uzyels of the need to provide an undertaking.the uzyels effectively used the deposited funds as an undertaking.we believe that by agreeing that the funds were deemed returned and accepting the benefits of this arrangement,the uzyels necessarily waived the right to recover prejudgment interest at the legal rate on the deposited funds after august.they are entitled to recover the funds remaining in the attorney trust account as of the date of entry of judgment,including any interest actually accrued on the deposited funds.the uzyels also are entitled to prejudgment interest at the legal rate on the entire from the date of its deposit,february,until august.kadisha concedes that they also are entitled to recover the approximately withdrawn from the attorney trust account from march through july.we agree and also conclude that they are entitled to prejudgment interest on the amount of each withdrawal from the date of the withdrawal until the entry of judgment,under civil code section,subdivision a discussed post 
the uzyels are entitled to prejudgment interest on the award of the 
disgorgement of profits arising from kadisha stock purchase from 
farahnik in may 
trial court decision 
the trial court in its statement of decision awarded the uzyels prejudgment interest from september,at the rate of percent on the award of in the disgorgement of profits arising from kadisha purchase of qualcomm stock from farahnik in may.in denying kadisha new trial motion,the court modified the judgment by reducing the award of to an amount to be determined based on the value of the shares on november,but did not modify the award of prejudgment interest on this claim.the court later reconsidered its ruling on the new trial motion,however,vacating the reduction of the award and denying prejudgment interest.
b.the order denying prejudgment interest is void 
after timely denying the new trial motion and modifying the judgment pursuant to code of civil procedure section in the order of february,the trial court had no jurisdiction to reconsider and amend its modification of the judgment by denying prejudgment interest or to do so after the expiration of the period to rule on the new trial motion,for the reasons stated ante.the order of march,purporting to do so was void.the award of prejudgment interest therefore must be restored

of damages resulting from the sale of trust qualcomm

b.the uzyels are entitled to prejudgment interest on the award 
under civil code section,subdivision a 
the uzyels contend they are entitled to prejudgment interest on the award under civil code section,subdivision a because the amount of damages was capable of being made certain by calculation ibid.on september.
civil code section,subdivision a provides that a party is entitled to recover prejudgment interest on an amount awarded as damages from the date that the amount was both due and owing and certain or capable of being made certain by calculation.koyer detroit ins.cal d,gray bekins cal,see also rest d contracts.the primary purpose of an award of prejudgment interest is to compensate the plaintiff for the loss of use of money during the period before the entry of judgment,in order to make the plaintiff whole.lakin watkins associated industries cal th,lewis nelson sons,clovis unified school dist.th.
damages are certain or capable of being made certain by calculation,or ascertainable,for purposes of civil code section,subdivision a if the defendant actually knows the amount of damages or could compute that amount from information reasonably available to the defendant.kgm harvesting fresh network th.a readily ascertainable market value can satisfy this requirement.cassinos union oil th.in contrast,damages that must be judicially determined based on conflicting evidence are not ascertainable.lineman schmid cal d,fireman fund ins.allstate ins.d.a legal dispute concerning the defendant liability or uncertainty concerning the measure of damages does not render damages unascertainable.olson cory cal d,shell oil national union fire ins.th.on appeal,we independently determine whether damages are ascertainable for purposes of the statute.kgm harvesting,supra,th at.
the trial court calculated damages on this claim as the difference between the market value of shares of qualcomm stock at the time of the termination of the trusts based on their lowest market price between september and,and the value of the proceeds of the sale of shares in may augmented by interest on those proceeds from the date of the sale until september.both the market value of shares at the time of the trusts termination and the value of the sale proceeds were ascertainable by kadisha on september.we conclude that the uzyels are entitled to prejudgment interest on the damages award pursuant to civil code section,subdivision a,from september,in light of our conclusion,we need not address their alternative argument that they are entitled to prejudgment interest under civil code section.
we reject kadisha argument that discrepancies between the damages awarded by the court and amounts previously stated by the uzyels in interrogatory responses or requested at trial compel the conclusion that the damages were not ascertainable.a large discrepancy between the amount demanded and the amount awarded indicates that damages were not ascertainable if the discrepancy results from the resolution of factual disputes arising from conflicting evidence or the lack of factual information needed to readily calculate damages.wisper california commerce bank th,polster,swing d.that was not the case here.
conderback,standard oil d,cited by kadisha,is distinguishable.the calculation of damages accepted by the jury in that case involved the application of a pricing formula and negotiations between the parties,all in accordance with a prior course of dealing id.at,apparently requiring the resolution of factual disputes.moreover,conderback stated that the invoices and other records provided to the defendant failed to provide sufficient information to enable the defendant to ascertain the exact amount due.id.at.here,in contrast,the amount due could be computed from information reasonably available to kadisha,as we have stated.
the uzyels cite no authority and offer no argument in support of awarding prejudgment interest at the rate of percent,as requested in their opening brief on appeal.the proper rate of prejudgment interest awardable under civil code section,subdivision a in these circumstances is percent.cal,continental airlines,mcdonnell douglas d.
section,subdivision a does not preclude 
prejudgment interest 
kadisha argues that section,subdivision a describes the circumstances in which prejudgment interest on a monetary award for breach of trust is,and is not,available.he argues that the inclusion of the words with interest in subdivision a and,contrasted with the absence of those words in subdivision a,indicates that prejudgment interest is not available under subdivision a on an award of damages for lost profits to the trust estate resulting from a breach of trust.
section,subdivision a expressly provides for prejudgment interest on an award of a ny loss or depreciation in value of the trust estate resulting from the breach of trust or a ny profit made by the trustee through the breach of trust,subd.a.subdivision a,however,authorizes an award of a ny profit that would have accrued to the trust estate if the loss of profit is the result of the breach of trust,with no mention of interest.section states that the provisions for a trustee liability for breach of trust under sections and do not preclude any other remedy available under the statutory or common law.
section,subdivision a states that if the trustee is liable for interest pursuant to section,the interest rate is the greater of the legal rate of interest on judgments at the time or the amount of interest actually received the legal rate of interest on judgments is percent.code civ,subd.a.the legal rate of interest on an obligation before the entry of judgment is percent,unless otherwise specified by statute.cal,continental airlines,mcdonnell douglas,supra,d at.thus,one effect of the express provision for interest on an award authorized by section,subdivision a or is to ensure that the prejudgment interest rate on such an award is percent rather than percent.moreover,subdivision a and authorizes prejudgment interest on such an award without the need to show that the amount was certain or capable of being made certain by calculation,as would be required under civil code section,subdivision a.
in light of section,and considering the differences between an award of prejudgment interest under section,subdivision a and an award of prejudgment interest under civil code section,subdivision a,we conclude that the omission of the words with interest in section,subdivision a was not intended to,and does not,preclude an award of prejudgment interest under civil code section,subdivision a.
the uzyels are entitled to prejudgment interest on the award of 
damages resulting from the failure to protect the value of trust 
investment in qualcomm stock in and after january 
trial court decision 
the trial court in its statement of decision,as modified on november,awarded the uzyels prejudgment interest at the rate of percent on the in compensatory damages arising from kadisha failure to protect the value of trust investment in qualcomm stock in and after january.in denying kadisha new trial motion,however,the court modified the judgment by denying prejudgment interest on the award.the court later explained that it had denied prejudgment interest in equity so as to avoid an undue penalty.
b.the uzyels are entitled to prejudgment interest on the award 
under section,subdivision a 
the uzyels contend they are entitled to prejudgment interest on the award under section,subdivision a.they argue that the damages are for the loss or depreciation in value of the trust estate resulting from a breach of trust,as described in the statute,and that prejudgment interest is mandatory on such an award absent grounds to excuse the trustee from liability,in whole or in part,pursuant to subdivision b.
section,subdivision a authorizes an award of a ny loss or depreciation in value of the trust estate resulting from the breach of trust,with interest.italics added.the plain statutory language suggests that an award of damages under this provision must include prejudgment interest.the legislative history supports this interpretation.the california law revision commission report to the legislature recommending the trust law stated that the proposed law would establish a uniform rule that the trustee is liable for interest in any case where there is a breach resulting in a loss or depreciation of the trust estate or in profit to the trustee.recommendation proposing the trust law cal.law revision com.moreover,the reference in section to a trustee liab ility for interest pursuant to section also suggests that section establishes a trustee liability for interest and does not merely refer to liability established under some other statute,as kadisha argues.
we conclude that the award of in damages arising from kadisha failure to protect the value of trust investment in qualcomm stock in and after january is an award of damages for the depreciation in value of the trust estate resulting from a breach of trust,subd.a and that the uzyels are entitled to prejudgment interest on the award at the rate of percent,subd.a,from september,pursuant to section,subdivision a in light of our conclusion,we need not address the uzyels alternative argument that they are entitled to prejudgment interest under civil code section.
the parties have shown no error in the punitive damages award 
kadisha contends the award of million in punitive damages will be constitutionally excessive if he successfully obtains the reversal of all of the compensatory damages and monetary awards that he challenges on appeal.we need not address this contention further because its predicate has not occurred,and the compensatory award will far exceed the amount of punitive damages awarded.
the uzyels contend the award of punitive damages is inadequate as a matter of law under california law because,considering the reprehensibility of kadisha conduct,the amount of the compensatory award,and kadisha wealth,the million punitive damages award is inadequate to serve the purposes of punishment and deterrence as a matter of law.we disagree.
a plaintiff is never entitled to punitive damages as a matter of right.brewer second baptist church cal d,brewer.whether to award punitive damages if the requirements of civil code section,subdivision a are satisfied and the amount of such an award are questions committed to the trier of fact.brewer,supra,at hannon engineering,reim d.accordingly,we conclude that the uzyels can not show that the award is legally inadequate.
the uzyels also argue that any increase in the compensatory award,including prejudgment interest,will require a reversal and redetermination of the award of punitive damages.we likewise disagree with that contention.if the reversal of part of a compensatory award renders the punitive damages excessive,the award of punitive damages should be reversed for a redetermination of punitive damages in light of the reduced compensatory award.ramona manor convalescent hospital care enterprises d.the reason for this is to ensure a reasonable relationship between the compensatory award and the amount of punitive damages.ibid.if an appeal results in an increase in the compensatory award,however,the plaintiff is not entitled to a reversal of the punitive damages award to keep pace with that increase.the rule that exemplary damages must bear a reasonable relation to actual damages citations is designed solely to guard against excessive punitive damages.citation.brewer,supra,cal d at accord,torres automobile club of california cal th.absent a showing of error in the award of punitive damages,we conclude that any increase in the compensatory award as a result of this appeal can not justify a reversal of the punitive damages award.
the attorney fee award was unauthorized 
trial court decision 
the trial court awarded the uzyels in attorney fees under section,subdivision b,which provides for an award of attorney fees and litigation expenses in favor of a beneficiary who contests the trustee account if the court determines that the trustee opposition to the contest was without reasonable cause and in bad faith.section,subdivision b states 
if a beneficiary contests the trustee account and the court determines that the trustee opposition to the contest was without reasonable cause and in bad faith,the court may award the contestant the costs of the contestant and other expenses and costs of litigation,including attorney fees,incurred to contest the account.the amount awarded shall be a charge against the compensation or other interest of the trustee in the trust.the trustee shall be personally liable and on the bond,if any,for any amount that remains unsatisfied.
the trial court concluded that this proceeding involved a contest of an account within the meaning of the statute the court stated further that kadisha had reasonable cause to oppose the contest only if a reasonable attorney knowing the facts known to kadisha at the time of his opposition would have believed that his opposition to each claim was legally tenable.
the trial court found that at the time he opposed the uzyels claims in this litigation,kadisha knew the pertinent facts relating to his misappropriations of trust funds,his preparation of fraudulent accountings to conceal his misappropriations,his failure to administer the trusts in the interests of the beneficiaries,his failure to invest prudently,and other misconduct.the court stated that kadisha also knew that to prevent the court from discovering his wrongdoings,he would have to commit and suborn perjury.the court concluded that no reasonable attorney knowing those facts would have believed that kadisha could be exonerated if the facts were presented in a truthful manner.the statement of decision stated 
no reasonable attorney could believe that presenting the facts outlined above in a way that is consistent with the truth could result in kadisha exoneration on any legal ground.and no reasonable attorney could have put kadisha and his witnesses on the stand knowing that they would have to give untrue testimony as they did in order to provide a defense.in addition,a reasonable attorney would have known that if the court did not believe kadisha or his witnesses,it could disregard all of their testimony as the court has done,and that,as a result,kadisha would have no evidence to support his opposition.in short,no reasonable attorney could have believed that an opposition based on false testimony was legally tenable.since no reasonable attorney would have thought kadisha opposition legally tenable,the court finds that kadisha opposition was unreasonable.
the trial court also found that kadisha had opposed the contest in bad faith because he conducted his defense primarily for an improper purpose.
kadisha had reasonable cause to defend this litigation 
kadisha contends the uzyels are not entitled to an award of attorney fees under section,subdivision b because his opposition to their claims was not without reasonable cause.he argues that a trustee opposition to a beneficiary contest of an account is without reasonable cause only if no reasonable attorney would have opposed the contest.he also argues that he successfully defended several claims seeking,in aggregate,more money than the uzyels were awarded on their successful claims.
section,subdivision b authorizes an award of attorney fees and litigation expenses in favor of a beneficiary who contests the trustee account if the trustee opposition to the contest was without reasonable cause and in bad faith.ibid.reasonable cause,when used with reference to the prosecution of a claim,ordinarily is synonymous with probable cause as used in the malicious prosecution context kobzoff los angeles county medical center cal th,kobzoff construing reasonable cause in code civ,subd.a.

the question here is the meaning of reasonable cause with reference to the defense,rather than the prosecution,of a proceeding.contrary to the trial court,we believe that reasonable cause in this context does not require an objectively reasonable belief,based on the facts then known to the trustee,that the trustee would be completely exonerated.instead,we believe that reasonable cause to oppose a contest of an account requires an objectively reasonable belief,based on the facts then known to the trustee,either that the claims are legally or factually unfounded or that the petitioner is not entitled to the requested remedies.conversely,there would be no reasonable cause to oppose a contest of an account only if all reasonable attorneys would have agreed that the opposition was totally without merit,or,in other words,no reasonable attorney would have believed that the opposition had any merit.as with probable cause,we independently review the trial court finding on the existence of reasonable cause absent any factual dispute as to kadisha knowledge at the time.kobzoff,supra,cal th at but see guardianship of th,applying the abuse of discretion standard to findings under section that objections to an account were without reasonable cause and in bad faith.
kadisha successfully opposed several substantial claims in the trial court,including claims for the disgorgement of profits earned on shares that he purchased in august and september,damages for the misappropriation of trust funds,lost profits resulting from the sale of trust qualcomm stock in april,and other claims.his successful opposition to those claims shows that he had reasonable cause to oppose them.moreover,the claims on which kadisha did not avoid liability presented questions concerning the existence of liability,measure of damages,or amount of disgorgement that were at least arguable.our review of the award of the disgorgement of profits arising from kadisha stock purchase from farahnik in may,the award of lost profits resulting from the sale of trust qualcomm stock in may,and the award of lost profits resulting from his failure to protect trust investment in qualcomm stock in and after january has revealed substantial questions concerning the existence or amount of liability on those claims we conclude that kadisha had reasonable cause to defend against the uzyels claims in this proceeding and that they are not entitled to an award of attorney fees under section,subdivision b
