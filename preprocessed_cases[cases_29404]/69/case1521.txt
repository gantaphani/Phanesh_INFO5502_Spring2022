the united states appeals from a decision of the united states court of federal claims that awarded million in damages,plus interest,to sufi network services,for breach of contract.sufi network,united states,fed.cl.sufi,seeking additional damages.we affirm in part,reverse in part,vacate in part,and remand.
background 
on april,the air force non appropriated funds purchasing office air force entered into a contract with sufi,under which sufi would install and operate telephone systems in guest lodgings on certain air force bases in europe.sufi agreed to furnish and install the necessary equipment,including cables and switches,and to operate the systems once installed,at no cost to the government in exchange,the air force agreed that a sufi telephone system sufi network was to be the exclusive method available to a guest for placing telephone calls at the lodging.br.for appellant at.exclusivity was central to the bargain because sufi sole compensation for its investments and operational costs was a portion of the revenues generated by local and telephone charges paid by guests when making calls to locations.the contract originally had a term but in march was extended to fifteen years.
soon after sufi began offering service in january,disputes arose about the air force role in not protecting sufi,under the exclusivity guarantee,against the diversion of calls from sufi systems.it is not disputed here that the contract permitted sufi to block access to other carriers networks for instance,by blocking access to calling cards and required the air force to remove or disable any preexisting defense switched network dsn telephone lines in the lodging hallways and lobbies.nevertheless,dsn phones remained in place after january,and lodging guests began engaging in toll skipping,often with the assistance of air force personnel guests avoided sufi charges by using dsn phones or,when using sufi phones,by engaging a dsn operator or other air force agent to patch a call through to a destination or to the number of another longdistance carrier.moreover,although sufi and the air force agreed to permit soldiers on temporary duty to be patched through to numbers for periodic morale calls of limited duration and frequency,call records showed that,with air force assistance,guests often exceeded the limits,placing multiple consecutive calls or lengthy individual calls.
after the air force declined to implement adequate controls to curb dsn and abuse,sufi blocked access to the dsn operator numbers but permitted morale calls to be placed from designated lobby phones,the latter under air force monitoring through logs.but air force personnel failed to require guests to sign the logs and,in addition,gave guests new access numbers to reach the dsn operator,thereby helping them to circumvent sufi charges.
guest use of calling cards also presented problems under the contract.on june,the parties agreed to modify the contract with respect to charges for calls.modification states 
toll free calls connection fee.some international toll free calls may be subject to billing,for example,international toll free calls to other countries,where a host nation passes along a charge,will be subject to contractor standard per minute charge for that country.
see sufi network,asbca,bca at,sufi i quoting provision.on november,the air force cited modification as authority to open toll free calls,to include calling cards at the connection fee,and ordered sufi to remove all restrictions on toll free calling.id.sufi was forced to comply with the demand for about six months in.
in response,sufi challenged the air force interpretation of modification and asked the contracting officer to decide whether modification or any other part of the contract requires sufi to remove restrictions on calls accessing other carriers.id.sufi also asked the officer to decide whether the air force directive that sufi remove such restrictions would constitute a material breach of contract that permit s sufi to cancel the contract and stop work.id.the contracting officer issued a final decision denying sufi claims on january.on sufi appeal pursuant to the contract disputes clause,however,the armed services board of contract appeals board concluded otherwise.the board held that sufi could not be required to remove restrictions on calls,that the government breached the contract in its order regarding calls,that the breach was material,and that sufi could therefore stop performance of the contract.sufi network,asbca,bca at,sufi ii sufi network,asbca,bca at,sufi iii.
on august,sufi notified the contracting officer that it intended to stop work on the contract,but would negotiate with the air force over transitional measures to minimize inconvenience to guests.ultimately,sufi,while maintaining its claims for breach of contract,sold the telephone system to the air force for million.the air force took over operation of the telephone system on june.
one month later,sufi submitted monetary claims,totaling million,to the contracting officer.the officer denied all of the claims,except that he allowed sufi on its claim.sufi appealed to the board,which granted only partial relief to sufi,on of the claims,in a series of decisions between and.the board final award was approximately million in damages,plus interest.
sufi challenged the board decisions in the court of federal claims by filing a contract action under the tucker act.the parties do not dispute that the tucker act covers sufi claims.nor do they dispute that judicial review of sufi claims under the tucker act is governed by the wunderlich act,now repealed.see vista scientific united states.
sufi did not challenge the board ruling on some claims,which accounted for approximately million in damages,plus interest.that amount became final.sufi challenged the board ruling regarding a number of claims,moving for judgment on the administrative record count i calling cards count iii hallway and lobby dsn phones count v other operator numbers and patching count vi early dsn abuse count vii delta squadron count viii prime knight lodgings count ix kapaun line charge count xi german troops housing count xv general lack of cooperation count xvi posttermination lost profits count xviii interfaces and count xxiii change of air force switches.
on november,the court of federal claims granted sufi motion.the court awarded sufi damages of,plus interest,for the claims that were appealed mostly representing lost profits both before termination of the contract and after termination.sufi network,fed.cl.at.that award was more than million greater than the board award on the same claims.id.
the united states appeals the increased award.it accepts that it is liable for breach of contract,appealing only with regard to the amount of damages.sufi crossappeals,seeking additional damages.we have jurisdiction under a.
discussion 
we review the board decision in this case under the wunderlich act,previously codified at.although the act has been repealed,the repeal does not affect this case involving judicial review of an administrative decision in a case that the parties agree is within the tucker act and outside the contract disputes act because sufi initiated these proceedings at the board before the repeal,stat.
under the wunderlich act,the board decision shall be final and conclusive unless the same is fra u dulent or capricious or arbitrary or so grossly erroneous as necessarily to imply bad faith,or is not supported by substantial evidence,and n o government contract shall contain a provision making final on a question of law the decision of any administrative official,representative,or board,id.although cases subject to the act involve contract disputes,the judicial proceeding is one of judicial review of agency action.as relevant here,in applying the express statutory standard,we,like the court of federal claims,decide legal issues de novo,review the board factual findings for lack of substantial evidence,and ensure that the board reasoning was not capricious or arbitrary.see granite const.united states.
the corollaries for issues that involve factual findings and record evidence are familiar.in united states carlo bianchi,the supreme court held that a court reviewing a wunderlich act case is limited to the administrative record and may not take new evidence.shortly thereafter,the court clarified that,w hen the board fails to reach and decide an issue because it disposes of the appeal on another ground,the reviewing court,if it later rejects the reliedon ground,should generally order a remand for the board to address the issue it had not reached before judicial review.united states anthony grace sons,see wilner united states,bennett,dissenting stating that bianchi required the court of claims to remand cases back to the agency board whenever additional findings of fact became necessary.on the other hand,a remand to the board is sometimes unnecessary not only where the dispute turns only on legal issues,but even where a factual dispute exists if no further record development is appropriate and the fact is one as to which the evidence is undisputed or is of such a nature that as a matter of law the board could have made only one finding of fact.maxwell dynamometer united states,no remand necessary see collins int l serv.united states,t he claims court may make findings of fact in this type of case under the wunderlich act where the evidence on the record is uncontroverted or undisputed.
we conclude that several matters require additional factual findings.none of those matters fall within exceptions to the general rule of remand to the board on factual matters.nor is this a case in which we conclude that the board will not promptly and fairly deal with the merits of the undecided issue.anthony grace,at.thus,any new factual findings that are required should be made by the board.
burden of proof 
before discussing the substance of particular damages issues,we address whether the board properly allocated the burden of proof regarding certain issues that arose in assessing damages.as the party seeking damages for breach in the form of lost profits,sufi must prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that 
the loss it claims was the proximate result of the breach the loss of profits caused by the breach was within the contemplation of the parties because the loss was foreseeable or because the defaulting party had knowledge of special circumstances at the time of contracting and a sufficient basis exists for estimating the amount of lost profits with reasonable certainty.
energy capital united states,see cal.fed.bank,fsb united states.where a defendant argues that,even had there been no breach,there would have been some impediment to the plaintiff ability to make a profit,the defendant must point out the alleged impediment,but t he burden of proof on the issue of causation in a case remains on the plaintiff without regard to the nature of the impediment that the plaintiff would have had to overcome in the nonbreach world to make a profit.nycal offshore dev.united states.that principle is not altered by the accommodation of reasonable imprecision in the plaintiff quantification of damages that would compensate for proven loss,see id.at,or by rules about offsets of retained benefits in cases involving damages unlike the lostprofits damages sought here,westfed holdings,united states,caroline hunt trust estate united states.
here,sufi claims as lost profits an amount that represented what it would have earned if subject to certain qualifications every call that was in fact placed on alternative networks in the actual,breach world had instead been placed on sufi network and gone on for just as long in the hypothetical,nonbreach world.the government claims that,due to sufi high calling rates,guests would have placed fewer and shorter calls on sufi network had they been unable to use the alternative networks.the court of federal claims mischaracterized this dispute as raising an issue on which the government bore the burden of proof.sufi network,fed.cl.at.once the government identified alleged impediments to the claimed amount of lost profits,sufi had the burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that its high rates would not have prevented it from earning the profits it claims and to quantify the amount by a reasonably certain estimate.
although the board did not err in placing the burden on sufi to prove its damages,in some instances,as we will discuss,the board erred because it rejected sufi calculations in favor of ones that were not supported by substantial evidence.in other instances,sufi has not demonstrated that the board decision lacked substantial evidentiary support.
count i calling cards 
sufi claimed close to million in damages from the government breach in requiring sufi to allow guests to use calling cards from february to august which,sufi alleged,diminished the total number of call minutes guests paid sufi for.sufi network,asbca,bca at,sufi viii.sufi methodology was to multiply the usage minutes by sufi rate,and then to subtract costs it would have incurred had the calls been made on its network and revenues it actually received from the minutes.id.the board declined to adopt this methodology,which counted all minutes as minutes that would have been spent on sufi network without this breach.id.at.instead,the board compared sufi monthly revenues before february,before sufi lost revenues due to the breach with revenues during the februaryaugust period of use and a period of transition back to blocking.id.the board method resulted in in lost revenues,which it awarded as damages along with a small additional amount that is not material here.id.
despite the large gap between sufi claimed losses and what the board calculated,sufi has failed to show that the board methodology was not supported by substantial evidence.sufi scarcely discusses this matter in its brief,relying entirely on the criticism of the board by the court of federal claims,which reasoned that the records of calls placed via calling cards were the best evidence of sufi losses and that,because sufi was experiencing a multitude of other breaches simultaneously,it would be impossible to isolate the calling card breach using the board methodology.sufi network,fed.cl.at.but the court of federal claims did not cite any evidence to indicate that the losses due to other breaches so changed during the comparison periods that it was unreasonable to use the comparison to estimate the losses attributable to usage alone.under a standard,sufi has shown no reason that this kind of event study was impermissible,especially when coupled with plausible questions,given the price differences,about whether the calls guests placed using calling cards are the best evidence of the revenues sufi would have earned in the nonbreach world.
because we can not agree that the board methodology was unsupported by substantial evidence or was otherwise not in accordance with the law,its damages calculation with respect to lost revenues attributable to usage should stand.accordingly,we reverse the court of federal claims on this issue.
count iii hallway and lobby dsn phones 
in calculating lost profits resulting from the air force failure to remove hallway and lobby dsn phones,which siphoned calls from room phones on sufi network,sufi relied on the use of surrogate phone records to estimate how many calls were placed on those improperly retained phones.because of the government loss of call records for most of the dsn phones in question,sufi had records only of the dates particular dsn phones were in service,not of the actual calls placed on most of the phones.sufi network,fed.cl.at sufi viii at.given the limited data available,sufi turned to certain phones for which complete call records were available namely,certain lobby phones that it operated,which had worldwide dsn access.sufi viii at.sufi then chose the surrogate phone with the lowest monthly usage in order to be conservative and multiplied that monthly usage by the number of months each dsn phone was in service when it should not have been.id.at.sufi used that calculation to estimate the profits it would have earned had the calls placed from the dsn phones instead been placed from sufi phones and lasted as long.sufi excluded only an amount estimated to reflect local calls on those dsn phones,for which sufi would not have levied a charge even if placed from phones because sufi provided local dsn access for free.sufi network,asbca,bca at july,sufi ix.
although sufi methodology resulted in million in alleged losses,the board found only million in losses.id.the board approach seemingly rested on two premises.one was that sufi surrogate phones were not dsn phones and their call records were not probative of the claimed lost revenue from calls on the dsn phones.id.the other which is not entirely explicit or clear in its foundation was that,under its contract,sufi could not and therefore would not have charged for guests dialing of the air force operator to obtain dsn access to make any official call,even a as opposed to local call.see id.at.on that apparent premise,any official call minutes spent on the improper dsn phones did not count toward calculating profits sufi would have earned in the absence of those phones,because sufi could not have charged for those minutes if the caller had spent them in calls made from the sufi phones.
instead of adopting sufi methodology,the board reviewed of the minutes for the dsn phones for which call records were available,and determined that of those minutes were during other than normal duty hours at the locations called,and therefore more likely than not to have been calls.id.at.extrapolating from this percentage,the board ultimately tallied about million minutes as a fair and reasonable approximation of the number of minutes of the calls that in the absence of the dsn phones would have been placed over the sufi phones.id.the board multiplied that number of minutes by sufi profit of about,and made certain adjustments,to arrive at its million damages award for count iii.
we agree with sufi and the court of federal claims that the board erred in determining sufi lost profits for count iii.first,the board failed to consider whether an adverse inference should be drawn against the government on the issue of the missing call records,as the air force failed to maintain the records even though it was on notice of this potential contract dispute.see bigelow rko radio pictures,the most elementary conceptions of justice and public policy require that the wrongdoer shall bear the risk of the uncertainty which his own wrong has created in a variety of cases,the wrongdoer may not object to the plaintiff reasonable estimate because not based on more accurate data which the wrongdoer misconduct has rendered unavailable.
moreover,the board did not cite to substantial evidence to justify its own methodology for count iii unlike for count i.even without regard to questions about the premise that sufi could not charge for any official inroom dsn call,whether local or longdistance,the board did not set forth substantial evidence to support,or reasonably justify,the crucial premise for its discarding of the calls on dsn phones namely,that all minutes of all calls made during normal business hours were official and thus not ones sufi would have been able to charge for in the absence of the dsn phones.that idea is so far from that it can not be adopted without substantial record support and reasoned consideration of the pertinent evidence.the board opinions are inadequate on this crucial point in this dispute.among other things,the board has not adequately addressed sufi submission that guests could obtain air force reimbursement for legitimate official calls made from their rooms,which might suggest that resort to the dsn phones was in large part for nonofficial calls.
the board also provided inadequate support for its rejection of sufi core contention that a reasonable estimate of the number of additional minutes it would have had on its network,but for the air force improper maintenance of the dsn phones,was the number of minutes those phones were used reasonably estimated.the board adverted in passing to,though did not rely on,the idea that the personal cost to the caller of using the sufi phones would have led to fewer minutes than minutes,sufi ix at.the proposition that purchases fall as prices rise certainly is true within a very wide range of circumstances.but the particular circumstances at issue can matter,and the board here did not analyze the distinctive circumstances of the present case.it did not attempt to assess the magnitude of any effect or,more basically,consider all relevant record facts that might affect whether,in this context,it might even be the case that,on balance,fewer minutes were spent on calls than would have been spent on calls made from guest rooms in the absence of phones,despite the higher cost of calls.there is record evidence that,dsn phones being few in number,long lines formed for use of some of those telephones,which might have created pressure for callers to cut calls short moreover,the telephones afforded little if any privacy.the board did not examine this and possibly other evidence to set forth a sound basis for rejecting the number of minutes of calls placed on the surrogate dsn phones as a reasonable estimate of the measure of minutes lost to sufi.
the board rationale is deficient for the foregoing reasons,even without regard to the soundness of the board apparent premise that sufi could not charge for access to the dsn for official calls.for these reasons,we agree with the court of federal claims that the board erred in determining the damages for count iii.under the wunderlich act,this count should be remanded to the board for reconsideration,not independently adjudicated in the courts.and in that reconsideration,the board should more squarely review the legal and evidentiary basis of its apparent premise about official dsn calls than it has yet done.the board opinions addressing that issue,and the parties briefs on it,leave the matter unclear.whether or not we could decide this in the first instance,we think it advisable for the board,and the parties,to address it more fully and clearly first,given that we order a remand on count iii in any event.we vacate the court of federal claims ruling on this issue and order it remanded to the board for those purposes.
the remand relating to this count should also encompass several issues sufi has raised in its.principally,sufi contends that the board erred in setting the date from which interest should run on its damages for count iii.it is undisputed that under a partial settlement agreement,sufi is entitled to interest from the date it actually incurred its damages.sufi network,asbca,bca at,sufi x.to simplify the required computation for count iii,sufi asked the board to use the weighted midpoint of the dates it incurred its damages,accounting for the fact that damages on count iii were,more damages were incurred earlier than later,because at some point during the damages period,the air force removed some of the breaching phones.sufi network,asbca,bca at,sufi xi.
the board initially selected june,as the starting date for interest on damages a date the board identified as the approximate of the dsn call data from september through may,the period for which sufi claimed damages,sufi x at.sufi then asked the board to reconsider its decision,urging that a weighted midpoint of march,be set or,at a minimum,the unweighted midpoint of march.sufi xi at.in response,the board stated that it was not persuaded to calculate a weighted midpoint,inconsistent with the unweighted midpoints we used in our prior decisions,but would correct the unweighted midpoint from june,to march,as sufi alternatively requested.id.
when sufi challenged the rejection of the march date in the court of federal claims,that court rejected the challenge because sufi actually proposed march,to the board as an alternative.sufi network,fed.cl.at.we see no sound basis for that ruling,because sufi preserved its argument for the weighted midpoint by making that argument to the board.on the merits,moreover,the board gave little explanation for rejecting the weighted midpoint,citing only its desire for consistency with prior decisions.we conclude,therefore,that when the board reconsiders count iii,as we require,it should also reconsider its rejection of the starting date for interest on damages.and at the same time,the board should address sufi evidence to correct the ramstein building dsn phone start date from october to october and evidence to correct the average monthly rate to minutes per month.sufi viii at.
count v other operator numbers and patching 
before october,sufi agreed to carry morale calls free of charge.sufi viii at.in october,sufi added to its switches two dsn access numbers for soldiers to use for these calls,which were supposed to be limited to minutes per soldier every two weeks.id.sufi monitoring revealed calls up to three hours long and multiple consecutive calls from the same guest room sufi records showed that guests exceeded limits by minutes hours and minutes in the first three months of alone.id.sufi responded by blocking the specially established telephone numbers,but air force personnel made other local dsn numbers available to circumvent the block another breach of contract.id.at.sufi identified direct and indirect dsn access numbers to which or more calls of at least minutes were placed,while the record showed that the average length of a dsn call from a location thus,more likely to be official in nature was just under minutes.id.at.in seeking damages for this breach by the government,sufi asked for compensation for each minute of all calls that lasted at least minutes on the identified lines.id.at.
the board rejected sufi methodology because sufi failed to show that the calls in question were not patched through to local numbers,rather than to numbers.id.at to the extent any such calls,even if,were to local phone numbers,they did not circumvent sufi commercial long distance phone network or result in any lost revenues thereby.except for morale calls,this evidentiary lacuna is fatal to sufi proof of liability for lost revenues.for that reason the board awarded damages only for the of excess minutes for which sufi produced records.id.
we agree with sufi that the board determination on count v is not supported by substantial evidence.even if sufi did not carry its burden to prove that all of the calls in question were calls,there was no basis for the board conclusion that none of the calls could be counted towards sufi recovery.but the court of federal claims erred in making its own factual finding on this issue.sufi network,fed.cl.at.we vacate that ruling and order a remand to the board for reconsideration of whether sufi evidence provided a reasonably certain estimate a fair and reasonable approximation of damages from this breach.see national australia bk.united states,bluebonnet sav.bk.united states.
count vi early dsn abuse 
in mid,pursuant to its contract,sufi provided guests at the ramstein military base with the ability to use the telephone to obtain access to the dsn,including the ability to make local calls directly over that network.sufi viii at.but according to its later evidence,sufi soon concluded that the dsn access was being used for calls,made through dsn air force operators.id.sufi representative testified that he observed a reduction in calls over the sufi network after the ramstein introduction of dsn access,with a pattern of long calls lasting up to four hours to the dsn information operator.id.when it then blocked access to the dsn operator numbers,sufi submitted,its call revenues returned to normal.id.
the board analyzed sufi revenues for the period in question,but did not find the recollection of sufi representative to be substantiated.id.at.on the contrary,the board found that sufi average monthly revenues increased,rather than decreased,after sufi began providing dsn service.id.accordingly,it held that sufi had not established that alleged dsn abuse caused a reduction in its long distance call revenues and denied any relief on count vi.id.
the court of federal claims reversed the board on the ground that t here were multiple other breach factors affecting sufi monthly revenues,and it is incorrect to rely upon the monthly averages as if this breach were the only one in play.sufi network,fed.cl.at.for the same reasons we have given in discussing count i,we do not agree that the board methodology comparing pre and revenues lacks substantial evidence.accordingly,we reverse the court of federal claims on count vi with respect to lost profits.
sufi also sought damages,under count vi,to compensate it for extra work it had to perform,and costs it incurred,in addressing the dsn abuse involving air force operators.the board did not address these claims.sufi viii at.on appeal,the government evidently concedes liability for extra work and costs under at least the far changes fixed price aug clause,incorporated into the contract,see sufi i at.but it contends that the board should be the one to calculate the amounts due in the first instance.we agree.although we do not disturb the board findings with respect to lost profits,we vacate the court of federal claims ruling on count vi in this respect and order a remand for the board to determine sufi and damages for count vi.
count vii delta squadron 
one of the buildings covered by sufi contract a lodging facility at sembach air force base housed the administrative,maintenance,and transportation personnel for the delta squadron before sufi began service,five or six dsn telephones were available in the building for all delta squadron personnel to use.sufi viii at.sufi requested the removal of those phones,as they were inside a lodging facility,contrary to the contract,and the phones were eventually removed.id.as to the last two such phones,the board findings and the record presented to us are unclear,but it appears that the air force agreed to the removal only if sufi replaced those phones with its own.in april,sufi installed two of its own phones in the delta squadron lounge,to be used subject to monitoring only for expedited access to the guest rooms of delta squadron personnel and for morale calls to outside numbers.id.call records revealed,however,that much of the use fell outside those limits.id.when sufi complained to air force personnel regarding the abuse and threatened to remove the phones,sufi was told that,if it did so,the delta squadron commander would order his troops not to use sufi room phones.id.
the board awarded sufi lost profits for the phones,but awarded no damages for abuse of the phones,because it found that sufi waited from april until june to threaten to remove those phones and found no government breach regarding the phones.id.at.the board later corrected its findings to reflect that sufi first threatened to remove the phones on or about august,but did not otherwise alter its holding.sufi ix at.
the circumstances under which sufi replaced the last two government dsn phones with its own phones are material to whether the board determination was supported by substantial evidence,but the record is incomplete on this issue.the board did not discuss the evidence regarding the government alleged initial refusal to remove the phones or eventual agreement to removal only if sufi replaced them with its own phones.although the court of federal claims seems to have concluded that the government conceded sufi crucial factual allegations,sufi network,fed.cl.at,it is not clear to us from the record that there are government concessions sufficient to make further factual findings unnecessary.
we therefore vacate the court of federal claims ruling on this issue and order the issue remanded to the board for further findings.the board should consider what the government has conceded and make factual findings regarding the circumstances surrounding sufi installation and maintenance of the two delta squadron phones.if sufi installed and maintained those phones only under threats that breached the contract,the board rationale for denying recovery for losses caused by the presence of the phones can not stand.in singling out that scenario for comment,we do not constrain the inquiry on remand.
count viii prime knight lodgings 
unlike the other lodgings sufi served,the prime knight lodging facilities at ramstein had dsn phones in the guest rooms,with worldwide service,before sufi contract with the air force.sufi viii at.although the contract provided that these phones were to be replaced with sufi phones once sufi began service,the air force refused to remove the phones until shortly after september,twenty months after sufi began service at ramstein.id.at.there is no dispute on appeal that the air force breached the contract by refusing to remove the phones.sufi network,fed.cl.at.
sufi estimated that it lost about per month in revenues because of the government breach,then multiplied that figure by the duration of the breach to arrive at a total of in claimed damages.sufi viii at.the month figure apparently reflected a comparison of the monthly revenues from the prime knight lodgings with the monthly revenues from other lodgings on the same base that did not have worldwide dsn access in the guest rooms,but the board found that the averages were misleading because they did not consider the number of rooms in each of the buildings.id.the board adopted an alternative methodology that compared the revenues of the prime knight lodgings to the revenues of other lodgings in the relevant time period,and found a difference of per room.id.at.the board multiplied this perroom difference by the number of prime knight rooms to arrive at a difference of.id.
because the board damages determination for count viii was reasonable and supported by substantial evidence,the court of federal claims erred in displacing it with its own damages calculation.sufi network,fed.cl.at.the only explanation the court of federal claims gave for rejecting the board calculation was that the revenues received per room from other ramstein lodging facilities were themselves repressed as a result of other breaches,such as those involving hallway and lobby dsn telephones.id.but the court of federal claims identified no reason to think that the prime knight and other ramstein lodgings were affected differently by the other breaches more precisely,no basis for concluding that the board had to find such a difference.indeed,building diagrams indicate that the prime knight lodgings,like others,made dsn phones available to guests other than in their rooms.without a difference regarding other factors,the comparison of buildings the board used to estimate the effect of the present breach is reasonable.accordingly,we reverse the court of federal claims on count viii.
count xi german troops housing 
during the bidding process,the air force made statements to sufi about who would be staying at the lodgings sufi would serve under the contract transient guests in transition between europe and the usa,who would use the long distance service to reestablish themselves in the usa or call relatives in the usa.sufi viii at.the air force further stated that americans are frequent callers and use the long distance service.id.starting in march,however,and without advance notice to sufi,the air force housed german troops in some of the lodgings,an arrangement that lasted two years until may.id.at the request of their commander,the air force decided generally not to give german troops personal identification numbers that would enable them to use sufi phones,although certain soldiers individually requested and received such numbers.id.from march to may,sufi revenues in the relevant lodgings declined to about of the levels.id.
the board found that the air force conduct regarding the german troops constituted a change in the terms of the contract that caused sufi to have to undertake extra work and that reduced its revenues,justifying an equitable adjustment for sufi extra work.id.at.the board did not address sufi claim that the air force actions breached implied duties of good faith and cooperation and violated the express terms of the contract nor did the board explain why it was not awarding damages for sufi lost profits on the phones in rooms occupied by the german troops.id.in these circumstances,we can not uphold the board decision under the wunderlich act standard of review.but the court of federal claims erred in itself determining the proper damages for count xi.we vacate the court of federal claims ruling on count xi and order that count remanded to the board for further consideration.
count xvi post termination lost profits 
count xvi concerns sufi loss of profits for the years in which it would have enjoyed the fruits of the contract had there been no government breach,which led to the justified contract termination by sufi.the parties disagree about the interpretation of two contract provisions relevant to calculating sufi lost profits concerning the term of the contract and whether sufi would have served new lodging facilities as they were added to bases covered by the contract.matters of contract interpretation are issues of law that we review de novo.massachusetts bay transp.auth.united states.
contract term.three provisions bear on determining the contract term for purposes of sufi lost profits.as modified,section provides the term of this contract will be for months years.as modified,sections and provide 
option to buy equipment 
upon completion of the performance period of each site years,and prior to removal of any contractor owned equipment,the government shall have the option to buy existing equipment at fair market value,which shall be negotiated between the contracting officer and the contractor for each site.
performance period 
the performance period for each site will commence upon actual completion of installation,inspection and acceptance by the ordering nafi non appropriated fund instrumentality for the system ordered for that particular site and shall not exceed a period of years from that date.
emphases added.relying on section,the board interpreted the contract to provide for an term from the date the contract was awarded,and thus set april,as the end date for contract performance for all sites.sufi ix at.the board considered its reading to be consistent with section,which states only that the performance period for each site shall not exceed a period of years,not that the performance period for each site would last fifteen years.id.
the court of federal claims rejected the board interpretation,instead reading the contract to provide for a separate term for each site,running from the date of completion of installation,inspection,and acceptance by the ordering nafi,as specified in section.sufi network,fed.cl.at.the court reasoned that the board interpretation would render sections and meaningless and superfluous,because there would be no reason to have other provisions addressing a performance period for each site.id.we conclude that,although the board reading may not render sections and meaningless and superfluous adds an option to buy equipment and specifies when sufi must begin performing its duties under the contract,the court of federal claims interpretation is the more reasonable reading of the relevant contract provisions.
first,the board interpretation is in substantial tension with section,whose language the performance period of each site years strongly indicates that the performance period for each site shall last years,rather than merely that it shall not exceed years.second,given that the contract anticipates the addition of new sites years into the contract,with sufi bearing substantial installation costs for each site,it makes sense for the contract to be providing a sitespecific performance period to permit recoupment of such investments.as the court of federal claims reasoned,contracting for a separate term for each site reflects the sound business principle that sufi could not earn any revenue on its investment at a base until the telephone system was up and running.sufi network,fed.cl.at.in the absence of a persuasive contrary showing,the fairer reading of the contract language,considering the economic logic of the bargain,is that the contract provided a performance period for each site.
