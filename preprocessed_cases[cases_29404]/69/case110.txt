the slow grinding of the wheels of justice is a major theme in this national labor relations board nlrb compliance case.
in,the nlrb awarded remedies for unfair labor practices committed by harding glass company harding in.harding glass harding iii,at.those remedies awarded over in back pay to nine employees and over to four union funds,with accrued interest.id.the board seeks enforcement the company says that enforcement should be denied,arguing that it would be driven out of business by enforcement of the order and that the sums owed should,at the least,be discounted for the delay in the resolution of this matter.
the case has cautionary lessons for counsel about the costs of minimalist responses to board allegations.here,the company failed to comply with the board rules for answering compliance specifications.those rules require highly specific information,going well beyond the requirements for answers in civil actions in federal courts.additionally,although interesting legal issues may lurk as to the limits of the board ability to order payment to union funds,the company has failed to provide any facts,thus rendering the questions hypothetical.
we reject the company arguments and enforce the board order.we note that the board has offered to work with the company on a payment plan,should that be necessary.
this saga,unfortunately,has taken fourteen years.harding sells and installs glass for automobiles and commercial buildings in worcester,massachusetts.in october,the company employed two glaziers and three glassworkers.the glaziers repaired and installed industrial and commercial glass,while the glassworkers repaired and replaced automobile glass.glaziers local,international brotherhood of painters allied trades,the union,represented both sets of employees.
several months before the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement on october,the parties,at harding request,entered into negotiations for a successor agreement.the company proposed to reduce the glaziers pay rate from per hour to per hour,while raising the glassworkers pay rate from per hour to per hour.the company also proposed eliminating all contributions to the union health,welfare,pension,and annuity funds it proposed replacing only the health fund with another insurance plan.the union put forward a counterproposal,which harding rejected.on october,the glaziers voted to reject harding offer and strike.they established a picket line the next day.the glassworkers initially respected the glaziers picket line.
the parties met again on october but failed to reach an agreement.on october,harding implemented its final offer.the company offered the glassworkers the wage and benefit package it had initially offered the union,while at the same time threatening to replace them.the three glassworkers resigned from the union and resumed working for harding.the two glaziers maintained their picket line,and the company hired a new glazier under its new terms and conditions of employment.the union filed unfair labor practice charges against harding alleging that the company had,inter alia,unilaterally implemented its final offer in the absence of a bona fide impasse in collective bargaining.
the board,on march,held that the company had,by its actions,violated section a of the national labor relations act nlra by implementing unilateral changes in employment conditions without a valid impasse in bargaining.harding glass harding i.this court,on march,enforced that portion of the board order nlrb harding glass,cir.under the relevant provisions of the board order,the company was directed to restore all terms and conditions of employment to the status quo as of october,and to make whole all employees and union funds for the losses they had suffered.harding i,at.it is this obligation for the events that is the subject matter of the proceedings before us.
once it had the enforcement order,the agency did not act promptly.the regional office did not issue a compliance specification until july.thereafter,it issued a first amended compliance specification on january.after various proceedings,the board issued an order on august,granting in large part the general counsel motion to strike portions of harding answer for failure to comply with the board rules.those rules require respondents who dispute compliance allegations to provide supporting figures or information.the board,having struck most of harding answer,then granted,with one exception,summary judgment against the company on the pay rates and the method of back pay calculation alleged by the general counsel to apply to the affected employees.harding glass harding ii,at.the board denied the motion for summary judgment as to employee james tritone and left open for litigation the issue of whether tritone back pay should be based on the full contract rate for a glazier,per hour,at the time of tritone reinstatement after recovering from a injury.id.at.for the period in question,from march to april,harding had paid tritone at the rate of per hour.the board also left open for litigation the parties dispute over the date on which the economic strike ended.id.at.
in its order,the board rejected the company affirmative defense that the amended compliance specification should be dismissed in its entirety because of delay by the regional office.the board was not moved by the gap between the issuance of the initial compliance specification and the first amended compliance specification.the board similarly rejected harding defense that it was entitled to offset on the payments due to the union funds for the value of alternative benefit payments made by the company.the board ordered that both affirmative defenses be stricken.id.thus,the board order resolved most,but not all,of the remedial issues and remanded the remaining matters to an administrative law judge alj for hearing.id.
the company,instead of trying to expedite the remaining proceedings,took the opposite tack.it did not ask the board to enter final judgment in on the matters then resolved.rather,harding chose to petition for review of the board interlocutory order.the predictable result was that this court granted,on november,the board motion to dismiss on the ground that we lacked jurisdiction because there was no final order.
again there was delay by the regional office as to the issues remanded to the alj.the regional office,over two years later,issued a second amended compliance specification on december.that was updated by a third amended compliance specification on january.
on april,the general counsel filed a motion in limine to preclude harding from rearguing issues that had already been resolved against the company in the underlying unfair labor practice proceedings.on april,the alj granted the motion,over the company objection.
on june,the alj issued a supplemental decision agreeing with the regional director back pay calculations for the individual employees as well as for monies due to the union funds.the alj agreed with the regional director that the economic strike ended on june,and that the back pay period for replacement workers began on the following day,june.as to the issue of back pay for tritone,the alj found that he was entitled to the full contract rate for glaziers,and awarded back pay to tritone in the amount of plus interest.in total,the alj ordered harding to pay lost wages of plus interest to nine employees and plus interest to four union funds the company sought review by the board.
on august,the board rejected the company exceptions,adopted the alj rulings,and directed harding to pay the specified amounts plus interest to the employees and the union funds.harding iii,at.with respect to the calculation of tritone back pay,the board agreed with the alj that tritone was entitled to the contractual glazier rate of per hour for the period from march to april.id.at.
on october,the board petitioned for enforcement of its order in full.harding did not for review,but it did assert in its answer to the enforcement application that the board decision and order are without foundation in law or fact and are erroneous as a matter of law and are not supported by substantial
