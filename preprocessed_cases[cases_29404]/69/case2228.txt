background 
petitioner william white filed a personal injury lawsuit against steak and ale for injuries arising out of an incident that occurred on december,claiming steak and ale was negligent in the maintenance of its premises.on august,steak and ale served on white an offer of settlement and dismissal pursuant to florida statutes,in the total amount of.white rejected the offer and the case proceeded to trial,resulting in a net verdict of.
steak and ale then moved to recover fees and costs under section,florida statutes.this statute provides that when the plaintiff rejects an offer and the judgment obtained is at least less than the offer,the defendant who makes the offer is entitled to recover its attorneys fees and costs.at the same time,white separately filed a motion to tax costs incurred before steak and ale offer in the amount of,and the trial court entered a cost judgment for white in that amount.white then asserted that steak and ale was not entitled to recover its fees and costs under the offer of judgment statute because the judgment obtained was,consisting of the jury verdict of plus the taxable costs of.thus,white argued the judgment obtained exceeded the threshold of of.
although the trial court granted white motion to tax as costs in his favor as prevailing party,the trial court felt bound by mincin short,so d dca,not to consider those costs in determining whether the judgment obtained exceeded the threshold.the trial court then found steak and ale fees and costs to be and,after making appropriate statutory adjustments,entered a final judgment for steak and ale in the amount of.white appealed to the second district,which affirmed the trial court,citing mincin,and certified conflict with perez.see white,so d at.
in resolving the conflict between the district courts,we begin with the language of the controlling statute,section.specifically,section sets forth how the court must determine whether the offeror is entitled to recover attorneys fees and costs 
upon motion made by the offeror within days after the entry of judgment or after voluntary or involuntary dismissal,the court shall determine the following 
a if a defendant serves an offer which is not accepted by the plaintiff,and if the judgment obtained by the plaintiff is at least percent less than the amount of the offer,the defendant shall be awarded reasonable costs,including investigative expenses,and attorney fees,calculated in accordance with the guidelines promulgated by the supreme court,incurred from the date the offer was served,and the court shall set off such costs in attorney fees against the award.when such costs and attorney fees total more than the amount of the judgment,the court shall enter judgment for the defendant against the plaintiff for the amount of the costs and fees,less the amount of the award to the plaintiff.
b if a plaintiff serves an offer which is not accepted by the defendant,and if the judgment obtained by the plaintiff is at least percent more than the amount of the offer,the plaintiff shall be awarded reasonable costs,including investigative expenses,and attorney fees,calculated in accordance with the guidelines promulgated by the supreme court,incurred from the date the offer was served.
for purposes of the determination required by paragraph a,the term judgment obtained means the amount of the net judgment entered,plus any postoffer collateral source payments received or due as of the date of the judgment,plus any postoffer settlement amounts by which the verdict was reduced.for purposes of the determination required by paragraph b,the term judgment obtained means the amount of the net judgment entered,plus any postoffer settlement amounts by which the verdict was reduced.
stat.emphasis added.
pursuant to this statutory scheme,if a defendant properly serves an offer on a plaintiff who rejects the offer,then an amount less than the offered amount constitutes the judgment threshold.if the plaintiff later obtains a judgment that is at or below this threshold,then the defendant may recover any attorneys fees and taxable costs incurred after the plaintiff rejected the offer,and the plaintiff is entitled only to the taxable costs incurred before receiving the offer.
the statute operates in a parallel manner with regard to offers made by a plaintiff if a plaintiff serves an offer on a defendant,then an amount that is more than the amount demanded constitutes the judgment threshold.if the plaintiff later obtains a judgment that is at or above the threshold,then the plaintiff may recover any attorneys fees and taxable costs incurred after rejecting the offer 
in determining whether the threshold amount has been met,the components included in the judgment obtained become critical.the question presented by this case is whether a prevailing party taxable costs are included for purposes of calculating the judgment obtained.the second and fifth district courts of appeal have defined the term judgment obtained as limited to the amount of the judgment for damages awarded by the jury.mincin,so d at quoting williams brochu,so d,dca see also gulf coast transp.padron,so d,dca.the third district in perez and the fourth district court of appeal have disagreed,concluding that a trial court is required to add taxable costs incurred up to the time of the offer when calculating the judgment obtained for purposes of determining entitlement to attorneys fees and costs under section.see perez,so d at herzog,so d,dca,disapproved on other grounds by allstate indem.hingson,so d.
we conclude that the judgment obtained is not limited to or equated solely with the amount of the judgment for damages.as the third district reasoned in perez,the amount of the judgment for damages awarded by the jury is the verdict,not the judgment.perez,so d at citing black law dictionary ed.the third district explained in perez that w hile a jury verdict is certainly an important part of the judgment obtained,the judgment obtained could not be equated with the jury verdict.perez,so d at.see also state farm mut.auto.ins.kujawa,so d,dca citing perez and holding that the correct source from which to determine whether to award section attorneys fees is the judgment,not the verdict.
in fact,the judgment obtained,as defined by statute,is the net judgment entered,plus any collateral source payments received or due as of the date of the judgment,plus any settlement amounts by which the verdict was reduced.see b.this definition does not limit the net judgment entered to the verdict.
in excluding the calculation of the amount of costs from the term judgment obtained,the mincin and williams courts relied upon cases holding that costs are incidental to an action for jurisdictional purposes.see mincin,so d at citing golub golub,so d dca williams,so d at citing louisville nashville railroad sutton,so.however,although costs may be incidental for determining the jurisdictional threshold,they are not incidental for determining the judgment threshold because a prevailing party is entitled to a judgment for taxable costs 
moreover,common sense,fairness,and the purpose of the statute,which is to encourage settlements of lawsuits,also lead us to this conclusion.in determining both the amount of the offer and whether to accept the offer,the party necessarily must evaluate not only the amount of the potential jury verdict,but also any taxable costs,attorneys fees,and prejudgment interest to which the party would be entitled if the trial court entered the judgment at the time of the offer or demand as we stated in danis industries ground improvement techniqu
