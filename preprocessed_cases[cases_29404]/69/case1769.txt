the question presented is whether plaintiff,nicholas laboratories,llc nicholas labs,is required to indemnify its,defendant christopher chen,for attorney fees incurred by chen during his successful defense of an action brought by nicholas labs.the trial court rejected chen assertion that various statutory,subd.a,subd.d contractual indemnity provisions obligated nicholas labs to reimburse chen.
we hold that labor code section does not require an employer to reimburse its employee for attorney fees incurred in the employee successful defense of the employer action against the employee we further conclude corporations code section has no application to limited liability companies,and that substantial evidence supports the court denial of chen attorney fees based upon the alleged contract.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
nicholas labs filed a complaint against chen,listing seven theories of liability breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,conversion,negligence,money had and received,unjust enrichment,and constructive trust.the alleged factual basis for nicholas labs complaint was the following chen was hired by nicholas labs as its director of information technology chen agreed to work full time and exclusively on behalf of nicholas labs chen instead engaged in a business that made him a competitor of nicholas labs chen diverted business opportunities away from nicholas labs chen stole certain personal property from nicholas labs,computers,printers chen misused the company credit card and chen,in contravention of nicholas labs specific directive,involve d himself in a renovation project of the residence of nicholas labs principal and thereby cause d third parties to enter into contracts to provide labor and equipment in the millions of dollars,purportedly binding nicholas labs.nicholas labs sought compensatory damages,punitive damages,reasonable attorney fees,and other relief in excess of million.
chen responded with a,claiming he has incurred and will continue to incur expenses and attorneys fees to defend himself against claims which relate to his service as employee or agent of plaintiff.chen is entitled to indemnity for all such claims and expenses under the provisions of the california labor code,the provisions of the california corporations code and the provisions of the operating agreement and articles of nicholas labs.chen sought compensatory damages and indemnity,as well as attorney fees.
motions in limine and stipulation 
citing various alleged abuses of the discovery process by nicholas labs,chen filed several motions in limine seeking either terminating sanctions or evidence sanctions against nicholas labs.see code civ,subds.c,d.nicholas labs opposed these motions in writing.
but on the eve of trial,the parties filed a stipulation premised on the following facts whereas,nicholas lab s has decided to dismiss its complaint without prejudice,if chen decides to submit his cross complaint for disposition pursuant to written submission to and decision by the court whereas,chen has decided to submit his cross complaint for disposition pursuant to written submission to and decision by the court,exclusive of a jury and without the presentation of live testimony.the parties stipulated nicholas labs will dismiss its complaint without prejudice pursuant to the request for dismissal attached hereto chen will submit his cross complaint for a bench trial based on written submissions and this stipulation is not a resolution of a disputed claim.nicholas labs has determined to dismiss the action for its own reasons,and chen has determined to submit the in writing to the court for his own reasons.
the stipulation was accompanied by a request for dismissal of nicholas labs complaint,without prejudice.
evidentiary submissions 
thus,the parties submitted trial briefs and declarations pertaining to the.notwithstanding nicholas labs dismissal of its complaint,most of the evidentiary material submitted by nicholas labs was geared to proving chen actually engaged in misconduct as alleged in the complaint.this material is irrelevant to the questions presented in this appeal.also irrelevant to our review is evidence pertaining to criminal allegations against certain principals of nicholas labs.
the record does contain some evidentiary material pertinent to the question of contractual indemnity.basically,the question of fact was whether chen was an employee of the manager of nicholas labs,ns holdings,llc ns holdings,or an employee solely of nicholas labs.if chen was an employee of the manager,ns holdings,he arguably was entitled to indemnification under an indemnification clause included in nicholas labs operating agreement.
a human resources department employee at ns holdings authenticated various documentation,tax forms,benefit forms suggesting chen worked for nicholas labs not ns holdings.a paralegal at ns holdings attested nicholas labs is a limited liability company.the company was converted into a delaware limited liability company in november,and has continuously operated as a delaware llc since that time.the paralegal continued ns holdings serves as the manager of nicholas labs t he two companies keep separate books and records,maintain separate payrolls and employee benefit accounts,and have their own employees.another individual declared ns holdings is a holding company that exists to manage various companies affiliated with the nicholas family.ns holdings officers and employees therefore manage and provide services to entities such as nicholas labs.the employees of nicholas labs do not work for and are not employed by ns holdings.rather,nicholas labs is a limited liability company with its own employees.
chen testified in a deposition that his title at nicholas labs was director of it senior director of it.chen confirmed this fact in a declaration,but added he took orders from and performed duties personally for henry nicholas the ultimate owner of nicholas labs and a number of affiliated entities and craig gunther nicholas.essentially,chen testified he considered himself to be employed by nicholas more generally rather than only for one specific entity,nicholas labs and that,by taking orders directly from gunther,the chief operating officer of ns holdings,chen worked for ns holdings as well as nicholas labs.
chen written offer of employment indicated chen would work for nicholas labs the letter was signed by gunther on behalf of ns holdings.prior to beginning his employment,chen signed an employee proprietary information and inventions agreement with all subsidiaries,affiliates,successors and assigns of the management company,llc,another nicholas entity.nicholas labs and ns holdings were specifically referenced in this agreement as possessing certain intellectual property chen was forbidden to appropriate.
the parties agree a copy of the nicholas labs operating agreement is in the record.this agreement selects california law to govern the agreement and all questions arising thereunder.included in the operating agreement is an indemnification provision the company nicholas labs shall indemnify and hold harmless the manager ns holdings from and against any loss or expense incurred by reason of the fact that the manager is or was a manager of the company,including without limitation any judgment,settlement,reasonable attorneys fees and other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the defense of any actual or threatened action or proceeding,provided such loss or expense resulted from good faith errors or from action or inaction taken in good faith for a purpose which the manager reasonably believed to be in,or not opposed to,the best interests of the company.the indemnification provided in this paragraph also shall apply to the agents,employees and other legal representatives of the manager.ns holdings was at all relevant times the manager of nicholas labs.ns holdings was also the sole owner referred to as a member under,subd.x of nicholas labs.
counsel for chen documented in attorney fees incurred by chen during the course of the litigation.
the court rejected each of chen rationales for attorney fees.labor code is applicable to third party claims against an employee,but not as to claims by an employer against its own employees as to corporations code d,chen has not presented evidence of a judicial determination on the merits in his favor as required for mandatory indemnification pursuant to that code section as to indemnity based on the operating agreement,chen has not carried his burden of establishing that he was an of ns holdings,llc t here was no employment agreement between ns holdings,llc and chen.additionally,there is insufficient evidence of direction and control of chen services by ns holdings,llc,and chen salary was paid by nicholas labs and not ns holdings,llc.there was insufficient evidence that chen was an employee in an enterprise in which he was subject to the control of both nicholas labs and ns holdings rendering him a joint employee of both entities.
the court entered judgment for chen and against nicholas labs on the complaint and for nicholas labs and against chen on the.the court awarded chen his costs on the complaint and awarded nicholas labs its costs on the.
discussion 
citing statutory authority,subd.a,subd.d and the nicholas labs operating agreement,chen claims nicholas labs is obligated to indemnify chen for the attorney fees he incurred in this action both to defend against the complaint and pursue the for indemnification.our review is de novo with regard to questions of statutory construction.people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,d.we review the trial court findings of fact for substantial evidence.in re first capital life ins.th,d.
chen first contends section requires nicholas labs to indemnify chen for his attorney fees in this case.section,subdivision a,states an employer shall indemnify his or her employee for all necessary expenditures or losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties,or of his or her obedience to the directions of the employer,even though unlawful,unless the employee,at the time of obeying the directions,believed them to be unlawful.
california has a strong public policy that favors the indemnification and defense of employees by their employers for claims and liabilities resulting from the employees acts within the course and scope of their employment.citation.s ection codifies this policy and gives an employee a right to indemnification from his or her employer.edwards arthur andersen llp cal th,d.
section requires an employer to indemnify an employee who is sued by third persons for conduct in the course and scope of his or her employment,including paying any judgment entered and attorney fees and costs incurred in defending the action.citations.as long as the employee is acting within the scope of his or her employment,the right to indemnity is not dependent upon a finding that the underlying action was unfounded.cassady morgan,lewis bockius llp th,d cassady,italics added.
unlike an insurer,the employer need not defend whenever there is a mere potential for liability.however,if the employer elects to run a risk and refuses to defend,the employer must indemnify the employee for his attorney fees and costs in defending the underlying action if the employee was sued for acts within the scope of his employment.jacobus krambo th,d jacobus.an employee may also recover reasonable attorney fees and other costs incurred in suing an employer to force the employer to comply with section,subdivision a,subd.c teamsters union local cir.
chen argues an employer is obligated to indemnify an employee not only for expenditures and losses arising out of third party lawsuits but also for the employee attorney fees if the employer unsuccessfully sues the employee based on the actions of the employee during the course of employment.no court has directly addressed this precise issue.
chen interpretation of section conflicts with the common understanding of the word indemnify as applied to litigation,an obligation to pay for judgments suffered expenses incurred in a lawsuit brought by a third party against the indemnitee,not a attorney fee provision in a dispute between the indemnitor and the indemnitee.but this common understanding of indemnify is not universally applied.although indemnity generally relates to third party claims,this general rule does not apply if the parties to a contract use the term indemnity to include direct liability as well as third party liability.zalkind ceradyne,th,d see also dream theater,dream theater th,d.and corporations code section,subdivision d,specifically requires a corporation to indemnif y its agents against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the agent to the extent the agent is successful in defending an action brought by or on behalf of the corporation against the agent.thus,it is not enough to simply point to the word indemnify in section and thereby deny chen claim.
when interpreting a statute,we look to the plain meaning of the statute words,which are generally the most reliable indicator of the legislature intent.cassady,supra,th at,d.other than the use of the word indemnify which,as noted above,usually refers to protection against third party claims but does not necessarily exclude claims brought by the indemnitor,nothing in the statute explicitly differentiates between lawsuits brought by the employer and lawsuits brought by a third party.
the elements of a section,subdivision a cause of action,as delineated by the statutory language,are the employee made expenditures or incurred losses the expenditures or losses were incurred in direct consequence of the employee discharge of his or her duties,or obedience to the directions of the employer and the expenditures or losses were necessary.cassady,supra,th at,d.as to the first and third elements,chen expended money during this lawsuit and the expenditures were necessary at least to some extent the trial court did not reach the question of whether the fees were reasonable.as to the second element,can an employer lawsuit against an arise as a direct consequence of the employee performance of his duties the allegations in the complaint pertain to chen conduct while employed by nicholas labs.had the complaint gone to trial,factual disputes about whether chen acted within the course of his employment and according to the directions of nicholas and gunther would have been resolved.does this mean the lawsuit against chen was a direct consequence of chen performance of his job simply looking to the plain language of section does not provide a clear answer to these questions.
two federal cases have come closer to addressing the issue presented than any california case.the first of these cases held albeit with limited analysis that two employees could recover attorney fees incurred both to enforce their section claim for indemnity and in defending against the union employer section claim,supra,at.the first half of this holding is now uncontroversial,as section was amended in to clarify that employees are entitled to reasonable attorney fees and other costs incurred in enforcing their right to indemnification.see,subd.c.the second half of the holding is arguably authority in support of chen position.in,the union employer citing and two named leal citing filed against each other in an attempt to pass the costs of a lawsuit involving a different employee allegations that the leals committed various wrongs against her on to the other,supra,at.
by allowing the leals to recover attorney fees,incurred in part defending against their,stands for the proposition that defending against an employer claim can at least in some circumstances provide the basis for indemnification under section.of course,the distinction between and the instant case is that involved an underlying third party claim that was the basis for the monetary dispute between the parties over who was required to indemnify whom.moreover,the court did not closely examine whether the leals pursuit of their indemnification rights could really be separated from their defense of the union which sought reimbursement for its costs of defending and settling the employee lawsuit.we are not convinced answers t
