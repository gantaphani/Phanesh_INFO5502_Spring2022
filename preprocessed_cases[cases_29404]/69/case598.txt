these appeals arose from a lawsuit in which a group of farmers and ranchers sought to prevent the united states department of agriculture usda from releasing certain government records to the animal protection institute api in response to api freedom of information act foia request.the district court entered an injunction preventing release of certain information,and the usda and the api appealed.
history of the lawsuit 
the lawsuit underlying these appeals is a action.in a action,a plaintiff seeks to prevent a governmental agency from releasing information to a third party in response to the third party request for information under foia in this lawsuit,a group of farmers and ranchers sought to prevent the release of information sought by api through a foia request.
in november,the api,an animal advocacy group,submitted a foia request to the usda for certain documents maintained by a usda agency,the animal and plant health inspection service aphis.the api sought copies of a form entitled application data report livestock protection collars from every state in which the livestock protection collar lpc has been used.
livestock owners use the lpc to protect sheep and goats in fenced pastures from coyotes who frequently attack by biting an animal neck.the lpc consists of a bladder containing a toxic,pesticide that is attached to an animal neck with a velcro strap.if a coyote bites the animal neck and punctures the bladder,the coyote will be poisoned.
employees of a usda agency,wildlife services ws,apply lpcs to animals as a service to farmers and ranchers.livestock owners using this service enter into cooperative agreements with ws under which they share the cost of the lpcs and allow ws to enter their properties to apply the collars.as a result,the participants in the lpc program are called cooperators.cooperators may be individuals,businesses,or governmental entities.
a cooperative agreement contains the cooperator name,address,telephone number,ranch or farm name,the property owner name and address,the land class and size,and a cooperative agreement number.the form sought by api contains only the name and location of the ranch or farm where the collars have been applied and the cooperative agreement number.
in response to api request for these forms,aphis released lpc records for the six states where the lpcs have been used,but redacted the names and locations of the ranches and farms where the collars have been applied,citing exemption of foia.under exemption,federal agencies may withhold from disclosure any personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.dissatisfied with the redacted records,api sought an administrative appeal on june.in august,when the appeal was still unresolved,api filed a foia lawsuit against ws in federal court in the district of columbia.in a foia lawsuit,a plaintiff who has unsuccessfully sought information through a foia request seeks to force the disclosure of the requested information.after api filed its lawsuit,the office of general counsel of the usda determined the records could be released without redaction.
before a release occurred,the appellees,three john doe plaintiffs and two associations representing farmers and ranchers the doe plaintiffs,sued the usda,aphis and ws collectively,the government,on november,in the western district of texas.the doe plaintiffs sought to prevent the release of information that could identify them as participants in the lpc program.the district court immediately granted a temporary restraining order tro enjoining aphis from releasing the personal information of individuals,entities,and using lpcs or enrolled in the livestock protection program.the tro was converted to a preliminary injunction on november.
the government moved to transfer the doe case to the district court where api lawsuit was pending,or alternatively to stay the doe action.the district court denied the motion in january,but the district court stayed api lawsuit in june pending disposition of the doe lawsuit.api then moved to intervene in the doe lawsuit.
before the doe plaintiffs filed their lawsuit,a third litigation began that served as the basis for an amendment to the doe complaint.in january,an environmental group called forest guardians submitted a foia request to aphis for a computer diskette copy of the management information system mis database used as the basis for all ws annual reports for states.the mis database contains information about the lpc program and similar agreements for participants of other usda wildlife control programs,including cooperator names and addresses,agreement numbers,and county and acreage information about cooperator property.because of the prohibitive cost and the disruption the requested download would cause,aphis attempted to persuade forest guardians to narrow its request.dissatisfied with this response,forest guardians sued aphis in march in the district of new mexico.aphis and forest guardians quickly began settlement negotiations.
in the process of reaching a settlement,aphis began to release partial sets of reports generated from the mis database.in the first two releases,in october before the doe suit was filed,aphis redacted the names and addresses of private cooperators,citing exemption.aphis made a third release in november.that release consisted of reports using data from states that did not participate in the lpc program.the names and farm or ranch addresses of private cooperators were not redacted.aphis third release was based on guidance from usda office of general counsel that the names and addresses of persons or entities dealing with the government in a business capacity should generally not be withheld under exemption.
in december,forest guardians agreed to settle its lawsuit and to forgo mis reports from states participating in the lpc program.in exchange,aphis agreed not to withhold information from remaining records under exemption.when the doe plaintiffs learned of the pending settlement,they amended their complaint.through the amendment,filed on january,the doe plaintiffs sought to prevent release of personal cooperator information in response to forest guardians foia request,and any other foia requests seeking personal cooperator information.because the amendment sought to prevent disclosure of all personal cooperator information,not just the information in lpc application records,the amendment considerably broadened the relief api originally sought.
in response to the amendment and a second request for a tro,the district court in the doe case issued a new tro on january,and expanded the previous preliminary injunction on february.the expanded injunction prohibited the government from disclosing any information that would allow the recipient to obtain or deduce the identity of cooperators.on august,the district court certified a plaintiff class consisting of all individuals or entities who have been since january.
forest guardians also finalized its settlement negotiations with aphis in august.to settle on terms that would not violate the expanded preliminary injunction,forest guardians agreed to settle for release of only one type of report from the mis summary cooperator identifying information redacted.under the settlement,the government agreed to cooperate in the release of further information in the county summary reports if and when the expanded preliminary injunction in the doe case was lifted.on february,forest guardians claims in the new mexico lawsuit were dismissed with prejudice under the settlement.
on september,the district court granted the government motion to dismiss the doe plaintiffs constitutional claims and the claims based on other pending foia requests.the district court then granted the doe plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,holding that personal identifying information about cooperators was exempted from disclosure under exemptions and of foia,and protected from disclosure by the privacy act 
the district court entered a permanent injunction on february.the injunction enjoins the government 
from releasing personal information of a cooperator contained in a records regarding the defendants livestock protection collar program,including but not limited to the following inspection reports,application data reports,lpc project summaries,lpc project data reports,records of toxic collar use,lpc quarterly reports b records regarding the location where restricted use pesticides have been,or will be,applied in connection with the defendants activities and c the mis database or the records from which information in the mis database derives,including written agreements by which plaintiff cooperators authorize the government defendants to enter their property.
the injunction defined personal information as 
information that reveals,directly or in combination with other information,the identity of a plaintiff cooperator.personal information includes but is not limited to,the following names,addresses,the county in which a plaintiff cooperator is located,the acreage of the plaintiff cooperator property,the name of a plaintiff cooperator ranch or farm,telephone numbers,agreement numbers and agreement types.personal information includes any type of identifying information which will allow the recipient of the information to ascertain the name,address,ranch,or location of a plaintiff cooperator.
in response to this language,api filed a notice of appeal.the government moved to alter or amend the injunction.
in its motion,the government argued that the permanent injunction is vague and overbroad.because it maintained the injunction prevented coordination among governmental agencies and cooperation in criminal investigations,the government asked the court to amend the injunction to avoid unintended consequences.the district court denied the motion.
the district court then granted a request by the doe plaintiffs for attorney fees.in awarding attorney fees,the district judge relied on aphis november release of information to forest guardians.the district court found the release was a willful and intentional violation of the privacy act that caused mental anguish and emotional injury to the plaintiffs.the government then filed a notice of appeal.together,the appellants challenge all aspects of the injunction and the award of attorney fees.
whether the district court exceeded its jurisdiction 
in their first issue,the appellants maintain the district court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin the release of personal information in the mis database because the doe plaintiffs claim regarding forest guardians foia request was moot when the injunction was entered.the appellants contend that the only request for disclosure properly before the district court was api foia request.as a result,the appellants argue that the district court exceeded its jurisdiction.
in chrysler corporation brown,the united states supreme court discussed the circumstances in which a private party may seek an order enjoining release of government records in response to a foia request the court explained that because foia is exclusively a disclosure statute,foia does not provide a private right of action to enjoin a governmental agency disclosure in response to a request for information under foia although foia does not permit a private party to enjoin disclosure,the court explained that a party seeking to prevent disclosure in response to a foia request may seek judicial review of an agency decision to release information under the administrative procedures act apa under the apa a court can set aside an agency determination if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.thus,a district court may review an agency decision to release information under foia and set aside that decision if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.
under basic article iii principles,this court can uphold a district court order setting aside an agency determination only to the extent there was a live controversy before the district court the exercise of judicial power under article iii of the united states constitution depends upon the existence of a case or controversy without an actual case or controversy,a federal court has no jurisdiction under article iii,
a federal court has neither the power to render advisory opinions nor to decide questions that can not affect the rights of litigants in the case before them.its judgments must resolve a real and substantial controversy admitting of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character,as distinguished from an opinion advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.
the usual rule in federal cases is that an actual controversy must exist at all stages of litigation,not merely at the time the complaint is filed where a controversy no longer exists,a claim based on that controversy is moot.
in general,a matter is moot for article iii purposes if the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.to have a legally cognizable interest in the outcome,a plaintiff must demonstrate an injury traceable to the defendant that is susceptible to some judicial remedy generally settlement of a dispute between two parties renders moot any case between them growing out of that dispute.
in the instant case,the issue of the release of personal information in the mis database became moot when forest guardians agreed to settle its lawsuit for the release of redacted county summary reports.although the doe plaintiffs were not part of the settlement,they had no injury traceable to the government that was susceptible to a judicial remedy because aphis decided not to release personal information.a suit simply does not provide the doe plaintiffs with the remedy they seek.
a plaintiff seeking to prevent disclosure under foia may seek judicial review of an agency decision to release information in response to a foia request but a plaintiff has no remedy until the agency determines it will release requested information in this case,aphis did not decide to release the mis database or personal cooperator information contained within the mis database.under the terms of the settlement agreement,aphis agreed to release only redacted county summary is,reports without personal identifying information.thus,aphis never decided to release the personal information that forms the basis of the doe plaintiffs amended claims consequently,the only relevant agency decision was the decision not to release personal cooperator information.
even though aphis decided not to release personal cooperator information,the district court enjoined the release of personal information contained in the mis database.by doing so,the district court acted without an actual controversy and exceeded the legal basis for review under the apa.as a result,the district court exceeded its jurisdiction by enjoining the government from releasing personal information in the mis database.
the doe plaintiffs argue on appeal that their claim about personal information in the mis database was not moot because they also challenged the usda policy which would have permitted release of the information requested by forest guardians.the second amended complaint does not support that argument.the second amended complaint specifically complains about forest guardians request for the mis database information and identifies the forest guardian suit and other pending foia requests as the fifth and sixth claims for relief.although the amended complaint also refers to a change in the government interpretation of exemption,the references can not be reasonably interpreted as asserting a challenge to the policy.instead,the references constitute factual allegations that support the doe plaintiffs request for the district court review of aphis decision to release information to forest guardians.these factual allegations did not create a controversy for the district court to resolve.
the doe plaintiffs also contend their claims about personal information in the mis database are not moot because the settlement agreement included a promise that aphis would release further information in the county summary reports if and when the expanded preliminary injunction in the doe case is lifted.because they maintain aphis has not made full disclosure under the settlement agreement,the doe plaintiffs contend the claim was not moot.
although the doe plaintiffs maintain the government has not fully complied with the settlement agreement,the promise in the settlement agreement does not preserve a live issue for resolution by the district court.under the settlement,aphis promised 
to cooperate with forest guardians to produce within a reasonable time given the amount of review and redaction any additional information withheld from county summary reports if and when the injunction issued by the texas district court is lifted or vacated,in accordance with the requirements of any court order lifting or vacating that injunction.
rather than serving as a commitment to release information upon the lifting of the injunction,this language represents a promise to cooperate with future foia requests for information.any releases of mis material to forest guardians will depend on forest guardians renewed expression of interest and a determination of releasability at that time.if forest guardians expresses that interest,and the government decides to release additional information,the doe plaintiffs will then have a basis for a lawsuit concerning the release.
whether exemption applies to api foia request 
in addition to enjoining the government from disclosing personal information in the mis database,the district court enjoined ws from releasing cooperators personal information contained in records regarding the lpc program.the district court determined such information is exempted from disclosure under exemption of foia.although the government maintained below that exemption does not apply to api foia request,it now agrees the exemption applies.api,however,challenges this finding on appeal.
exemption provides that foia 
does not apply to matters that are specifically exempted from disclosure by statute,provided that such statute a requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue,or b establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld 
the district court found that the federal insecticide,fungicide and rodenticide act fifra prohibits disclosure of the information api sought.
fifra establishes a comprehensive scheme for registering and regulating pesticides in order to provide for the protection of man and his environment.as part of the registration scheme,the administrator of the environmental protection agency epa classifies pesticides as being for general or restricted use when the administrator determines that a pesticide may generally cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment,the administrator classifies the pesticide for restricted use the administrator classification of pesticides as is codified in title of the code of federal regulations 
the pesticide used in classified as a pesticide under title to use a pesticide like sodium fluoroacetate,an individual must be certified through an epa approved program individuals who are authorized to use or supervise the use of pesticides are referred to as certified applicators 
section of fifra requires certified applicators of pesticides to maintain certain application records although these records are available to federal and state agencies dealing with pesticide use or any health or environmental issue related to the use of pesticides,fifra prohibits those agencies from releasing data,including the location from which the data was derived,that would directly or indirectly reveal the identity of individual producers.consequently,fifra prohibits the government from releasing data,including the location from which the data was derived,that would directly or indirectly reveal the identity of cooperators using the lpc because the lpc uses sodium fluoroacetate because fifra prohibits disclosure,the personal information in the lpc application forms is exempted from disclosure under exemption of foia.
api,however,maintains exemption does not apply to its request because fifra prohibition applies only to federal agencies that have accessed applicator records under subsection b of fifra provision that provision states that 
records maintained under subsection a of this section shall be made available to any federal or state agency that deals with pesticide use or any health or environmental issue related to the use of pesticides,on the request of such agency.each such federal agency shall conduct surveys and record the data from individual applicators to facilitate statistical analysis for environmental and agronomic purposes,but in no case may a government agency release data,including the location from which the data was derived,that would directly or indirectly reveal the identity of individual producers.in the case of federal agencies,such access to records maintained under subsection a of this section shall be through the secretary of agriculture,or the secretary designee.state agency requests for access to records maintained under subsection a of this section shall be through the lead state agency so designated by the state 
because it maintains that the lpc documents are not records that ws accesses under this language,api contends fifra prohibition against release does not apply to the information it requested from ws.
api interpretation of this language,however,is illogical.under api interpretation,fifra would permit ws to directly release the application records it maintains as a certified applicator of a pesticide and reveal the identities of individual agricultural producers,but protect release if ws forwarded the information to another component of secretary of would then forward it to another federal agency.not only is this illogical,this interpretation contradicts the act legislative history.the legislative history indicates that congress was concerned about protecting the privacy of farmers who use pesticides because fifra prohibits the government from releasing data that would reveal the identity of individuals using the lpc because the lpc uses a pesticide,the district court properly concluded that exemption precludes release of the personal information of cooperators in the lpc application forms 
whether the injunction is vague and overbroad 
the appellants also contend the injunction is vague and overbroad.specifically,the appellants complain that the order enjoins the government from releasing personal information in records regarding the defendants livestock protection collar program records regarding the location where restricted use pesticides have been,or will be,applied and the mis database or the records from which information in the mis database derives.the appellants maintain this language is overbroad because it addresses matters that were not properly before the district court.
the appellants also complain that the injunction defines personal information as information that reveals,directly or in combination with other information,the identity of a plaintiff cooperator.they further complain that the definition includes identifying information which will allow the recipient of the information to ascertain the name,address,ranch,or location of a plaintiff cooperator.the appellants argue that the language defining personal information is vague because the government has no way of determining what information might allow a recipient to determine cooperator identities and locations,and overbroad because it prohibits the release of the county where cooperator property is located.
rule of the federal rules of civil procedure requires an injunction to be specific in terms and describe in reasonable detail,and not by reference to the complaint or other document,the act or acts sought to be restrained.t he scope of injunctive relief is dictated by the extent of the violation established the district court must narrowly tailor an injunction to remedy the specific action which gives rise to the order an injunction fails to meet these standards when it is overbroad or vague 
t he broadness
