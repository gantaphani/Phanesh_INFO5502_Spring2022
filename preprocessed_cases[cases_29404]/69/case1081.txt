this appeal presents a classic union power struggle.we must resolve whether of the labor management reporting and disclosure act creates a fiduciary duty to the union as an organization,not merely the union members.we hold that it does.
the defendants,who by jury were determined to be rogue local union officials who diverted union resources in an attempt to establish a new competing local union,breached this duty.the international union executive committee had decided to consolidate all of its california unionized healthcare workers from three different local unions into one.the defendants actively attempted to obstruct this consolidation,breaching the fiduciary duty they owed their own union as an organization.this breach involved a pattern of conduct of engaging in dual unionism that is not protected speech.because this breach contravened the union constitution,it could not have been authorized.we affirm the jury verdict and uphold its award of damages.
the services employees international union seiu consists of million members who work in healthcare,public services,and property services.united health workers uhw is one of many local unions affiliated with seiu.at the time its dispute with the international union arose,uhw represented approximately healthcare workers in california.
the seiu constitution,which is binding on uhw,defines the relationship between seiu and uhw.the seiu constitution vests seiu international executive board with authority regarding alignment and jurisdiction of local unions like uhw.for at least the last decade,seiu has regularly merged and realigned local unions.
the uhw itself was formed as the result of seiu merger of two local healthcare unions in california in.harmony between the international and its newly created local union was.shortly after uhw creation,uhw officials began to spar with seiu leadership over seiu jurisdictional plan for care workers in california.the international union intended to move care workers from three separate unions,including some from uhw,into a new local union chartered by seiu.
the controversy began to heat up in.in january of that year,an seiu executive vice president issued a report concluding that care workers would be better served if they had a union of their own.on january,the uhw executive board passed a resolution instructing uhw officers to take any and all appropriate measures to protect the ability of uhw care workers to vote on any plans to split them into a new union.for good measure,the uhw executive board passed an additional,similarly worded measure in march.
seiu decided to appoint a hearing officer in early to further analyze the care workers issue.in august,the hearing officer released his findings,endorsing the creation of a new seiu union of care workers.based on this recommendation and other findings,seiu international executive board issued a written resolution on january,directing consolidation of care workers into a new california union.
as the care worker realignment controversy accelerated and tensions escalated between officials of the international union and uhw,seiu began to consider placing uhw into trusteeship.the seiu constitution grants seiu the authority to place a local union into trusteeship to protect the interests of the membership from local union malfeasance.instituting a trusteeship allows seiu to appoint new officers to take charge and control of the affairs of a local union with the effect of removing the officers of the local union.essentially,a trusteeship allows the parent union to replace the existing local union leadership.
in august,while seiu appointed hearing officer was recommending the realignment of uhw care workers,seiu convened a hearing to discuss whether to place uhw in trusteeship.former united states secretary of labor ray marshall presided over the trusteeship hearing.secretary marshall eventually issued his report on january,twelve days after seiu had adopted its realignment plan.the report recommended that uhw be placed into trusteeship if it refuse d to abide by and cooperate with seiu realignment decision regarding care workers.secretary marshall suggested that uhw be given five days to accept the care decision or face trusteeship.
the seiu international executive board approved secretary marshall recommendations on january,giving uhw until january,to confirm in writing that it would not oppose the creation of the new care workers union.the uhw would not so promise,and seiu placed uhw into trusteeship on january.
the jury found that the defendants did not take these developments kindly.before the controversy reached its climax,the defendants,local uhw officials,took a number of actions that seiu proved at trial violated the officials fiduciary duties to uhw.the jury,by its verdict,found that defendants,while still employed as uhw officers,engaged in action designed to weaken uhw in the event of a trusteeship while acting to form and promote a rival union.
the evidence at trial showed that uhw officials sought to create an ungovernable situation for trustees appointed to administer uhw by blocking access to uhw buildings to prevent the trustees from entering removing uhw property from uhw buildings,including office equipment,computers,and employee grievance files instructing uhw officials and members not to recognize the authority of the trustees harassing seiu staff by storming seiu alameda,california,office and terminating uhw collective bargaining agreements with california employers.
at the same time,the defendants,while still on the uhw payroll,began to create and promote the new union.the evidence showed that the defendants searched and prioritized office space for the new union in december and january instructed staff to collect signatures on a disaffiliation petition in an attempt to disaffiliate uhw from seiu researched the decertification of uhw,which would have terminated uhw role as collective bargaining agent for its members,thus allowing a new union to become the bargaining representative of those members announced to members three days before the trusteeship was imposed that members could decertify and join a new,independent,democratic,progressive union created an database of member contact information before the trusteeship was imposed for use after the trusteeship went into effect,at least in part to solicit uhw members to join the new union and registered the domain and drafted a press release announcing the new union on january,the day the uhw trusteeship was imposed.
within a week after the trusteeship was announced,the individually named defendants had created the national union of healthcare workers nuhw and had filed petitions to have uhw removed as the bargaining representative for its current members.
litigation began in march when seiu sought a temporary restraining order tro from the united states district court for the northern district of california requiring the return of all uhw property possessed by the defendants.the defendants resisted the tro on the grounds that they did not possess any uhw property.the defendants argued that,because they did not possess any property,a tro would be an exercise in futility.still,seiu prevailed,a tro issued,and the defendants appealed.we previously upheld the issuance of injunctive relief on appeal.serv.emps.int l union union of healthcare workers,cir.
notwithstanding counsel representations that the defendants possessed no uhw property,the defendants eventually returned scores of boxes of records belonging to uhw.seiu claimed that not all missing property had been returned,and the district court granted a permanent injunction extending the tro requirement that the defendants return all uhw property.
the case proceeded to trial on seiu claims for breach of fiduciary duties under of the lmrda and damages.in the spring of,the case was tried before a jury,which found in favor of seiu.the jury returned a verdict awarding damages against the individual defendants in various amounts,and the district court entered judgment against the defendants for varying amounts awarded by the jury.the individual judgments ranged from to,and nuhw was assessed damages of.
although the jury instructions allowed the jury to impose either individual or liability,the special verdict form contained no place for the jury to indicate which they had chosen.the verdict form required the jury to list damages under four different columns salary and benefits,diversion of resources,increased security,and lost dues.on the form,the jury entered specific amounts for each defendant in each of the four categories.the final column of the form asked the jury to indicate the total liability of each defendant.the district court interpreted the form to impose several liability on each defendant for the amount in the final column.
the defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law for new trial and to alter the damages awards.the district court denied these respective motions,and the defendants timely appealed.we have jurisdiction under.
we must first resolve what duty federal law imposes on local union officials who act to subvert the directives of a parent union in contravention of their own union constitution.
under of the labor management reporting and disclosure act lmrda,officers of labor unions are held to the highest standards of responsibility and ethical conduct in administering the affairs of the union.what makes this case unusual,and one of first impression for us,is that usually a union member,not a parent organization like seiu,asserts a claim against union officers.see,kerr shanks,cir stelling int l of workers,local union,cir.in this case,however,the international union asserts that the defendants violated their duty to uhw,their own organization.the question before us,one that underpins the majority of the defendants claims on appeal,is exactly to whom union officials owe that fiduciary duty.
the uhw defendants posit that they owed this duty to only the members of their local union.because they subjectively believed their actions assisted those members by establishing a more democratic union with localized control,they maintain they have done no wrong under.their argument ignores the fact that they diverted union resources to weaken their own union and form a rival union merely because they did not agree with the constitutionally permissible decision of the international union.because no construction of the lmrda allows such conduct based merely on the defendants subjective motives,we reject the defendants argument.
the seiu executive committee,under the authority given to it by both its constitution and the uhw constitution,carefully considered and adopted a measure it believed would better serve its members.the uhw officers disagreed,which they may do,and they voiced their opposition,which they also may do.see protecting union officials speech.what they may not do under the law is use their union resources to actively obstruct implementation of the final decision.
the international union has the authority,under its constitution,to place a local union into trusteeship.the facts adduced at trial show that seiu did not take this decision lightly it appointed a respected former department of labor secretary to preside over a hearing and considered the issue for six months.based on the recommendation from this hearing and the defendants refusal to accept seiu decision to create a new consolidated local union under seiu control,the international placed uhw into trusteeship.
local unions are not completely at the mercy of their international unions.the trusteeship must be respected only if seiu imposed it properly.if the international union takes action that violates its own fiduciary duties under federal law,or if the international union improperly impresses a trusteeship contrary to its constitution or federal laws regarding trusteeship,see,the local union can challenge the international union decision.see,navarro gannon,cir allowing a local union to bring an action under against the international union when the international did not follow the lmrda trusteeship provisions or its own constitution.the defendants considered such a legal challenge,but they were told by their counsel that their chances of success were nil.the international union had followed the law.
the defendants were left with no legal right to stand in the way of the implementation of seiu consolidation decision.instead,they opted for an extensive,challenge with one mission to discard the charred remains of a weakened uhw while simultaneously starting a new competing local union of their own.
now,after engaging in a pattern of conduct aimed at weakening the very union they represented,the defendants assert that,under the plain language of,this strategy nonetheless deserves the law protection.they argue that congress intended that the lmrda ensure that unions are internally democratic,and yet they also seek judicial exoneration for their decidedly anarchistic methods of opposition 
their argument that the fiduciary duty of is owed only to the members of their local union fails.the plain language of the statute demonstrates that union officers owe this duty to the organization as a whole,not merely to the rank and file.inherent in this duty is a requirement that officials spend union money solely for the benefit of the organization and its members in accordance with its constitution and bylaws.a.using union resources to weaken the union itself constitutes a breach of this duty,even when the officers believe they are acting in the best interest of the members.
to determine scope,we look first to the text.s tatutory interpretation begins with the statutory text.if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent,judicial inquiry must cease.miranda anchondo,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the text of provides 
the officers of a labor organization occupy positions of trust in relation to such organization and its members as a group.it is,therefore,the duty of each such person to hold its money and property solely for the benefit of the organization and its members and to manage,invest and expend the same in accordance with its constitution and bylaws and any resolutions of the governing bodies adopted thereunder.
a emphasis added.the statutory language explicitly highlights the duty of union officers to the organization itself,not merely the union members.
even if the defendants believed they were acting in the best interest of the union members,they needed to consider their actions in relation to the interests of the union as an institution.the uhw constitution shall at all times be subordinate to the seiu constitution,which prohibits local union officers from engaging in dual unionism or assisting in efforts to disaffiliate.the defendants actions directly contravened the constitutional provisions of the union they represented.expenditures by union officers that violate the union constitutions represent the classic case of breach of fiduciary duty under section.guzman bevona,cir.we find no reason to change course merely because the union officers believed their actions indirectly benefitted members.the text of the lmrda does not suggest a defense of trust us,we know what best for our members.
otherwise,the lmrda would essentially provide an unmitigated avenue for rebellious local officers to circumvent the constitutional hierarchy of an organization like uhw.the uhw,at its founding,adopted the seiu constitution and recognized its authority that authority is meaningless if local officers can attempt to scuttle the ship on the union dime merely by invoking the putative interest of their members.
the defendants propose that despite this misconduct,seiu may pursue only one remedy injunctive relief under of the labor management relations act.see.but in a case such as this,where a malcontent officer has already resigned,the organization would have no remedy for those financial resources that the officer skimmed to assist the rebellion.we do not believe congress intended to write such a blank check for internal insurrection.
we do not decide whether imposes a duty owed to the international union itself.but see operative plasterers cement masons benjamin,when the interests of a local and its international conflict,a local union officials fiduciary duty under attaches primarily to the local union,not the international.we decide only that imposes a duty to the local union as an organization.under,the defendants owed a duty to spend uhw resources in accordance with its constitution,which shall at all times be subordinate to the international constitution.any expenditure that violates the seiu constitution including g ross disloyalty,f inancial malpractice,and engaging in dual unionism would violate this duty.the mere subjective belief that any of these overarching violations would nonetheless be justified as benefitting the membership does not absolve the defendants of liability.
we turn now to the district court jury instruction defining this duty,which we review de novo for statements of law and under abuse of discretion for its formulation.hunter county of sacramento,cir.we repeatedly have held that j ury instructions must fairly and adequately cover the issues presented,must correctly state the law,and must not be misleading.id.quoting dang cross,cir.a party is entitled to an instruction on its theory of the case only if it is supported by law and has foundation in the evidence.id.
when instructing the jury on the defendants duty to uhw under,the district court repeated the entirety of,except for the statute inapplicable final sentence,verbatim.the instruction did not tell the jury that the defendants owed any duty specifically to the international union it instructed only that,as states,the defendants had a duty to hold its money and property solely for the benefit of the organization and its members in accordance with its constitution and bylaws.because we hold that,by its plain language,created a duty that the defendants owed to their own union,the instruction did not misstate the law.
the defendants propose that even if creates a fiduciary duty to the organization,another provision of the lmrda shields them from any liability because their actions constituted protected activities.see.
whether the lmrda protects the defendants conduct is reviewed de novo whether the court properly formulated its instructions on this protection is reviewed for abuse of discretion.hunter,at.because our precedent demonstrates that the defendants engaged in conduct,not merely speech,we affirm the district court application of law and its formulation of the instructions.
the provision of the lmrda provides that e very member of any labor organization shall have the right to meet and assemble freely with other members and to express any views,arguments,or opinions.a.this section,while broad,does not provide blanket protection for all union activities a member wishes to characterize as free speech.the statute preserves the union right to adopt and enforce reasonable rules as to the responsibility of every member toward the organization as an institution and conduct that would interfere with its performance of its legal or contractual obligations.id.emphasis added.
our case law distinguishes between speech critical of a union which protects and conduct designed to impair the union ability to function which does not protect.ferguson int l ass of bridge,structural ornamental iron workers,cir.in ferguson,officers of a local union actively opposed the imposition of a trusteeship by their parent union.after the parent union imposed the trusteeship,the local officers formed a rival union and urged members of the local union to join.id.at.when the trustees filed internal misconduct charges,the officers brought an action arguing that protected their activities.id.at.
we rejected their argument.we explained that a union that has disciplined union members who established a rival union,became its leaders and promoted it,and interfered directly with the union efforts to function as an institution has not punished the members for protected free speech.id.at.the officers conduct was not free speech it was part of a pattern of conduct designed to destroy the union and to interfere with the performance of its legal obligations.id.at.the conduct was not protected by the lmrda.
we find no reason to distinguish ferguson from the case at hand.the defendants,faced with trusteeship,wrongfully engaged in a pattern of conduct designed to weaken the local union while simultaneously setting up a rival union to compete as the local union collective bargaining agent.the defendants portrayal of these obstructionist activities which included actively blocking the trustees access to uhw facilities and instructing employees to t ake everything out of the office as symbolic slumber parties goes beyond the pale.under ferguson,does not shield from liability those who engage in subversive conduct.
the lmrda does protect some of the defendants activities,such as simply speaking out in their individual member capacities.the district court carefully formulated its instructions to ensure that defendants were free to make their case within the system and were free to express their opinions as union members on the jurisdiction and trusteeship decisions.but the district court also instructed the jury,consistent with ferguson,that defendants owed a duty to uhw and seiu to refrain from obstructing or frustrating any formal decision made by seiu or uhw.the instructions adequately explained that speech alone was not the type of conduct that could constitute obstructing or frustrating,but the defendants did not have a right while employed by uhw,to plan for the creation of a union or to undermine the ability of uhw to function after their departure.
the instructions adequately protected defendants from punishment for voicing their dissenting opinions while retaining a proper explanation of defendants liability for their acts undermining uhw ability to function and for establishing a new union.the district court did not abuse its discretion in formulating a correct statement of the law to be applied once the jury had decided on the relevant facts.
before we can declare that ample evidence at trial supported the jury verdict,we must finally consider the defendants proposed authorization defense.because no union can authorize expenditures in violation of its constitution,the district court did not err in excluding this defense in its final charge to the jury.we review the district court decision de novo.dang cross,cir.
the defense of authorization derives from a general rule that c ourts are reluctant to substitute their judgment for that of union officials in the interpretation of the union governing documents.stelling,at quoting vestal hoffa,cir internal quotation marks omitted.often,if a union official act has been authorized by constitution,bylaw,resolution,or by a vote of the membership,liability under attaches only if the officer benefitted personally from the act or the act is patently unreasonable or taken in bad faith.see guzman,at local,united of carpenters joiners united of carpenters joiners,cir.
against this backdrop of judicial reluctance to intervene in union affairs,however,stands of the lmrda and a union constitution.section requires that union funds be spent only for the benefit of the organization and its members in accordance with the union constitution.see.the resolution of this conflict requires that the authorization defense apply only when the authorizing document,as john kennedy explained before passage,is not in conflict with the union constitution and.local,int l ass of bridge,structural ornamental iron workers norris,cir quoting daily cong.rec,remarks of senator john kennedy.local union officials can not assert the authorization defense when they take actions in direct conflict with,and contravention of,provisions of the constitution of the international union which remained applicable to the local.id.at.
the defendants used union resources to undermine and weaken their own union and promote a rival union.these actions contravene the seiu constitution,and,therefore,also the uhw constitution.thus,as a matter of law,no bylaw or board resolution could authorize their actions.
even assuming the defendants had a legal claim to such an instruction,the uhw executive board r
