introduction 
plaintiff danuta tuszynska,an attorney,provided legal representation to members of defendant riverside sheriffs association rsa,under the auspices of defendant riverside sheriffs association legal defense trust rsa ldt,a prepaid legal services plan that provides legal representation and related services to rsa members.plaintiff filed suit against rsa ldt,rsa,and james cunningham,a former administrator of rsa ldt,alleging that,because she is a woman,she received fewer case referrals from rsa ldt after cunningham became its administrator,and cases were instead referred to male attorneys with less experience than plaintiff.
defendants moved to strike the entire complaint under the statute the strategic lawsuit against public participation statute code civ,on the ground its allegations were based on protected petitioning activities defendants undertook on behalf of rsa members,namely,rsa ldt selection of outside panel attorneys to represent rsa members,and related decisions concerning whether and to what extent rsa ldt would fund rsa member litigation.
the trial court denied the motions,reasoning that plaintiff allegations were not based on protected petitioning activities,subd.e,but were instead based on defendants conduct in failing to refer legal work to plaintiff because she is a woman.thus,the court did not reach the second prong of the analysis it did not consider whether plaintiff had met her evidentiary burden of demonstrating a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of her gender discrimination claims.
defendants appeal,claiming the court erroneously determined that the allegations of the complaint were not based on protected activities.we agree.we conclude that plaintiff allegations were based on communications and statements defendants made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a judicial body,subd.e,namely,defendants attorney selection and litigation funding decisions on behalf of rsa members.we therefore reverse the order denying the motions and remand the matter with directions to determine whether plaintiff demonstrated a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of her gender discrimination claims.
ii.background 
a.the parties 
the rsa is the employee organization that represents law enforcement and public safety unit employees of the county of riverside in collective bargaining with the county concerning the terms and conditions of the employees employment.the rsa has around members,including deputy sheriffs,sheriff investigators,deputy coroners,correctional deputies,probation officers,and group counselors.
the rsa ldt is an trust or prepaid legal plan,which the rsa created in order to fund and provide legal representation and assistance to rsa members in civil,criminal,and administrative matters.in exchange for rsa members monthly fees,the rsa ldt pays for and provides the members with an attorney and other legal services.the rsa ldt is administered by a board of trustees,consisting of rsa members who meet monthly to discuss trust business.the rsa ldt maintains a list or a panel of qualified attorneys who may be selected to represent rsa in rsa ldt covered litigation.
cunningham is an attorney who served as the executive director of the rsa from october to february.cunningham also served as the interim administrator for the rsa ldt from november to july,with the exception of an unspecified period beginning in september,when another trust administrator served.in or about july,attorney muna busailah of stone busailah became the administrator.
plaintiff entered private practice in,following a year career as a deputy district attorney for the county of riverside.around august,scott teutscher,the legal operations manager for the rsa,and riverside county deputy sheriff duane winchell recruited plaintiff to become an rsa ldt panel member or contract attorney.plaintiff signed a contract with teutscher in september concerning the terms of her representation as a panel attorney for the rsa and the rsa ldt,and providing she would be paid per hour for her services.
plaintiff allegations 
in three causes of action,plaintiff complaint alleges that the rsa and cunningham violated plaintiff rights under the california fair employment and housing act first cause of action,and that all three defendants violated plaintiff rights under the unruh civil rights act,subd.a second cause of action and article i,section of the california constitution third cause of action.the complaint was filed in december.
plaintiff alleged that in she began representing deputy winchell in a criminal matter,and successfully concluded the winchell matter,convincing the court to reduce the sole felony charge to a misdemeanor and to dismiss a stalking charge.in,martin bruehl,the rsa ldt administrator who preceded cunningham,assigned plaintiff to represent deputy sheriff david kushner in a criminal matter.
around the to time frame,plaintiff was the only female trial attorney on the rsa ldt panel and the only panel attorney who had practiced in riverside and was familiar with the local bar and legal community.plaintiff continually advised male panel attorneys on local practices and procedures.
around november,after cunningham replaced bruehl as the administrator of the rsa ldt,plaintiff case assignments dropped almost immediately.her criminal case assignments stopped coming entirely,and she was assigned perhaps four brief administrative matters over the course of two years.for several years,she continually requested that cunningham assign her cases,to no avail,although it was apparent that the male panel attorneys were regularly assigned cases.the male panel attorneys were assigned all of the cases,criminal and administrative,that were reviewed by the rsa ldt.
in,cunningham and rsa president,pat mcnamara,came to plaintiff law office for a meeting.plaintiff believed the purpose of the meeting was to assign her more cases and increase her involvement with the rsa ldt,but instead she was ambushed and chastised at the meeting for allegedly advising former deputy david kushner to challenge mcnamara and cunningham.
in may,deputy kushner was convicted on two counts of an count information,and cunningham openly blamed plaintiff for losing deputy kushner case.cunningham refused to pay plaintiff attorney fees for representing deputy kushner in a new trial motion and during sentencing,overruling the recommendation of another rsa ldt employee to continue funding deputy kushner case.
at some point,plaintiff asked an rsa ldt staff member why cunningham would not assign her any cases,and the staffer replied that it was still a good old boys club and the staffer would try to get plaintiff more cases.plaintiff further alleged that one rsa member was not provided coverage for an administrative appeal,in part because plaintiff was his attorney,and the rsa ldt would not assign plaintiff to represent the same rsa member in another matter.
on another occasion,plaintiff was made aware that two deputy sheriffs had requested that the rsa ldt assign plaintiff to represent them,but both requests were denied and the matters were assigned to male attorneys from outside riverside county with less experience than plaintiff.plaintiff claimed the new rsa ldt administrators,stone busailah,regularly assign new rsa ldt cases to a member of their law firm,thereby garnering those fees to their firm,and.
plaintiff further alleged that the rsa ldt slandered her in settling a case on behalf of former rsa member john leseberg,who sued the rsa ldt and its staff.according to plaintiff,cunningham falsely informed the rsa ldt board of trustees that plaintiff was at fault in her handling of leseberg case,thereby authorizing a significant settlement to leseberg.finally,plaintiff alleged she stopped receiving the rsa newsletter in may,and reina canales,the only female attorney employed by the rsa,was fired by cunningham so that a male employee would replace her.
defendants anti slapp motions and plaintiff oppositions 
in february,the rsa ldt and cunningham filed an motion and rsa and cunningham filed a separate motion.both motions sought to strike plaintiff entire complaint,and each motion relied,in part,on the evidence adduced in support of the other motion.defendants claimed the allegations of the complaint arose from protected petitioning activities undertaken by cunningham and others on behalf of rsa members,namely,communications made in determining what attorneys should be selected to represent rsa members,and whether and to what extent the rsa ldt should fund litigation on behalf of rsa members.
in opposition to the motions,plaintiff submitted a declaration supporting the allegations of her complaint,and argued her complaint had nothing to do with the courtroom,nor clients,nor pending litigation,but focus es on what was happening outside the courtroom,at rsa,when plaintiff attempted to be treated in the same manner as the male panel attorneys.
d.the trial court order denying the anti slapp motions 
the trial court denied the motions on the ground that plaintiff allegations of gender discrimination did not arise from protected speech or petitioning activities under the statute.in its decision,the court wrote that the gravamen of plaintiff claims was that because she is a woman,she is not getting cases,and reasoned that plaintiff claims were based on defendants alleged conduct in failing to refer cases to her,rather than communications defendants made in connection with pending litigation.
the court also wrote that one of the other problems with applying the slapp statute here is that,because the complaint really alleges a continuing problem between plaintiff and cunningham with little impact on or intervention by third parties,there are no limits to the scope of slapp protection defendants seek.taken to its extreme,defendants argument is really that,because plaintiff had a contract to perform legal services at cunningham direction,any conversations between the two of them or any comments by cunningham about plaintiff qualify as statements made in connection with matters under consideration or review before a judicial proceeding.the staggering scope of this argument counsels caution in deciding to what extent,if any,section,subdivision e applies.the court thus concluded that plaintiff alleged exclusion from appointments is not conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right to petition.
iii.discussion 
a slapp suit seeks to chill or punish the exercise of the constitutional rights to freedom of speech and to petition the government for redress of grievances.rusheen cohen cal th,briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,fn.in enacting section,the legislature created a special motion to strike,also known as an motion,as a procedural means of disposing of slapp suits at the earliest possible stage of the litigation.gerbosi gaims,weil,west epstein,llp th.
section prescribes a process for striking a cause of action.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th.first the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity,subd.b.a defendant meets this burden by demonstrating that the act underlying the plaintiff cause of action fits one of the categories spelled out in section,subdivision e citation.navellier sletten cal th,navellier.a cause of action arises from protected activity if the defendant acts underpinning the plaintiff cause of action involve s an exercise of the right of petition or free speech.gerbosi gaims,weil,west epstein,llp,supra,th at.

jurisdiction and standard of review 
an order denying an motion is immediately appealable,subd.i,subd.a.on appeal,we review the trial court decision de novo,engaging in the same process to determine,as a matter of law,whether the defendant met its initial burden of showing the action is a slapp,and if so,whether the plaintiff met its evidentiary burden on the second step.marijanovic gray,york duffy th.
here,we conclude defendants met their burden on the first step,but the trial court reached a contrary conclusion and did not address whether plaintiff met her evidentiary burden on the second step.thus we remand the matter to the trial court to determine,in the first instance,whether plaintiff demonstrated a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of her three causes of action.see navellier,supra,cal th at.
c.the gravamen of the claim controls application of the anti slapp law 
our supreme court has recognized the statute should be broadly construed citation and that a plaintiff can not avoid operation of the statute by attempting,through artifices of pleading,to characterize an action as a garden variety tort or contract claim when in fact the claim is predicated on protected speech or petitioning activity.citation.accordingly,we disregard the labeling of the claim citation and instead examine the principal thrust or gravamen of a plaintiff cause of action to determine whether the statute applies and whether the trial court correctly ruled on the motion.citation.we assess the principal thrust by identifying t he allegedly wrongful and conduct that provides the foundation for the claim.citation.if the core conduct upon which the plaintiff claim is premised does not rest on protected speech or petitioning activity,collateral or incidental allusions to protected activity will not trigger application of the statute.citation.hylton frank rogozienski,supra,th at.
as our supreme court has stressed,the critical point is whether the plaintiff cause of action itself was based on an act in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech.citations.city of cotati cashman cal th.in other words,the defendant act underlying the plaintiff cause of action must itself have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.citation.peregrine funding,sheppard mullin richter hampton llp th.
plaintiff allegations are based on protected activities,subd.e 
defendants argue that the allegations of plaintiff three causes of action,each of which allege defendants discriminated against plaintiff by failing to assign legal cases to her because she is a woman,are based on protected speech and petitioning activities defendants undertook on behalf of rsa members,namely,defendants activities in selecting attorneys to represent rsa members in rsa ldt covered litigation,and in deciding whether and if so to what extent the rsa ldt should fund litigation on behalf of rsa members,subd.e.we agree.
first,defendants attorney selection and litigation funding decisions constitute statements or writings made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law,subd.e.as such,the decisions constitute protected speech and petitioning activities,even though they were made on behalf of rsa members and clients of the rsa ldt and not on behalf of defendants themselves.rusheen cohen,supra,cal th at act in furtherance of free speech or petitioning includes communicative conduct such as filing,funding,and prosecution of litigation briggs eden council for hope opportunity,supra,cal th at statute does not require that a defendant demonstrate that its protected statements or writings were made on its own behalf rather than,for example on behalf of its clients or the general public.
to be sure,plaintiff does not seriously dispute that defendants attorney selection and litigation funding decisions,and any communications made in connection w
