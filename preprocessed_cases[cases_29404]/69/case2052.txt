introduction 
this appeal concerns a victim restitution obligation under former penal code section the principal issues presented are whether either of the following may be offset against a criminal defendant victim restitution obligation payments to the victim by the victim insurance carrier or payments to the victim by the insurer of defendant mother to settle the victim civil action against the mother and defendant.we hold that neither payment may offset the defendant restitution obligation.
background 
respondent eric duane hamilton hamilton shot and seriously injured donald hill hill while hill performed work for hamilton and hamilton mother,lena hamilton hamilton.pursuant to a plea agreement,hamilton pleaded no contest to assault with a firearm in violation of section,subdivision a.on november,the trial court sentenced hamilton to eight years in prison,but suspended the sentence and placed him on probation for five years.the trial court imposed as a condition of hamilton probation the payment of in victim restitution.the trial court revoked and reinstated hamilton probation on numerous occasions.
sometime in early,hill sued hamilton and hamilton in a civil action for hill injuries.hamilton insurer paid hill between and to settle the claim on her behalf and obtained hill release of claims and dismissal with prejudice of the lawsuit against hamilton and hamilton.hill died sometime after the settlement.hamilton has made no restitution payments to hill or to hill successor,his mother,tina wright wright.
in march,the people sought to revoke hamilton probation for failure to pay his victim restitution obligation.at the april,probation revocation hearing,wright testified concerning the cost of hill medical care and the settlement with hamilton insurer.wright said that although her health insurance and the settlement with hamilton insurer covered some of hill medical expenses,wright incurred expenses that were not reimbursed.wright also testified that she could not reconstruct her expenses with certainty because she had lost much of the necessary documentation.
the trial court inquiry at the april,hearing focused on wright out of pocket expenses that had not been reimbursed either by her insurance or by the civil action settlement proceeds 
the court my query to you,though,is in actual out of pocket expenses,what were the actual costs for bills and everything 
wright i had my bills,i lost them on the elevator,and 
the court just tell me.
wright well,the insurance from the hospital and then from the cardiologies sic and from the psychiatrists,and other expense,and the lawyer expense,ran way over what the insurance paid.
the court i know,but you talking about the deductibles because you know if you have health insurance or hospitalization,the insurance will pay and then there is usually a percentage that is not covered.
wright the insurance paid some of it and then i had to pay a lot of it myself.
the court so i just want to know what was the total loss,money that you had to put out of your pocket 
the trial court then asked wright to provide an accounting of her out of pocket expenses but noted that it appeared hamilton restitution obligation had been satisfied 
the court this is what i would like you to do.if you can reconstruct your bills and give us a total of everything that you had to pay out of your pocket and then subtract that from the that you received,minus attorney fees,minus your deductibles on the insurance,and then please forward that to this counsel and to the prosecutor.and if it looks like it grossly out of whack here,the gentleman is still on probation,and we bring everybody back in and have a further conversation.but right now,it appears to the court that there been a restitution 
the trial court concluded by advising wright that if she did not provide an accounting of her out of pocket expenses,the court would consider hamilton restitution obligation satisfied 
the court all right,thank you very much for coming in,and if you can reconstruct your bills,if they do go over out of pocket expenses,please give a copy of your breakdown and forward it to counsel hedding and to the people.
wright all right.
the court all right,and if we do if counsel hedding and the people do hear from you,within the next two weeks,then we will assume that,you know,it over and done with,all right okay,thank you.
after the foregoing exchange,the trial court reinstated hamilton probation,under the same terms and conditions existing before the april,hearing date.the trial court minute order issued after the hearing states probation reinstated on original terms and conditions.there is no indication in the record that wright provided any further information to the court.the people appeal from the trial court oral ruling concerning hamilton restitution obligation.
discussion 
the people contend the trial court erred in offsetting any payments made by wright and hamilton insurers against hamilton restitution obligation.the people argue in the alternative that the amount of any permissible offset should have been limited to payments made by hamilton insurer to compensate hill for losses expressly covered by former section.because these issues involve questions of statutory interpretation,we review them de novo.people saephanh th,d.
appealability of the trial court order 
the people contend that the trial court oral ruling at the april,hearing offsetting hamilton victim restitution obligation against payments made by hamilton insurer and by wright insurer is appealable under subdivision a and a of section.hamilton maintains that the trial court oral ruling is not an appealable order within the meaning of section.
section delineates the people right to appeal in criminal cases.people douglas cal th,d.section,subdivision a accords the people the right to appeal from an order made after judgment,affecting the substantial rights of the people.section,subdivision a authorizes an appeal from t he imposition of an unlawful sentence and defines an unlawful sentence as the imposition of a sentence not authorized by law or the imposition of a sentence based upon an unlawful order of the court which strikes or otherwise modifies the effect of an enhancement or prior conviction,subd.a.
the trial court oral ruling at the april,hearing concerning hamilton victim restitution obligation is appealable under section,subdivision a.the april,ruling was made after the imposition of sentence on november.because the ruling effectively reduced hamilton restitution obligation,it affects a substantial right of the people.people douglas,supra,cal th at,d,order reducing felony count to misdemeanor after court suspended imposition of judgment and granted defendant probation appealable under,subd.a people minjarez d.order granting defendant credit for days spent in custody following court imposition of judgment and sentence appealable under,subd.a.the people have a substantial interest in ensuring the enforcement of victim restitution obligations,mandated both by the california constitution and by statute.an oral ruling in a criminal case,such as the one made here,may be appealed.minjarez,at.trial court oral ruling reducing defendant sentence by crediting time in custody appealable.
hamilton contends that the trial court statements regarding victim restitution were equivocal and did not constitute a final order.although the trial court did leave open the possibility for wright to present a future accounting of her out of pocket expenses and offered to bring everyone back in and have a further conversation at that time,the court made clear that the focus of any future proceedings regarding restitution would be wright out of pocket expenses,those unreimbursed by her insurance or by the settlement with hamilton.we conclude the trial court oral ruling was sufficiently explicit to serve as the basis for an appeal.because we hold that the trial court ruling is appealable under section,subdivision a,we need not address its appealability under section,subdivision a.
