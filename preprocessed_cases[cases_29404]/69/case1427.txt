this appeal arises out of an intellectual property dispute between plaintiff luke cataract and laser institute,luke and defendants james sanderson and james sanderson,llc sanderson regarding the ownership and use of two internet domain names and and an internet website the website the domain names and website were used to advertise and promote luke cosmetic surgery services while sanderson worked for luke.
luke complaint alleged that,after he resigned from luke,sanderson improperly used the domain names and website to advertise and promote his solo practice,james sanderson,llc after a trial,the jury found in favor of sanderson on luke copyright infringement claim,but found in favor of luke on its six other claims,which included service mark infringement,cyberpiracy,and unfair competition.the jury awarded luke a total of in profits and actual,statutory,and punitive damages,but the district court later reduced the jury award to after concluding some damages were duplicative.the district court also awarded luke in attorney fees and in costs 
on appeal,luke argues that the district court erred by denying its motion for a new trial on its copyright infringement claim limiting the scope of its copyright to the version of the website finding that the damages awarded on its cyberpiracy and service mark infringement claims were duplicative and failing to exclude the testimony of sanderson expert witness patricia perzel.sanderson and challenges the district court denial of his motion for judgment as a matter of law on luke service mark infringement and unfair competition claims the sufficiency of the evidence to support the award of profits,punitive damages,and attorney fees to luke and the number of attorney hours in the district court attorney fees award.after review and oral argument,we vacate and remand as to the district court determination of duplicative damages,but affirm as to all other issues raised in luke appeal and sanderson.
trial evidence 
we begin by reciting the trial evidence.because one of luke copyright registrations at issue came after its complaint was filed,we outline the facts in chronological order,placing the complaint in the context of the factual events.
website launch during sanderson employment with luke 
luke is a privately owned eye care and ambulatory surgery center.in august,sanderson joined luke as a general ophthalmologist to perform eye care and cataract surgery.in,sanderson left luke to complete a fellowship in oculoplastic surgery of the face and eyes.
in january,sanderson rejoined luke as a employee and started an oculoplastic surgery practice,which was called the luke cosmetic laser center at the time,luke did not have any other doctors who performed cosmetic surgery.luke paid for the equipment and staff that sanderson needed to establish an oculoplastic surgery practice and advertised sanderson as its resident specialist in oculoplastic surgery however,luke informed sanderson that he would need to participate in advertising and promoting the practice as well.
in,sanderson worked with luke webmaster mark erickson to create an internet website to promote sanderson oculoplastic surgery practice at luke.erickson registered the domain names and to use for the website.sanderson was listed as the registrant with a luke physical address.luke paid the domain name registration and internet hosting fees while sanderson worked at luke.erickson regularly provided sanderson with backup disks containing the content of the website.
luke website contained information about luke,sanderson education and training,the surgical procedures that sanderson performed,before and after photographs of patients,surgical videos,and other information for prospective patients.luke employees took and edited some of these photographs and videos.sanderson wrote the text for the website.erickson wrote the computer code for the website.sanderson and erickson collaborated on the graphics and layout of the website.erickson placed a copyright notice on each page of luke website that stated copyright year luke cosmetic laser center,all rights reserved.
in approximately,erickson and sanderson added to the website a stylized version of the name in a blue and gold color scheme with a swoosh design to the right of the name,as shown below.
this logo appeared on the upper left corner of each page of the website.the logo served as a common navigational tool that linked the user to luke home page when clicked.
the website originally was located at the domain name but later was moved to the domain name in the domain name then was parked to the domain name so that any user visiting the domain name would be automatically redirected to luke website.luke website was linked to luke primary website.other registered domain names used to promote luke specific practices were similarly linked to luke primary website.
sanderson worked at luke for over eight years from to.luke website and logo,as well as its two domain names,were part of luke oculoplastic surgery service for over five years from to.
sanderson leaves luke,opens solo practice,and relaunches the website 
in,luke employees began to hear rumors that sanderson was planning to leave luke to open his own oculoplastic surgery practice.luke was concerned because it was planning a major renovation and expansion of its facilities used by sanderson.in may,james gills,luke founder,and bradley houser,luke administrator,met with sanderson to discuss the renovation plans.they asked sanderson about the rumors that he was planning to leave.sanderson denied the rumors and did not inform them that he was making arrangements to open his own practice.by the time of their may meeting,sanderson already had incorporated james sanderson,llc and had begun negotiating a lease for office space for his own practice.
less than a month later,on june,sanderson tendered his letter of resignation to luke.sanderson letter requested that luke pay him percent of the accounts receivable for services rendered as of may.according to administrator houser,luke accounts receivable was comprised primarily of claims from insured patients for whom luke generally received payment of only to percent of the amount owed.houser told sanderson that his request was outlandish,but sanderson demanded that luke agree that day to pay him the requested amount.sanderson also requested that luke send letters to all of his patients and post notices in luke lobby announcing that he was leaving luke to start his own practice and providing his new contact information.luke denied sanderson requests.
sanderson june,resignation letter stated that he would work for two more weeks.however,he stopped working at luke on june,even though he had a surgery scheduled that day.luke immediately began searching for sanderson replacement but did not hire a new oculoplastic surgeon until nearly two years later.
sanderson website launch in october 
after sanderson resigned from luke,he sought to transfer the administrative contact information for the domain names and website to his new solo practice.at sanderson request,the registrar of the domain names,sent an email notice to luke webmaster erickson stating that it had received a request to change the administrative contact information for the domain names from erickson to sanderson.erickson approved this change by clicking on certain links in the email,which effectively gave sanderson all control of the domain names.the registrar responded in an email to erickson,thank you for contacting.the transfer of registrant for the domain names and has been successfully completed.the new registrant is james sanderson box odessa,fl phone email todo 
sanderson also changed internet hosting companies and directed the domain names to a new internet hosting company over which sanderson had control.and the former internet hosting company used by luke for its website deleted that website content days after sanderson made the change 
sanderson used a backup copy of luke website content,which he obtained from erickson while at luke,to create a website for his new practice.sanderson hired jeff fultz to make changes to the content of the backup copy of the website so it could be relaunched.fultz updated the contact information for sanderson practice and removed the references to luke.fultz changed the watermark on the videos to display sanderson name and changed the copyright disclaimer to state that the website was copyrighted by sanderson.the rest of the content of the backup copy of the website was left the same as it was when sanderson worked at luke.sanderson stored this revised content for the website on the server of the new internet hosting company and redirected the domain names to that server.
in october,sanderson relaunched the website for his solo practice using the and domain names.in,sanderson made cosmetic changes to the color and layout and added the website to the business cards he used to advertise his solo practice.at trial,luke counsel asked sanderson,d id you contact anybody at luke after you left luke asking whether it would be acceptable for you to have the domain name and the website transferred to you sanderson responded,i did not contact someone to ask for permission for my domain name.
some time after sanderson resigned,luke realized that sanderson was using the domain names and the website content on his private practice website.specifically,in the spring of,a luke employee advised administrator houser that sanderson was using the domain names and the website for his own practice and that luke main website was still linked to the website.luke administrator houser explained,when sanderson left,we had no oculoplastics practice,so we were not marketing an oculoplastics practice and i had no occasion to go to the website,and apparently none of our staff had occasion to go to the laserspecialist website either.although luke attempted to remove the links between the two websites,some links were not discovered until this litigation was pending.and it was over three years after sanderson left and over two years after sanderson launched his own website that luke applied to register a copyright in its own website.as explained below,luke first registered the version of its website in january and later registered the version of its website in august.
d.the first copyright registration version of website 
specifically,in january,luke submitted an application to the united states copyright office to register a copyright in the february,version of the website the first application.luke listed itself as the author and claimed that the website was a work made for hire.the copyright registration form asks the applicant to b riefly describe nature of material created by this author in which copyright is claimed.emphasis added.luke claimed the e ntire web site.
the copyright registration form also has a section entitled derivative work or compilation that asks the applicant to i dentify any preexisting work or works that this work is based on or incorporates.luke answered,previous version in which claimant,luke cataract and laser institute,is owner and author.on the question asking the applicant to g ive a brief,general statement of the material that has been added to this work and in which copyright is claimed,luke wrote only,editorial revisions.
according to luke,it chose to register the february,version of the website because it wanted to use the last version of the website that sanderson edited before he resigned from luke in june.luke did not have a copy of the website content because it already had been deleted from the internet hosting company that luke used and erickson had given sanderson the backup disks.therefore,luke used an internet archive called the wayback machine to obtain the copy of the website that it filed with its copyright registration 
luke administrator houser testified that he was involved in the copyright registration process.houser reviewed the information submitted in the first application because he wanted to make sure that what we were saying was accurate.houser said luke claimed a copyright over the e ntire website in the first application because a t the time,we thought that the entire website was original material.houser conceded,however,that several things on the website were not original,such as stock photographs,sanderson thesis paper,and maps and directions from the internet website.in fact,houser,who was designated as luke corporate representative at trial,did not know which photographs on luke website were stock photographs and which were original.houser also did not know the scope of luke ownership claim in parts of the website,such as the introductory page that contained sanderson photograph and biography.houser admitted that sanderson and erickson used literature from botox to draft the botox page on luke website and that luke was not claiming a copyright in the maps and directions from,even though luke copyright registration claimed ownership of the entire website.
houser also conceded that several parts of the deposit copy,submitted with the first application,did not match the date of publication listed on the application.for example,houser testified that the page on cymetra injections was dated december,by the wayback machine internet archive and thus was not on luke website on february.houser admitted that the cymetra injections page was put on the website in december,well after sanderson left luke in june.houser described this as a clerical mistake in the first application.houser also testified that the dates on the pages obtained from the wayback machine internet archive indicated that some of the pages submitted to the copyright office were dated from earlier than february.when asked about other parts of the website,houser explained,i think what we claimed was the layout of the page and the way that it was put together.i believe that,i not a copyright expert,but i believe that constitutes something that you can claim with copyright.
on january,the copyright office registered luke copyright in the february,version of the website the first registration.
luke complaint and motion for a preliminary injunction 
a few days later,on february,luke filed a complaint against sanderson based on his conduct regarding the domain names and the website.luke alleged that sanderson infringed luke copyright in the website,in violation of the federal copyright act,a removed the copyright protection information from the website,in violation of the federal digital millenium copyright act dmca,c infringed luke service mark,in violation of the lanham act,a committed cyberpiracy by registering and using the two domain names,in violation of the anticybersquatting consumer protection act acpa,d misappropriated and converted luke two domain names under florida common law violated the florida deceptive and unfair trade practices act fdutpa,in violation of.stat.and participated in unfair competition under florida common law 
sanderson answered and counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment that luke first registration was invalid and unenforceable.sanderson also took down his website after luke filed its complaint.
after filing its complaint,luke filed a motion seeking a preliminary injunction.luke requested that the district court order sanderson to return the domain names,website content,and code to luke and enjoin sanderson from using any of the copyrighted content from the website and from accessing luke computer systems in any way.
the district court granted in part and denied in part luke motion the district court allowed sanderson to retain possession of the two domain names and use certain website content that luke stipulated was outside of its claimed copyright.the district court warned,however,that any such retention or use could be considered later in awarding damages if luke prevailed in the litigation.the district court directed sanderson to delete from his website certain content that was identified by the parties as likely owned by luke.
f.the second copyright registration version of website 
on august,seven months after filing its complaint,luke filed another application with the copyright office to register a copyright in the june,version of the website the second application.luke second application again listed itself as the author and claimed that the website was a work made for hire.luke second application,however,differed in several other respects from the first application.
first,the second copyright registration form,as did the first registration form,asked the applicant to b riefly describe the nature of the material in which copyright is claimed.luke responded,text,compilation,photos audiovisual excluding photos,text,marks and illustrations,as opposed to its claim of the e ntire website in the first application.second,unlike the first application,luke did not provide any response to questions or b in the section titled derivative work or compilation.
in response to the question,has registration for this work,or for an earlier version of this work,already been made in the copyright office in the section titled previous registration,luke answered,no.although the and versions of the website were substantially similar,luke did not mention its first registration of the website.
on september,luke submitted to the copyright office a deposit copy of the june,version of the website that it obtained from sanderson during discovery.in its transmittal letter to the copyright office,luke stated,the sample submitted with the registration application is the best available copy of the copyrightable material and represents,at best estimation,over of the copyrightable content as it was displayed on the date indicated in the application.we have been unable to locate an original copy after diligent search.on september,the copyright office registered luke copyright in the june,version of the website the second registration.
luke amended its complaint to include the second registration in its copyright infringement claim.sanderson responded that the second registration,like the first registration,was invalid.
at trial,houser reviewed the february,and the june,versions of the website and stated that the two versions were substantially similar,except for changes in the prices.when asked by sanderson counsel,so,it true,is it,that luke has registered two copies of the same website that are fundamentally the same but said that one is a february,version and the other is a june,version,correct,houser responded,yes.
sanderson and expert witnesses 
at trial,sanderson testified that he owned the website and the two domain names because he created the website content and paid the registration fees for the domain names while at luke.however,several luke employees testified that,during sanderson employment,luke paid for the development of the website,the registration fees for the domain names,and the other fees associated with the website.sanderson conceded that luke paid these bills but argued that luke charged these costs back to him as part of the overhead expenses deducted from his pay.both parties presented conflicting evidence regarding luke system of charging for overhead costs and whether luke actually charged sanderson for the costs of the registration fees and the website in the overhead charges.
several experts testified about damages and attempted to quantify the value of the domain names and the website.the evidence showed that revenues from sanderson practice at luke were flat in the two years preceding the original launch of the website and.after the website was launched,the revenues from sanderson practice at luke increased by approximately to percent for the next two years and.the evidence also showed that revenues from sanderson solo practice decreased substantially in after he took down the website that he launched in october.
in defense,sanderson presented survey data suggesting that not many of his patients at luke were referred to his oculoplastic surgery practice from the website.while at luke,sanderson asked his patients how they were referred to his practice in a questionnaire given to them before their first appointment and in person during their visit.in,only of sanderson patients said they were referred by the website.
during the charge conference,the parties discussed the issue of overlapping damages.luke argued that the jury should be instructed to consider each claim and should not be concerned with duplicative remedies.during its closing argument,luke advised the jury that the court would rectify any issue of duplicative damages,as follows 
now,you notice some of these claims are similar and the relief we seeking on some of these claims is similar,and the court court will decide later,after you make whatever award you think is appropriate,to make sure that we do get more than one recovery.we ca get more than one recovery.that will be taken care of by the court after trial.
jury verdict 
the jury returned a verdict in favor of luke on all of its claims except its copyright infringement claim.while the jury found that sanderson infringed luke copyright in portions of the website,it also found that sanderson proved that luke first and second registrations were invalid.based on the jury findings,the district court entered judgment for sanderson on luke copyright infringement claim 
the jury awarded luke damages on its other claims in the amount of in actual damages and in profits on its service mark infringement claim under the lanham act in statutory damages on its federal dmca claim in statutory damages on its cyberpiracy claim under the federal acpa no damages on its misappropriation and conversion claim under florida law in actual damages on its fdutpa claim under florida law and in actual damages and in punitive damages on its unfair competition claim under florida law.
ii.motions 
we next outline the district court rulings on the four motions being challenged on appeal and.
luke motion for a new trial 
luke filed a written motion for a new trial on its copyright infringement claim,which the district court denied.the district court observed that there was evidence and testimony from which the jury could find that luke falsely represented in its initial application to the copyright office that it owned the entire website and its contents.the district court noted that the parties disputed luke knowledge of the lack of originality of much of the content on the website and that the jury apparently resolved that dispute in favor of sanderson.the district court observed that the jury was instructed that it had to find that luke intentionally or purposefully concealed relevant information with the intent of misleading the copyright office.the district court noted that the jury heard the trial testimony and had the opportunity to review the trial exhibits,which consisted of the two registrations and the deposit materials submitted to the copyright office as well as exemplars demonstrating that many aspects of the applications were not original to plaintiff and could not have been construed to be.the district court determined that the jury determination that both of luke registrations were invalid was not against the great weight of the evidence.
sanderson two motions 
sanderson filed a written motion for judgment as a matter of law on all of luke claims and also orally moved to demand that luke elect among the remedies awarded by the jury.the district court denied sanderson motion for judgment as a matter of law but ordered luke to elect between the damages awards.over luke objections,the district court found that the in actual damages on the federal service mark infringement claim overlapped with the actual damages on the state unfair competition claim and the in statutory damages on the federal claim overlapped with the in actual damages on the state fdutpa claim given these rulings by the district court,luke elected to receive the in actual damages on the service mark infringement claim and the in statutory damages on the federal claim.on appeal,however,luke does not challenge these two findings 
rather,it challenges the district court third finding that the in actual damages on the federal service mark infringement claim were also duplicative of the in statutory damages on the claim.in the end,the district court entered final judgment of for luke,consisting of in actual damages and in profits on the federal service mark infringement claim in statutory damages for the federal dmca claim and in punitive damages on the state unfair competition claim the district court did not enter judgment on the in statutory damages on the federal claim because of its finding that they were duplicative.
luke motion for attorney fees 
luke moved for attorney fees and costs in connection with its service mark infringement and federal dmca claims.luke stated that its attorney fees totaled.luke requested that the district court award,which reflected a percent reduction to account for the attorney work performed in connection with its copyright infringement claim.
the district court granted luke motion for attorney fees.as to luke federal service mark infringement claim,the district court determined that this was an exceptional case.the district court relied on the jury finding on the state unfair competition claim,which was governed by the same standard as the service mark infringement claim,that luke had proven by clear and convincing evidence that sanderson actions were committed with malice or reckless indifference to luke rights.the district court also found that luke was a prevailing party on its federal dmca claim.
as to the amount of attorney fees,the district court reduced the hourly rates of luke counsel to the rates charged by luke local counsel.the district court agreed with luke that its attorney hours should be reduced by percent to exclude compensation for claims for which luke did not recover.the district court noted that luke copyright and service mark infringement claims were the most significant claims and that a substantial part of the trial was dedicated to establishing the validity of luke copyright.the district court also determined that an attorney fees award of million would be excessive in light of the recovery initially sought by luke over million,the attorney fees it requested,and luke ultimate recovery of a total of only.the district court thus reduced luke hours by an additional percent,for a total reduction of percent,and awarded it in attorney fees.
iii.discussion 
on appeal,the parties present several challenges to the district court trial and rulings.luke argues that the district court erred in denying its motion for a new trial on the copyright infringement claim limiting the scope of luke copyright over the version of the website finding that the jury damages award on its federal claim was duplicative of the award on its service mark infringement claim and admitting the testimony of sanderson expert witness patricia perzel in the,sanderson argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment as a matter of law on luke service mark infringement and unfair competition claims the evidence was insufficient to support the award of profits on the service mark infringement claim,punitive damages on the state unfair competition claim,and attorney fees on the service mark infringement and dmca claims and the district court awarded an unreasonable number of hours to luke in its attorney fees award 
after oral argument and a thorough review of the record,we affirm the district court in all respects except for its determination regarding duplicative damages.only three denial of luke motion for a new trial on the copyright infringement claim,the election among duplicative damages,and the denial of sanderson motion for judgment as a matter of further discussion.
luke motion for a new trial on the copyright infringement claim 
copyright protection attaches at the time of an author creation of an original work susceptible to copyright under a.however,an owner can not bring a cause of action for copyright infringement until the owner has complied with the copyright registration procedures in a,which include payment of fees and deposit of copies of the work.this court has recognized that the consensus among federal courts,including this circuit,is that a registration requirement is a jurisdictional prerequisite to a copyright infringement suit stuart weitzman,llc microcomputer,cir.a valid certificate of registration satisfies this jurisdictional requirement and is prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright and of the facts stated in the certificate when the registration is filed within five years after the first publication of the work.c.
a certificate of registration satisfies the registration requirement in a regardless of whether the certificate contains any inaccurate information,unless a the inaccurate information was included on the application for copyright registration with knowledge that it was inaccurate and b the inaccuracy of the information,if known,would have caused the register of copyrights to refuse registration.id.b.o missions or misrepresentations in a copyright application can render the registration invalid where there has been intentional or purposeful concealment of relevant information.original appalachian artworks,toy loft,cir.thus,there must be a showing of scienter in order to invalidate a copyright registration.id.in general,an error is immaterial if its discovery is not likely to have led the copyright office to refuse the application.data grumman.support,cir.
luke argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying its motion for a new trial because the jury finding that its first and second registrations were invalid was against the great weight of the evidence.we disagree because there was evidence from which the jury could have inferred that luke made intentional,material misrepresentations in the first and second applications and the deposit copies it submitted to the copyright office.
the testimony from bradley houser,luke administrator and representative at trial,revealed that luke made numerous misrepresentations about authorship and originality on its copyright registration applications.for example,on the first application,luke stated that it claimed a copyright over the entire february,version of the website.however,houser admitted that the february,version of the website contained numerous things that were not original,such as stock photographs,sanderson thesis paper,and maps and directions that were obtained from the website.in fact,houser still did not know which photographs were stock and which were original when he testified.despite the many items whose originality was questionable,and others that clearly were obtained from other internet sources,houser indicated that luke did not make any inquiry to determine the source of these questionable items.more importantly,luke did not disclose in its first application that it was unsure whether some of the information on the website was original or from third parties.rather,luke represented that the e ntire website was created by luke.
the deposit copy submitted with the first application revealed further misrepresentations.houser admitted that the deposit copy contained a page on cymetra injections that was added to the website after sanderson resigned from luke and was not on the website on february.in addition,houser acknowledged that the date on several pages of the deposit copy showed that they appeared on the website before february.nevertheless,luke represented to the copyright office in its first application that the date of the first publication of the work being registered was february.the date of the first publication is highly relevant because it affects whether the presumption of validity applies.
the second application also contained material misrepresentations.for example,luke responded no to the question on the copyright registration form asking,has registration for this work,or for an earlier version of this work,already been made in the copyright office luke provided this answer even though to percent of the content on the june,version of the website was the same as the february,version covered by the first registration.at trial,defense counsel showed houser both versions of the website,and houser testified that they were substantially similar.defense counsel asked houser,so,it true,is it,that luke has registered two copies of the same website that are fundamentally the same but said that they is a february,version and the other is a june,version,correct houser responded,yes.even though luke acknowledges the overwhelming similarities between the june,and february,versions,it failed to advise the copyright office of the first registration when asked if registration for this work already had been made.while there were some differences between the two registered versions of the website,the jury was free to decide as a question of fact whether these were fundamentally the same versions of the website and whether it was a material omission for luke not to disclose that it had registered substantially the same version of the website several months earlier.
luke characterizes these discrepancies as clerical errors and contends that there was no evidence that any misrepresentation or omission in the first and second applications or the deposit copies was intentional or purposeful.however,the jury could have inferred such intent from the evidence discussed above.as to the first registration,the jury could have inferred that luke knew that there were parts of the website that were not original and intentionally misrepresented to the copyright office in its first application that it had a copyright to the entire february,version of the website similarly,the jury could have inferred that luke intended to mislead the copyright office in its second application by failing to disclose that it had registered a version of the website only a few months earlier that was to percent similar in content.the jury heard the trial testimony and had copies of both registrations and deposit copies in its deliberation.it was within the province of the jury to conclude that houser characterization of the misrepresentations was not credible.
in light of this evidence,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion in denying luke motion for a new trial 
duplicative damages 
luke also argues that the district court erred in determining that the jury award of in statutory damages on luke claim overlapped with the jury award of actual compensatory damages on luke federal service mark infringement claim.the supreme court has instructed that the courts can and should preclude double recovery by an individual.eeoc,d.it is clear that no duplicating recovery of damages for the same injury may be had.white united states,cir see also conway icahn,cir where a plaintiff seeks recovery for the same damages under different legal theories,only a single recovery is allowed.
here,we conclude that the district court erred in determining that luke could not recover damages under both the acpa and the lanham act for several reasons.first,the statutory text of the acpa explicitly states that a cyberpiracy damages award is in addition to any other civil remedies otherwise available.d.specifically,d states that t he civil action established under d and any remedy available under such action,shall be in addition to any other civil action or remedy otherwise applicable.see also sporty farm sportsman,cir stating that a party might be eligible for damages under the federal trademark dilution act since there is nothing in the acpa that precludes,in cybersquatting cases,the award of damages under any law and citing d.thus,congress,by statute,has prescribed recovery under the acpa even if it is duplicative of other damages awarded.and no party argues that this statutory provision is unconstitutional.
in any event,the damage awards for luke service mark infringement and claims are not duplicative because the statutory elements of the two claims are different and,as a result,the two damages awards served different purposes,compensation for luke injury versus a sanction to deter sanderson wrongful conduct.an claim,unlike a service mark infringement claim,requires a showing of a bad faith intent to profit from a protected domain name compare d a with a indeed,the district court instructed the jury that it must find that sanderson acted in bad faith and that the jury may award statutory damages of not less than,and not more than,in your discretion against any defendants you have found to have violated the acpa that you find is necessary to penalize the defendants and deter future violations of the acpa by them.the statutory damages on luke claim thus served to sanction or punish sanderson for his bad faith conduct in order to deter future violations of the acpa by him in contrast,the actual damages on its service mark infringement claim compensated luke for its own injuries and losses thus,luke was not compensated twice for the same injury because the statutory damages award was focused on punishing sanderson for his conduct,not compensating luke for its injury.
we base this distinction not merely on the particular jury charge given in this case but on the similarity between the acpa statutory damages provision and the statutory damages provision in copyright law,which has been construed to deter and to sanction wrongful conduct.more specifically,the statutory damages provision in the acpa,d,is similar to the statutory damages provision in copyright law,c in that it allows a plaintiff to elect to receive statutory damages within a prescribed range instead of actual damages and profits.see gallo winery spider webs,cir the statutory damages provisions in the acpa,which is relatively new,are akin to the statutory damages provisions of the copyright laws.in the copyright context,we have recognized that g enerally,statutory damages are awarded when no actual damages are proven,or actual damages and profits are difficult or impossible to calculate.commc network,cir.but we have also stressed that when the infringement is willful,deterrence of future violations is a legitimate consideration because defendants must not be able to sneer in the face of copyright owners and copyright laws.id.at internal quotation marks omitted citing,inter alia,woolworth contemporary arts.likewise,in the copyright context,the supreme court has explained that deterrence is a proper consideration in a statutory damages award in order to achieve the statute goals,as follows 
a rule of liability which merely takes away the profits from an infringement would offer little discouragement to infringers.it would fall short of an effective sanction for enforcement of the copyright policy.the statutory rule,formulated after long experience,not merely compels restitution of profit and reparation for injury but also is designed to discourage wrongful conduct.the discretion of the court is wide enough to permit a resort to statutory damages for such purposes.even for uninjurious and unprofitable invasions of copyright the court may,if it deems it just,impose a liability within statutory limits to sanction and vindicate the statutory policy.
woolworth,at.at.this court similarly has stated that a district court,in awarding statutory damages in a copyright infringement action,may take into account the attitude and conduct of the parties and should consider both the willfulness of the defendant conduct and the deterrent value of the sanction imposed.commc,at quotation marks omitted.
in light of the similarities in the language of these two statutory provisions and congress intent to deter cyberpiracy other circuits have interpreted the acpa statutory damages provision to contain a deterrence element similar to copyright law.see,gallo winery,at noting that the copyright statutory damages provision is designed to discourage wrongful conduct and affirming statutory damages award of under the acpa,even though plaintiff did not suffer any actual injury quoting woolworth,at.at.we agree and conclude that an acpa statutory damages award,which serves as a sanction to deter wrongful conduct,is not duplicative of a service mark infringement actual damages award,which serves to compensate a plaintiff for his injuries.
based on all of these reasons,we vacate the district court judgment and remand with instructions for the district court to reinstate the jury award of in statutory damages in favor of luke on its claim 
sanderson motion for judgment as a matter of law 
in his,sanderson contends that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment as a matter of law on luke federal service mark infringement claim and its state unfair competition claim.both claims required luke to prove that its service mark was entitled to protection and sanderson used a similar or identical mark that was likely to confuse consumers.welding,forman,cir.a service mark is defined as any word,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof used by a person to identify and distinguish the services of one person,including a unique service,from the services of others and to indicate the source of the services,even if that source is unknown.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to,and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of,the jury verdict,we conclude that the district court did not err in its rulings.
first,luke presented sufficient evidence to support the jury finding that its name was a service mark entitled to protection under.luke used the name on each page of the website.luke focused the attention on that name by highlighting the name with blue and yellow lettering and a swoosh.several witnesses described this stylized version of the name as the logo.moreover,this logo was strategically placed in the upper left corner of each page.luke presented testimony from expert witness john pellman,a marketing professional who had been involved in the design of over websites for cosmetic surgeons,that commercial websites,including those for cosmetic surgery practices,generally are branded and that brands typically are placed in the upper left corner.pellman explained 
english,and most languages,are read from top to bottom,left to right.so,the eye of a visitor to a website is immediately drawn to the upper corner.it becomes a placement mark of where you know where you are,you can have multiple web browsers opened to different websites at the same time.so,when you go back to that particular browser and you look in the upper corner,you find the name often of the company or the website that you looking at.
this same name,in a stylized version,also served as a hot spot that linked users to the home page of the website.in addition to the branding on the website,luke used the name in numerous advertisements to market the services of the luke cosmetic laser center and luke employee sanderson.based on this evidence,the jury reasonably could have concluded that the name was used to identify luke as a source of oculoplastic surgery.
and luke presented sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that luke mark was entitled to protection.service mark protection is only available to marks that are distinctive,marks that serve the purpose of identifying the source of the goods or services.welding,at.the four categories of distinctiveness in service mark law,listed in descending order of strength,are fanciful or arbitrary,suggestive,descriptive,and generic.id.this court has noted that t he demarcation between each category is more blurred than it is definite.coach house,coach and six,cir.distinctiveness is a question of fact,whether the question is inherent distinctiveness or acquired distinctiveness.welding,at.
although the jury did not make a specific finding regarding the category of distinctiveness in which luke mark falls,the evidence was sufficient to find that the mark was,at a minimum,suggestive.a suggestive mark refers to some characteristic of the goods,but requires a leap of the imagination to get from the mark to the product.id.at.because a suggestive service mark is inherently distinctive,no proof of secondary meaning is required for it to be protectable.coach house,at.
luke presented testimony from pellman that he had never heard of a cosmetic surgeon identified as a laser specialist or ever referred to a cosmetic surgeon as a laser specialist on any of the websites he had designed.pellman commented that the term laser specialist could refer to a lasik surgeon or a dermatologist.in addition,luke administrator houser testified that he had never heard of an oculoplastic surgeon referred to as a laser specialist.the jury reasonably could have concluded from this evidence that the mark was suggestive because it does not immediately convey the nature of the services offered and requires a leap of the imagination to deduce that a laser specialist is a oculoplastic surgeon.thus,the jury could have determined that the mark was inherently distinctive and protected based on this evidence alone.
even if the jury did not find that the mark was suggestive,the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that it was a protected,descriptive mark.a descriptive mark identifies a characteristic or quality of the service or product.welding,at.pellman testified that a domain name can affect the amount of traffic a website receives and is particularly effective if it is easy to remember or describes a particular product or company.in explaining why he believed that was an effective domain name for a cosmetic surgery practice,pellman stated that the search terms that people might type into google or yahoo would often include those two words,perhaps among a few other words that they enter in,but it if it a cosmetic surgery practice and they working with lasers for surgery or for for skin conditions,then it synonymous with that type of practice.this evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the mark described a characteristic of the services performed with a laser by sanderson at the luke cosmetic laser center,such as eyelid surgery and hair removal.
if the jury found that the mark was descriptive,it also had to find that the mark had acquired secondary meaning in order for it to be protected.see coach house,at if a court finds that the term is descriptive,and hence not inherently distinctive,petitioner must establish that a secondary meaning attached before registrant began using the logo in order to obtain trade identity rights.a name has acquired secondary meaning when the primary significance of the term in the minds of the consuming public is not the product but the producer.welding,at quoting am.television commc ns am.commc ns television,cir internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original.the determination of whether a mark has acquired secondary meaning depends on the length and nature of the name use,the nature and extent of advertising and promotion of the name,the efforts of the proprietor to promote a conscious connection between the name and the business,and the degree of actual recognition by the public that the name designates the proprietor product or service.id.the existence of a secondary meaning is a question of fact.coach house,at.
the evidence was also sufficient for the jury to find that the mark had acquired secondary meaning.for nearly five years before sanderson resigned,luke used the name to advertise and promote sanderson in the luke cosmetic laser center.the stylized logo appeared on every page of the website for the latter three years of that time period.luke listed the website on numerous marketing materials for sanderson practice at luke,including billboards,fliers,brochures,and newspaper advertisements.
in addition,jennifer corrow,sanderson former cosmetic surgery assistant at luke,testified that sanderson told her to refer his cosmetic surgery patients to the website.when patients called in,corrow would refer to the website.corrow testified that a lot of the patients would say that they already had checked out the website.in fact,there was evidence that the website received significant traffic while sanderson was at luke.the jury could have inferred that the name acquired a secondary meaning of association with luke in the mind of the public based on the evidence of the length and nature of the use of the mark by luke to promote sanderson practice.thus,the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that was protected either as a suggestive or descriptive mark.
finally,luke presented sufficient evidence for the jury to find a likelihood of confusion between luke mark and the identical name used by sanderson.the likelihood of confusion is assessed by examining seven factors distinctiveness of the mark alleged to have been infringed similarity of the infringed and infringing marks similarity between the goods or services offered under the two marks similarity of the actual sales methods used by the two parties,such as their sales outlets and customer base similarity of advertising methods intent of the alleged infringer to misappropriate the proprietor good will and existence and extent of actual confusion in the consuming public.welding,at.
here,the likelihood of confusion was clear.this is not a case where one party used a mark that is arguably similar to a mark owned by another party.sanderson used the same name,the same website,and the same logo in the same manner,in basically the same format,for the same geographical market to target the same customers for the same services previously provided at luke.sanderson merely removed the references to luke,changed the contact information,and relaunched the website for his own promotion.these facts were more than sufficient for the jury to find that there was a likelihood of confusion in the public between luke protected mark and the name used by sanderson.
for all these reasons,we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict in favor of luke on its service mark infringement claim and that the district court thus did not err in denying sanderson motion for judgment as a matter of law 
iv.conclusion 
in sum,we reverse the district court judgment and remand with instructions for the district court to reinstate the jury award of in statutory damages in favor of luke on its cyberpiracy claim.we affirm the district court as to all other claims raised in luke appeal and sanderson.
affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded with instructions.

luke also named former luke webmaster mark erickson as a defendant in its complaint.at trial,luke dismissed its claims against erickson.
additionally,the district court determined that sanderson was the prevailing party on luke copyright infringement claim and awarded him in statutory attorney fees and in costs under.this district court order is the subject of a separate appeal between the same parties presently before this court in appeal and is not discussed in this opinion.
sanderson was the only doctor at luke who practiced in the luke cosmetic laser center.luke registered the fictitious name luke cosmetic laser center with the florida secretary of state and listed the owner of the name as luke cataract and laser institute,not sanderson.sanderson signed and dated the registration form.
at his deposition,sanderson defined oculoplastics as an abbreviation for ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery,which is a field of ophthalmology that originally had to do with the practice of surgery on the eyebrows and the eyelids and the lower eyelids and the orbit tissues around the eye,the tearing system,down into the nose.sanderson explained that oculoplastics had expanded over time to include facial plastic surgery and laser skin resurfacing.
the parties stipulated that sanderson began working with erickson to create the website in,but they did not specify the precise date that the website was launched.but we do know that,in,luke had a website.
there is some testimony that luke website content stayed on luke servers.however,there is also evidence that,after sanderson left,luke did not have a copy of the website and had to obtain a copy from an internet archive.

section a was enacted as part of the trademark act of,stat,which is also known as the lanham act.the anticybersquatting consumer protection act of,a,stat,amended the lanham act to include d.
luke also brought claims of service mark dilution and injury to business reputation but voluntarily dismissed those claims before trial.
the parties consented to have a magistrate judge conduct all proceedings in the district court,including the trial,entry of a final judgment,and all proceedings.thus,all rulings in this case were by the magistrate judge pursuant to this consent.
the verdict form included separate lines for findings about whether the first and second registrations were invalid.the verdict form instructed the jury that if it found that the first and second registrations were invalid,then it should not answer the questions on damages from the copyright infringement and should move on to the next claim.this was consistent with the requirement that a plaintiff must have a valid certificate of copyright registration in order to bring a copyright infringement cause of action.
the district court also rejected sanderson argument that the punitive damages award of on the state unfair competition claim and the profits award of on the federal service mark infringement claim were duplicative because the claims had different standards of proof.
luke conceded that the in actual damages awarded on the federal service mark infringement claim and the in actual damages on the state unfair competition claim were duplicative.however,luke suggested that the damages awards on both claims could survive,in part,because it sought only as damages for the loss of use of both domain names and thus the jury could have split its damage award between the federal and state claims.nevertheless,luke noted that it elected to receive the actual damages awarded on the federal service mark infringement claim,which it conceded should be reduced from to.the district court rejected luke argument that the jury intended to split its damages award between the two claims because at luke request,the district court declined to instruct the jury to adjust its damages award to avoid double recovery and luke advised the jury that it should not adjust its award to avoid double recovery.
the district court denied luke motion for reconsideration of its damages determination.
