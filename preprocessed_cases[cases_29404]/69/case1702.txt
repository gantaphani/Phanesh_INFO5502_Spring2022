introduction 
this appeal challenges an order enforcing an agreement between two siblings,aisha krechuniak sister and her brother zia jamal noorzoy brother,settling litigation concerning the failed development of a residential parcel in pebble beach.sister was awarded a stipulated judgment of against brother as provided in their memorandum of settlement.brother appeal contends that this amount includes a liquidated damages penalty of that is unenforceable under civil code section,an argument he did not make in the trial court 
we will affirm the judgment after concluding that brother has forfeited his contention.in doing so we hold that the determination of whether a contract provision is an illegal penalty or an enforceable liquidated damage clause is a question to be determined by the trial court and,on review,appellate deference to the trial court factual findings is required unless the facts are undisputed and susceptible of only one reasonable conclusion.

proceedings

the parties agree that the stipulated sum of said judgment does not constitute a penalty within the meaning of greentree financial group.execute sports.th greentree for several reasons,including but not limited to the following the stipulated sum represents less the value of the property sic located at sand dunes,pebble beach,ca,assessor parcel number,at the time sister entered into her agreement with brother.it does not include lost profits from the development of that property,interest on the money lost,nor the value of the property lost at mile drive,pebble beach,ca.additionally,sister further relinquished her right to trial during which she reasonably expected to achieve a verdict in excess of the stipulated sum.sister agrees to accept substantially less in settlement as an act of kindness towards a family member in order accommodate brother attempt to maintain his business and home,as well as the sake of his children.said stipulated judgment is designed to encourage brother to make his settlement payments on time and to compensate sister for the loss of use of the money,her relinquishment of valuable rights and claims for which a substantial likelihood of success exists.
on december,brother proposed several modifications of their settlement,asserting through counsel that the settlement was no longer binding on him because sister had breached the confidentiality provision by making statements in another action.specifically,on december,at a hearing in a probate case,brother stated to the court that sister,as executor of their mother will,had her daughter drop off a box of personal property without offering an explanation of missing items due to him under the will.sister responded that she had provided a written explanation for each item but did not wish to speak with brother in that there has been ongoing litigation with a piece of property and fraud is involved.the court directed them to talk about the missing items outside the courtroom.according to brother attorney,in the courtroom hall sister refused to discuss the estate property,saying in earshot of other attorneys and parties,i wo talk with a liar and a thief.
based on these alleged breaches of the confidentiality of the settlement,brother counsel by email proposed four changes to their settlement,namely reducing brother total obligation to,eliminating his payment of by december,requiring sister to pay if she breached the confidentiality clause a second time,and canceling brother remaining obligation if sister breached the clause a third time.
brother counsel drafted a revised settlement agreement that did not include all these proposals.he proposed maintaining brother obligation at while eliminating his initial payment of.the revision preserved paragraph quoted above as paragraph and the provision for a stipulated judgment of to be executed and held unless and until there is a default in payment.the revision proposed increasingly severe financial penalties for each breach by sister of the confidentiality provision and prohibited sister from disparaging brother.sister counsel informed brother counsel that the penalty provisions were unacceptable to sister.
according to a declaration by sister counsel dated june,brother did not make the payment or sign the settlement agreement,although in april he did send a check representing percent of his commission on one sale only.a supplemental declaration acknowledged receipt of other commission payments totaling.in the bankruptcy action,brother had neither prepared nor presented a stipulation that his settlement obligation was not dischargeable.
d.the motion to enforce the settlement 
on june,sister filed a motion to compel enforcement of the settlement under code of civil procedure section.on july,brother filed opposition stating that he did not contest that the memorandum for settlement is a valid and binding agreement,but sister motion to enforce it was premature because a the bankruptcy court had not yet approved the settlement b sister had not yet executed a general release c any judgment was subject to the bankruptcy stay.brother counsel declared on july,that the bankruptcy court had declined to enter a judgment requested by sister at a hearing on june.also,counsel had forwarded three checks totaling representing part of brother real estate commissions.in response,sister provided a transcript of the june bankruptcy court hearing 
brother oral arguments at the hearing on july,were consistent with his written opposition.significantly,he did not assert that the settlement memorandum included an illegal penalty provision.the court granted the motion to enforce the settlement pending sister signing a general release.on july,the court entered a judgment against brother for.
iii.the liquidated damages statute 
in ridgley topa thrift loan cal th,ridgley,the california supreme court explained california law has long recognized that a provision for liquidation of damages for contractual breach can under some circumstances be designed as,and operate as,a contractual forfeiture.to prevent such operation,our laws place limits on liquidated damages clauses.under the civil code,a provision by which damages for a breach of contract were determined in anticipation of breach was enforceable only if determining actual damages was impracticable or extremely difficult.civ.code.as amended in,the code continues to apply that strict standard to liquidated damages clauses in certain contracts consumer goods and services,and leases of residential real property,subds.c,d,but somewhat liberalizes the rule as to other contracts a provision in a contract liquidating the damages for breach of the contract is valid unless the party seeking to invalidate the provision establishes that the provision was unreasonable under the circumstances existing at the time the contract was made,subd.b fn.omitted 
hong somerset associates d,explained that i n response to a recommendation of the california law revision commission recommendation relating to liquidated damages,cal.law revision com,the legislature in enacted section et,which became effective july.stats,ch.the law revision commission has provided a detailed explanation of the relevant changes in section.their comments are entitled to great weight in construing statutes proposed by the commission and adopted without substantial change.pacific trust.ttee fidelity fed.sav.loan d.
what is most relevant in their explanation is that the statute was amended to provide in subdivision b a new general rule favoring the enforcement of liquidated damages provisions except against a consumer in a consumer case.in a consumer case,the prior law under former sections and,continued in subdivision d,still applies.in the cases where subdivision b applies,the burden of proof on the issue of reasonableness is on the party seeking to invalidate the liquidated damages provision.the subdivision limits the circumstances that may be taken into account in the determination of reasonableness to those in existence at the time the contract was made.the validity of the liquidated damages provision depends upon its reasonableness at the time the contract was made and not as it appears in retrospect.accordingly,the amount of damages actually suffered has no bearing on the validity of the liquidated damages provision.unlike subdivision d,subdivision b gives the parties considerable leeway in determining the damages for breach.all the circumstances existing at the time of the making of the contract are considered,including the relationship that the damages provided in the contract bear to the range of harm that reasonably could be anticipated at the time of the making of the contract.among o ther relevant considerations are the anticipation of the parties that proof of actual damages would be costly or inconvenient and the difficulty of proving causation and foreseeability our italics cal.law.revision com,supra,at.
though the versions of sections and did not specifically assign a burden of proof,by it was settled law that the burden is on the party seeking to rely upon a liquidated damage provision in a contract to plead and prove facts showing impracticability.better food markets american dist.cal d,better food markets rice schmid cal d,rice robert marsh tremper cal.the amendment shifted the evidentiary burden,with section,subdivision b now stating,a provision in a contract liquidating the damages for the breach of the contract is valid unless the party seeking to invalidate the provision establishes that the provision was unreasonable under the circumstances existing at the time the contract was made.our italics televideo system,d.
a violation of section,subdivision b,as amended,can be established by evidence that a contractual damages provision was intended by the parties to impose a penalty.ridgley,supra,cal th at.even without proof of that intent,a contractual provision may be invalid under section,subdivision b if the parties estimate of damages resulting from a contract breach is outside the range of reasonableness,either too high or too low,in light of the circumstances known at the time of the estimate.a liquidated damages clause will generally be considered unreasonable,and hence unenforceable under section b,if it bears no reasonable relationship to the range of actual damages that the parties could have anticipated would flow from a breach.ridgley,at.such contractual provisions must be distinguished from provisions intended to create an option of alternative performance.mcguire investments,llc th,mcguire.
as the law revision commission stated,demonstrating the provision is unreasonable requires consideration of existing circumstances relevant to the formation of the contract.christian,supra,th at el centro mall,llc,supra,th at.a recital in the agreement that a provision is either for penalty or liquidated damages is not conclusive,as the parties intent should be derived from the entire agreement and its surrounding circumstances.pogue kaweah power water cal,nakagawa okamoto cal,dyer.golden west iron works central iron works cal,central iron works.
