costco wholesale corporation and its third party claims administrator sedgwick claims management services collectively,costco petitioned for review of the decision of the workers compensation appeals board board affirming an award to respondent jorge chavez chavez.costco contends the award was improperly calculated using the schedule for rating permanent disabilities that was in effect before january,rather than the new schedule that went into effect on that date.we agree and annul the award.
background 
chavez was employed at a costco warehouse in novato.on june,he slipped and fell during the course of his employment,injuring his back,elbow and hip.chavez was off work for two days and then placed on light duty work,which he continued to do until he was terminated in late.
in september,chavez was evaluated by vatche cabayan,an orthopedic surgeon and qualified medical examiner.cabayan issued a report on september,in which he recommended additional treatment and upgraded chavez lifting restrictions.the report stated,the patient is not permanent and stationary at this time,and opined that chavez was expected to be permanent and stationary hopefully in the next days to days.the report did not state whether any of chavez conditions would result in permanent disability.moses jacob,issued a report on october,diagnosing chavez with back strain,joint disease,and elbow strain and declaring these conditions to be permanent and stationary.
a trial was held before a workers compensation judge wcj.one of the issues presented was whether permanent disability should be rated using the schedule that was in effect at the time of chavez injury in or the schedule that went into effect on january.the wcj issued an award that included permanent disability based on the schedule,a decision that was affirmed by the board following a petition for reconsideration.
ii.discussion 
introduction 
labor code section governs the calculation of the percentage of permanent disability.effective april,that statute was amended as part of senate bill reg.sess,a comprehensive workers compensation reform package,to require regular revisions of the permanent disability rating schedule.a new rating schedule incorporating the american medical association guides to the evaluation of permanent impairment ed.went into effect on january.this schedule superseded the rating schedule that was in effect when chavez was injured in.see state comp.ins.fund workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
section,subdivision d,provides in relevant part that t he schedule and any amendments thereto or revision thereof shall apply prospectively and shall apply to and govern only those permanent disabilities that result from compensable injuries received or occurring on and after the effective date of the adoption of the schedule.the statute then lists three exceptions to the rule that the date of injury governs the schedule to be applied.for compensable injuries occurring before,the schedule will apply when,before january,there has been either no comprehensive report or no report by a treating physician indicating the existence of permanent disability,or when the employer is not required to provide the notice required by section to the injured worker,subd.d.in other words,when any of these three circumstances have occurred before january,the percentage of permanent disability will be calculated using the earlier schedule that was in effect on the date of the injury 
the board concluded that the schedule applied to chavez injury because the report issued by cabayan on september,was a qualifying comprehensive report.it adopted a finding by the wcj that the report indicated the existence of permanent disability,but concluded that such a finding was unnecessary.the board reasoned,the correct construction of the pertinent sentence,when there has been either no comprehensive report or no report by a treating physician indicating the existence of permanent disability,requires a report by a treating physician to indicate the existence of permanent disability,while a comprehensive report does not require an indication of permanent disability.
comprehensive report 
costco asserts that the phrase indicating the existence of permanent disability applies both to a report by a treating physician and to a comprehensive report.it contends the board decision must be annulled because the report prepared by cabayan on september,did not indicate the existence of permanent disability.we agree.
the board conclusions on questions of law do not bind this court.kuykendall workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.the interpretation of section,subdivision d,and its phrase no comprehensive report or no report by a treating physician indicating the existence of permanent disability,is a legal issue subject to our de novo review kuykendall,supra,th at,d california insurance guarantee workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
in construing section,subdivision d,the board relied on the last antecedent rule of statutory construction,which generally provides that qualifying words,phrases and clauses are to be applied to the words or phrases immediately preceding and are not to be construed as extending to or including others more remote.white county of sacramento cal d.the board reasoned that the lack of a comma after the word physician in the phrase,no comprehensive report or no report by a treating physician indicating the existence of permanent disability,subd.d signifies that the legislature intended the words indicating the existence of permanent disability to apply only to the immediate report by a treating physician.evidence that a qualifying phrase is supposed to apply to all antecedents instead of only to the immediately preceding one may be found in the fact that it is separated from the antecedent by a comma.white county of sacramento,supra,cal d at,see also garcetti superior court th,d.
although grammatically sound,this interpretation of the statute is unpersuasive.the rules of grammar and canons of construction are but tools,guides to help courts determine likely legislative intent.citations.and that intent is critical.those who write statutes seek to solve human problems.fidelity to their aims requires us to approach an interpretive problem not as if it were a purely logical game,like a rubik cube,but as an effort to divine the human intent that underlies the statute.burris superior court cal th,d.
the human problem to be solved by section,subdivision d,is the rating of permanent disability.that statute provides that the new rating schedule will apply to injuries unless one of three circumstances have occurred before.one such circumstance is the preparation of a physician report indicating the existence of permanent disability.another discussed more fully below is the obligation of the employer to serve notice under section,which advises the employee of the employer position regarding the entitlement to permanent disability at the time the last payment of temporary disability is made.these two circumstances are clearly tied to a determination of permanent disability before january.we can conceive of no rational basis for the legislature to include a third comprehensive report at issue hereunless it was tethered to a similar requirement.a report written about issues other than permanent disability,or a report that considered the issue but found no permanent disability,would supply no logical basis for applying the earlier rating schedule.it makes little sense to construe the statute as chavez suggests,and hold that any report could suffice,when the syntax of the statute is amenable to a construction that requires those reports to contain an indication of permanent disability.see burris superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
the last antecedent rule does not trump these considerations.one exception to that rule exists when several words are followed by a clause which is applicable as much to the first and other words as to the last,and the natural construction of the language demands that the clause be read as applicable to all.garcetti superior court,supra,th at,d.a second exception is made when the sense of the entire act requires that a qualifying word or phr
