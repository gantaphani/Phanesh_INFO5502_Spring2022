introduction 
appellees rx depot,rx of canada,llc,carl moore,and david peoples collectively rx depot facilitated the sale of prescription drugs from canada to customers in the united states.the united states brought suit against rx depot,alleging its business practices violated provisions of the federal food,drug and cosmetic act fdca.rx depot admitted to violating the act and entered into a consent decree of permanent injunction.subsequently,the united states sought disgorgement of rx depot profits.the district court denied disgorgement,concluding it was not an available remedy under the fdca as a matter of law.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to.because the fdca invokes courts general equity jurisdiction and does not prohibit disgorgement by clear legislative command or necessary and inescapable inference,we reverse and remand.
ii.background 
rx depot helped consumers in the united states obtain prescription drugs from canada at reduced prices.a customer with a prescription from an american physician could download forms from rx depot website or visit one of rx depot storefront affiliates to order medications.rx depot then transmitted the customer forms,prescription,and payment information to cooperating canadian pharmacies.a canadian physician would rewrite the prescription,which was then filled by a canadian pharmacy and sent directly to the customer in the united states.rx depot received a ten to twelve percent commission for each sale they facilitated.
the united states filed a civil action alleging rx depot activities violated provisions of the fdca.specifically,the government alleged rx depot violated d by reimporting prescription drugs originally manufactured in the united states and a by introducing new drugs into interstate commerce without fda approval.the government sought a temporary and permanent injunction and other equitable relief.the district court entered a preliminary injunction ordering rx depot to discontinue its business activities.the parties then agreed to,and the district court approved,a consent decree of permanent injunction.in the consent decree,rx depot admitted to violating the fdca and agreed not to resume its business operations.the consent decree left to the discretion of the district court the issue of what,if any,equitable relief,including restitution disgorgement,should be awarded to the united states.
subsequently,the district court denied restitution,reasoning rx depot customers did not lose money in their transactions because they purchased medications at reduced prices.the district court initially concluded disgorgement would be an appropriate remedy.upon reconsideration,however,the district court determined disgorgement was not available under the fdca as a matter of law.although the fdca invokes courts equity jurisdiction,the district court determined the act express provision of other remedies and legislative history create a necessary and inescapable inference that congress intended to restrict courts power to order disgorgement.the united states appeals only the district court denial of disgorgement.
iii.discussion 
we review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.employers reinsurance cas,cir.the fdca provides,t he district courts of the united states and the united states courts of the territories shall have jurisdiction,for cause shown to restrain violations of the fdca.a.the issue before this court is whether this statutory grant of jurisdiction enables district courts to order disgorgement in appropriate cases.
in porter warner holding,the supreme court held when congress invokes the equity jurisdiction of courts in a statute,all the inherent equitable powers of the courts are available for the proper and complete exercise of that jurisdiction,unless the statute,by clear and valid legislative command or necessary and inescapable inference,restricts the forms of equitable relief authorized.the court in porter was examining whether a of the emergency price control act of epca permitted federal courts to order restitution of rents collected in excess of statutory maximums.id.at.the court determined restitution was authorized by the statute because a invoked courts general equity jurisdiction and the statute did not expressly or impliedly preclude restitution.id.at.moreover,the court noted because the suit involved the public interest and not merely a private controversy,courts equitable powers assume d an even broader and more flexible character.id.at.
arguably,the court decision in porter also relied in part on the broad language of a,which authorized any other order.see id.at.the court subsequent decision in mitchell robert de mario jewelry,however,demonstrates that such inclusive language is not required,d see also atchison,topeka santa fe ry.lennen,cir.in mitchell,the court determined the fair labor standards act flsa authorizes federal courts to order reimbursement of lost wages to employees who are discriminated against or unlawfully discharged for filing complaints under the act.id.at.the court relied exclusively on language in the statute granting courts authority for cause shown,to restrain violations of the flsa.id.at.the court observed that the absence of language in the statute affirmatively confirming the power of courts to order reimbursement did not preclude such relief in light of the statute grant of general equity jurisdiction.id.at.the court explained,w hen congress entrusts to an equity court the enforcement of prohibitions contained in a regulatory enactment,it must be taken to have acted cognizant of the historic power of equity to provide complete relief in the light of statutory purposes.id.at.accordingly,under porter and mitchell,when a statute invokes general equity jurisdiction,courts are permitted to utilize any equitable remedy to further the purposes of the statute absent a clear legislative command or necessary and inescapable inference restricting the remedies available.
amicus argues our analysis of the remedies available under the fdca should be guided by meghrig kfc western,instead of porter and mitchell.meghrig,d.meghrig held the grant of general equity jurisdiction in the resource conservation and recovery act rcra citizen suit provision does not authorize courts to order restitution of past cleanup costs.id.at.the plaintiff in meghrig owned property contaminated with petroleum products.id.at.after having the waste removed and disposed of,the plaintiff brought suit against a former property owner seeking recovery of cleanup costs the plaintiff had expended.id.at.in concluding the remedy was not available under rcra,the court recognized,but did not overrule,porter and mitchell holding that a statutory grant of general equity jurisdiction authorizes courts to use all traditional equitable powers.id.at.see also united states oakland cannabis buyers,d citing porter in a case decided after meghrig for the proposition that courts sitting in equity have discretion unless a statute clearly provides otherwise miller french,d same.instead,the court merely identified rcra as a statute that fit into the exceptions recognized by porter and mitchell.meghrig,at.in particular,the court determined rcra contained a clear legislative command and concluded congress did not intend to permit recovery of past cleanup costs.id.at.the court also determined the recovery of past cleanup costs was not consistent with the statutory purposes of rcra.id.at.
first,the court reasoned the clear language of rcra citizen suit provision precludes an order of restitution for past cleanup costs.id.at.rcra citizen suit provision permits suit against any person who has contributed or who is contributing to the past or present handling,storage,treatment,transportation,or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste which may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment a b.the court observed that the requirement that waste may present an imminent endangerment demonstrated the provision was directed only at harm that threatens to occur in the immediate future.meghrig,at.emphasis added.thus,it concluded,costs for the past cleanup of waste that no longer poses a danger to health or the environment are not recoverable.id.
second,the court found evidence that congress did not intend to authorize restitution of past cleanup costs in both the structure of rcra and its relation to another environmental statute.rcra prohibits citizen suits when either the epa or the state has commenced a separate enforcement action.b b c.thus,if rcra permitted restitution for past cleanup costs,it would only provide compensation in those cases in which waste problems are not severe or substantial enough to attract governmental attention.meghrig,at.the court rejected this result as wholly irrational,concluding congress could not have intended to provide compensation for individuals with minor waste problems while leaving individuals with severe or substantial waste problems without a remedy.id.
the court analysis also relied on significant differences between rcra and the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla.cercla,which was enacted several years after rcra,contains a citizen suit provision which mimics rcra and authorizes courts to order such action as may be necessary to correct violations of the act.id.at.unlike rcra,however,cercla also contains an explicit provision permitting the recovery of remediation costs.id.citing a b.the court concluded the absence of similar language in rcra compelled an inference that congress did not intend to provide past cleanup costs under rcra because it would have been unnecessary for congress to specifically enumerate the remedy in cercla if it was already encompassed within the statute grant of general equity jurisdiction.id.at.
finally,the court noted an award of past cleanup costs is inconsistent with rcra purposes.id.at.the primary purposes of rcra,according to the court,are to reduce the generation of hazardous and solid waste and ensure its proper treatment,storage,and disposal,not to effectuate the cleanup of waste sites or to compensate those who have remediated waste sites.id.
thus,rather than overruling or limiting porter and mitchell general rule that a grant of equity jurisdiction enables courts to order any form of equitable relief,meghrig merely demonstrates that a statute particular characteristics may preclude application of the rule.see meghrig,at.additionally,meghrig is distinguishable from the present case,and from porter and mitchell,because it involved a controversy between private parties relying on a statutory provision for private causes of action,not an enforcement action by the government to protect the public.as the court pointed out in porter,equitable powers assume an even broader and more flexible character in suits involving the public interest.at.thus,meghrig restrictive view of the remedies available under rcra citizen suit provision is likely due in part to the private nature of actions brought under the provision.see united states price,cir observing that,a rcra provision which authorizes the epa to bring suit to restrain violations of the act,confers upon courts broad authority to grant equitable relief.for these reasons,the general rule announced in porter,and followed by mitchell and meghrig,guides our analysis 
section a of the fdca invokes the equity jurisdiction of courts using the same statutory language the supreme court construed in mitchell to authorize all traditional equitable remedies.compare a district courts shall have jurisdiction,for cause shown to restrain violations,with district courts shall have jurisdiction,for cause shown,to restrain violations see mitchell,at.disgorgement is a traditional equitable remedy.ftc gem merch,cir.moreover,because the present action was brought by the government to protect the public health and safety,courts equitable jurisdiction under the statute assume s an even broader and more flexible character.porter,at.thus,disgorgement is available under the fdca unless there is a clear legislative command or necessary and inescapable inference prohibiting disgorgement or disgorgement is inconsistent with the purposes of the fdca.
rx depot and amicus first contend the text of the fdca limits the remedies available under the act to remedies.they argue the term restrain in a envisions stopping ongoing violations of the act or preventing future ones,not punishing past violations.thus,they urge,the remedy of disgorgement is expressly prohibited by the statute.
in mitchell,the supreme court interpreted the statutory command to restrain violations to permit the arguably remedy of restitution.at.see also atchison,at.subsequently,in meghrig,the court observed that the term restrain in rcra envisions,prohibitory injunctions.at.in that case,however,the court also relied heavily on other language expressed and implied in the statute in concluding restitution of past cleanup costs was not available.see id.at.moreover,the court did not explicitly overrule mitchell holding that remedies are permitted under a grant of authority to restrain violations.in light of these considerations,we do not think the presence of the term restrain in a statutory grant of general equity jurisdiction is dispositive evidence of congress intent to limit remedies to those that are 
rx depot and amicus also rely on united states philip morris usa,in arguing that a statutory grant of equity jurisdiction to restrain violations authorizes only remedies.in philip morris,a divided panel of the district of columbia circuit held disgorgement was not available under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico.id.at.rico authorizes district courts 
to prevent and restrain violations of rico by issuing appropriate orders,including,but not limited to ordering any person to divest himself of any interest,direct or indirect,in any enterprise imposing reasonable restrictions on the future activities or investments of any person or ordering dissolution or reorganization of any enterprise 
a.citing meghrig,the court reasoned the statutory language to prevent and restrain limited courts to ordering remedies aimed at preventing future violations of the act.id.at.but see id.at tatel,dissenting arguing that porter and mitchell,not meghrig,control.the court also relied on the fact that the remedies enumerated in the statute jurisdictional grant are all.thus,the court applied the canons noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis to conclude that any authorized remedies beyond those specifically mentioned in the statute must be similarly.id.at.but see id.at tatel,dissenting questioning the applicability of the canons in light of the statute command that the list of remedies is not exhaustive.
although we express no opinion regarding whether,or in what circumstances,disgorgement is authorized under rico,philip morris is inapposite to our decision here because the court relied on statutory language in rico not present in the fdca.see id.at in the rico act,congress provided a statute granting jurisdiction defined with the sort of limitations not present in the flsa or the epca.in any event,we note that philip morris did not question the continued validity of porter and mitchell,the cases we rely on here.see id.at ruling out disgorgement remedy using porter test 
rx depot and amicus next contend that because the fdca explicitly authorizes certain remedies,we should be reluctant to infer additional remedies.defendants and amicus fail to recognize that by granting courts general equity jurisdiction,congress authorized all traditional equitable remedies.as the court noted in mitchell,w hen congress entrusts to an equity court the enforcement of prohibitions contained in a regulatory enactment,it must be taken to have acted cognizant of the historic power of equity to provide complete relief in the light of statutory purposes.at.thus,we need not infer any remedies rather,all equitable remedies are available unless congress express provision of other remedies creates a necessary and inescapable inference that those remedies are exclusive.
in porter,the court determined the express provision of certain remedies in the epca did not create a necessary and inescapable inference limiting courts authority to order unenumerated e
