plaintiff pete thomas,a podiatrist,filed this action for a writ of traditional mandate ordering defendant who is the director of the department of health care services dhcs to reconsider his application for reenrollment as a provider of services without regard to his outstanding liability for an overpayment that a dhcs audit identified in july and that the dhcs caused to be entered summarily as a judgment in july in the alternative,he sought an order for the dhcs to provide him an opportunity to contest the audit determination on the merits.the trial court denied the petition.plaintiff has filed a timely notice of appeal.
in his own words,plaintiff is limiting his appeal only to the issue of whether the dhcs s failure to file a certificate in orange county his principal place of business to request a summary entry of judgment on the overpayment determination welf,did not affect the enforceability of the july,sacramento county judgment entered pursuant to section.we shall affirm.
the dhcs conducted audits of plaintiff records in november and may and an exit interview in may.it then mailed a notice to plaintiff attorney on july,which counsel received the next day of its determination that plaintiff owed reimbursement of all dollar amounts are rounded to the nearest for overpayments to him under two different provider numbers.this amount would be payable within days from the july,notice unless plaintiff filed a request for a hearing within days from receipt of the notice.however,plaintiff attorney did not file a request for a hearing until september.
in response to a second notice in april of the sum owing plus interest under one of the provider numbers,plaintiff attorney initially asserted that there was a pending hearing on that sum,then asserted that plaintiff had filed a request for a hearing in september to which the dhcs had not responded.the dhcs subsequently filed a certificate on july,with the clerk of the sacramento county superior court,attesting to a final administrative determination of an overpayment to plaintiff in the amount of plus in interest,from which plaintiff had not taken any appeal and which was within three years preceding the filing of the certificate,subd.a.a deputy clerk entered judgment on the same date.ibid.
the petition alleged that plaintiff did not receive a notice of entry of this sacramento county judgment and that the dhcs did not file a certificate of health care provider overpayment in orange county his principal place of business as required under section.although the dhcs contested these allegations in its answer to the petition,the appellate appendix does not include any proof of service of the sacramento county judgment or any certificate or judgment from orange county,and the dfeh does not dispute these representations in its brief.
in may,plaintiff attorney again attempted to assert in a letter to the administrative appeals unit of the dhcs that the principal amount of from was no longer due because the dhcs had failed to act on his september request for a hearing.the chief hearing officer of the dhcs responded that the dhcs had never received the request,but in any event it was untimely.however,he invited plaintiff to request a hearing to demonstrate good cause for an untimely request for a hearing on the merits of the determination 
in september,plaintiff entered into a settlement agreement with the dhcs in connection with an accusation that had alleged improper billing practices.plaintiff status as a provider had been suspended temporarily since he now agreed to the deactivation of his provider numbers for a minimum period of months.at the end of this deactivation period,plaintiff could file an application for reenrollment as a provider in connection with which the dhcs could not consider any of the allegations of the accusation.the dhcs otherwise could base its decision on the application on the circumstances existing at the time the application is submitted,without any promises or representations regarding the application being accepted being made or implied under the settlement agreement.in accord with dhcs regulations,the settlement agreement included a provision that all outstanding forms of indebtedness owed by the plaintiff to the dhcs,including all audit overpayment liability,must be paid in full before the dhcs will accept and entertain a new provider application form from the plaintiff.see,a.plaintiff alleged that he entered into the settlement agreement believing that the determination was not valid any longer 
plaintiff filed his application for reenrollment in february.the dhcs notified him in march that the application was incomplete among the deficiencies were his failure to include documentation of debts you owed to state health care programs that have not been paid in full and what arrangements have been made to fulfill the obligations.the notice specified that he must correct the deficiencies within days.the dhcs does not have any record of any response to the notice,and accordingly notified him that by operation of law his application was denied as incomplete,and he had days within which to appeal this determination.see welf,d,f,i.the dhcs does not have any record of an appeal of the denial.plaintiff filed the present petition in october.
in its opposition to the petition,the chief of the audit division attested to the destruction of all documentation that supported the audit pursuant to the division standard policies for document retention because the time to challenge the audit had long passed.another dhcs employee attested to plaintiff outstanding indebtedness to the dhcs as of december,which was including an earlier audit from in principal and interest.plaintiff had not entered into any voluntary repayment agreements as of that date.
in its ruling on the petition,the trial court noted the failure of plaintiff to file a timely administrative appeal either of the denial of his application for reenrollment,or the underlying obligation it also concluded that the sacramento county judgment on the determination of overpayment was not invalid for the failure either to serve plaintiff with notice of its entry,or to obtain a second judgment in orange county.moreover,he had an independent contractual obligation pursuant to the settlement agreement to reimburse the overpayment.it therefore denied the petition.
discussion 
plaintiff does not offer any argument on issues included in the trial court ruling and the dhcs briefing other than the claimed invalidity of the sacramento county judgment.regardless of the fact that we review issues of law de novo,it remains his duty as an appellant to demonstrate error in the trial court reasoning.independent roofing contractors california apprenticeship council th,d.we shall nonetheless reach the other issues on the merits as well.
as noted in our summary of the trial court ruling and as the dhcs asserts on appeal,there is an administrative remedy for the denial of plaintiff application that he did not exhaust before filing his petition.in the absence of any exception,the exhaustion of an administrative remedy is a jurisdictional prerequisite to resort to the courts.county of contra costa state of california d,italics added.
plaintiff has not argued the existence of any exception to this rule that might apply.to note two of the more common excuses that parties invoke,there is neither evidence that the dhcs had predetermined the resolution of his administrative appeal,nor that the administrative remedy did not comply with the standards of due process.imagistics,department of general services th,d.his petition is therefore barred procedurally.we will proceed to the merits in any event to put the issue to rest in the event of a future application for reenrollment neither party having directed us to any provision that would bar plaintiff from doing so or subsequent litigation
