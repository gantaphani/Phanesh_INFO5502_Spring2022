this appeal concerns a dispute between two businesses forte automation systems,forte,the,and full spectrum software,full spectrum,the.their dispute requires us to resolve two distinct legal issues.the first turns on whether the evidence in the record suffices to sustain the jury verdict and chiefly concerns the scope of the massachusetts consumer protection statute,chapter.see.laws ch.the other turns on whether full spectrum had a right to have its chapter claim for damages tried by a jury in federal court at all.because we decide both issues in favor of full spectrum,we affirm.
the following facts are uncontested.this dispute dates back to june of.at that time,forte executed a contract with protom international,protom.under that contract with protom,forte agreed to engineer specialized software for a proton radiation therapy station in a cancer treatment hospital.full spectrum became involved in the following way.
after forte secured the contract with protom,forte executed a subcontract to complete the project with medical instruments,doing business as civco medical solutions civco.civco,in turn,subcontracted software development services for the project to full spectrum.on or about april,however,civco pulled out of the project.and,on april,a representative from civco informed full spectrum,over email,that starting today,all work performed on the product should be billed to forte,and that forte would want a quote on the remaining work.
the next day,april,the president of full spectrum,andrew dallas,emailed the president of forte,toby henderson,to confirm that forte would be taking over management of the project.in that email,dallas told henderson,in order to make the transition,we need to get our consulting services agreement csa in place with forte along with a work order for the project.dallas attached the csa,along with full spectrum billing rates,to the email.no work order was attached.forte project manager,ed roman,replied on april,directing full spectrum to continue work on the project.
in accord with roman email,full spectrum continued to work on the project over the next several weeks.full spectrum also billed forte on april,may,and may,in the total amount of.as we discuss in more detail below,the parties also continued to work out aspects of their commercial terms.on may,forte and full spectrum signed the csa.full spectrum then sent forte the work order which contained specific details about the project and repeatedly requested that forte sign it.on may,forte presented full spectrum with a purchase order,which contained terms that were different from those in full spectrum csa and work order,and that were adverse to full spectrum on that same date,full spectrum terminated its involvement with the project.forte subsequently refused to compensate full spectrum for the work that full spectrum had completed between april and may.
on august,full spectrum,which is based in massachusetts,filed this diversity suit against forte,which is based in illinois,in federal court in the district of massachusetts.in the complaint,full spectrum alleged various claims under massachusetts law,only two of which remain at issue on appeal.these two claims are for breach of implied contract and violation of chapter.
prior to trial,full spectrum moved to submit the chapter claim to a binding jury,or,in the alternative,to an advisory jury.forte objected under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure to submitting the claim to a binding jury,arguing that there is no right to a jury trial under state or federal law for claims under chapter.the district court granted full spectrum motion without comment.
at the close of evidence,forte submitted a motion under rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure for judgment as a matter of law.in its motion,forte contended that there was not sufficient evidence to support a finding for full spectrum on either the implied contract or the chapter claim.the district court denied the motion without comment.
before the jury began deliberations,the district court instructed the jury,i have no opinion about what the facts are or what your verdict ought to be that is solely and exclusively your duty and responsibility.the jury then was given a special verdict form and returned the following verdict.the jury found forte liable for breach of implied contract and for knowing and willful violation of chapter.the jury awarded full spectrum in actual damages,without specifying whether those damages arose from the breach of implied contract,from the violation of chapter,or from some combination of the two.the jury also awarded full spectrum in punitive damages specifically based on the violation of chapter.
in entering the judgment,the district court noted that the judgment reflected a jury verdict,rather than a decision by the district court itself.forte then renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.the district court denied the motion without comment.
on appeal,forte challenges the district court denial of forte motion for judgment as a matter of law on both full spectrum implied contract claims and on its chapter claims,contending that there was not sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict on either claim.forte also challenges the district court decision to submit full spectrum chapter claim to a jury notwithstanding forte objection under rule

as noted above,the jury found that forte was liable for both breach of implied contract and for violating chapter.the jury awarded full spectrum the entire amount that full spectrum claimed in actual damages without specifically basing that award on either theory of liability.forte makes no argument that,because the damages award was aggregated,that award can not be sustained unless we sustain both theories of liability as a matter of law.in fact,at oral argument,forte expressly conceded the opposite.as a result,we may uphold the judgment for actual damages so long as there is sufficient evidence in the record to sustain either the implied contract claim or the chapter claim.moreover,the jury additionally awarded full spectrum in punitive damages,and predicated the punitive damages solely on the finding that forte chapter violation was knowing and willful.thus,the parties agree that the entire judgment encompassing the award of both actual and punitive damages can stand so long as the chapter verdict can stand.we therefore focus on whether the record provides sufficient support for the jury verdict on that claim.
chapter makes unlawful unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.laws ch.section of the statute extends its protections to business entities.id.at.chapter does not define what constitutes an unfair or deceptive act or practice.and,though the boundaries of what may qualify for consideration as a chapter violation is a question of law,whether a particular set of acts,in their factual setting,is unfair or deceptive is a question of fact.commercial union ins.seven provinces ins,cir.quoting schwanbeck fed.mogul.app.

full spectrum contends that the record suffices to show that forte knowingly and intentionally violated chapter in a number of ways we focus on only one of these ways here,in which full spectrum contends that forte violated chapter by intentionally stringing along full spectrum for forte benefit and to full spectrum detriment.see greenstein flatley.app.finding a chapter violation where defendants engaged in a pattern of conduct calculated to misrepresent the true situation to the plaintiff,keep him on a string,and make the plaintiff conclude reasonably that a deal had been made see also.eye and ear infirmary qlt phototherapeutics,cir.explaining that stringing along a counterparty to induce detrimental reliance can constitute a chapter violation because massachusetts cases recognize a need to police negotiations even those among relatively sophisticated parties to ensure that they are not unfair or deceptive citation omitted.
specifically,full spectrum contends that the record supports the finding that forte deliberately delayed and failed to sign the work order,while taking steps to induce full spectrum to believe that forte would sign it.and,full spectrum goes on to argue,the record also supports the finding that forte then attempted to leverage full spectrum financial exposure through the work it had done in order to coerce full spectrum into signing forte purchase order,which contained terms adverse to full spectrum relative to the terms that would have been binding had the work order been signed.we agree.
first,the record shows that forte was aware that full spectrum expected forte to sign the work order from the very beginning of the relationship between full spectrum and forte.from its first email to forte on april,full spectrum made clear to forte that the two of them would need to get the work order in place.in that email,full spectrum explained,w e will have to start with a block work order expressing engineering time and budget in order to allow us to continue to make progress while preparing the estimate based upon the updated requirements.
the record also provides support for finding that forte knew both that,unless the work order was signed,the csa would not take effect even if separately signed and that the csa contained terms that were important to full spectrum and favorable to it.indeed,the district court in this case found in an earlier ruling on the parties for partial summary judgment,and neither party contests,that the csa did not,on its own,constitute an enforceable contract because rather than specifying the terms of the agreement the csa was designed to incorporate such terms by reference to the work order.for example,the csa did not identify the project at issue,instead providing that full spectrum shall perform the service for the project identified in the work order which is attached hereto.and full spectrum made it clear to forte from its first email to forte that full spectrum would need to get our consulting services agreement csa in place along with a work order.
these aspects of the record are significant for the following reason.the record supportably shows that,even though forte was aware that full spectrum expected forte to sign the work order from the beginning,forte had no intention of doing so.and yet,the record supportably shows,rather than informing full spectrum at any point that it had concerns with the work order,forte actually took actions to induce full spectrum to conclude otherwise so that it would continue working for forte.
in particular,on may,toby henderson and andrew dallas,the presidents of forte and full spectrum,respectively,met in person.at that meeting,forte signed full spectrum csa.but while the signing of the csa could reasonably have been understood to indicate that forte intended to then sign the work order,forte president,toby henderson,testified at trial that he in fact had no such intention.rather,he testified that the reason he signed the csa was because a representative from protom was in the next room and henderson felt pressure to report to protom that he had a subcontractor working on the project.
then,in the weeks following the may meeting at which the csa had been signed,full spectrum continued to request that forte sign the work order.forte,however,failed to respond to full spectrum repeated requests,even though evidence in the record shows that forte knew that full spectrum was continuing to work on the project.
finally,the record shows that full spectrum eventually informed forte that full spectrum would have to leave the project if it did not receive the signed work order.at that point,forte project manager,ed roman,responded with an affirmative assurance that forte would sign the work order.specifically,roman promised full spectrum that forte would send the signed work order by the morning of may.but,notwithstanding that statement,on may,forte did not send full spectrum the signed work order.forte instead sent full spectrum a copy of forte own purchase order,which was materially less favorable to full spectrum than full spectrum csa and work order.it was at that point that full spectrum pulled out of the project.
drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict,at,we conclude that a jury reasonably could find the following.forte was aware from the first day of its relationship with full spectrum that full spectrum intended for the csa and work order together to constitute the contract between the parties.forte was also aware that the csa on its own would not become an enforceable contract unless forte signed both documents.but,even though forte had no intention of being bound by the csa,forte chose to string full spectrum along for several weeks by signing the csa and telling full spectrum that it would also sign the work order without ever doing so.and then,at the last moment,and with no attempt at discussion or negotiation,forte substituted full spectrum work order with forte own purchase order,which was materially less favorable to full spectrum.
thus,while forte contends that this case is not anything more than a dispute over whether money was owed,which would not give rise to a violation of chapter,see duclersaint fed.mortg.ass n,a jury could reasonably find that forte had strung full spectrum along in order to take advantage of full spectrum financial exposure in its attempt to replace the terms in full spectrum csa with the terms in forte purchase order.accordingly,we reject forte challenge to the district court denial of forte motion for judgment as a matter of law.
in so holding,we recognize that section of chapter subjects businesses to a stricter standard than consumers in terms of what constitutes unfair or deceptive conduct.giuffrida high country inv r.app.see also buster,at t he market is a rough and tumble place where a competitor lack of courtesy,generosity,or respect is neither uncommon nor in itself unlawful.but,one business stringing along of another to the other detriment can satisfy that stricter standard.see greenstein.app.at affirming chapter judgment where the stringing along of sophisticated plaintiff,an accounting firm,went beyond the toleration even of persons inured to the rough and tumble of the world of commerce.and,here,a reasonable jury could have found that forte conduct violated even the heightened standard that applies to conduct between business entities under chapter.
finally,while forte contends that there was not sufficient evidence to support the jury imposition of punitive damages on the chapter claim because full spectrum failed to show that forte violation of chapter was knowing and willful,forte failed to argue that its chapter violation was not knowing and willful in its rule a motion for judgment as a matter of law.thus,the issue is waived.costa urena segarra,cir.it is that arguments not made in a motion for judgment as a matter of law under rule a can not then be advanced in a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law under rule b.
