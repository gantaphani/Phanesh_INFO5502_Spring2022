california immigration consultants act ica bus,et regulates nonattorneys who offer advice or assistance to a particularly vulnerable population,immigrants seeking legal residency in the united states.plaintiffs appeal involves questions of first impression whether there is a right to a jury trial on a cause of action for violation of the ica,and whether the unclean hands doctrine may be raised as an affirmative defense to an ica cause of action.we answer the second question in the negative and partially reverse the judgment on the complaint for prejudicial error.for purposes of retrial,we confirm that there is a right to a jury trial on ica claims for damages.
defendant does not challenge the judgment against him on his.we find his issues pertaining to the judgment on the complaint either unpersuasive or moot in light of our holding in plaintiffs appeal.
factual and procedural background 
in may plaintiffs ramon mendoza,moises juarez,jose angel saldaña,maria esther reynoso,ricardo chavez and martin fernando nuño filed a complaint against jose ruesga for violation of the ica,breach of fiduciary duty and intentional infliction of emotional distress plaintiffs are admittedly undocumented immigrants.the complaint alleged ruesga acted as an immigration consultant within the meaning of the ica,and he charged each plaintiff to get them work permits and legal residence in the united states the plaintiffs allegedly learned later that they did not qualify for the benefits ruesga sought on their behalves and their applications have been or will be denied.
further,the complaint alleged ruesga violated the ica by failing to provide plaintiffs with written contracts,subd.a failing to display a required notice failing to provide them with copies of documents and completed forms,subd.a failing to post a bond with the secretary of state making false and misleading statements to plaintiffs and providing false documents in support of plaintiffs applications,subd.a and representing he had contacts inside the united states citizenship and immigration services immigration services,subd.c.the complaint prayed for civil penalties for each violation of the ica,subd.a,actual damages trebled,subd.a,and attorney fees,subd.a.although injunctive relief is available in an action under the ica,subd.a,plaintiffs did not seek such relief 
in his answer,ruesga raised the affirmative defense of unclean hands.he also filed a against plaintiffs mendoza,juarez,reynoso and chavez the arose from an incident on february,in which allegedly held ruesga against his will in reynoso office and forced him to sign two false documents in which he purportedly made admissions and agreed to pay sums of money to.
plaintiffs moved in limine to preclude a jury trial on their claim for compensatory damages under the ica.the court granted the motion,but it nonetheless later allowed a special verdict form in which the jury was required to decide ica issues.plaintiffs also moved to exclude evidence pertaining to the unclean hands defense,but the court denied the motion 
the evidence showed plaintiffs were unqualified for amnesty because they did not first come to the united states before january.generally,the evidence also showed ruesga told them he could nonetheless help them obtain legal status in this country,he had inside contacts at immigration services,and he could expunge any deportations or other impediments to obtaining amnesty.ruesga provided plaintiffs with questionnaires that sought personal information such as addresses and employment histories,and they filled them out and returned them to him.he later gave them completed application forms,which claimed they first came to this country before,and indicated where they should sign them.plaintiffs could not or did not read the applications,but signed them under penalty of perjury and sent them to immigration services.
plaintiffs eventually realized ruesga supposed contacts in immigration services would not save the day.immigration services began calling them in for interviews and demanding records showing they met the residency requirement.ruesga provided at least some of the plaintiffs with letters he signed that vouched for their character and falsely stated he had known them since,and letters from a farm labor contractor that falsely stated they worked for the company for a period beginning in.plaintiffs,however,learned those documents would not suffice and their applications were doomed.
ruesga admitted he took plaintiffs money for immigration matters,and he did not comply with procedural requirements of the ica.ruesga also admitted giving plaintiffs the questionnaires.he essentially testified,however,that he was a between plaintiffs and a molina,with whom ruesga met in tijuana or near the border.ruesga said he gave plaintiffs money to molina,but did not get a receipt.ruesga gave plaintiffs completed questionnaires to molina without reviewing them,and molina gave the completed applications to him for delivery to plaintiffs.when asked whether he gave plaintiffs letters falsely stating he had known them since,his attorney advised him to invoke the fifth amendment privilege against.
ruesga admitted telling plaintiffs their cases were guaranteed,but said he was merely relaying molina position.ruesga testified that molina told him the applications were legal,and in turn he told the plaintiffs they were legal.ruesga also testified he told a plaintiff he would not get involved unless the applications were legal because he would get burned.ruesga testified that mendoza asked him to provide false evidence.he also admitted,however,that mendoza and reynoso told him plaintiffs wanted only truthful evidence.
despite ruesga insistence the applications were legal,he argued plaintiffs had unclean hands because they knew they were unqualified for amnesty,they submitted false information in their applications,they signed applications falsely stating they came here before,and they insisted that ruesga provide them with fraudulent evidence to support their applications.
on the complaint,the jury in its special verdict found ruesga acted as an immigration consultant for plaintiffs,and he violated the ica in several procedural respects,such as by failing to provide written contracts and post a bond,but the violations were not a legal cause of plaintiffs damages.the jury also found ruesga made false and misleading statements to plaintiffs that he had contacts inside immigration service and he could erase or remove any prior record plaintiffs had with immigration authorities,and the statements were the legal cause of their damages.the jury,however,found plaintiffs unclean hands barred the recovery of damages for violation of the ica.
further,on the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action,the jury found ruesga was plaintiffs agent,he breached his duties to them,the breach was a legal cause of their damages,and their conduct did not bar recovery.the jury awarded mendoza and each of the other plaintiffs,which was of what they paid ruesga.the jury also found ruesga conduct was outrageous,but he did not intentionally cause them emotional distress.
the jury returned a second special verdict on the.the jury found the conduct toward ruesgas was not outrageous,and they did not intentionally deprive him of his freedom of movement by the use of physical barriers or physical force.
plaintiffs then moved for civil sanctions,treble damages and attorney fees under the ica.the court declined to assess any damages because an award would conflict with the jury finding on the unclean hands defense.the court,however,awarded plaintiffs a total of in civil penalties,and in statutory attorney fees and in other costs as prevailing parties.judgment was entered on july.
plaintiffs appealaunclean 
the defense of unclean hands arises from the maxim,he who comes into equity must come with clean hands.citation.the doctrine demands that a plaintiff act fairly in the matter for which he seeks a remedy.he must come into court with clean hands,and keep them clean,or he will be denied relief,regardless of the merits of his claim.winery,superior court th,d.
the doctrine of unclean hands requires unconscionable,bad faith,or inequitable conduct by the plaintiff in connection with the matter in controversy.citations.unclean hands applies when it would be inequitable to provide the plaintiff any relief,and provides a complete defense to both legal and equitable causes of action.citations.whether the defense applies in particular circumstances depends on the analogous case law,the nature of the misconduct,and the relationship of the misconduct to the claimed injuries.fladeboe american isuzu motors,th,d.
the unclean hands doctrine is not a legal or technical defense to be used as a shield against a particular element of a cause of action.rather,it is an equitable rationale for refusing a plaintiff relief where principles of fairness dictate that the plaintiff should not recover,regardless of the merits of his claim.it is available to protect the court from having its powers used to bring about an inequitable result in the litigation before it.winery,superior court,supra,th at,d.
plaintiffs contend that as a matter of law the unclean hands doctrine is inapplicable to their cause of action under the ica because it is based on ruesga violation of statutes intended to protect consumers we agree with plaintiffs.it is true that when the legislature enacts a statute forbidding certain conduct for the purpose of protecting one class of persons from the activities of another,a member of the protected class may maintain an action notwithstanding that he has shared in the illegal transaction.the protective purpose of the legislation is realized by allowing the plaintiff to maintain his action against a defendant within the class primarily to be deterred.lewis and queen ball sons cal d.
there is no published opinion pertaining to the ica,but cases in the analogous context of california unfair competition law ucl bus,et are persuasive.courts have long held that the equitable defense of unclean hands is not a defense to an unfair trade or business practices claim based on violation of a statute.to allow such a defense would be to judicially sanction the defendant for engaging in an act declared by statute to be void or against public policy.citation.it has long been the law that t he equitable doctrine of the refusal of aid to anyone with unclean hands,does not,as such,apply to actions under the unfair practices act.ticconi blue shield of california life health ins.th,d ticconi.e quitable defenses may not be asserted to wholly defeat a ucl claim since such claims arise out of unlawful conduct cortez purolator air filtration products cal th,d,cortez.

in kofsky smart and final iris d,the court held that assuming the plaintiff violated the ucl by selling cigarettes and other merchandise below cost for the purpose of injuring competitors or destroying competition,his action against the defendant for injunctive relief for the same conduct was not subject to an unclean hands defense.the court explained that since the defendant conduct was against public policy per statute,the unclean hands doctrine was inapplicable.id.at.
here,as in the ucl context,allowance of an unclean hands defense would undermine public policy.consumers seeking to legalize their status in this country have long been subject to considerable deception and outright consumer fraud for many reasons.immigrants are particularly vulnerable to fraud because of a combination of their tenuous status in this country and their lack of knowledge about their legal rights.their desire to normalize their status makes many immigrants more willing to try anything promised to them by seemingly trustworthy and knowledgeable individuals.castro,immigration consultant fraud the role of the prosecutor,legal service providers and the bar state bar.section,hereafter castro,fn.omitted.

the state bar report explains that despite enactment of the ica,fraud appeared to be increasing,particularly among undocumented aliens who are desperate to gain work authorization,amnesty or other protection from deportation.state bar report,supra,at.many nonattorneys that offered immigration services h e ld themselves out as a notario,licenciado,or abogado,terms which can connote legal training or licensure to members of the latin american immigrant community.ibid.further,some immigration consultants failed to perform work,invented fictitious immigration laws and told clients they qualified for nonexistent benefits,sold false documents to clients,and made claims of special influence with immigration officers.id.at.

we conclude that as a matter of law the unclean hands doctrine is not an affirmative defense to an ica cause of action.application of the doctrine would allow unscrupulous immigration consultants to go unpunished and undermine the protective purposes of the legislation.the dishonesty of undocumented immigrants can not be countenanced,of course,but the legislature was undoubtedly aware of that potential when it enacted the ica and subsequent amendments.see,com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill,supra,as amended june,victims include undocumented immigrants who are poor,have little knowledge of the united states legal system,and who are desperate to gain work authorization,amnesty,or other protection from deportation.yet,while consistently expanding protections for immigrants,the legislature has imposed no obligations on them or limitations on their recovery.
jury trial 
plaintiffs contend the court erred by allowing the jury to determine their claims under the ica because they are equitable in nature.we answer this question for the trial court convenience on retrial.the issue is a question of law we review independently.caira offner th,d.
the right to a jury trial is guaranteed by our constitution.cal,art.i.we have long acknowledged that the right so guaranteed,however,is the right as it existed at common law in,when the constitution was first adopted,and what that right is,is a purely historical question,a fact which is to be ascertained like any other social,political or legal fact.citations.as a general proposition,t he jury trial is a matter of right in a civil action at law,but not in equity.c k engineering contractors amber steel cal d.
if the action has to deal with ordinary rights cognizable in courts of law,it is to that extent an action at law.in determining whether the action was one triable by a jury at common law,the court is not bound by the form of the action but rather by the nature of the rights involved and the facts of the particular gist of the action.a jury trial must be granted where the gist of the action is legal,where the action is in reality cognizable at law.citation.on the other hand,if the action is essentially one in equity and the relief sought depends upon the application of equitable doctrines,the parties are not entitled to a jury trial.c k contractors amber steel,supra,cal d at.

the right to a trial by jury is fundamental and should be zealously guarded by the courts.citations.in case of doubt,the issue should be resolved in favor of preserving a litigant right to trial by jury.blanton womancare,cal d.maintenance of the jury as a body is of such importance and occupies so firm a place in our history and jurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the right to a jury trial should be scrutinized with the utmost care.beacon theatres,westover,d.
we conclude there is a right to a jury trial on an ica cause of action for damages.the ica specifically provides that a consumer may recover compensatory damages from an immigration consultant,subd.a.further,although violations of the ica include such things as an immigration consultant failure to provide a written contract or to post a bond,the statute is principally intended to combat fraud state bar report,supra,at moore,supra,at,an analogous legal action that existed in.buzard houston.in determining whether a jury trial right existed at common law as of,for purposes of a right to trial under the federal constitution seventh amendment,the united states supreme court concluded a fraud action for damages was generally enforced at law rather than equity.
the essential elements of a fraud claim are representation falsity knowledge of falsity intent to deceive and reliance and resulting damage causation.witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading.under the ica,it is unlawful for an immigration consultant to make false or misleading statements to a client,make any guarantee or promise to a client unless it is in writing and has some basis in fact,or make any statement that the immigration consultant has special influence with federal immigration authorities,subds.a c.here,for instance,the jury determined that while ruesga violated procedural requirements of the ica,plaintiffs damages arose from his fraudulent conduct.
the ica also allows for injunctive relief,which is an equitable matter pacific hills homeowners prun th,d,but an alternative request for equitable relief in an action for compensatory damages does not alter its legal nature.in such a situation,if a legal claim is joined with an equitable claim,the right to jury trial on the legal claim,including all issues common to both claims,remains intact.the right can not be abridged by characterizing the legal claim as incidental to the equitable relief sought.tull,d.the ica does not intertwine equitable relief with the assessment of damages.see chauffeurs,teamsters helpers,local terry,d.rather,each type of relief is separately authorized.a person claiming to be aggrieved by a violation of this chapter by an immigration consultant may bring a civil action for injunctive relief or damages,or both,subd.a,italics added.moreover,the injunction remedy is unhelpful to plaintiffs because they sought no such remedy.chauffeurs,teamsters helpers,local terry,at.
plaintiffs reliance on cases pertaining to the ucl et is misplaced.in hodge superior court th,d,the court held no jury trial was available in a ucl action because the ucl provides only for equitable remedies.prevailing plaintiffs are generally limited to injunctive relief and restitution.citations.damages are not available.citations.thus,the ucl is not simply a legislative conversion of a legal right into an equitable one.it is a separate equitable cause of action.italics added.in cortez,supra,cal th at pages,d,the court explained the exclusion of claims in a ucl action for compensatory damages is consistent with the overarching legislative concern to provide a streamlined procedure for the prevention of ongoing or threatened acts of unfair competition.to permit individual claims for compensatory damages to be pursued as part of such a procedure would tend to thwart this objective by requiring the court to deal with a variety of damage issues of a higher order and complexity.here,in contrast,the ica expressly authorizes an action for compensatory damages rather than limiting plaintiffs monetary recovery to restitution,or disgorgement of gains,subd.a.
plaintiffs also point out that the language of section indicates the legislature intended to provide for a court trial rather than a jury trial.it provides,if the court finds that the defendant has violated a provision of this chapter,it shall award actual damages,subd.a,italics added.the statutory language,however,is not dispositive.the constitutional right to a jury trial does not permit the legislature to confer on the courts the power of trying according to the course of chancery any question which has always been triable according to the course of the common law by a jury.citation.in other words,the legislature can not,by providing new remedies in form equitable,convert a legal right into an equitable one so as to infringe upon the right of trial by jury.wisden superior court th,d.
on retrial,ruesga is again entitled to a jury trial on plaintiffs cause of action for damages under the ica.
