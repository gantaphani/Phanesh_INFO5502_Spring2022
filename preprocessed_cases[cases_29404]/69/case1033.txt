appellants mallinckrodt,tyco international,jerry mattys,and hans stover collectively mallinckrodt appeal from a jury award to appellee ann macgregor macgregor in a gender discrimination suit.mallinckrodt charges as error denial of its motions for remittitur,new trial,and judgment as a matter of law by the district court mallinckrodt also claims that the district court abused its discretion by taking judicial notice of the company size.for the following reasons,we affirm.
statement of facts 
mallinckrodt,the company,a producer and seller of health care products,employed macgregor,who was the senior female in marketing and the only female among the three business segment directors bsds at the plymouth,minnesota facility.her compensation was significantly less than the two male bsds,and she had fewer direct reports.the company justified the higher salary for leon narem,a bsd,because he produced the most revenue,and though david baker,another bsd,accounted for the least revenue,his higher compensation was justified because he had sold his canadian company to the company in.
jerry mattys,macgregor initial supervisor,was promoted to national vice president in early.mattys reorganized his chain of command from seventeen direct reports,four of whom were female,to twelve direct reports,none of whom were female.mattys also named hans stover,formerly macgregor peer,to succeed mattys in his former post.at his first meeting,stover commented that there were too many women at the table.the remark was reported to tina cronin,the director of human resources.instead of reprimanding him,cronin told stover to be careful with such comments because they could be taken out of context.additionally,when a female manager proposed hiring a female candidate in her department,stover refused,stating that there are too many women in marketing.
stover decided to consolidate the bsd positions into one director of marketing,and,according to macgregor,held an ongoing presentation contest to determine which bsd would be promoted.stover also allowed david gast,who worked in sales rather than marketing and outside the plymouth facility,to enter the contest after it had started.although macgregor scores exceeded those of narem and gast,stover promoted gast based on his higher energy level and better rapport with others.
stover then offered macgregor a new position,director of market development.this new position had no budgetary or supervisory responsibilities.macgregor engaged in negotiations with stover and mattys about her continued employment.given her success with a recent project,macgregor requested a per year pay increase to per year,a signing bonus,the title of senior director,and confirmation that her position would lead to advancement.stover refused the signing bonus and offered only a per year pay increase.he declined the higher title because he wanted his direct reports at the same level.stover told macgregor that his offer was the best he could do.on september,macgregor left stover a message rejecting the position as offered.
meanwhile,macgregor had complained to mattys,alleging stover had discriminated against her.mattys alerted cronin,who responded by interviewing macgregor,mattys,stover,and various witnesses and by consulting with mallinckrodt counsel.cronin determined there had been no discrimination.mallinckrodt contends that the results of this investigation were communicated to macgregor,but macgregor denies such a report.
on september,stover sent a memo to mallinckrodt employees stating that macgregor was leaving the company.he offered the director of market development position to narem.narem had been making per year,and after stover acquiesced to his request for his annual merit increase,narem took the position at per year.he remained there until the plymouth facility closed on december.
on september,macgregor received a letter stating october,as her last day the letter offered her severance pay and notice of her rights under cobra.macgregor stayed until october,to launch a new product her team had created and developed.
on summary judgment,the district court dismissed all of macgregor claims against mallinckrodt except for gender discrimination under title vii of the civil rights act of title vii and all claims against mattys.after a trial,a jury awarded macgregor a total of in damages for lost wages,for lost stock options,for other damages,and in punitive damages.mallinckrodt motions for judgment as a matter of law,new trial,and remittitur were denied.however,applying the statutory damages cap under the civil rights act of,b d,the district court reduced the punitive damages award to.
ii.discussion 
a.the district court properly denied judgment as a matter of law on.there was sufficient evidence to find mallinckrodt liable 
mallinckrodt asserts that the district court erroneously denied its motion for judgment as a matter of law on macgregor claim for gender discrimination.mallinckrodt contends that macgregor rejection of the director of market development position restricts her to a constructive discharge theory to prove adverse action.
this court reviews the district court denial of mallinckrodt motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo and in the light most favorable to the jury verdict for macgregor.coffman tracker marine,cir internal citations omitted.this court will not set aside a jury verdict unless there is a complete absence of probative facts to support the verdict.browning president riverboat,cir internal citation omitted.
a prima facie case of discrimination requires the employee to present evidence of an adverse employment action brought on by the employer discriminatory motive.kerns capital graphics,cir internal citation omitted.whether there has been an adverse action is an issue of fact for a jury to determine.see kim nash finch,cir davis city of sioux city,cir.
in this case,where there is a conflict over whether macgregor quit or was fired after having received an alternative offer of employment,there are two ways the jury could have found liability.first,the jury could have found that macgregor was discharged and that her termination was motivated by her gender.see manual of model civil jury instructions for the district courts of the eighth circuit,modified.alternatively,the jury could have found that macgregor resigned under circumstances amounting to constructive discharge.see tidwell meyer bakeries,cir.because macgregor did not present evidence to support a theory of constructive discharge,the second method was not available.accordingly,the jury finding of liability equates to a finding of adverse action with discriminatory motive.
as the district court found,macgregor presented ample evidence of discrimination.she was passed over for a promotion which was instead given to a less qualified male employee.the alternate position offered to her,director of market development,had previously been discontinued as.additionally,stover two references to too many women would support a reasonable inference of discriminatory motive.
macgregor was not required to prove constructive discharge to show liability 
a constructive discharge theory of liability allows an employee to sue for discrimination even after she has voluntarily resigned.see tidwell,at.a constructive discharge occurs when an employee resigns after the employer has created an intolerable working environment in a deliberate attempt to compel such a resignation.see smith goodyear tire rubber,cir internal citation omitted.
however,where an employer offers to substitute a new job for one that has been eliminated,the employee rejection of the new job does not necessarily indicate that the employee has resigned.establishing an adverse action requires the employee to show a materially significant disadvantage including t ermination,cuts in pay or benefits,and changes that affect an employee future career prospects as well as circumstances amounting to a constructive discharge.kerns,at internal citations omitted.thus,constructive discharge is but one incident by which an employee can demonstrate an adverse action.
mallinckrodt presented evidence that could reasonably have shown that macgregor resigned and that there was no adverse action.the elimination of macgregor position may have been part of an overall streamlining of the reporting structure at the plymouth plant.the appointment of a seemingly lesser qualified male as director of marketing may have been the result not of discrimination but rather of his higher energy level and better rapport with others.moreover,macgregor refusal of the substitute offer by rejecting the position,as offered could be taken as a resignation,particularly in light of stover telling her that the last offer was the best he could do.
however,considering the facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict,we conclude that the jury finding of liability shows that macgregor was terminated and that this termination was an adverse employment action.stover notified the company that macgregor employment would end one day after she had rejected his offer.stover admission that she expected a response from him indicates that the negotiation process was ongoing and that macgregor did not resign.furthermore,mallinckrodt letter to macgregor discussed her severance pay and cobra rights,benefits typical for terminated employees.
the position that macgregor was offered was sufficiently inferior to constitute an adverse action.even though her salary would have remained the same,macgregor would have lost her supervisory and budgetary responsibilities,likely diminishing her career prospects both within and outside the company.moreover,macgregor concerns that the position was a job were confirmed when the company deemed the position one year after she had rejected it.
prior decisions of this circuit rejecting workplace discrimination claims can be factually distinguished.in smith goodyear tire rubber,cir,the trial court finding of age discrimination was reversed where the employee was one of approximately sales managers offered jobs as salespersons in different cities when their positions had been eliminated.id.at.in contrast to the employer method of choosing which sales managers to eliminate based on sales volume in goodyear,macgregor has presented sufficient evidence from which a jury could infer a plan to reduce the number of women in marketing.moreover,the employee in goodyear rejected the alternate offer because he feared he would have difficulty selling his home because of a downturn in the economy,whereas macgregor rejected the offer for reasons specific to the position.id.at.therefore,it was reasonable for her to expect mallinckrodt to respond with a better offer.in gartman gencorp,cir,this circuit reversed the district court denial of the employer motion for judgment as a matter of law involving a situation in which a female employee rejected an alternative offer.the plaintiff position would have essentially remained the same in gartman as she would have had to relocate but would also have retained her title,salary,and benefits.id.at.in rejecting the offer,she cited personal and family reasons,which the employer could not have been expected to remedy.id.at.in contrast,macgregor rejected the company offer solely because of its specific terms,allowing both parties to expect that negotiations would continue.
accordingly,we hold that a jury could have reasonably found that macgregor suffered an adverse action and could have reasonably inferred a discriminatory motive,and reject mallinckrodt argument that macgregor must prove constructive discharge 
b.the district court jury instructions do not mandate a new trial 
mallinckrodt claims the district court erred in denying its motion for a new trial based on ambiguous jury instructions.this court reviews both jury instructions and the denial of a new trial for abuse of discretion.campos,at internal citation omitted.jury instructions must fairly and adequately present the jury with the issues of law and fact appropriate to the case.id.at internal citation omitted.a new trial is appropriate where the verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence,clearly excessive,or the result of passion or prejudice.ouachita bank tosco,cir internal citations omitted.
mallinckrodt argues that jury instruction offered the jury a smorgasbord of adverse actions from which to find liability order at.constructive discharge is,however,only one method of showing an adverse action.see kerns,at internal citations omitted.therefore,an independent showing of constructive discharge is not necessary for the court to find an adverse action.see id.all of the adverse actions listed in jury instruction correctly cite decisions of this circuit.jury instruction also cautions the jury properly adverse action does not include mere inconvenience,an alteration of job responsibilities or loss of status and prestige when salary and position remain the same.nothing in this case renders this standard eighth circuit jury instruction inappropriate.
mallinckrodt also erroneously contends that the special form verdict amounted to a general verdict.where a general verdict makes it impossible to distinguish multiple claims,some of which should not have been questions for the jury,a new trial is warranted.see sunkist growers,winckler smith citrus prods,d.the fact that the parties disagreed on whether the adverse action element was based on direct or constructive discharge does not amount to multiple claims of liability.macgregor presented only one claim gender discrimination.she did not present evidence of a constructive discharge.because there is no confusion as to which adverse action the jury used to find liability,whether there was a general form verdict is irrelevant.
accordingly,because the instruction and form properly allowed the jury to choose from multiple forms of adverse action,all of which were supported by the evidence,there was no error and the motion was properly denied.
c.the district court properly entered the jury award of punitive damages 
mallinckrodt charges as error the district court denial of its motions for judgment as a matter of law,for remittitur,and for a new trial on punitive damages.mallinckrodt claims that punitive damages are unsupported by the evidence and grossly excessive.it further argues that the district court erred in taking judicial notice of the company size when imposing the statutory cap on punitive damages.for the following reasons,we reject these contentions and affirm the district court decision on the issue of punitive damages.
punitive damages are supported by the evidence 
mallinckrodt alleges that the punitive damages are not supported by the evidence and that the district court should have accordingly granted its motion for judgment as a matter of law.this court reviews denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.see webner titan distribution,cir internal citation omitted.we do,however,view the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.see gartman,at internal citation omitted.
punitive damages are appropriate against an employer that has discriminated with malice or with reckless indifference to the employee federally protected rights b.the punitive damages inquiry requires a showing of the requisite malice or reckless indifference by certain individuals as well as a showing that the employer may be held liable for the conduct of those individuals.see ogden wax works,cir citing kolstad american dental ass n,d.reckless indifference means that the defendant had knowledge that it may be acting in violation of federal law.walsh computer,cir quoting kolstad,at.an employer can be held responsible for the reckless indifference of discriminatory actions taken by those serving in a managerial capacity.id.internal citation omitted.
here,stover was acting in a managerial capacity when he made the discriminatory decision to hire a less qualified male instead of macgregor.as human resources manager,cronin was also acting in a managerial capacity when she failed to respond adequately to macgregor complaints.such behavior sufficiently shows apathy by executives toward protecting employees title vii rights.
mallinckrodt further argues that the company corporate policies require vacating the punitive damages award.a corpora
