while employed as an angiography technician by respondent proctor hospital,petitioner staub was a member of the united states army reserve.both his immediate supervisor mulally and mulally supervisor korenchuk were hostile to his military obligations.mulally gave staub disciplinary warning which included a directive requiring staub to report to her or korenchuk when his cases were completed.after receiving a report from korenchuk that staub had violated the corrective action,proctor vice president of human resources buck reviewed staub personnel file and decided to fire him.staub filed a grievance,claiming that mulally had fabricated the allegation underlying the warning out of hostility toward his military obligations,but buck adhered to her decision.staub sued proctor under the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act of userra,which forbids an employer to deny employment,reemployment,retention in employment,promotion,or any benefit of employment based on a person membership in or obligation to perform service in a uniformed service,a,and provides that liability is established if the person membership is a motivating factor in the employer action,c.he contended not that buck was motivated by hostility to his military obligations,but that mulally and korenchuk were,and that their actions influenced buck decision.a jury found proctor liable and awarded staub damages,but the seventh circuit reversed,holding that proctor was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the decisionmaker had relied on more than mulally and korenchuk advice in making her decision.
if a supervisor performs an act motivated by antimilitary animus that is intended by the supervisor to cause an adverse employment action,and if that act is a proximate cause of the ultimate employment action,then the employer is liable under userra.in construing the phrase motivating factor in the employer action,this court starts from the premise that when congress creates a federal tort it adopts the background of general tort law.see,burlington united states.intentional torts such as the one here generally require that the actor intend the consequences of an act,not simply the act itself.kawaauhau geiger.however,proctor errs in contending that an employer is not liable unless the de facto decisionmaker is motivated by discriminatory animus.so long as the earlier agent intended,for discriminatory reasons,that the adverse action occur,he has the scienter required for userra liability.moreover,it is axiomatic under tort law that the decisionmaker exercise of judgment does not prevent the earlier agent action from being the proximate cause of the harm.see hemi group,llc city of new york.nor can the ultimate decisionmaker judgment be deemed a superseding cause of the harm.see exxon,sofec.proctor approach would have an improbable consequence if an employer isolates a personnel official from its supervisors,vests the decision to take adverse employment actions in that official,and asks that official to review the employee personnel file before taking the adverse action,then the employer will be effectively shielded from discriminatory acts and recommendations of supervisors that were designed and intended to produce the adverse action.proctor also errs in arguing that a decisionmaker independent investigation,and rejection,of an employee discriminatory animus allegations should negate the effect of the prior discrimination.
applying this analysis here,the seventh circuit erred in holding that proctor was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.both mulally and korenchuk acted within the scope of their employment when they took the actions that allegedly caused buck to fire staub.there was also evidence that their actions were motivated by hostility toward staub military obligations,and that those actions were causal factors underlying buck decision.finally,there was evidence that both mulally and korenchuk had the specific intent to cause staub termination.the seventh circuit is to consider in the first instance whether the variance between the jury instruction given at trial and the rule adopted here was harmless error or should mandate a new trial.

vincent staub,petitioner proctor hospital 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit 
justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court.
we consider the circumstances under which an employer may be held liable for employment discrimination based on the discriminatory animus of an employee who influenced,but did not make,the ultimate employment decision.
petitioner vincent staub worked as an angiography technician for respondent proctor hospital until,when he was fired.staub and proctor hotly dispute the facts surrounding the firing,but because a jury found for staub in his claim of employment discrimination against proctor,we describe the facts viewed in the light most favorable to him.
while employed by proctor,staub was a member of the united states army reserve,which required him to attend drill one weekend per month and to train full time for two to three weeks a year.both janice mulally,staub immediate supervisor,and michael korenchuk,mulally supervisor,were hostile to staub military obligations.mulally scheduled staub for additional shifts without notice so that he would pa y back the department for everyone else having to bend over backwards to cover his schedule for the reserves.she also informed staub,leslie sweborg,that staub military duty had been a strain on th e department,and asked sweborg to help her get rid of him.ibid.korenchuk referred to staub military obligations as a b u nch of smoking and joking and a waste of taxpayers money.ibid.he was also aware that mulally was out to get staub.ibid.
in january,mulally issued staub a corrective action disciplinary warning for purportedly violating a company rule requiring him to stay in his work area whenever he was not working with a patient.the corrective action included a directive requiring staub to report to mulally or korenchuk when he ha d no patients and the angio cases we re complete d.at.according to staub,mulally justification for the corrective action was false for two reasons first,the company rule invoked by mulally did not exist and second,even if it did,staub did not violate it.
on april,angie day,staub,complained to linda buck,proctor vice president of human resources,and garrett mcgowan,proctor chief operating officer,about staub frequent unavailability and abruptness.mcgowan directed korenchuk and buck to create a plan that would solve staub availability problems.at.but three weeks later,before they had time to do so,korenchuk informed buck that staub had left his desk without informing a supervisor,in violation of the january corrective action.staub now contends this accusation was false he had left korenchuk a notification that he was leaving his desk.buck relied on korenchuk accusation,however,and after reviewing staub personnel file,she decided to fire him.the termination notice stated that staub had ignored the directive issued in the january corrective action.
staub challenged his firing through proctor grievance process,claiming that mulally had fabricated the allegation underlying the corrective action out of hostility toward his military obligations.buck did not follow up with mulally about this claim.after discussing the matter with another personnel officer,buck adhered to her decision.
staub sued proctor under the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act of,et,claiming that his discharge was motivated by hostility to his obligations as a military reservist.his contention was not that buck had any such hostility but that mulally and korenchuk did,and that their actions influenced buck ultimate employment decision.a jury found that staub military status was a motivating factor in proctor decision to discharge him,app,and awarded in damages.
the seventh circuit reversed,holding that proctor was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.the court observed that staub had brought a cat paw case,meaning that he sought to hold his employer liable for the animus of a supervisor who was not charged with making the ultimate employment decision,at it explained that under seventh circuit precedent,a cat paw case could not succeed unless the nondecisionmaker exercised such singular influence over the decisionmaker that the decision to terminate was the product of blind reliance.at.it then noted that buck looked beyond what mulally and korenchuk said,relying in part on her conversation with day and her review of staub personnel file.ibid.the court admit ted that buck investigation could have been more robust,since it failed to pursue staub theory that mulally fabricated the.ibid.but the court said that the singular influence rule does not require the decisionmaker to be a paragon of independence it is enough that the decisionmaker is not wholly dependent on a single source of information and conducts her own investigation into the facts relevant to the decision.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.because the undisputed evidence established that buck was not wholly dependent on the advice of korenchuk and mulally,the court held that proctor was entitled to judgment.ibid.
we granted certiorari.
the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act userra provides in relevant part as follows 
a person who is a member of or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment,reemployment,retention in employment,promotion,or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership,or obligation.a.
it elaborates further 
an employer shall be considered to have engaged in actions prohibited under subsection a,if the person membership is a motivating factor in the employer action,unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of such membership.c.
the statute is very similar to title vii,which prohibits employment discrimination because of race,color,religion,sex,or national origin and states that such discrimination is established when one of those factors was a motivating factor for any employment practice,even though other factors also motivated the practice.a,m.
the central difficulty in this case is construing the phrase motivating factor in the employer action.when the company official who makes the decision to take an adverse employment action is personally acting out of hostility to the employee membership in or obligation to a uniformed service,a motivating factor obviously exists.the problem we confront arises when that official has no discriminatory animus but is influenced by previous company action that is the product of a like animus in someone else.
in approaching this question,we start from the premise that when congress creates a federal tort it adopts the background of general tort law.see burlington united states,slip,at safeco ins.of america burr,burlington industries,ellerth.intentional torts such as this,as distinguished from negligent or reckless torts,generally require that the actor intend the consequences of an act,not simply the act itself.kawaauhau geiger.
staub contends that the fact that an unfavorable entry on the plaintiff personnel record was caused to be put there,with discriminatory animus,by mulally and korenchuk,suffices to establish the tort,even if mulally and korenchuk did not intend to cause his dismissal.but discrimination was no part of buck reason for the dismissal and while korenchuk and mulally acted with discriminatory animus,the act they committed the mere making of the reports was not a denial of initial employment,reemployment,retention in employment,promotion,or any benefit of employment,as liability under userra requires.if dismissal was not the object of mulally and korenchuk reports,it may have been their result,or even their foreseeable consequence,but that is not enough to render mulally or korenchuk responsible.
here,however,staub is seeking to hold liable not mulally and korenchuk,but their employer.perhaps,therefore,the discriminatory motive of one of the employer agents mulally or korenchuk can be aggregated with the act of another agent buck to impose liability on proctor.again we consult general principles of law,agency law,which form the background against which federal tort laws are enacted.see meyer holley,burlington,supra,at.here,however,the answer is not so clear.the restatement of agency suggests that the malicious mental state of one agent can not generally be combined with the harmful action of another agent to hold the principal liable for a tort that requires both.see restatement second agency,illustration.some of the cases involving federal torts apply that rule.see united states science applications int l,cadc chaney dreyfus service,united states philip morris usa,cadc.but another case involving a federal tort,and one involving a federal crime,hold to the contrary.see united states ex rel.harrison westinghouse savannah river,united states bank of new england.ultimately,we think it unnecessary in this case to decide what the background rule of agency law may be,since the former line of authority is suggested by the governing text,which requires that discrimination be a motivating factor in the adverse action.when a decision to fire is made with no unlawful animus on the part of the firing agent,but partly on the basis of a report prompted unbeknownst to that agent by discrimination,discrimination might perhaps be called a factor or a causal factor in the decision but it seems to us a considerable stretch to call it a motivating factor.
proctor,on the other hand,contends that the employer is not liable unless the de facto decisionmaker the technical decisionmaker or the agent for whom he is the cat paw is motivated by discriminatory animus.this avoids the aggregation of animus and adverse action,but it seems to us not the only application of general tort law that can do so.animus and responsibility for the adverse action can both be attributed to the earlier agent here,staub supervisors if the adverse action is the intended consequence of that agent discriminatory conduct.so long as the agent intends,for discriminatory reasons,that the adverse action occur,he has the scienter required to be liable under userra.and it is axiomatic under tort law that the exercise of judgment by the decisionmaker does not prevent the earlier agent action and hence the earlier agent discriminatory animus from being the proximate cause of the harm.proximate cause requires only some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged,and excludes only those link s that are too remote,purely contingent,or indirect.hemi group,llc city of new york,slip,at internal quotation marks omitted we do not think that the ultimate decisionmaker exercise of judgment automatically renders the link to the supervisor bias remote or purely contingent.the decisionmaker exercise of judgment is also a proximate cause of the employment decision,but it is common for injuries to have multiple proximate causes.see sosa.nor can the ultimate decisionmaker judgment be deemed a superseding cause of the harm.a cause can be thought superseding only if it is a cause of independent origin that was not foreseeable.exxon,sofec,internal quotation marks omitted.
moreover,the approach urged upon us by proctor gives an unlikely meaning to a provision designed to prevent employer discrimination.an employer authority to reward,punish,or dismiss is often allocated among multiple agents.the one who makes the ultimate decision does so on the basis of performance assessments by other supervisors.proctor view would have the improbable consequence that if an employer isolates a personnel official from an employee supervisors,vests the decision to take adverse employment actions in that official,and asks that official to review the employee personnel file before taking the adverse action,then the employer will be effectively shi
