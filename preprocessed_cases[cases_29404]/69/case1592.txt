the chamberlain group,chamberlain owns patent patent,an invention that improves security in garage door openers.chamberlain and johnson controls interiors llc jci,chamberlain exclusive licensee with respect to development of radio frequency transmitters for sale to automotive original equipment manufacturers,sued lear lear,charging lear transmitter with infringement of claim of the patent.after a markman hearing,a claim construction order,chamberlain group,lear,wl,initial markman order,and a modified claim construction order,chamberlain group,lear,wl,modified markman order,the united states district court for the northern district of illinois issued a preliminary injunction,chamberlain group,lear,wl,preliminary injunction order.the trial court,however,stayed that injunction for lear contracts with general motors.chamberlain group,lear,wl,partial stay order.because the district court erred in construing the claim term binary code,this court reverses the district court claim construction,vacates the preliminary injunction,and remands.
the garage door opening systems claimed in the patent comprise a transmitter generally integrated into a vehicle visor or rearview mirror and a receiver usually attached to a mechanical device that operates the garage door.the transmitter and receiver communicate via an encrypted signal on a radio frequency rf carrier.in the claimed invention,part of the signal changes with each transmission rolling or variable code.the rest of the signal remains fixed fixed code.the receiver compares the transmitted fixed code and the rolling code with stored codes to activate the door opener.
the patent improved the prior art of garage doors with an enhanced encryption system to make cracking the code more difficult for.specifically,asserted claim,and claims and from which it depends,recites the generation and transmission of a trinary code to encrypt the transmitted signal 
a transmitter for sending an encrypted signal to control an actuator,comprising 
oscillator for generating a radio frequency oscillatory signal 
apparatus for enabling the sending of an encrypted signal 
binary code generator responsive to the enabling apparatus for generating a variable binary code,said variable code being different for each enabling by the enabling device 
trinary code generator for generating a or trinary code responsive to the variable binary code and 
transmitting apparatus for modulating the radio frequency oscillatory signal with the trinary code to produce a modulated trinary coded variable radio frequency signal for operation or control of a secure actuator.
a transmitter for sending an encrypted signal to control an actuator according to claim,comprising apparatus for producing a fixed code signal and for combining said fixed code signal with a rolling code signal.
a transmitter for sending an encrypted signal to control an actuator according to claim,comprising apparatus for interleaving trinary bits derived from said fixed code signal with trinary bits derived from said rolling code signal to produce a trinary interleaved fixed and rolling code signal.
patent.claim itself includes the additional feature of producing a trinary code signal comprising trinary bits derived from both a fixed code and a rolling code,interleaved together.
the key claim construction issue on appeal is the interpretation of the word code as it is used in the patent.the district court construed four terms that require an understanding of code binary code claim,binary code generator claim,trinary code generator for generating a or trinary code responsive to the variable binary code claim,and apparatus for producing a fixed code signal and for combining said fixed code signal with a rolling code signal claim.initial markman order at.although the district court did not construe it,the meaning of trinary code is also relevant to construing code and ultimately to understanding binary code,since binary and trinary are themselves closely related terms and presumptively modify code in parallel ways.
the district court defined binary code as a code in which each code element may be either of two distinct kinds of values,which code may represent various kinds of letters and numbers including,but not limited to,a representation of a base number.id.at.on lear motion for reconsideration,the district court clarified that binary code can not encompass trinary code.modified markman order at.as for trinary code,this term is defined to some extent by the specification as a code.see patent,claim see also id.
on chamberlain motion for a preliminary injunction,the district court applied its definitions of binary code and the other disputed terms to lear transmitter.lear characterized its transmitter as using only trinary numbers and trinary algorithms,therefore operating in trinary code rather than binary code.the district court noted that while lear code might represent a trinary number,lear conceded that this trinary number is still represented as and in a computer.preliminary injunction order at.indeed,the parties agree that all computers necessarily operate in binary code.in other words,microprocessors and memory devices use low and high voltages to manipulate,transmit,receive,and store vast amounts of data.a low voltage represents a,while a high voltage represents a.thus the district court characterized lear trinary number,as represented in a computer,as a trinary number.id.at.on this basis,the court concluded that lear accused transmitter would likely satisfy the binary code limitation.id.at.also,according to the district court,lear admitted that its product generated trinary code,so the district court likewise concluded that lear binary and trinary codes had to be generated by binary code generators and trinary code generators,making it likely that lear product met the binary code generator and trinary code generator limitations.id.at.further finding that lear likely met the fixed code limitation of claim,the district court concluded that chamberlain would likely prevail on the merits of its infringement claim.id.at.from there,the district court evaluated the remaining parts of the traditional test for injunctive relief,see ebay,mercexchange,d,and imposed a preliminary injunction on lear,preliminary injunction order at as modified by partial stay order.
this court reviews claim construction as an issue of law without deference.cybor fas,en banc.to construe a claim term,the trial court must determine the meaning of any disputed words from the perspective of one of ordinary skill in the pertinent art at the time of filing.intrinsic evidence,that is the claims,written description,and the prosecution history of the patent,is a more reliable guide to the meaning of a claim term than are extrinsic sources like technical dictionaries,treatises,and expert testimony.phillips awh,en banc.although it is unacceptable to import limitations into a claim from the written description,the specification is always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis.usually,it is dispositive it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.id.at quoting vitronics conceptronic.
the district court defined binary code in the patent as a code in which each code element may be either of two distinct kinds of values,which code may represent various kinds of letters and numbers including,but not limited to,a representation of a base number.initial markman order at.the trial court also explained that binary code can encompass not only binary numbers,but also other numbers or symbolic designations that are represented in a system using two types of values,and s.see id.at.in other words,binary code refers to the basic form for computer expression or storage of a given number or term,rather than its meaning.under the district court interpretation,binary code could serve as a medium to express binary base numbers,trinary base numbers,decimal base numbers,or any other base for that matter,by aggregating individual bits into combinations representing numbers.
thus for the district court,lear trinary numbers were binary code,not trinary code.the significance of this distinction depends
