vida negrete filed this class action lawsuit against allianz life insurance company of north america.allianz appeals a district court order that effectively prevents it from proceeding with any settlement negotiations on similar class action claims raised in any federal or state court without first obtaining permission from negrete counsel and from finalizing a settlement in any other court that resolves,in whole or in part,the claims brought in the negrete action,without first obtaining the district court approval.we reverse.
background 
on september,vida negrete filed a class action lawsuit against allianz,an insurance corporation,in which she challenged the sale of allianz fixed deferred annuities.negrete,acting as conservator for everett ow,alleges that ow was sold an unsuitable financial product because the maturity date exceeded his life expectancy and restricted his access to principal without surrender charges.the complaint asserted claims for violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act,rico,breach of fiduciary duty,aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty,unjust enrichment,and violation of california statutes 
in november,the district court certified a nationwide class on the rico claims only and a class as to the california statutory claims.the district court certification order on the rico claims covered all allianz deferred annuities purchased by individuals aged or older within the applicable statutes of limitations this was not the only action against allianz regarding its sales of annuities several similar cases have been filed in various federal and state courts.
iorio asset marketing.was filed in march,in the united states district court,southern district of california,on behalf of a california class which purchased certain bonus annuity products.in july,the district court in iorio issued an order certifying a plaintiff class.that class partially overlaps the negrete class.
mooney allianz life insurance of north america,was filed on february,in the united states district court,district of minnesota.plaintiffs in that case sought to represent a nationwide class asserting claims under minnesota prevention of consumer fraud act and unjust enrichment.on may,the court certified a nationwide class of all purchasers of bonus annuities.negrete contends that many of the annuity transactions at issue in mooney overlap those in negrete.
castello allianz life insurance of north america,civ.no.is a certified nation wide class action that was filed on december,in the fourth judicial district court,state of minnesota.the castello class is comprised of individuals who purchased allianz cash bonus annuities.
finally,on january,the minnesota attorney general filed an action,state of minnesota allianz life insurance of north america,civ,in the fourth judicial district court,state of minnesota the ag action.the ag action seeks relief under minnesota law on behalf of minnesota residents who purchased allianz fixed deferred annuity products.that class may also partially overlap the negrete class.
on february,the parties in castello participated in a hearing in which the court asked the parties to address settlement issues.allianz indicated that it would be willing to engage in mediation discussions only if the discussions included possible settlement of mooney and the ag action.the parties in castello,the ag action and mooney were amenable to that settlement plan,and on march,they met with a mediator to commence settlement discussions.negrete counsel was neither informed of nor included in that mediation session,but learned of the proceedings from a third party.believing that settlement negotiations in mooney could possibly extend to and extinguish the claims of the class in negrete,and that allianz might be engaged in a collusive reverse auction,negrete counsel contacted allianz and requested assurances that 
any settlement negotiations or mediation in the referenced cases will not address any of the claims or damages asserted on behalf of the negrete class,that any proposed settlement reached as a result of those negotiations will not compromise,impair,prejudice or affect the claims of the negrete class members,and that any proposed settlement class will expressly exclude all members of the negrete class.
allianz declined to provide those assurances.negrete then commenced the proceedings that led to this appeal.she sought an ex parte order prohibiting allianz from 
settling,attempting to settle,negotiating,compromising,or releasing any claims,causes of action,or damages relating to any allianz deferred annuity purchased by any class member in the matter during the relevant class period,in any other forum,including but not limited to,the mooney matter,without the express approval of this court and participation of court appointed counsel in the matter.
allianz opposed the ex parte application.
on march,the district court,without holding a hearing,issued an order nominally denying the application because it was not authorized by the all writs act.how ever,the court went on to order 
any discussions of a settlement that would affect any claims brought in this litigation,other than claims of an individual plaintiff or class member,must be conducted or authorized by plaintiffs counsel.any proposed settlement that resolves,in whole or in part,the claims brought in this action shall first be subject to review and approval by the court in this litigation.
allianz appealed that order on april.
at a september,status conference,the district court ordered negrete and allianz to commence mediation.the court also indicated that it did not then intend to enforce the march order as to the other federal cases because it would be inappropriate to interfere with the dockets of the other judges.the court also suggested that it might be inclined to rescind the order,but it did not do so.later on,during a september,status conference,the district court stated that it had conferred with the judges presiding over the mooney and iorio cases and it expressed clearly to both of them that the court did not intend for any order that it entered to any way impede their ability to go forward and set settlement conferences.again,the court did not lift its own order or even state that negrete counsel were not to play a part in those other proceedings.subsequently,on october,the district court reaffirmed that it was not going to seek to enforce an order to prevent allianz from attempting to settle the other district court cases.again,it did not rescind its own order.finally,on november,the district court indicated that mediation was proceeding in mooney it did not,however,mention its own order at that point.
allianz,which is still bound by the district court order,has continued with this appeal.
standards of review 
we review a district court order granting an injunction pursuant to the all writs act for an abuse of discretion.brother records,jardine,cir.a district court abuses its discretion in issuing a preliminary injunction if its decision is based on either an erroneous legal standard or clearly erroneous factual findings,or if the injunction is overbroad.clear channel outdoor city of los angeles,cir.a district court decision is based on an erroneous legal standard if the court did not employ the appropriate legal standards that govern the issuance of a preliminary injunction or in applying the appropriate standards,the court misapprehended the law with respect to the underlying issues in the litigation.id.

jurisdiction 
at the threshold,we are met with negrete claim that we lack jurisdiction over the district court order because it was not an injunction and because,even if it was,the issue is now moot.we disagree.
we recognize that,in general,our jurisdiction extends only to final district court decisions.see dependable highway express,navigators ins,cir alsea valley alliance dep t of commerce,cir.nevertheless,a major exception to that rule is for i nterlocutory orders granting,continuing,modifying,refusing or dissolving injunctions.a see also plata davis,cir.that may not seem to dispose of negrete challenge because the district court did not denominate its order as an injunction and even denied negrete request for a temporary restraining order.but looks can be deceiving.we can not content ourselves with the surface,but must expiscate further.
simply put,we are not bound by what a district court chooses to call an order,or even by a failure to give an order a particular name.we,instead,look to the order substantial effect rather than its terminology.orange county,cal.airport hotel assocs.hongkong shanghai banking,cir.that does not mean that we take an expansive view of a.id.it does mean,however,that in deciding whether an appeal is proper,we will ask does the order have the practical effect of the grant or denial of an injunction does the order have serious,perhaps irreparable consequences and is the order one that can be effectively challenged only by immediate appeal thompson enomoto,cir see also carson am.brands,d plata,at.reviewing the order at hand,we must answer all of those questions in the affirmative.
the order enjoins allianz from even discussing settlements in other cases that could affect any claims in this litigation,without obtaining the permission of its opponent in this litigation or allowing its opponent to actually conduct the discussions it further precludes any proposed settlement of other cases without the approval of this district court.in practical effect,it was an injunction the consequences of the order are serious to say the of the other cases in which allianz is,or may be,involved can be settled by or in the other courts in which they are located absent permission of negrete counsel and the court in this case.and,of course,the order can only be challenged by immediate appeal because if allianz awaits the final determination of this case,the damage to prompt proceedings in other cases will have already been done.a decision by us months or years after that can not repair the damage.
nor does negrete attempt to characterize the order as nothing more than a scheduling order change our analysis.that is just another inventive label with no real substance.the order does not set forth a mere pretrial procedure or merely prescribe the conduct of the parties while they await trial as already explained,the order effectively precludes allianz from proceeding in other actions brought against it in other courts.in fact,the district court recognized as much when it declared that it did not presently intend to enforce the order as to certain other federal actions because it did not wish to interfere with the other judges handling of the progress of those actions at that time.
negrete seizes on those statements by the district court in suggesting a final reason that we lack.we recognize that an issue becomes moot when no controversy remains or where the parties have no real interest in the outcome as far as the law is concerned but that surely does not decide this case.this is not even a case where an order has been withdrawn so that it has no continuing effect but the parties are still contending over whether it could be,or would be,reimposed at a later time.see,adarand constructors,slater,d per curiam deakins monaghan,d.
here,the district court has never withdrawn its order,even though it recognized withdrawal as a possibility and even though allianz asked it do so.rather,the court has merely indicated that it will not now enforce the order regarding certain other federal cases because those courts have indicated that they wish to proceed and the district court is not inclined to interfere with them.we see no basis for determining that the controversy is over,that allianz is not still affected,or that no effective relief will be granted if we reverse the district court decision.again,the mere fact that the district court has not seen fit to withdraw the order itself indicates that it still considers the order to be viable and enforceable against allianz.
therefore,we have jurisdiction over this appeal.
discussion 
allianz argues that the injunction in question was not proper under the all writs act and,even if it was,it was barred by the act as far as state court proceedings are concerned.both of those arguments depend on a determination that the injunction was directed against proceedings in other courts.plainly it was.
here,again,the mere form of the injunction does not describe its true reach.in form,it is directed to allianz and allianz attorneys.in substance,it interferes with proceedings in other courts.as the supreme court stated in a case where a district court directed an injunction at a party but,in effect,stayed proceedings in a state court it is settled that the prohibition of can not be evaded by addressing the order to the parties or prohibiting utilization of the results of a completed state proceeding.atl.coast line of locomotive eng rs,d.and,in response to an argument that the act did not apply because the district court order enjoins a party rather than the tennessee proceeding itself we replied that o rdering the parties not to proceed is tantamount to enjoining the proceedings.bennett medtronic,cir.the same is true here,and,while the cited cases apply to the anti injunction act,the principle is perfectly general.it applies to the all writs act as well,for it is the restraint on other court proceedings that is problematic.
with that said,the specific issues can now be considered.
a.the all writs act 
the all writs act provides that the supreme court and all courts established by act of congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.a.that is a broad,but not unlimited,grant of authority to federal courts,including the district court.as we have already noted,we review the district court decision for an abuse of discretion.see brother records,at.we are constrained to find that there was abuse here.
much of what has been said in the act area regarding state court cases,an area we discuss in part b of this opinion,applies here as well,and there is precious little authority dealing with injunctions directed by a district court to a court of equal federal district court.a recent decision of the third circuit court of appeals says it all.there,a district court had enjoined proceedings in another district court.see grider keystone health plan,cir.the court of appeals commented on the fact that injunctions of that nature directed at another district court,as opposed to a state court,are not typical.id.at.indeed,they appear to be rarae aves like us,the third circuit did not find any other appellate decisions on point it said 
indeed,the lack of cases in which the all writs act has been used to enjoin settlement efforts in another federal court is telling.it is clear that the act is generally used to prohibit activities in another court that threaten to undermine a pending settlement in the enjoining court.when the act has been used to block settlement efforts in another court,it is typically because a party was deliberately using that forum to circumvent a pending settlement agreement in the enjoining court.
id.at citations omitted.the court then concluded 
based on the limited precedent in this area,there does not appear to be any basis for the injunction in this case.although significant resources have been invested in this litigation to this point,there is simply no support for the proposition that a court may enjoin parties from participating in or reaching a bona fide settlement in another federal court that may dispose of claims before when there is no pending settlement in the enjoining court and the other federal court is charged with attempting to reach a global settlement.
id.at footnote omitted.
we agree with that assessment and find that it has even more bite here.no settlement was directly in prospect i
