sloan debtor and insured and moldo bankruptcy trustee appeal from the district court judgment awarding in compensatory damages based upon breach of contract,bad faith failure to settle,and a violation of the new mexico insurance practices act.state farm insurer also appeals contending that several trial errors occurred.we affirm the judgment on liability,reverse the judgment insofar as damages and remand for a new trial on compensatory and punitive damages.
background 
the insured and his family were traveling eastbound on near grants,new mexico,during snowy weather when his vehicle crossed into the westbound lane,causing a collision with the shelton family.shelton was seriously injured.the sheltons lawyer offered to settle the claims of the family members for.ultimately,the family members sued the insured.prior to trial,the claims of the insured two children were settled for,and,respectively.the claims of and shelton were tried to a jury,resulting in judgments against the insured for and,respectively.state farm paid the judgment,but only paid of the other judgment,resulting in an excess judgment of.
a key dispute in this case pertains to the insured policy limits.the insurer maintains that the policy issued,designated policy form,limited coverage for bodily injury to per person,and per accident involving two or more persons,with the per accident limits subject to the per person limits.thus,according to the insurer,only of coverage was available to compensate shelton,the most seriously injured victim.
early in the underlying litigation,the sheltons attorney obtained a certified copy of the policy from the insurer.that policy form is shown as and is different from what the insurer now relies upon.the certified policy contains limits,however,the provision containing those limits had been held patently ambiguous by a washington state court.haney state farm ins.construing the contract in favor of the insured,the haney court concluded that the per accident limits were not subject to the per person limits,resulting in an interpretation that renders the limit unenforceable in favor of the limit.see also andrews nationwide mut.ins.
the sheltons attorney notified the insurer of the ambiguous policy language in the context of a demand.the insurer replied that it had certified the wrong policy form and that a later policy form,one that remedied the ambiguous language,was actually issued.whether the change was the correction of an inadvertent error or an attempt to prevent the insured from exercising his contractual rights was the subject of the federal court trial.it is clear,however,that the insurer was well aware of the potential for an excess judgment against its insured.
on appeal,plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in not submitting punitive damages on the bad faith claim to the jury,because the evidence supported compensatory damages and there was sufficient evidence for punitive damages.plaintiffs also object to the district court ordering remittitur without giving the plaintiffs the option to consent or to have a new trial on damages.defendant contends that plaintiffs were not entitled to have punitive damages submitted to the jury because they failed to object to the jury instructions which omitted this issue,the compensatory award will not support the necessary finding for punitive damages,and the evidence does not support punitive damages.defendant agrees that remittitur requires that the plaintiff be given an option to accept the remittitur or a new trial on damages.in its,defendant argues that the jury instructions and verdict form were faulty because they failed to prohibit double recovery,the remittitur was inadequate to cure this problem,the visiting district judge who presided at the trial improperly rushed it,failed to timely advise defendants of the need to summarize depositions the court would not allow depositions to be read while so advising the plaintiffs,and made derogatory and negative comments about defense counsel and his evidence throughout the trial.defendant seeks a new trial on compensatory damages only,or in the alternative,a new trial on liability and damages should we accept its contention that it was prejudiced by the district judge conduct towards it.see aplee.br.at.defendant urges this court to uphold the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law jmol on the punitive damages claim.
discussion 
we stayed these appeals pending resolution of a certified question of law on the punitive damages issue addressed to the new mexico supreme court.sloan state farm mut.auto.ins.in re sloan.we now vacate that stay and proceed to the merits.obviously,we were not persuaded by defendant contention that plaintiffs forfeited the punitive damages issue by failing to object to the jury instructions and the verdict form that omitted the issue.see.the district court granted jmol on the punitive damages claim at the close of the plaintiffs case,reconsidered the issue after the defendant case upon plaintiff motion and adhered to its original ruling.thus,the district court made a legal determination,albeit on a factual issue and without the guidance we now have from the new mexico supreme court,that punitive damages for bad faith required a culpable mental state and that was lacking here.the issue having been raised and definitively ruled upon,it was not forfeited.see city of louis praprotnik,d squibb sons,lloyd,cir.in granting the motion for jmol,the district court explained that the case was nothing more than a breach of a contract by an insurance company.at the close of the evidence,however,the case was submitted to the jury on three theories of liability including bad faith.the special verdict returned by the jury was predicated in part on bad faith.the evidentiary basis for the liability portion of that special verdict has not been challenged in this appeal.
punitive damages.
in light of the contentions of the parties,we posed the following question for the new mexico supreme court 
is an instruction for punitive damages required in every insurance bad faith case in which the plaintiff has produced evidence supporting compensatory damages as suggested by uniform jury instruction.directions for use,or is the new mexico court of appeals correct that subsequent new mexico supreme court authority requires a culpable mental state beyond bad faith for imposition of punitive damages in insurance bad faith cases motors,chrysler ins.
in re sloan,at.
the new mexico supreme court accepted certification and overruled that part of that would require a culpable mental state for punitive damages beyond that required for compensatory damages in bad faith cases.see sloan state farm mut.auto.ins.in re sloan,copy attached.in most cases,evidence of bad faith sufficient to present the case to the jury will warrant an instruction on punitive damages because it could support a culpable mental state.id.at.in the context,an unreasonable denial or delay of a claim suffices for compensatory damages if the denial or delay is also frivolous or unfounded,that demonstrates a culpable mental state sufficient to submit the issue of punitive damages to the jury.id.at.
this case includes a failure to settle claim.in such cases,an insurer failure to investigate or competently defend may be evidence of bad faith.id.at.but if there is evidence that the insurer exercised dishonest judgment and did not given equal consideration to its interests and that of its insured,a punitive damages instruction is warranted.id.at.to these ends,the new mexico supreme court has revised the instruction on punitive damages in bad faith cases to require a finding not only that compensatory damages are warranted,but also that the conduct of the insurance company was in reckless disregard for the interests of the plaintiff,or was based on a dishonest judgment,or was otherwise malicious,willful,or wanton.id.at revising uji.
based upon what we now know about punitive damages and bad faith in new mexico,we hold that the grant of jmol on the punitive damages claim was error.the insurer has not from the judgment insofar as the sufficiency of the evidence supporting liability,including liability on the bad faith claim indeed,plaintiffs tell us that the insurer did not move for jmol on these grounds either the appendix does not appear to be to the contrary.aplt.br.at.
the general rule announced by the new mexico supreme court is that ordinarily a jury should decide the issue of punitive damages given a prima facie showing of bad faith sufficient to submit the case to the trier of fact.sloan,at.given the liability findings and the obvious factual dispute about the bona fides of the policy switch,we hold that a punitive damages instruction is now warranted.a jury could conclude that the insurer may have exercised less than honest judgment or that it did not give equal consideration to its interests and that of the insured.given the doubt surrounding which policy applied and the insured almost certain exposure to an excess judgment,a jury could conclude that the insured conducted an unfair balancing of interests in not settling for policy limits early on.see id.at an insurer frivolous or unfounded refusal to pay is the equivalent of a reckless disregard for the interests of the insured,and a dishonest or unfair balancing of interests is no less reprehensible than reckless disregard,which has historically justified an award of punitive damages.
remittitur.
the next issue we must confront is the remittitur.ordinarily,a district court grant of remittitur in a diversity case is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.gasperini ctr.for humanities,d.plaintiffs do not argue that the district court was without power to order remittitur or a new trial.although the insurer challenges the remittitur as insufficient,both parties agree that the district court may not force the plaintiff to remit the excess portion of the judgment prior to allowing a plaintiff to choose between remittitur or a new trial on damages.
we agree with the parties.the seventh amendment requires that a plaintiff be given the option of a new trial in lieu of remitting a portion of the jury award.hetzel prince william county,d.no judgment for a remittitur may be entered without the plaintiff consent because the seventh amendment prohibits the court from substituting its judgment for that of the jury regarding any issue of fact.gasperini,at.see also dimick schiedt.regardless of whether remittitur is proposed by the trial or appellate court,if the plaintiff does not consent to the remittitur,the district court has no alternative but to order a new trial on damages.int l playtex,cir citing kennon gilmer.mckinnon city of berwyn,cir.
even if allowed to elect,plaintiffs tell us that they will not accept remittitur as ordered by the district court.aplt.br.at aplt.br.at.thus,the case must remanded for a new trial on damages,a remedy also sought by the insurer.because of that,we do not address defendant arguments concerning double recovery and the adequacy of the remittitur amount.
conduct of the trial.
we must consider defendant point concerning the conduct of the trial to the extent defendant seeks a new trial on liability.essentially,defendant contends that the judge conduct considered in its totality deprived it of a fair trial.defendant relies upon rocha great am.ins,cir 
when the remarks of the judge during the course of a trial,or his manner of handling the trial,clearly indicate a hostility to one of the parties,or an unwarranted prejudgment of the merits of the case,or an alignment on the part of the court with one of the parties for the purpose of furthering or supporting the contentions of such party,the judge indicates,whether consciously or not,a personal bias and prejudice which renders invalid any resulting judgment in favor of the party so favored.
id.at quoting knapp kinsey,cir emphasis omitted.our review of this claim of judicial bias is for plain error because defendant did not object on this basis.see gaydar sociedad instituto y planificacion familiar,cir united states mackay,cir criminal context.and counsel must object.we recognize counsel fear of antagonizing the trial judge or possibly the jury and thereby prejudicing his client case,but a respectful objection may bring the matter before the trial court for possible corrective action and preserve the client right to meaningful appellate review.as it stands,in civil cases,the plain error doctrine is sharply limited to errors that seriously affect the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.quigley rosenthal,cir.
having reviewed the transcript,we are troubled by the process used by the court to inform counsel of how deposition testimony would be admitted.at a minimum,a variant procedure such as this one should be announced to both parties well in advance not on the eve of trial,or be included in the pretrial order.at the same time,a review of the record indicates that deposition testimony was presented albeit out of sequence and through excerpted portions of video or summaries presented by counsel with counsel afforded the opportunity to object and have those objections ruled upon by the court.suffice it to say that while we understand defense counsel justifiable concern with the procedure,we can not find that the fairness of the proceedings was substantially compromised.
although a federal court has the right to comment on witness testimony,it must exercise great care to maintain an impartial attitude and not become an advocate for one of the parties to the litigation or mislead the jury.united states sowards,cir.we have reviewed the district court comments on the evidence,and the revelation of facts to the jury that the prior district judge may have ruled inadmissible,and find no plain error.a district court may attempt to clarify evidence,and it may revisit interlocutory evidentiary rulings made by another district judge.the district judge did not comment directly on the ultimate factual issue to be decided by the jury,nor add to the evidence,both of which would be improper.see quercia united states.rocha,at sowards,at.
finally,we consider the district court comments directed towards counsel preparation,erudition,objections or lack of objection,and settlement.we certainly expect trial courts to treat counsel with respect,but given our standard of review in the absence of any objection,we do not find that the district court comments in this case directed towards both sides rendered the trial unfair.the district court repeatedly expressed its views that the parties should settle the case and what the case was worth,but it did this outside the presence of the jury.while we recognize that settlement is an appropriate topic for a pretrial conference.c,some cases can not be settled and the parties desire for a trial must be respected.as for the trial court other comments,we do not find them to be of such a character to have compromised the substantial rights of the insurer on the issue of liability.both sides won and lost issues on that score.on remand,however,we think it would be best for the case to be reassigned.

in this case,arising from an insurance company failure to settle a lawsuit against its insured,we are asked to clarify whether a culpable mental state in addition to bad faith is required for the imposition of punitive damages.the following question was certified to us by the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit,in accordance with rule nmra 
is an instruction for punitive damages required in every insurance bad faith case in which the plaintiff has produced evidence supporting compensatory damages as suggested by uji nmra,or is the new mexico court of appeals correct that subsequent new mexico supreme court authority requires a culpable mental state beyond bad faith for imposition of punitive damages in insurance bad faith cases motors,chrysler ins.
sloan state farm mut.auto.ins.in re sloan,cir.
exercising jurisdiction under nmsa,we answer that under new mexico law,a instruction should be given to the jury in every case where the evidence supports a finding either in cases those arising from a breach of the insurer duty to timely investigate,evaluate,or pay an insured claim in good faith,that the insurer failed or refused to pay a claim for reasons that were frivolous or unfounded,or in cases those arising from a breach of the insurer duty to settle a claim against the insured in good faith,that the insurer failure or refusal to settle was based on a dishonest or unfair balancing of interests.an insurer frivolous or unfounded refusal to pay is the equivalent of a reckless disregard for the interests of the insured,and a dishonest or unfair balancing of interests is no less reprehensible than reckless disregard,which has historically justified an award of punitive damages.to ensure the jury has found a culpable mental state before awarding punitive damages,we modify uji to reflect that punitive damages may only be awarded when the insurer conduct was in reckless disregard for the interests of the plaintiff,or was based on a dishonest judgment,or was otherwise malicious,willful,or wanton.
this matter comes to us in the course of an appeal from a jury trial in federal district court.the trial court granted defendant state farm motion for judgment as a matter of law on plaintiffs claim for punitive damages against defendant for failure to settle.sloan,at.the court submitted plaintiffs claims to the jury without the instruction for punitive damages,uji nmra.even though plaintiffs claims primarily involved failure to settle,the court included in its instructions to the jury both the standard in a action,that is,a dishonest or unfair balancing of interests jury instruction,below,and the standard in a action,that is,any frivolous or unfounded refusal to pay jury instruction,below.because the trial court gave the jury both instructions,we shall address the standard for punitive damages under both causes of action.the jury instructions relevant to plaintiffs claim given at trial were 
jury instruction 
a liability insurance company has a duty to timely investigate and fairly evaluate the claim against its insured,and to accept reasonable settlement offers within policy limits.
an insurance company failure to conduct a competent investigation of the claim and to honestly and fairly balance its own interests and the interests of the insured in rejecting a settlement offer within policy limits is bad faith.if the company gives equal consideration to its own interests and the interests of the insured and based on honest judgment and adequate information does not settle the claim and proceeds to trial,it has acted in good faith.
see uji nmra.
jury instruction 
an insurance company acts in bad faith when it refuses to pay a claim of the policyholder for reasons which are frivolous or unfounded.an insurance company does not act in bad faith by denying a claim for reasons which are reasonable under the terms of the policy.
in deciding whether to pay a claim,the insurance company must act reasonably under the circumstances to conduct a timely and fair investigation and evaluation of the claim.
a failure to timely investigate,evaluate or pay a claim is a bad faith breach of the duty to act honestly and in good faith in the performance of the insurance contract.
see uji nmra.
the jury found that state farm acted in bad faith in its dealings with plaintiffs and that its bad faith proximately caused plaintiffs damages.the jury awarded plaintiffs in compensatory damages,later reduced to on motion for remittitur.plaintiffs appealed to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit,arguing that under new mexico law,where there is sufficient evidence to submit an claim to the jury,the jury must also receive an instruction on punitive damages.the court of appeals then certified the above question to us because it was unclear under new mexico law whether in an action,a finding of bad faith,without an additional finding of a culpable mental state,permitted an award of punitive damages.
this case presents an opportunity to assess the new mexico court of appeals holding in that an award of punitive damages in an case requires a culpable mental state in addition to the bad faith required for compensatory damages.see motors,chrysler ins.although we denied the petition for certiorari in that case,such denial in itself expresses no opinion on the merits of the case.see state breit.in our denial of certiorari in,we avoided having to reconcile various statements we have made about the standard for punitive damages in claims.we now take the opportunity to clarify the law on this point.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that under new mexico law,conduct by an insurer typically involves a culpable mental state,and therefore the determination whether the bad faith evinced by a particular defendant warrants punitive damages is ordinarily a question for the jury to resolve.to the extent would,in every case,require a showing of an additional culpable mental state to permit an instruction on punitive damages,is overruled.in so holding,we reaffirm our statement in jessen national excess insurance,that b ad faith supports punitive damages upon a finding of entitlement to compensatory damages.accordingly,an instruction on punitive damages will ordinarily be given whenever the plaintiff claim is allowed to proceed to the jury.we do,however,somewhat limit the per se jessen rule by affording the trial court the discretion to withhold a instruction in those rare instances in which the plaintiff has failed to advance any evidence tending to support an award of punitive damages.
held that in cases,new mexico requires the presence of aggravated conduct beyond that necessary to establish the basic cause of action in order to impose punitive damages.in reaching this conclusion,the court analyzed two new mexico supreme court rulings,paiz state farm fire casualty,and allsup convenience stores,north river insurance,and determined from the language of those opinions that this court intended to raise the standard of conduct required for an award of punitive damages in cases.the court determined that paiz and allsup superseded the jessen formulation and that new mexico now requires a showing of a culpable mental element to allow imposition of punitive damages.
in its original opinion,the court affirmed the trial court denial of the plaintiffs claim for punitive damages arising from an claim.id.the plaintiffs had argued that they were automatically entitled to punitive damages once compensatory damages were awarded and that the trial court therefore misapplied the legal standard for the award of punitive damages.id.interpreted paiz as requiring evidence of an evil motive or a culpable mental state,in addition to bad faith,for a plaintiff to be entitled to punitive damages.accordingly,it held the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing punitive damages.id.
in a separate published order on rehearing,appended to the original published opinion,the court reinforced its initial holding,and again relied on paiz and allsup for the proposition that there is a real distinction between bad faith sufficient to support an award of compensatory damages and bad faith meriting exemplary damages.id.the court also noted that uji,as it currently stands,clearly contemplates the giving of a punitive damages instruction in every bad faith case submitted to a jury.id.the court then stated,given the holding in paiz,and the language in allsup,upon which we rely,it would seem appropriate to reconsider this approach.id.
as we reconsider uji and the law of punitive damages in claims,we first consider the analyses of paiz and allsup in.
the court began its analysis of paiz by characterizing it as a first party case.although paiz began as an case,by the time it reached the appellate courts it was reduced to a case.at the trial level the plaintiffs had filed claims sounding in negligence,insurance bad faith,and breach of contract.before submitting the case to the jury,however,the trial court directed a verdict against the plaintiffs with respect to their claim.paiz,at,at.the judge then submitted the case to the jury under a theory and under the plaintiffs tort claims of negligent misrepresentation,negligent investigation,and negligent delay in making payment.id.at,at.the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs.t he trial judge viewed the damages awarded as arising from state farm breach of contract instead of from any of defendants various negligent acts.id.at,at.we agreed,holding the jury award was grounded in breach of contract and not as damages for commission of one or more torts.id.
importantly,the claim of insurance bad faith was never raised as an issue on appeal.the plaintiffs did not appeal the directed verdict against them and therefore conceded the correctness of the trial court ruling rejecting the claim.id.at,at.c ases are not authority for propositions not considered.sangre de cristo dev.city of santa fe.we conclude paiz ought not be relied upon in answering the certified question and was not dispositive in answering the question raised in,because in paiz this court as well as the trial court focused on the contractual nature of the claims,rather than the degree to which they also sounded in tort.
interprets paiz as directly applicable to the tort of insurance bad faith.as we read paiz,however,the holding is more narrowly drawn w e hold that such a award for a breach of contract may no longer be based solely on the breaching party gross negligence in failing to perform the contract.paiz,at,at.because the tort of insurance bad faith is fundamentally distinct from a claim for breach of contract,and because insurance bad faith was not before the court in that case,the opinion in paiz is properly confined to the standard for punitive damages in a case for breach of contract.
the court further advanced certain language from allsup as supporting its conclusion that this court had raised the standard for punitive damages in cases.allsup involved an insurer appeal of a jury award of punitive damages in an claim.the insurer,north river,argued its due process rights were violated by a jury instruction suggesting the jury would merely have to find unreasonable conduct,as opposed to bad faith,in order to be held liable for punitive damages.id.the instruction at issue there,essentially identical to uji nmra,read 
under the bad faith claim,what is customarily done by those engaged in the insurance industry is evidence of whether the insurance company acted in good faith.however,the good faith of the insurance company is determined by the reasonableness of its conduct,whether such conduct is customary in the industry or not.industry customs or standards are evidence of good or bad faith,but they are not conclusive.
allsup.north river interpreted this instruction as permitting the slightest unreasonableness to render an insurance company liable for punitive damages.id.this,north river argued,conflicted with our statement in mcginnis honeywell,that a culpable mental state is a prerequisite to punitive damages.
to resolve the alleged conflict,we examined another jury instruction given at trial that stated in part,allsup contends and has the burden of proving that any bad faith actions on the part of north river were malicious,reckless or wanton,and,therefore punitive damages should be awarded,emphasis omitted.reading the two instructions together,we concluded the jury must have found malicious,reckless,or wanton conduct before it could award punitive damages.id.thus,allsup held,north river suffered no due process violation in the imposition of punitive damages.as we read allsup,its holding is strictly designed to resolve the question whether the jury was adequately instructed on the standard for punitive damages to survive a due process challenge.see id.accordingly,the presence of the second instruction on punitive damages enabled this court to avoid the precise issue before us now,which is whether a greater standard than that required for compensatory damages in litigation is required before instructing on punitive damages.as a result of these considerations,we believe the court,understandably,may have been misled by our opinion in allsup in regard to what we now hold is the correct analysis of new mexico law on the standard for punitive damages in cases.
in our current analysis,we conclude that allsup in fact supports our view that a instruction will ordinarily be given whenever the plaintiff is entitled to have the jury instructed on his or her claim.in analyzing uji,the allsup court reasoned that w hile bad faith and unreasonableness are not always the same thing,there is a certain point,determined by the jury,where unreasonableness becomes bad faith and punitive damages may be awarded,emphasis added.in other words,there comes a point at which the insurer conduct progresses from mere unreasonableness to a culpable mental state.because the resolution of precisely where this point lies in each case depends on an assessment of the complex factual determinations surrounding the insurer conduct and corresponding motives,such a question must ordinarily be reserved for the factfinder to resolve.as a general proposition,therefore,once a plaintiff has made a prima facie showing sufficient to submit his or her claim to the jury,the determination whether the insurer conduct is deserving of punitive damages is for the jury to decide.
although we overrule holding that an award of punitive damages in such cases always requires evidence of culpable conduct beyond that necessary to establish basic liability,we agree with its statement that bad faith may include a culpable mental state,but it is not necessarily so.we agree with this statement because of the manner in which the jury instructions for basic liability,uji and,are currently written.while these instructions properly convey the two standards we have previously articulated for a finding of a culpable mental frivolous or unfounded refusal to pay,see uji,and a failure to honestly and fairly balance the interests of the insured and its own,see uji acknowledge the instructions as written might be interpreted,in some circumstances,as permitting merely unreasonable conduct to support a finding of bad faith sufficient for an award of punitive damages.this is because these instructions,particularly uji,include concepts of reasonableness along with concepts which may evince a culpable mental state.because punitive damages are imposed for the limited purposes of punishment and deterrence,a culpable mental state is a prerequisite to punitive damages.see mcginnis,at,at.while the unreasonable conduct described in these instructions may support an award of compensatory damages,such conduct does not support an award of punitive damages.thus,there may be cases in which a plaintiff,despite having advanced evidence sufficient to submit his or her claim to the jury,nevertheless fails to make a prima facie showing that the insurer conduct exhibited a culpable mental state.
under new mexico law,an insurer who fails to pay a claim has acted in bad faith where its reasons for denying or delaying payment of the claim are frivolous or unfounded.see state farm ins.clifton.in clifton we concluded that in order to recover damages in tort under this claim,there must be evidence of bad faith or a fraudulent scheme.id.we further announced that bad faith means any frivolous or unfounded refusal to pay.id.internal quotation marks and quoted authority omitted.we have defined frivolous or unfounded as meaning an arbitrary or baseless refusal to pay,lacking any support in the wording of the insurance policy or the circumstances surrounding the claim 
unfounded in this context does not mean erroneous or incorrect it means essentially the same thing as reckless disregard,in which the insurer utterly fail s to exercise care for the interests of the insured in denying or delaying payment on an insurance policy.jessen,at,at.it means an utter or total lack of foundation for an assertion of arbitrary or baseless refusal to pay,lacking any arguable support in the wording of the insurance policy or the circumstances surrounding the claim.it is synonymous with the word with which it is coupled frivolous.
jackson life ins.receconi.by refusing or delaying payment on a claim for reasons that are frivolous or unfounded,the insurer has acted with reckless disregard for the interests of the insured such reckless disregard supports a claim for punitive damages.
we acknowledge,however,that the reasonableness of the insurer conduct is generally an element of the jury inquiry in determining whether compensatory damages should be awarded.for this reason,the bracketed second sentence of our jury instruction reads,in deciding whether to pay a claim,the insurance company must act reasonably under the circumstances to conduct a timely and fair investigation or evaluation of the claim.uji nmra.in claims,therefore,a plaintiff under these circumstances might make a proper showing that the insurer acted unreasonably in denying or delaying a claim,entitling the plaintiff to compensatory damages,without having made a prima facie showing that the refusal to pay was frivolous or unfounded.in such circumstances,it is proper for the trial court to submit the plaintiff claim to the jury for consideration of an award of compensatory damages but withhold the instruction.
on the other hand,while new mexico recognizes a cause of action for failure to settle within policy limits,we do not recognize a cause of action for negligent failure to settle.ambassador ins.paul fire marine ins.to be entitled to recover for failure to settle,a plaintiff must show that the insurer refusal to settle was based on a dishonest judgment.by dishonest judgment,we mean that an insurer has failed to honestly and fairly balance its own interests and the interests of the insured.an insurer can not be partial to its own interests,but rather must give the interests of its insured at least the same consideration or greater.see lujan gonzales.in caring for the insured interests,the insurer should place itself in the shoes of the insured and conduct itself as though it alone were liable for the entire amount of the judgment.dairyland ins.herman,internal quotation marks and quoted authority omitted.as we stated in ambassador,the insurer decision not to settle should be an honest decision.it should be the result of the weighing of probabilities in a fair and honest way.at,at quoted authorities omitted.this element of a dishonest or unfair balancing of interests is the key element in determining whether,in claims,the insurer conduct merits punitive damages.
in such claims,evidence of an insurer negligence in researching a claim does not give rise to its own cause of action,but rather provides one possible means of demonstrating that an insurer acted in bad faith.as we said in ambassador 
w hen failure to settle the claim stems from a failure to properly investigate the claim or to become familiar with the applicable law,then this is negligence in defending the suit a duty expressly imposed upon the insurer under the insurance contract and is strong evidence of bad faith in failing to settle.here,basic standards of competency can be imposed,and the insurer is charged with knowledge of the duty owed to its insured.in this sense,such negligence becomes an element tending to prove bad faith,but not a cause of action in and of itself.
id.at,at.thus,if the insurer fails to meet basic standards of competency in investigating a claim or researching the applicable law,such conduct is strong evidence of bad faith,but is not in itself sufficient to support the plaintiff claim.
in ambassador,we predicated an insurer honest judgment on its diligent,competent investigation of the claim 
in order that the insurer decision whether to settle be honest and intelligent it must be based upon a knowledge of the facts and circumstances upon which liability is predicated,and upon a knowledge of the nature and extent of the injuries so far as they reasonably can be ascertained.
this requires the insurance company to make a diligent effort to ascertain the facts upon which only an intelligent and judgment may be predicated.
id.quoted authorities omitted.our current uniform jury instruction reflects this standard of conduct when it states an insurer has a duty to timely investigate and fairly evaluate the claim against its insured.uji nmra.nevertheless,we conclude the competence and timeliness of the insurer investigation of the claim,while strong evidence of whether the insurer conducted itself fairly and in good faith,is not the dispositive element in a claim.even where the insurer investigation was both competent and timely,the insurer is nevertheless liable for bad faith when its refusal to settle within policy limits is based on a dishonest judgment.in many respects,a dishonest judgment in these circumstances may be more reprehensible than where the insurer bases its decision not to settle on a negligent investigation.we conclude,therefore,in cases,it is the insurer failure to treat the insured honestly and in good faith,giving equal consideration to its own interests and the interests of the insured,that renders the insurer liable for insurance bad faith and also merits an instruction on punitive damages.
as a result of the foregoing analysis,we conclude that in most cases,the plaintiff theory of bad faith,if proven,will logically also support punitive damages.to ensure,however,that a jury only awards punitive damages for conduct manifesting a culpable mental state,and not for conduct that may fall short of such reprehensibility,we find it necessary to augment the instruction to reflect the requisite standard for a culpable mental state.accordingly,we modify the first sentence of uji to read as follows 
if you find that plaintiff should recover compensatory damages for the bad faith actions of the insurance company,and you find that the conduct of the insurance company was in reckless disregard for the interests of the plaintiff,or was based on a dishonest judgment,or was otherwise malicious,willful,or wanton,then you may award punitive damages.
the trial court should include also the definitions of dishonest judgment a failure by the insurer to honestly and fairly balance its own interests and the interests of the insured along with the definitions of reckless,malicious,willful,and wanton.see uji nmra.we believe this revised instruction will ensure the jury will award punitive damages only in those cases where the insurer conduct is shown to have manifested a culpable mental state.
finally,in answering as we do that a instruction will ordinarily be given every time the jury is instructed on the plaintiff claim,we acknowledge the prospect that in certain instances a plaintiff evidence of conduct,though sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to compensatory damages,may be,as a matter of law,insufficient to warrant a instruction.where the trial court determines,based on the evidence marshaled at trial,that no reasonable jury could find the insurer conduct to have manifested a culpable mental state,then the trial court may withhold the giving of a instruction.accordingly,we also modify the use note for uji to reflect that this instruction must ordinarily be given whenever uji,or is given the instruction will not be given only in those circumstances in which the plaintiff fails to make a prima facie showing that the insurer conduct exhibited a culpable mental state.
it is so ordered.
