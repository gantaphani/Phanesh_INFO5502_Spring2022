this case is a parent nightmare come true.plaintiff daughter,danielle,started acting out after she became the girlfriend of a boy,defendant,whom she met at school.in addition to her behavioral problems at home,danielle began skipping school,her grades declined,and she failed three classes.fearing that her daughter might be using drugs,plaintiff openly searched danielle room and found some disturbing letters written by defendant,instructing danielle how to retaliate against plaintiff for the restrictions that she had imposed on danielle.believing that defendant was a cause of danielle behavior problems,plaintiff told them they could no longer see each other.
defendant became angry and wrote three vile and vitriolic letters to danielle,anticipating that plaintiff would discover and read them.one demonstrating that defendant favorite word is fuck relates his plan to deliberately provoke plaintiff or danielle father into physically attacking defendant,whereupon he would sue them and,w hen we eighteen then we can use the money to be together.another letter,with the salutation,dear bev plaintiff,warns that her efforts to stop danielle from seeing defendant are for naught,fuck you in the ass.you wo win,and states just fucking give up and let us live our own damn lives.saying,he oughta date your daughter,because i like the way she tastes,defendant tells plaintiff to j ust get away from my ass and rape yourself you psychotic fucking whore.yet another letter contemplates defendant and danielle killing plaintiff and her husband,after which there will be no trace of your parents.then we go hang out.
alarmed that defendant became angry when plaintiff told danielle she could no longer see him,that he wrote letters my daughter to create disharmony in my home,and that he even contemplated killing plaintiff and her husband,plaintiff sought a temporary restraining order and an injunction prohibiting harassment by defendant.code civ.
apparently coddled rather than castigated by his parents,the defendant showed up in court with an attorney to defend what appears to be indefensible.wrapping himself with the f reedom of speech,freedom of association,and right of privacy,defendant declared he did nothing to plaintiff or any member of her family that would merit an injunction.according to defendant,his letters were not a threat to anyone,but were a joke designed to prove that plaintiff was searching danielle room since we knew she would say something if she found it.in defendant view,the letters would not have caused a reasonable person in plaintiff position to suffer substantial emotional harm because any parent should expect some emotional distress when they do not like their children choice of friends.defendant denied that he had ever manipulated danielle or coached her to create disharmony in plaintiff home,and he blamed plaintiff for danielle problems in school.
unmoved by defendant pronouncement that he and danielle would like our parents to accept the fact that we love each other,and that we would never hurt each other or each other families,either,the trial court enjoined defendant from contacting danielle and members of her family,and ordered him to stay at least yards away from them,except at school where he must stay at least feet away.
on appeal,defendant contends the order must be reversed because there was no evidence of a credible threat of violence or a knowing and willful course of conduct by defendant that would seriously alarm,annoy,or harass a person,the injunction violates his rights of freedom of expression and association,and his right to privacy,and the order is void because it contains no expiration date.
we shall affirm the injunction as modified to expire when danielle becomes an adult on her birthday.as we will explain,defendant engaged in a course of conduct directed at plaintiff that seriously alarmed,annoyed,and harassed her that would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress and that actually caused plaintiff to suffer substantial emotional distress.code civ,subd.b.utterly without merit are defendant claims that the injunction violates his constitutional rights.his was used to annoy,ridicule,and threaten entitled to no protection because it was between purely private parties,about purely private parties,and on matters of purely private interest.defendant has no right to associate with danielle,who is a minor child.and the right of privacy does not entitle him to interfere with plaintiff exercise of her fundamental right as a parent to direct and control her daughter activities.finally,contrary to defendant claim,the injunction has an expiration date and is not void.however,it must end when danielle becomes an adult and has the right and responsibility to make her own decisions about those with whom she will associate.
we summarize the facts in the light most favorable to the judgment.cassim allstate ins.cal th,d.
while attending the same school,plaintiff daughter,danielle,and the defendant,dean wills,became girlfriend and boyfriend.thereafter,danielle relationship with her parents deteriorated,and she began to display negative behavior at home.she also started skipping classes at school and failed three courses.
danielle parents attempted to correct the situation by having danielle see a counselor,getting counseling themselves,and attending parenting classes.concluding that danielle relationship with defendant was not a healthy one and that he was undermining the family efforts to deal with danielle problems,plaintiff told her daughter that the relationship with defendant must end.
defendant then telephoned plaintiff because he did not understand why he could not see danielle.according to plaintiff,she tried to explain why she was concerned about his relationship with danielle,but defendant argued every point and would not listen to what she had to say.plaintiff finally became frustrated and just basically said we done with this conversation,told him,you need to stay away from my daughter,and hung up the phone at that point.in a letter he wrote to danielle,defendant admitted laughing at plaintiff when she said that she was trying to do what was best for danielle,and he acknowledged cuss ing at plaintiff,saying danielle was fucking scared of her.
when plaintiff began to fear that danielle might be using drugs,she searched danielle room and found letters that her daughter had received from defendant.according to plaintiff,many of them were disturbing but not threatening.some of them were instructions on how to retaliate against me for the consequences danielle was getting.those think those ones were kind of manipulative but not serious threats.
plaintiff did not make a secret of the fact that she was searching danielle things and based on substantial evidence,the trial court found that defendant knew plaintiff would search for additional letters.so he gave danielle three more letters with the expectation that plaintiff would read them.two of the letters are signed bill aaron.the third,addressed to plaintiff,is unsigned.for n o particular reason,defendant prefers to be known as bill and uses his middle name of aaron as a last name.he concedes that he wrote the letters.
in one letter defendant states,your mom is crazy,repeats that assertion several times,and relates a plan to deliberately provoke plaintiff or danielle father into physically attacking defendant.he says he will do nothing to respond,but will then call his lawyer.danielle parents will be forced to pay his bills for the rest of his life and,when defendant and danielle are years old,they can use the money to be together.buy a big house,pay for a huge wedding,a long honeymoon.we make sure to let your parents know that they paying for it.they on the other hand,will be living in the caddy all broken down and shit.it work out fine.
defendant goes on to say your mom a stupid whore she fuckin lied straight up to you though there is no way she could get a restraining order.the judge will laugh at her.also,i have a good lawyer already and she does so i going to ruin the things between you two huh what is there to ruin,a door he.he.he your mom said that now that you ca see me that you been more cooperative with her and your sic not being as disobedient.i told her that was because you were scared of her and she said,no,i really think she trying to be a better person and earn our trust back.she fucking scared of you that was the only time i cussed at her.yeah,we argued that one for a while.apparently you had her going.she really thought what she was doing was working.she a pretty smart person.he.he.very intelligent.lol.defendant acknowledges he laughed at plaintiff when she said that she was doing what was best for her daughter.
after relating how plaintiff ended her telephone conversation with him,defendant says fuck her.stupid bitch.i hope she reads this too.just in case she read sic this,this is to her.he then instructs plaintiff to turn to page eight,which is a separate letter that we quote in full below,including defendant sometimes extraneous use of quotation marks.
dear bev why do you fucking pull your head out of your ass and stop lying to everyone then accusing everyone else of lying just so you do get caught in your own damn lie.fuck you in the ass.you wont sic win.no matter what you do or say i will always be there for your daughter.the more you hurt her the more i have to be there for her.the more time you take away from us,the more we have to find,the more class we have to skip.just keep fucking yourself in the ass because everything you say is contradictory.your sic just jealous cause we young and in love.is there a problem with being in love with someone,just because you lost yours does mean you have to take ours.the problem is that you ca take it so just fucking give up and let us live our own damn lives.when we get married,do you want to be accepted by your son in law or hated by him.hated by me.when she an adult,do you ever want to talk to her again.just get away from my ass and rape yourself you psychotic fucking whore.
defendant added two postscripts to the dear bev letter,which purportedly are song lyrics ilp can i date your daughter,i mean i think i oughta,i like the way she tastes.this one for you too.goldfinger she a bitch,fuck her,asshole,fuck her.
the most notable aspect of the third letter is the fantastical scheme of set forth by defendant.he tells danielle,contemplating is the enjoyment of everything,and advises her to start by contemplating killing her parents.he then relates a scenario where danielle parents would be tied to a tree surrounded by starving,rabid dogs.defendant and danielle would fly over in a plane and drop bloody meat on them.then the dogs would be released one by one.when the dogs finish attacking,there will be no trace of danielle parents and t hen we go hang out.
after plaintiff read these letters,she sought a temporary restraining order and injunction against defendant.code civ.
at the hearing,plaintiff testified that defendant actions toward plaintiff and her family were disturbing.after testifying that the threat to kill kind of came off like a joke,plaintiff nonetheless stated she took it very seriously.in her words,i have to say that when you deal with an imbalanced sic person or seemingly imbalanced sic person,irrational person,there is no way of telling what that person is capable of doing.plaintiff also testified that she felt harassed and annoyed by defendant conduct.as for danielle,plaintiff testified that her daughter was doing much better in terms of school and behavior at home since there has been the no contact.
defendant mother,donna wills,testified that during their conversations,plaintiff never expressed any fear of defendant.wills asked plaintiff to drop the case against defendant b ecause in your bringing this to the court,that put him in a precarious situation that i was not willing to just leave him dangling.instead,wills wanted plaintiff to work together with me and my husband to work with our children.
defendant father,daniel wills,testified that his son letters were not ones that made me very happy,but that plaintiff expressed no fear because,in wills words,the letters were not believable.rather than a order,he wanted to minimize the contact between the two but do force them apart otherwise it would end up like a romeo and juliet situation.wills acknowledged seeing defendant so upset that it was very hard for him to control himself.however,he opined that defendant was not a threat he may punch a wall but no he walks away.he will not hurt somebody.wills opposed an injunction because,in his words,i think it would actually antagonize things and make things worse.and put defendant closer to an edge we do want him to be near.that at any given time somebody might do something that could push him over the edge of the restraining order and cause him further legal problems.
during his testimony,defendant denied threatening plaintiff or trying to manipulate danielle.his letters were simply a joke,a test to find out whether plaintiff was searching danielle room.according to defendant,contemplating killing danielle parents was just to release stress for her and get her to start thinking just of other options rather than being close minded about everything the only way that i thought i can get her to start listening to everyone and stop being depressed was to go to the extreme.as to his telephone conversation with plaintiff,defendant characterized her comments as blah,blah,blah.
the trial court issued the injunction,explaining we have a disrespectful defendant before the court.disrespect is not the basis for the issuance of a restraining order.what i find of major significance in this case is that the defendant father dan basically states that he was wondering whether or not the issue of a restraining order would antagonize the defendant.that the word he used.if the court issues the restraining order,he does not know how his own son will react.he is concerned about the defendant son.the plaintiff in this case equally shares that fear.i think that the danger plaintiff feels is real.and in light of the evidence in this case i think the action,that is,the letters,would alarm a reasonable person and alarmed plaintiff.it is harassment.there discussion about killing a parent,ways to do so.there discussions about how he going to provoke an attack by plaintiff i think that disturbing and quite rightfully so.i assume that some people are aware of the columbine high school students little discussions that somebody thought to be quite funny at some period of time,did take it serious ly.these are not just high school kids these days.this is just not a old.defendant is very mature for his age and should take responsibility,but he has not chosen to do so.and i do care if he is antagonized by the court issuing orders.it is an appropriate case to issue the restraining order.
again referring to the testimony of defendant father,the trial court stated in closing this is not a typical romeo and juliet case because at least romeo was respectful to capulet.and the defendant is not in this case.and i shocked.
discussion 
we begin our analysis by rejecting defendant claim that the injunction violates his first amendment rights of freedom of speech and freedom of association,as well as his right to privacy.
the united states supreme court has long recognized that not all speech is of equal first amendment importance.it is speech on matters of public concern that is at the heart of the first amendment protection.citations.dun bradstreet greenmoss builders,d,fn.omitted.the special concern for speech on public issues is no mystery the first amendment was fashioned to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people.citations.s peech concerning public affairs is more than it is the essence of.citation.id.at.at d at.in contrast,speech on matters of purely private concern while not totally unprotected is of less first amendment concern.id.at.at,d at.when such example,as in defamation or the intentional infliction of emotional damage,civil sanctions may be imposed because t here is no threat to the free and robust debate of public issues there is no potential interference with a meaningful di
