financial corporation,robert bisno,and james coxeter appeal from the trial court order modifying a prior judgment for judicial foreclosure to allow respondent corporation cja to instead obtain a money judgment against appellants.we hold that because respondent unequivocally elected to proceed against appellants by way of judicial foreclosure,it was estopped from seeking to change its remedy after judgment.we further hold that the trial court exceeded its jurisdiction in modifying the judgment based upon matters that were never before it at trial.we therefore reverse and remand to the trial court with directions that it vacate its order modifying the judgment and reinstate the prior judgment of judicial foreclosure.
factual and procedural background 
appellants are the general partners of two limited partnerships,commercial investors,and trans action commercial mortgage investors.in,the limited partnerships acquired property known as the berkeley conference center hereinafter,the property,subject to a first deed of trust given to secure a loan on the property.in,the note and first deed of trust were assigned to the bank of america.in,the limited partnerships obtained another loan for from first republic thrift loan first republic,secured by a second deed of trust on the property.in,the limited partnerships defaulted on repayment of the bank of america loan,causing bank of america to file an action for judicial foreclosure against several entities,including the limited partnerships and first republic,the holder of the second deed of trust.in turn,first republic against the limited partnerships and their general partners appellants for breach of the note and second deed of trust and for judicial foreclosure.bank of america subsequently dismissed its complaint,leaving only first republic to be resolved.
in,first republic assigned its loan to cja,which pursued the for judicial foreclosure to trial,ultimately obtaining a judgment of judicial foreclosure pursuant to code of civil procedure section.the trial court judgment,entered june,ordered that the property be sold in the manner described by law by the levying officer a deficiency judgment not being waived or prohibited in this action,the real property is to be sold subject to the right of redemption as provided in the code of civil procedure.in addition,the court retained jurisdiction in order that corporation or its successors and assigns may apply for a deficiency judgment,after the foreclosure sale of the real property,in accordance with the provisions of code of civil procedure section,et,and in order that the court may determine the amount of the deficiency,if any,and render a money judgment therefore in favor of corporation italics added.
on june,the limited partnerships filed for bankruptcy.the parties thereafter stipulated to a relief from the bankruptcy stay to allow cja to proceed with the enforcement of its judgment against the limited partnerships for judicial foreclosure.the united states bankruptcy court approved the stipulation and granted the relief from stay on february.having obtained stay relief,cja filed a motion in the trial court for an award of contractual attorney fees as prevailing parties in the judicial foreclosure action.on april,the court awarded cja attorney fees and costs in the amount of.
meanwhile,the senior lienholder represented by attorney melvin malat,had filed a second action for judicial foreclosure on the first deed of trust,which went to trial in may.after evidence was presented and the matter was taken under submission,malat asked the trial court not to issue a decision.the revere action was thereafter dismissed.on july,revere attorney,malat,substituted in as attorney of record for junior lienholder cja.subsequently malat,now acting as trustee under the first deed of trust,noticed a trustee sale of the property.the trustee sale was held in september,with revere purchasing the property.the trustee deed upon sale,executed on september,by malat as trustee,indicated that t he amount of the unpaid debt secured by the first deed of trust was.
after revere purchased the property at the trustee sale held under the first deed of trust,malat filed a motion on behalf of cja,seeking to convert cja judgment of judicial foreclosure,which it had never acted upon,from a judgment ordering foreclosure by sale with a possible monetary deficiency into a money judgment for the entire amount of the debt.cja asserted the modification of the judgment was appropriate because,as a result of the sale of the security at the trustee sale,cja was now a junior lienholder.after hearing,the trial court granted cja motion and ordered that the previously entered judgment of judicial foreclosure and order of sale be converted to a money judgment against the limited partnerships and appellants in the amount owing under the note in the sum of,plus attorney fees and interest.appellants timely filed a motion for new trial,which was denied.this appeal followed.
discussion 
appellants seek reversal of the trial court order converting the judgment of judicial foreclosure to a money judgment on the ground there were essential factual issues relating to cja junior lienholder claim that were never presented to or resolved by the trial court.in addition,appellant maintains that cja unequivocal election to pursue judicial foreclosure under the second deed of trust precluded it from seeking to change remedies after obtaining a judgment of judicial foreclosure.we hold that the record clearly establishes that cja elected its remedy of judicial foreclosure,thereby barring it from seeking to change remedies after judgment.we further hold that unresolved factual issues did exist,preventing the trial court from deciding that cja was a junior lienholder entitled to avoid the provisions of code of civil procedure section.once judgment had been entered,the trial court was without jurisdiction to consider issues that had not been before it at trial.

code of civil procedure section provides in relevant part that a there can be but one form of action for the recovery of any debt or the enforcement of any right secured by mortgage upon real property,which action shall be in accordance with the provisions of this chapter b the decree for the foreclosure of a mortgage or deed of trust secured by real property shall declare the amount of the indebtedness or right so secured and,unless judgment for any deficiency there may be between the sale price and the amount due with costs is waived by the judgment creditor or a deficiency judgment is prohibited by section,shall determine the personal liability of any defendant for the payment of the debt secured by the mortgage or deed of trust and shall name the defendants against whom a deficiency judgment may be ordered following the proceedings prescribed in this section.this one action rule thus compels a secured creditor to exhaust its security in a single judicial action before obtaining a monetary deficiency judgment against the debtor.ziello superior court th,d.the purpose of the one action rule is to prevent a secured creditor from enforcing its rights by seeking recourse to more than one remedy,such as by obtaining both a money judgment on the mortgage debt and by foreclosing on the mortgage.in re madigan bankr th cir.
