this case arises out of an employment agreement agreement between appellant derrick gordon gordon or appellant and appellee proudfoot consulting company proudfoot or proudfoot north america or appellee that contains a number of restrictive covenants.the agreement prevents gordon,for six months after his employment with proudfoot ends,from working for a direct competitor or client of proudfoot,contacting proudfoot clients and soliciting proudfoot employees.the agreement also bars gordon from using or disclosing proudfoot confidential information and from retaining proudfoot materials after his employment ends.after gordon left proudfoot in june to work for the highland group highland,a direct competitor,proudfoot brought suit to enforce the restrictive covenants.
following a bench trial,the district court held that all of those restrictions restrictive covenants were enforceable under florida law.based on gordon breaches of the restrictive covenants,the district court concluded that proudfoot was entitled to a statutory presumption of irreparable harm.because gordon failed to rebut that presumption,the district court entered an injunction against gordon,preventing him,for six months,from working for highland and from soliciting proudfoot clients and employees.since the district court decision was handed down over a after gordon began working at highland,in order to grant this injunctive relief,the district court had to rely on a tolling provision in the agreement,which provides that the restrictive period is to be tolled during any period where gordon is in breach of the and covenants.the district court found that gordon continuous work for highland,which breached the agreement bar against employment with a direct competitor,justified tolling the restrictive period.in addition to granting injunctive relief,the district court also awarded proudfoot attorney fees and in damages stemming from a project performed by highland for bombardier,a proudfoot client that gordon both worked on and helped solicit for highland.
on appeal,gordon seeks to reverse the damages award.in addition,although gordon has not appealed the attorney fees award,he challenges the validity of the injunction,which has expired,in the hope of revisiting the attorney fees award before the district court if the injunction is invalidated.for the reasons explained below,we conclude that the injunction was not improper.however,we reverse the damages award.proudfoot failed to establish that gordon solicitation of bombardier for highland resulted in proudfoot loss of the project that was the basis of the damages award.
background 
proudfoot north america is a management consulting firm that provides consulting services to improve clients work processes by eliminating redundancies,streamlining processes and implementing systems of management.proudfoot north america,which is headquartered in west palm beach,florida and has offices in atlanta and new york,operates and markets its services in the united states and canada and has clients located in both countries.management consulting group proudfoot global,a company based in the united kingdom,is the parent company of a number of proudfoot affiliates across the globe,including an affiliate in europe proudfoot europe as well as proudfoot north america.
gordon worked at proudfoot north america from march through may.from march though october,gordon was a senior process consultant.process consultants,who are supervised by a project manager,work directly with a client first and supervisors.from october through january,gordon was a project manager.as a project manager,gordon had overall responsibility for a specific client project and supervised five to ten process consultants.project managers are responsible for achieving results for a client,obtaining repeat business from a client and convincing a client to provide referrals and to serve as a reference.
from january through may,gordon worked as a project director.as a project director,he supervised two to four project managers at a time and was responsible for multiple client projects.a project director is responsible for managing client relationships and is the most senior proudfoot employee who interacts with individual clients on an ongoing basis.project directors report to the vice president of business delivery.
on april,gordon was offered a position by highland,an operational management consulting firm that competes directly with proudfoot.after gordon tendered his resignation from proudfoot on may,proudfoot ceo luiz carvalho carvalho met with gordon.at this meeting,gordon lied to carvalho about the offer that he had received,stating that the offer was from a private equity firm and never mentioning highland.after carvalho offered gordon the position of vice president of business delivery for proudfoot europe,gordon accepted that position and withdrew his resignation.vice president of business delivery is a critical position that has ultimate responsibility for all aspects of delivering services to clients and for defining strategy for each client account.while in this position,gordon office was located in london.
on june,gordon again notified proudfoot that he was resigning.this time he did not withdraw his resignation,which was voluntary and became effective on june.gordon never informed proudfoot that he was leaving to work for highland.
during his tenure at proudfoot north america,gordon worked on many client projects in the united states and on a client project in mexico.the district court found that gordon traveled to a proudfoot client project in canada the district court also found that during gordon tenure at proudfoot north america,his territory included the united states and canada 
at proudfoot,gordon had access to,and received,information in various forms about specific proudfoot clients and projects,as well as about proudfoot operations generally.gordon received hard copies of a number of proudfoot materials,including training manuals and videos from the numerous training sessions he attended,a list of proudfoot europe employees,business cards of proudfoot clients for whom he had worked,and a proudfoot employee newsletter.gordon retained these materials after leaving proudfoot,but insisted that he did so unintentionally.
while at proudfoot,gordon also had access to information beyond the specific materials that he retained.he had access to information about proudfoot clients,including pricing information moreover,during his tenure as vice president of business delivery for proudfoot europe,gordon conducted reviews of the company client projects in europe and received information about those projects.in addition,gordon also had access to information about proudfoot operations.at trial,he admitted,generally,that he had access to confidential information about proudfoot business.moreover,the district court concluded that gordon was exposed to proudfoot methodology for providing operational management consulting services as well as to proudfoot products and offerings and tools.
in addition,during his tenure at proudfoot,gordon accessed and downloaded information from the knowledge management database,a project database that contains information about all of proudfoot client projects,from around the world,dating back to the and other information about proudfoot business operations.tools,studies,questionnaires and diagnostics from past projects are included in the knowledge management database so that proudfoot employees can use that information for other clients in similar situations anywhere around the world.
on june,gordon started working at highland.highland,whose headquarters are located in the united states,does business and maintains offices in north america and europe.at highland,gordon served as a project manager responsible for delivery and execution of client projects and the direct supervision of process consultants.gordon was promoted to director of operations in june.
at highland,gordon worked on projects for different clients one of those clients was bombardier,who was also a client of proudfoot europe.in september,highland assigned gordon to a project for bombardier called bombardier interiors.in february,eight months after leaving proudfoot,gordon helped solicit a different bombardier project for highland called bombardier logistics.gordon was the project manager for that project until his promotion in june in addition to his specific client assignments,in the fall of,gordon was given the responsibility of training other highland employees and coordinating the development of written training materials.gordon performed this function for approximately eight weeks.also,around the time of trial,gordon was put in charge of developing a new model for reviewing the operations phase of highland client projects.
the agreement gordon signed with proudfoot contains four restrictive covenants.three of the restrictive covenants are found in a noncompetition and nonsolicitation clause,which restricts gordon from engaging in certain activities for six months after his employment with proudfoot ends restrictive period.first,the provision prevents gordon from s erv ing as an employee or consultant for any business which is a direct competitor competitor covenant or competitor clause.direct competitor is defined as any person or entity engaged in the business of providing professional services to advise clients as to the design and installation of systems and processes to improve the productivity and efficiency of their business operations.second,the provision also prevents gordon from s erv ing as an employee or consultant for any business which is a client client covenant or client clause.client is defined as a person or organization,which at any time within the three years preceding the date of termination of employee employment has received a proposal or bid from proudfoot,or has received any services from proudfoot third,under a provision,gordon is prohibited from contact ing any client of proudfoot or soliciting any proudfoot employees covenant or clause.the agreement also provides that the restrictive period shall be tolled during any period in which employee is in violation of this noncompetition and nonsolicitation provision.
in addition,fourth,the agreement also includes a clause concerning confidential information confidential information clause that is distinct from the noncompetition and nonsolicitation clause.the confidential information clause defines what constitutes confidential and requires gordon to return all proudfoot documents and materials to the company upon the termination of his employment.unlike the time limit of the other three covenants described above,this clause prevents gordon from disclosing or using this information at all times after the termination of his employment.
ii.procedural history 
on august,proudfoot filed suit against gordon in florida circuit court seeking injunctive relief and alleging breach of contract.gordon,a citizen of georgia,removed the case to the united states district court for the southern district of florida on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.pursuant to the consent of the parties,the case was tried in january before magistrate judge linnea johnson district court.after a bench trial,the parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law proposed findings.proudfoot proposed findings offered three alternative damages proposals,which sought an award based on highland profits for all projects that gordon worked on highland profits for the bombardier project that gordon helped solicit or the total compensation gordon received while working at highland.on april,the district court adopted,with few modifications,proudfoot proposed findings and proudfoot second damages proposal.that same day,the district court entered a final judgment awarding proudfoot in damages and enjoining gordon,for six months,from working in north america or europe for highland or any other direct competitor contacting any client of proudfoot and soliciting any proudfoot employees.gordon was also enjoined from possessing,using or disclosing any confidential information of proudfoot and was directed to return any such information in his possession to proudfoot.the portion of the injunction preventing gordon from using or disclosing proudfoot confidential information did not include a time limitation.on appeal,gordon challenges the district court grant of the injunction and the damages award.
after gordon filed a notice of appeal,the district court entered a separate judgment against gordon,awarding proudfoot in attorneys fees and costs under.stat.k.no notice of appeal was filed from this award.

the violation of an enforceable restrictive covenant creates a presumption of irreparable injury to the person seeking enforcement of a restrictive covenant.stat.j.this presumption,however,is rebuttable.jonjuan salon,acosta,so d.
the district court decision 
the district court found that proudfoot established three legitimate business interests,a prerequisite under the statute for any form of relief.these interests are gordon receipt of the information outlined earlier,which the district court found was valuable and confidential proudfoot substantial relationships with specific prospective and existing customers and the extraordinary and specialized training provided to gordon.
after finding that those interests justified the restrictive covenants,the district court had to determine whether the geographic scope of the competitor covenant was overbroad or otherwise not reasonably necessary to protect proudfoot legitimate business interests at the outset,the district court found that the agreement provided in plain fashion,that the covered area is north america and any other territory to which gordon is assigned during his employment.that finding was erroneous as the competitor clause in the agreement contains no such explicit geographic limitation.however,gordon concedes that because the competitor covenant did not include a geographic limitation,it was permissible for the district court to supply a reasonable geographic scope.here,the district court found that,even if the agreement were silent,north america and europe would be a reasonable geographic area because proudfoot conducts its operations in that territory and gordon was assigned to that territory.
once the district court determined that the restrictive covenants were enforceable and defined the geographic scope of the competitor clause,the district court concluded that gordon breached all four restrictive covenants.the district court found that gordon employment by highland breached the competitor covenant.the district court also found that gordon solicitation of bombardier and his work on projects for bombardier violated both the clause and the client covenant.finally,the district court determined that gordon retention of proudfoot materials after his employment ended breached the confidential information clause,which required gordon to return these materials to proudfoot.based on these breaches,the district court concluded that proudfoot was entitled,under.stat.j to a presumption of irreparable injury,which the district court found gordon failed to rebut.
the district court concluded that gordon breach of the competitor covenant,based on his employment with highland,tolled the restrictive period from the time he began working for highland in june through the date of the district court judgment.the district court used this violation to toll not only the restrictive period for the competitor covenant,but also the restrictive periods for the client covenant and the clause this tolling allowed the district court both to grant the injunction and to award proudfoot damages,which were based on gordon work for,and solicitation of,bombardier in february and occurred more than six months after gordon left proudfoot.
in attacking the injunction and damages award,gordon argues that the competitor clause should not have been enforced because the training he received did not rise to the level of a legitimate business interest and because he did not intentionally retain any confidential proudfoot materials.gordon also contends that,even if the competitor covenant were enforceable,his work for highland in canada should not have been considered a violation of that covenant because canada should not have been included in the geographic scope of that covenant.finally,gordon asserts that even if he breached the competitor clause,that breach should have been disregarded because it was not intentional.
although we have doubts about some of the district court factual findings and legal conclusions,gordon arguments ultimately do not persuade us that the district court erred in concluding that the confidential information which gordon had was a legitimate business interest and justified the competitor covenant gordon work for highland in canada breached that covenant and gordon breach could be used to toll the restrictive period even if that breach was not intentional.accordingly,the grant of injunctive relief was not improper 
enforceability of the competitor covenant 
the district court found that all three of proudfoot legitimate business information,training and client the competitor clause.although gordon argues that proudfoot failed to establish a legitimate business interest in his training,it is unnecessary to address that challenge because proudfoot was only required to establish one legitimate business interest to justify the covenant and we conclude that the district court did not err in finding this covenant was justified by,and reasonably necessary to protect,proudfoot legitimate business interest in its confidential information 
the district court found that,while at proudfoot,gordon received information about proudfoot clients and business operations,including training materials,pricing information,information about proudfoot methodology for providing operational management consulting services and information about proudfoot products,offerings and tools.the district court concluded that this information constituted valuable confidential business information and that the confidentiality of that information is at risk so long as gordon is employed by proudfoot direct competitor.citing autonation,d,the district court reasoned that when an employee has access to confidential business information crucial to the success of an employer business,that employer has a strong interest in enforcing a covenant not to compete.
gordon does not dispute that he received valuable confidential information during his tenure at proudfoot his only argument related to proudfoot confidential information is that he did not intentionally breach the confidentiality clauses restriction against the retention of proudfoot materials because he unknowingly kept certain proudfoot materials after leaving proudfoot and never used or disclosed those materials while working at highland.
gordon mistakenly assumes that proudfoot interest in its confidential information would only have justified the enforcement of the competitor covenant if proudfoot could establish that he breached the confidential information clause by improperly retaining and using proudfoot materials.gordon,however,ignores the fact that the information that he received was clearly not limited to the physical materials he retained.gordon admitted that he had access to confidential information about proudfoot business,including pricing information.in addition,gordon was exposed to proudfoot methodology for providing operational management consulting services as well as to proudfoot products,offerings and tools.although the testimony on these points could have been more detailed,gordon does not challenge the district court findings on these points and does not contest that he could use this information in his new position at highland to compete unfairly against proudfoot.even if it is assumed that gordon accidental retention of proudfoot materials should not be considered a material breach of the confidential information clause,the district court conclusion that gordon employment with highland endangered the information that he received at proudfoot a conclusion that gordon does not challenge provides a basis to enforce the competitor covenant moreover,nothing raised by gordon in his argument regarding the proudfoot materials that he retained undermines that conclusion as such,gordon has failed to show that the district court clearly erred in finding that proudfoot confidential information constituted a legitimate business interest that justified the competitor covenant.
geographic scope of the competitor covenant 
gordon asserts that canada should have been excluded from the geographic scope of the competitor covenant and that,if excluded,there would be no breach of the competitor covenant.in arguing for the exclusion of canada,he points out that proudfoot complaint limited the geographic scope of that covenant to the united states and urges that even apart from the complaint,including canada was not reasonably necessary to protect proudfoot business interests and,therefore,an exclusion covering canada should not be enforceable.
gordon claims that the inclusion of canada is critical because he testified that,during the first six months of his tenure at highland,he worked exclusively in canada.if this conduct were not a breach of the competitor covenant,gordon contends that the restrictive period should not have been tolled.because this tolling was necessary to both the grant of the injunction and the damages award,gordon urges that both the injunction and the damages award were not valid 
geographic scope alleged in proudfoot complaint 
gordon argues that proudfoot should be bound by the allegation in its verified complaint that the geographic scope of the competitor covenant is limited to the united states when gordon raised this issue at trial during an oral motion for judgment on partial findings,proudfoot counsel responded that the stipulation expanded the scope of the territory outlined in the complaint after denying gordon motion,the district court explicitly stated that the impact of the stipulation on the complaint was still an open issue.however,in his proposed findings,gordon never argued that the allegations in proudfoot complaint conclusively determined that the competitor covenant geographic scope did not encompass canada.moreover,not only did the evidence at trial include admissions by gordon that his territory included canada and that he attended weekly meetings that discussed every project in north america,but gordon has not even argued that the allegation in proudfoot complaint prejudiced him either during discovery or at trial.the trial court was,therefore,fully justified in relying on the evidence offered rather than on what clearly appeared to be a mistake in proudfoot pleadings.
reasonableness of the geographic scope of the competitor noncompete covenant 
whether a covenant is reasonable or overly broad is a question of fact for the trial court.whitby infinity radio,so d,holding that trial court erred in granting summary judgment without conducting an evidentiary hearing to hear and receive evidence regarding covenant reasonableness and scope and noting that trial court had previously assured employee that she would be allowed to present such evidence.as explained below,the district court did not clearly err in including canada in the geographic scope of the competitor.
as an initial matter,we reject gordon argument that proudfoot failed to show that it competes in the canadian market because no evidence was introduced identifying specific proudfoot clients in canada.carvalho,proudfoot ceo,testified that proudfoot has clients all over the united states and canada,and markets itself throughout both countries.aside from the testimony of carvalho,gordon admitted that he visited one proudfoot client project in canada covered a territory that included the united states,canada and mexico and attended weekly meetings that discussed proudfoot projects in north america.notably,gordon offered no contrary evidence suggesting that proudfoot does not compete in the canadian market.
with regard to the issue of the appropriate geographic scope,gordon sole argument related to proudfoot confidential information is that there was no evidence that proudfoot knowledge management database contained any information about any specific canadian clients,and that,even if it did,there was no evidence he accessed any such information.underlying gordon argument is the assumption that the confidential information he received at proudfoot is relevant only to specific clients and to the united states market.however,if a restriction preventing gordon from working for a direct competitor anywhere in the united states was reasonably necessary to protect the confidential information gordon received,a point that gordon does not contest,it is unclear why that information would not be equally relevant to the canadian market.even if gordon never accessed confidential information about specific canadian,gordon points to no evidence showing that the confidential information he did receive was only relevant to the united states and could not be used by a competitor to compete unfairly against proudfoot in the canadian market.as such,we can not say that the district court clearly erred in including canada in the geographic scope of the competitor covenant.see autonation maki,cace,wl,at,enjoining former employee from competing within miles of his former auto dealership and within miles of any other dealerships owned by his former employer anywhere in the united states where employer established interests in confidential information and training and former employee failed to show that geographic area was overbroad,aff,so d per curiam autonation hankins,cace,wl,at,same autonation,d,finding reasonable geographic restriction preventing employee from working in any geographic space in which employer operates where employer had interest in confidential information see also intermetro indus.kent,wl,at,when the employer protected interests include information that may be competitively harmful to the employer in any area it competes,then it is reasonable for a to extend to all areas the employer competes.
intent to breach the competitor covenant 
gordon also argues that because he had a reasonable belief that his work for highland in canada did not violate the agreement,the district court should not have relied on his breach of the competitor covenant in granting the injunction and tolling the restrictive period.according to gordon,his belief was based on the fact that the competitor covenant did not explicitly include a geographic scope and that his territory at proudfoot did not include canada.in arguing that proudfoot had to show that he intentionally breached the competitor covenant,gordon relies on milner voice and data,tassy,d,which required the plaintiff to prove that the defendants intentionally breached the restrictive covenants at issue in order to receive injunctive relief,id.at citing sarasota beverage johnson,so d.
as an initial matter,gordon assumes that if florida law requires an intentional breach of a restrictive covenant in order to grant an injunction,his breach of the competitor covenant would not trigger the agreement tolling provision unless that breach was intentional.however,all of the decisions that gordon cites to in arguing that florida law requires an intentional breach discuss intentional breach in the context of parties seeking a preliminary injunction.although it is unclear if gordon is correct in assuming that the same standard would also govern the tolling provision,it is unnecessary to resolve that question because we are not persuaded that,in a case governed by.stat,florida law would refuse to grant injunctive relief if an employee reasonably believed that his conduct did not violate the restrictive covenants at issue.
some older florida intermediate appellate court decisions have stated that a plaintiff must prove that the defendant intentionally breached the restrictive covenant in order to be entitled to a preliminary injunction,see,sarasota beverage,so d at silvers,so d.although these decisions refer,in what is arguably dicta,to an intent element,none of these decisions have held that a preliminary injunction should be denied if a plaintiff fails to prove that the defendant intentionally breached the restrictive covenant at issue.nor do these decisions discuss or even mention the notion that a preliminary injunction should be denied if a defendant has a reasonable belief that his conduct did not violate the restrictive covenant at issue.in addition,these decisions are questionable precedent because they appear to misconstrue prior authority moreover,all of the florida state court decisions referring to an intent element were decided under the earlier statute.stat.a,which does not apply to the agreement.stat.
stat.h,which governs this case,states that t he violation of an enforceable restrictive covenant creates a presumption of irreparable injury to the person seeking enforcement of a restrictive covenant.nothing in the statute suggests that intentional breach is a precondition to relief,and no florida state court decisions under this statute have required plaintiffs to prove intentional breach in order to benefit from the statutory presumption of irreparable injury the only decision discussing an intent element under the new statute is milner voice and data,tassy,d,a federal district court decision that relies on sarasota beverage,so d at,a case decided under the prior statute.
in addition.stat.h states that 
a court shall construe a restrictive covenant in favor of providing reasonable protection to all legitimate business interests established by the person seeking enforcement.a court shall not employ any rule of contract construction that requires the court to construe a restrictive covenant narrowly,against the restraint,or against the drafter of the contract.
this section was added to.stat.in order to legislatively discard prior florida decisions that invoked and applied such doctrines in restrictive covenant cases.grant steele at.the approach proposed by gordon,which would not even consider the employer legitimate business interests,would undermine the policy behind this section.it would make little sense for a court to follow this section mandate and construe a restrictive covenant broadly only to turn around and conclude that the defendant breach of the covenant should nonetheless be excused because the defendant may have reasonably interpreted the covenant more narrowly 
even assuming that intent would,in some circumstances,be relevant under florida law and that gordon belief was reasonable,we fail to see why such a belief should have prevented the district court from using gordon breach as a basis to toll the restrictive period and to enjoin prospectively gordon from working for highland.the fact that gordon may have reasonably erred in determining the scope of the competitor covenant does not grant him a license to work for a competitor in violation of the agreement.
the district court damages award is overturned because there was no showing that gordon breach caused the claimed damage.the damages award against gordon was based on gordon contact with bombardier in february,which led to highland obtaining the bombardier logistics project.although the district court made certain factual findings regarding bombardier,those findings do not support the award and,in addition,fail to make findings on a number of critical details from the trial testimony.those details,which appear to be undisputed,are noted below.
during the first half of,proudfoot was first introduced to,and began its sales process with,bombardier.carvalho testimony suggests that proudfoot europe was the specific proudfoot entity involved in this sales process.proudfoot submitted a proposal or bid to bombardier in late may or early june while gordon was still employed by proudfoot after its proposal was accepted,proudfoot conducted a business review for bombardier starting in.after the business review ended,bombardier hired proudfoot to conduct a project for bombardier that included work focusing on lead times,productivity gains and procurement.carvalho testified that this project was performed in the united kingdom by proudfoot europe.in february,bombardier interrupted the project,two months prior to its scheduled completion.at trial,carvalho admitted that gordon did not work on proudfoot project for bombardier.
while at highland,gordon worked on two projects for bombardier in canada.in september,gordon was assigned to a project for bombardier called bombardier interiors,which had begun prior to gordon joining highland.in february,gordon was personally involved in the design and discovery phase of a second project for bombardier called bombardier logistics.during the design and discovery phase,highland would do an initial analysis for a client in the hopes of convincing the client to hire highland for an implementation project.gordon attended all the formally scheduled meetings with bombardier and all of the meetings where highland made presentations to bombardier about the proposed project.at these meetings,gordon explained the benefits of the proposed project to bombardier.bombardier elected to hire highland for the proposed project,which ultimately generated in revenue for highland.the initial design and discovery phase of this second project generated an additional in revenue for highland.
the district court made no findings about the details of either of highland projects for bombardier.at trial,however,gordon testified that the bombardier interiors project involved helping bombardier pass faa certification for burn tests concerning the interiors of an aircraft.gordon also testified that the bombardier logistics project,which involved a different division at bombardier that builds different types of aircraft,was similar to the first project in that the primary objective for both projects was look ing at ways in which they could better produce the aircraft to meet faa guidelines in a faster fashion and mitigate some of the snags that they were having problems with.as noted earlier,the only evidence about proudfoot europe bombardier project was that it was a project that included work focusing on lead times,productivity gains and procurement.thus,based on this sparse record,it is impossible to determine if highland bombardier projects were even similar to proudfoot bombardier project.also,there is no evidence suggesting any link between the interruption of proudfoot europe bombardier project and highland bombardier logistics project.
after finding that gordon contact with,and solicitation of,bombardier in february violated the clause and client covenant,the district court concluded that this breach entitled proudfoot to in damages,an amount equal to the profits gordon helped to generate for highland from the bombardier project the district court explained that s uch profits are inextricably linked to gordon breach of the restrictive covenants.in justifying this finding,the district court,citing first miami,bell,so d,per curiam,noted that w hen a former employee solicits clients in violation of a restrictive covenant,at least one florida court has calculated the former employer losses by looking to the revenues earned as a result of the solicitation.
stat.j states that a court shall enforce a restrictive covenant by any appropriate and effective remedy,including,but not limited to,temporary and permanent injunctions.thus,proudfoot may seek damages for any breaches of the enforceable restrictive covenants in the agreement,but a n award of damages for breach of contract is intended to place the injured party in the position he or she would have been in had the breach not occurred.mnemonics,max davis,so d.as one court has explained 
to recover damages for lost profits in a breach of contract action,a party must prove a breach of contract,that the party actually sustained a loss as a proximate result of that breach,that the loss was or should have been within the reasonable contemplation of the parties,and that the loss alleged was not remote,contingent,or conjectural and the damages were reasonably certain.
frenz,port everglades,so d,emphasis added see also gay mech.contractor,wharfside two,so d,per curiam stating that in order to recover lost profits a plaintiff must prove that the defendant action caused the damage.thus,proudfoot bears the burden to prove both that it sustained a loss and that its lost profits were a direct result of gordon breaches of the client covenant and clause.whitby infinity radio,so d,applying these principles in the context of a covenant not to compete under.stat.
although,under florida law,uncertainty as to the precise amount of the lost profits will not defeat recovery so long as there is a reasonable yardstick by which to estimate the damages,causation must be proved with reasonable certainty.nebula glass,reichhold,cir citing gay,so d at see also trugreen,mower,utah surveying cases involving covenants not to compete in the employment context and holding that although a defendant profits may be relevant in measuring the amount of a plaintiff lost profits,plaintiff must still prove the fact of damages.one of the reasons why injunctions are a favored remedy for breaches of restrictive covenants is that it is inherently difficult to determine what damage actually is caused by the employee breach of of a restrictive covenant.capraro lanier bus,so d,citation omitted.
the district court erred,as a matter of law,in awarding proudfoot damages for gordon solicitation of bombardier because the district court never found that absent gordon breach,proudfoot would have obtained the bombardier logistics project.moreover,even if the district court had made such a finding,neither the underlying facts found by the district court nor any evidence in the record could support such a conclusion.the fact that highland profits are inextricably linked to gordon breach of the restrictive covenants is irrelevant absent a finding that gordon solicitation of bombardier caused proudfoot to lose business.damages for breach of a are intended to make the prior employer whole,not to punish employees.
the cases relied on by proudfoot and the district court do not hold that proudfoot can recover damages without having to prove that it suffered a loss caused by gordon breach.rather,these cases,which do not explicitly discuss the issue of causation,simply suggest that if proudfoot could show that it lost the bombardier logistics project due to gordon breach,the amount of proudfoot lost profits could be calculated by looking at highland profits.
in first miami,so d,the defendant employee had used confidential information to solicit customers from his former employer,resulting in some of the accounts being transferred to his new employer.the trial court had concluded,based on various records regarding the transferred accounts,that damages can be readily calculated from the commissions derived by defendant at his new place of employment.id.at.while first miami never explicitly discusses causation,the decision clearly implies that but for the defendant solicitation,the transferred accounts would have stayed at the former employer.under such circumstances,it may be reasonable to assume that,absent the defendant solicitation,those accounts would have generated the same amount of commissions if they had remained with the former employer.
similarly,in litwinczuk palm beach cardiovascular clinic,so d,where a doctor began seeing patients from his former employer,causation was not at issue.in litwinczuk,the court merely implied that the former employer losses may have been calculable based on what the doctor was currently billing those patients.moreover,the cases from other jurisdictions cited to in the district court decision all involve similar scenarios where there was no dispute that the loss suffered was caused by the breach.
here,however,there is simply insufficient direct or circumstantial evidence in the record from which it could reasonably be inferred that proudfoot lost the bombardier logistics project to highland.contrary to proudfoot claim,the fact that proudfoot would have been able to perform the work on the bombardier logistics project does not,standing alone,show that proudfoot would have obtained the project absent the involvement of highland or,more specifically,of gordon.
proudfoot chose not to call any witnesses from bombardier to testify about the bombardier logistics project.while proudfoot may have had sound business reasons to avoid embroiling a client in this litigation,without such testimony the record is devoid of any evidence that proudfoot lost the bombardier logistics project to highland.see nebula glass,at finding evidence sufficient to show that defective component provided by defendant caused plaintiff to lose customers where,inter alia,two customers testified that they stopped purchasing plaintiff product because of the defective component.moreover,proudfoot did not provide any records indicating that it had made a proposal in connection with the bombardier logistics project and offered no evidence that it had any,even embryonic,plans for proposing a similar project to bombardier.nor was there any testimony that proudfoot would have eventually pitched this project to bombardier.
furthermore,the district court found few facts concerning the origin of the bombardier logistics project.the district court simply found that in february,gordon was personally involved in the design and discovery phase of this project.without knowing how highland secured this project,it is impossible to infer that proudfoot ever even had a chance at obtaining the project.similarly,there is little evidence about the origin of proudfoot europe own bombardier project and no evidence about bombardier process for awarding consulting projects.it should be noted that gordon testified that highland obtained the bombardier logistics project because of an internal bombardier referral based on the successful delivery of the bombardier interiors project the district court never found that this testimony was not credible and there was no competing evidence offered by proudfoot to explain the origins of the bombardier logistics project.
in addition,given the scant details about both the bombardier project performed by proudfoot europe and highland bombardier projects,it is impossible to infer that proudfoot europe work for bombardier would have necessarily led to proudfoot securing the bombardier logistics project.the record also shows that highland bombardier projects were performed in canada,whereas proudfoot europe project occurred in the united kingdom.notably,there is no evidence that proudfoot ever even sought to perform any projects for bombardier in canada.
finally,we note that the use of the term profits,which is found in both the district court decision and throughout proudfoot brief,reveals what proudfoot is truly damages it simply disgorgement of highland profits.yet,proudfoot conspicuously avoids explicitly raising this argument and cites to no authority showing that florida law permits disgorgement of profits for breach of contract while proudfoot points to the equitable principle that no one shall be permitted to profit by his own fraud,or take advantage of his own wrong,or found any claim upon his own iniquity,or profit by his own crime,cabrerizo fortune intern.realty,so d,quoting ashwood patterson,so d,proudfoot cites to no authority applying this principle to award disgorgement of profits as damages in a breach of contract case.as this court has recognized,under florida law,disgorgement of profits earned is not a remedy for breach of contract burger king mason,cir.moreover,even if disgorgement were an appropriate remedy,proudfoot seeks the profits of highland,who is not even a party to this litigation.
proudfoot alternatively argues that we should remand this case back to the district court for a damages finding pursuant to an alternative methodology.in proudfoot proposed findings,proudfoot presented two alternative damages proposals.first,proudfoot argued that it is entitled to the total profits that highland earned on all projects that gordon worked on for highland through the date of trial.this theory is untenable for many of the same reasons that we reverse the district court damages award.second,proudfoot argues that,as a matter of equity,gordon should be required to disgorge to proudfoot the total compensation that he received while employed at highland.the authority relied on by proudfoot does not persuade us that florida law would permit such relief in this context.for example,proudfoot cites to phillips chem.morgan,so d,which required disgorgement where the employee received in breach of his fiduciary duty to his employer.that circumstance is clearly dissimilar.as such,we find no reason to remand the damages issue back to the district court 
iv.conclusion 
although gordon has failed to establish that the injunction was inappropriate,we reverse the damages award.proudfoot did not establish that it would have obtained the bombardier logistics project were it not for gordon breach accordingly,proudfoot has failed to establish that it suffered any financial loss.
gordon argues that this trip,which occurred in,was part of his orientation and that he did not do any work on that project.
although gordon maintains on appeal that his territory did not include canada,at trial,he was impeached with a deposition answer where he admitted that prior to being transferred to europe,he covered a territory that included the united states,canada and mexico.at trial,gordon tried to explain that this only meant that he worked for proudfoot north america,whose territory encompassed those countries.it should,however,be noted that gordon stated during trial that at proudfoot,we would have meetings on a weekly basis where we would literally go through and discuss every project within north america,and i was aware of all the projects 
it is somewhat unclear from gordon trial testimony whether the pricing information that he had access to was relevant only to specific clients or whether this information had broader relevance to any potential client that proudfoot might seek to obtain.carvalho,however,testified that proudfoot employees have access to pricing mechanisms,which would appear to be generally applicable.
the details of gordon work for,and solicitation of,bombardier are addressed more fully in the discussion of gordon appeal of the damages award.
the agreement defines confidential information as i client and prospective client names,needs,structures,organizations,data profiles,preferences,attitudes,idiosyncracies,and all other information concerning the business and operations of clients of the company ii all of the company applications,operating systems,techniques,methods,procedures and approaches,including diagnostic instruments,drawings,designs,graphs,charts,tapes,diagrams,films,specifications and software iii the company fee structures,and procedures and arrangements and all financial information pertaining to the company iv inventions,and research and development activities of the company and v all other materials and information concerning the company business and its conduct which the company treats as proprietary and confidential which is not generally known to others.
the district court never discussed a geographic limitation for the covenants that restrict gordon from contacting or working for proudfoot clients.
although the district court also found that gordon breached the client clause and the covenant by working on a project for bombardier in september and by working on,and soliciting,a project for bombardier in february,the district court did not explicitly rely on those breaches as a basis for tolling the restrictive period.
except for the portion of the injunction restricting the use or disclosure of proudfoot confidential information,which has no temporal limitation,the remainder of the injunction,which ran for six months,has long since expired.it is unclear if the attorney fees award would prevent gordon appeal of the injunctive relief from being moot,particularly as gordon has not appealed that,some of the same issues,such as,for example,the enforceability of the competitor clause and the tolling of the restrictive period,underlie both the injunction and the damages award.therefore,those issues are not moot.see medtronic,janss,cir holding that even though injunction had expired,issues concerning enforceability and breach of restrictive covenants were not moot where damages claim,which was bifurcated from trial of injunctive relief,was still pending.although the question of whether the district court was correct in enjoining gordon from using or disclosing proudfoot confidential information for an indefinite period of time is not moot,gordon has not challenged that determination on appeal.it should,however,be noted that similar covenants regarding confidential information have been found to be presumptively unreasonable under.stat.d where the restriction has a duration of more than two years.see,citimaxx,wl.june.
we doubt that proudfoot interest in gordon training could justify the competitor clause.proudfoot did not establish that gordon training went beyond what is usual,regular,common,or customary in the consulting industry.hapney cent.garage,so d,disapproved on other grounds,gupton village key saw shop,so d.in addition,gordon training,which appears to have involved general management,sales and consulting skills,would only seem to be specialized in the sense that it was geared to proudfoot own methodologies,practices and also have doubts whether proudfoot interest in its substantial client relationships would justify the competitor clause.proudfoot legitimate business interest in its client relationships includes the relationships that gordon established with proudfoot clients as well as the confidential information known to gordon.although the covenants that prevent gordon from contacting or working for proudfoot clients would be reasonably necessary to prevent gordon from exploiting any relationships that he developed with proudfoot clients,we do not see why the broad competitor covenant,which bars gordon from working for a competitor irrespective of which clients he is serving,would be reasonably necessary to protect proudfoot interest in the relationships that gordon developed with its clients.see envtl,carter,so d,finding that agreement that prevented former employee from performing services for customers of former employer with whom the employee had any contact during employment was justified by former employer legitimate business interest in its substantial relationships with those customers.moreover,a broad prohibition against work for a competitor may not be reasonably necessary to protect confidential information known to an employee if restrictions that prevent the employee from contacting,or working for,those clients would be sufficient to protect that information.gordon,however,has not contended that his access to confidential information was limited to information that was only relevant to specific clients.
the district court found that gordon employment by a direct competitor,no matter in what capacity,necessarily endangers proudfoot confidential information.although this broad statement suggests that the district court believed that gordon position at highland was irrelevant,it must be stressed that,prior to making this statement,the district court had previously found that gordon was in a position at highland that competes with proudfoot.
the district court findings regarding the confidentiality and value of the information that gordon had access to are somewhat troubling.for example,the district court found,without further explanation,that proudfoot valuable confidential business information included the mere identity of proudfoot clients as well as the pricing terms related to the company projects.such information may not be sufficient to justify a restrictive covenant.see deloitte touche usa llp lamela,no.civ,wl,at,rejecting,under.stat,former employer attempt to apply clause to certain clients where employee did not have any relationship with those clients and former employer failed to establish it had any special pricing arrangement with those clients and did not allege with any specificity that the employee had access to nonpublic pricing information or strategies of the former employer that would give the employee an unfair competitive advantage in dealing with those clients.the district court findings illustrate why verbatim adoption of one party proposed findings are strongly disapproved.lykes,at.that said,at trial,gordon admitted that proudfoot pricing information and the identity of proudfoot clients were confidential.moreover,before the district court,gordon did not contest that he had access to confidential information while at proudfoot and instead attempted to argue that proudfoot interest in its confidential information did not justify the restrictive covenants because there was no evidence that he ever used that information or misappropriated any confidential proudfoot materials.
it is unclear under florida law when confidential information will justify a broad restriction that prevents an employee from working for a competitor.there are two potentially conflicting strands of authority on this issue.under the approach adopted by the district court,such covenants should be enforced where an employee is in a position at her new employer to use her former employer confidential information.other authorities suggest a second,slightly different standard that would enforce such covenants where it is established that disclosure of the confidential information by the employee would be inevitable in the employee new following the first approach,the district court relied on an earlier federal case,autonation,d,which held that the employee access to confidential information,which included the former employer strategic plan,market analyses,forecasts,sales trends,and best practices,justified a restriction against work for a competitor where the employee was in a position at his new employer to use that information to unfairly compete against his former employer.some florida state court decisions also appear to have adopted this approach.see open magnetic imaging,so d,per curiam holding that physician relations representative knowledge of confidential database of physicians,which was created as part
