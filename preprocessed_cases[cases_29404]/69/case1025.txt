jeffery royal royal brought a section prisoner suit against several iowa medical classification center imcc employees,including tom reid reid,imcc head of security.after a trial,royal obtained a judgment against reid for,and was awarded attorney fees in the amount of.the district court expressly found royal did not sustain a physical injury.consequently,the district court denied mental or emotional damages,awarding only nominal damages,and further denied an award of punitive damages.we affirm.
background 
while an inmate at imcc,an institution within the iowa department of corrections,royal made numerous complaints and grievances.most of royal complaints followed unsuccessful requests for medical care to address a spinal cord injury.after reid tired of royal behavior,reid placed royal in segregation for sixty days.royal filed a section suit against the imcc officials,including reid,for retaliation against royal first amendment rights and access to the courts.the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment,which the district court denied.in denying the motion for summary judgment,the district court determined the record contained no allegations and no evidence showing royal sustained physical injury.thus,the district court determined the prison litigation and reform act of plra limited royal damages to nominal damages.see e.
following an evidentiary hearing,the district court found reid had unconstitutionally retaliated against royal by placing him in segregation because royal filed numerous grievances.since royal did not suffer physical injury,the district court assessed nominal damages of.the district court considered punitive damages,but decided against them after finding reid did not act with evil motive or reckless indifference,but out of frustration and a desire to protect his staff from royal abuse.because reid had retired,the district court also found punitive damages would not deter future conduct.applying the plra limitation on attorney fees,the district court awarded attorney fees in the amount of to royal.
on appeal,royal asserts three grounds for reversing the district court.first,royal contends he is entitled to more than nominal damages,even though he suffered no physical injury.second,royal contends the district court abused its discretion by failing to award punitive damages.third,royal attacks the constitutionality of the plra limitation on attorney fees.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review claims of constitutional error and issues of statutory construction de novo.foulk charrier,cir.however,the district court damages award,including the district court decision to deny punitive damages,is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.trobaugh hall,cir.we review the district court factual findings for clear error.see williams brimeyer,cir.
compensatory damages 
the plra states n o federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner confined in a jail,prison,or other correctional facility,for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.e.with commendable candor,royal acknowledges he did not suffer physical injury,and does not challenge the district court conclusion royal suffered no physical injury as a result of reid actions.however,royal contends the plra does not limit his damages simply because he did not suffer physical injury.royal argues the plra limitation on damages does not apply to first amendment violations,and his claim for being improperly segregated does not involve mental or emotional injury,so the plra should not limit his damages.
we are not the first court to confront whether section e applies to first amendment violations.other courts have not agreed on a uniform interpretation of section e.the majority of courts hold section e limitation on damages applies to all federal prisoner lawsuits.see,thompson carter,cir concluding s ection e applies to all federal civil actions including claims alleging constitutional violations searles van bebber,cir holding section e applies to first amendment violations allah,cir holding section e applies to first amendment violations todd graves,d,holding section e applies to fourteenth amendment suits.some courts have charted a different course,excluding first and fourteenth amendment claims from section e reach.see,canell lightner,cir holding section e does not apply to first amendment claims mason schriro,d,holding section e does not apply to fourteenth amendment equal protection claims.
we join the majority,concluding congress did not intend section e to limit recovery only to a select group of federal actions brought by prisoners.instead,we read section e as limiting recovery for mental or emotional injury in all federal actions brought by prisoners.in reaching this conclusion,we can not escape the unmistakably clear language congress used no federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner for mental or emotional injury without a prior showing of physical injury.to read this statute to exempt first amendment claims would require us to interpret n o federal civil action to mean n o federal civil action except for first amendment violations.if congress desires such a reading of section e,congress can certainly say so.we can not.
royal second argument is his claim does not involve mental or emotional injury,so the plra should not limit his recovery rights.royal apparently contends other types of recovery are available to him.to the extent royal argues nominal damages,punitive damages,and injunctive and declaratory relief are available to him,we agree.congress did not intend section e to bar recovery for all forms of relief.see,memphis cmty.sch.dist.stachura,d holding nominal damages should be granted for section claims when actual injury can not be shown smith wade,d holding punitive damages are authorized for violations of constitutional rights hughes lott,cir holding section e does not preclude nominal damages thompson,at holding section e does not preclude injunctive relief or nominal damages searles,at holding section e does not preclude nominal damages davis dist.of columbia,stating section e does not preclude injunctive relief zehner trigg,cir same.therefore,royal was free to seek nominal damages,punitive damages,injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment.congress is well within its authority to balance the interests and reasonably limit a prisoner relief.
the district court awarded in nominal damages to royal,and considered awarding punitive damages.faithfully following the plra,the district court appropriately awarded royal in nominal damages for royal first amendment violation.royal may not recover some indescribable and indefinite damage allegedly arising from a violation of his constitutional rights.see,stachura,at.stating nominal damages,and not damages based on some undefinable value of infringed rights,are the appropriate means of vindicating rights whose deprivation has not caused actual,provable injury carey piphus,d holding nominal damage award of required for procedural due process violation risdal halford,cir holding court must award nominal damages in the amount of for first amendment violations 
punitive damages 
a factfinder may assess punitive damages in a section action when a defendant conduct is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent,or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.wade,at.if a district court finds a defendant conduct meets the threshold for awarding punitive damages,the court should then consider the two purposes of punitive damages punish willful or malicious conduct and deter future unlawful conduct.coleman rahija,cir.an appellate court should not lightly reverse a district court decision to not to damages in a section case.because a district court decision to award punitive damages involves a discretionary moral judgment,we empower a district court with enough discretion to make its proper judgment call without fear of inappropriate appellate intervention.taylor howe,cir holding district court decision not to award punitive damages was not an abuse of discretion because the court action was not so far out of bounds as to justify appellate intervention.we reverse only when we are convinced the decision to not to damages constitutes an abuse of discretion.coleman,at.
given the highly deferential standard of review,we find no reversible error for three reasons.first,the district court accurately stated and applied the appropriate legal standard on punitive damages.second,the district court factual findings were not clearly erroneous.as the factfinder,the district court found no evil motive or reckless or callous indifference in reid actions.instead,the district court found reid acted,in part,out of frustration and a concern to protect his staff from royal abuse.third,the district court concluded the purposes behind punitive damages would not be advanced in this case.the district court noted reid retirement weighed against awarding punitive damages,because a punitive damages award would not deter reid future conduct.the district court also concluded punitive damages were unnecessary to deter others.this conclusion is buttressed by the district court finding reid conduct violated the first amendment,of which every imcc employee should be made aware.
royal contends trobaugh also controls the punitive damages issue.however,the court in trobaugh did not hold the district court abused its discretion by not awarding punitive damages.instead,the court held the district court abused its discretion by awarding only for nominal damages.trobaugh,at.since the court reversed the district court on the nominal damages award and remanded for reconsideration,the court asked the district court to reconsider its decision not to award punitive damages.id.at.indeed,the district court refused to award punitive damages upon remand.we conclude trobaugh does not require us to reverse the district court decision not to award punitive damages.
because the district court applied the correct legal standard,and exercised its discretion in denying punitive damages,we refuse to the district court decision.we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in not awarding punitive damages to royal.
attorney fees 
the plra places the following limitation on awards of attorney fees 
whenever a monetary judgment is awarded in an action brought by a prisoner in which attorney fees are authorized,a portion of the judgment not to exceed percent shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney fees awarded against the defendant.if the award of attorney fees is not greater than percent of the judgment,the excess shall be paid by the defendant.
d.although awkwardly worded,the plra allows an award of attorney fees for percent of the damages award.
royal contends the plra attorney fees limitation violates his constitutional rights.based on settled eighth circuit precedent,the district court rejected royal constitutional attack and awarded attorney fees in the amount of,percent of the monetary judgment.
on appeal,royal recognizes eighth circuit precedent controls the issue of the constitutionality of the plra attorney fee limitation.we agree.in foulk,at,our circuit joined other circuits in holding the plra attorney fees cap passes constitutional muster.see robinson hager,cir following foulk because this circuit has already upheld the constitutionality of the plra,and because a panel can not overturn another panel decision.in deciding the plra attorney fee limitation was constitutional,our court recognized we are not authorized to act as a superlegislature to judge the wisdom or desirability of legislative policy determinations made in areas that neither affect fundamental rights nor proceed along suspect lines.moreover,our role is not to judge the wisdom,fairness,or logic of legislative choices.foulk,at quoting walker bain,cir.
notwithstanding our circuit binding decision upholding the plra limitation on attorney fees,royal wishes to await this panel decision and seek en banc review to overrule foulk.agreeing with the district court decision to limit attorney fees to percent of the damages award,we affirm the district court award of in attorney fees.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court judgment in royal favor,including its decision to award in nominal damages and not to award punitive damages.we also affirm the district court order limiting the attorney fees award to,or percent of the damages award.
based on court precedent,the language of the physical injury requirement,and the legislative history of the prison litigation reform act plra,i disagree with the majority holding that e bars compensatory damages for violations of the first amendment,and therefore,respectfully dissent.
background 
jeff royal was convicted of cattle rustling and sentenced on august,to a term of five years in the iowa department of corrections system.prior to his conviction,royal fell through a haymow and suffered a spinal cord injury requiring him to use a wheelchair.royal was initially sent to the iowa medical and classification center imcc and assigned to the general population.royal became dissatisfied with the medical treatment he received and filed a pro se complaint on september.his complaint included allegations that he could not turn his wheelchair in his cell he was unable to get to the toilet or shower he had blood in his catheter but no action was taken by medical staff because he did not have an elevated temperature he was transferred in a van that was not handicapped accessible,requiring him to fall to the floor before pulling himself onto the van seat he had to fall on the ground and pull himself up onto a shower chair in order to shower he had to lay on the floor after using the toilet to pull on his jumpsuit,and his request to wear pants instead of a jumpsuit was denied and his requests for an enema were for ten days and once for six days.royal request for the assistance of counsel was granted on september.
in october of,the imcc medical director decided that royal did not need his analgesics and confiscated his wheelchair.royal complained that the crutches he was expected to use caused him pain and tingling in his hands and that the health service unit was far away,making it difficult for him to show up for his periodic exercises.between november and january,royal submitted seventeen grievances in attempt to regain his wheelchair.on december,royal filed a preliminary injunction motion to get his wheelchair back.accompanying the motion was an affidavit in which royal stated that his leg brace had broken and,without his wheelchair,he had to crawl on the floor.royal also asserted in the affidavit that when tom reid,the imcc security director,was notified that royal had to crawl on the floor,reid issued a memorandum stating that any inmate seen crawling on the floor would be subject to discipline.
on january,prior to the preliminary injunction hearing,royal had a consultation with a neurosurgeon at the university of iowa hospitals and clinic.the doctor stated that the use of crutches was putting pressure on royal ulnar nerve and recommended that royal wheelchair be returned to him.the prison authorities returned his wheelchair and the preliminary injunction hearing was cancelled.
on january,royal was written up after a confrontation with a nurse in the health services unit.shortly thereafter,royal was removed from the general population and placed in summary administrative segregation or,lock up.prior to being placed in segregation,royal had been rated as above average in adjusting to prison work and outstanding in adjusting to his living unit.he remained in segregation until march,when he was transferred to another facility.royal was paroled in december.
royal brought this suit pursuant to,alleging that he was retaliated against for exercising his right of access to the courts when he was placed in segregation for almost two months the magistrate judge agreed,holding that royal was placed in segregation in retaliation for filing complaints in violation of his first amendment rights.the magistrate judge,however,denied royal claims for both compensatory and punitive damages,awarding royal in nominal damages and his attorney as of the damages award.royal now ap
