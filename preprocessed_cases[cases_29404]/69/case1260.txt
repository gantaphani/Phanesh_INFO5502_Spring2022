in this appeal we consider whether a statutory scheme compelling california pistachio growers to fund generic advertising through the california pistachio commission pistachio commission violates the first amendment.more specifically,we address whether this generic advertising is the government own speech and therefore is exempt from first amendment scrutiny under the supreme court analysis in johanns livestock marketing association,d.
a group of pistachio growers,paramount land company,paramount orchards partners vi llc,wv acquisition corporation,and paramount farms,and intervenors william koch and donald quist collectively paramount,challenge the marketing and promotional activities of the pistachio commission.paramount argues that the annual subsidies mandated by the california pistachio act of the pistachio act,cal.food.agric.code,and administered by the pistachio commission constitute compelled speech in violation of the first amendment.
this issue arises in the context of the pistachio commission appeal of a preliminary injunction forbidding it from collecting and using the challenged assessments until the litigation is resolved on the merits.because it is not apparent on this record that paramount can meet its burden to establish a first amendment violation,paramount has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.although paramount has raised the specter of irreparable injury by bringing a colorable first amendment claim,its showing with respect to the merits is insufficient to sustain an injunction.we reverse the judgment of the district court and vacate the injunction.
background 
state regulation of pistachio commission 
the california state legislature created the pistachio commission to enhance and preserve the economic interests of the state of california,by,among other activities,i mplement ing public policy through its expressive conduct.cal.food agric.code.the pistachio commission administers the pistachio act and supports the pistachio industry through advertising,marketing,research,and government relations campaigns.see pistachio act.
the pistachio commission is authorized to undertake a broad range of activity research into production,food safety,marketing,crop protection and production materials,promotion of the elimination of trade barriers,consumer education regarding the health benefits of pistachios,regulation to stabilize the market,analysis of relevant foreign,federal and state regulation,cooperative crisis resolution,cooperation with state and federal agencies in foreign negotiations,and support of industry.see cal.food agric.code.this regulatory scheme,which applies to all councils and commissions relating to agricultural or seafood markets in california,is designed to work subject to,and together with,the constraints placed on the agricultural industry by state and federal statutes and regulations and international restrictions.id.
the pistachio commission has nine members,eight selected by california pistachio growers and one selected by the secretary of the california department of food and agriculture cdfa.pistachio act.acting through committees chaired by the commissioners,the commission meets three times a year and employs a staff to handle daily operations.in addition to appointing one member of the committee,the secretary of the cdfa or a designee,may attend and participate in pistachio commission or committee meetings as an ex officio member.id.like other entities in the state government,the commission is subject to transparency and ethics regulations designed to promote public accountability.
the secretary retains broad statutory authority to review and approve the pistachio commission annual budget and planned activities,conduct fiscal and compliance audits,approve nomination and election procedures,decide appeals from grievance petitions filed by growers,and suspend or discharge the commission president.see id.the secretary also may require the pistachio commission to correct or cease any activity or function that is determined by the secretary not to be in the public interest or to be in violation of the pistachio act.id.although the secretary has ultimate authority over the commission budget,operations,and planning,the secretary has declined to exercise many of his more specific statutory powers.
paramount and its various affiliated entities are the largest producers of pistachios in california,together paying between and percent of the pistachio commission total assessments in recent years.the expressive activity that has attracted paramount ire centers around generic print and public relations advertising campaigns for california pistachios.the most recent campaign features the logo california pistachios and the slogan grab a handful.the campaign included print advertising in magazines,media mailings,a satellite tour,appearances by spokesperson jane seymour,and promotion at the retail level including promotional materials,price recommendations,and advertising incentives.paramount maintains that these campaigns are ineffective in augmenting pistachio sales,do not adequately feature the nuts themselves,and are antithetical to paramount interests,which are to increase sales by differentiating its products from competitor products.
paramount also targets the pistachio commission government relations activities,which are coordinated by a political consultant who hires lawyers to represent the industry before the international trade commission and the commerce department,and to lobby government entities on behalf of the pistachio industry.paramount complains that the pistachio commission has not done enough to protect the domestic pistachio industry from foreign pistachios.
these offending activities are funded by mandatory assessments paid by pistachio producers and importers via processors who deduct dues from the amount they pay the producers.see id.failure to pay invites financial penalties and possible enforcement action by the pistachio commission.id.the majority of the commission annual budget,which has fluctuated between million and almost million in recent years,is dedicated to the challenged expressive activity.
ii.federal regulation of pistachios 
in,the united states secretary of agriculture issued a marketing order for california pistachios under the agricultural marketing agreement act of,stat,as amended,et.see the marketing order.the marketing order regulates two broad areas of the pistachio industry aflatoxin levels and minimum quality levels.id.the marketing order makes no mention of promotion,marketing,advertising,research,government relations or other potential expressive activity to be carried out by the administrative committee established by the federal regulations.the committee may deliberate,consult,cooperate and exchange information with the california pistachio commission.
iii.proceedings in the district court 
in october,paramount filed a complaint in the central district of california against the pistachio commission,challenging the mandatory assessments under the first amendment and on various state law grounds after paramount moved for a preliminary injunction,individual pistachio growers filed motions to intervene as plaintiffs and asked the district court to extend the preliminary injunctive relief to them.although the parties stipulated to the interventions as to all but two of the growers,the district court denied the motions to extend relief.the vast majority of the growers were denied relief because they were generally unfamiliar with the pistachio commission expressive activity and could not articulate any clear objections to that activity.
william koch and don quist are the only intervenors whose motions were granted by the district court.koch is a pistachio grower who objects to the pistachio commission generic message that pistachios are healthful and believes the pistachio commission is no longer necessary.quist,also a grower,objects to the commission marketing strategy,which emphasizes price rather than brand.
in december,the district court granted paramount motion for a preliminary injunction the district court held that it was unlikely that the
