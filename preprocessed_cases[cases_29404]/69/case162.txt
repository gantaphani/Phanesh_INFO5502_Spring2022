on motion by fleet national bank for the turnover of held in escrow as security for an outstanding claim,the bankruptcy court ruled that the escrow funds should instead be turned over to the debtor because the debtor transaction at issue was not a fraudulent conveyance within the meaning of the uniform fraudulent transfer act ufta.on appeal,the district court agreed.we now reverse the district court and direct the bankruptcy court to award judgment to fleet.
the material facts of this case are undisputed.in,the appellant,fleet national bank,lent the,paul valente,secured by property in newport,rhode island.valente defaulted on this loan.after the resulting foreclosure sale left a deficiency,fleet obtained a judgment on july,for from the rhode island superior court.the resulting execution order levied the goods and chattels and real estate of valente including any and all real estate located within the town of middletown,county of newport,state of rhode island.fleet filed a copy of that order in the land evidence records for the town of middletown on september.
on june,approximately one year prior to the deficiency judgment,valente transferred title to the middletown property to his son for no consideration.valente claimed that he conveyed the property for estate planning purposes however,he later testified that he and his son had an understanding that i was going to be able to stay at the house and live at the house because i could afford to keep the house any longer.the middletown real estate was valente primary asset at the time and he was having trouble paying his bills.the property was encumbered by a mortgage loan from citizens bank,the irs,and rhode island state tax liens.the mortgage alone was for and the property was only worth about.when asked at deposition why his father transferred the property to him,valente son testified because he was trying to scam somebody or scam something,i do know,beat something.it was out of the generosity of his heart.
valente filed for chapter bankruptcy protection on january,claiming that he had no assets available for distribution to his creditors.the irs and the state of rhode island released their tax liens on the middletown property.valente received his bankruptcy discharge on april,
during and after the bankruptcy proceedings,valente continued to manage,maintain,and live in the home in middletown as if he were the actual owner.he ran a business on the premises,the valco construction corporation,and paid the utilities and other bills.in april,valente contracted with a realty firm to list and sell the property.in september,after his attempt to sell the real estate failed,he leased the property.valente signed all of the lease documents and collected the rent money during this period.
on april,valente son transferred title back to his father,without consideration,because valente told him that h e was going to sell it and get his money so he could move to florida.two months later,valente entered into another listing agreement with the realty firm on august,he sold the property for cash.his son was not involved in this transaction.
in preparation for the closing on the property,a title attorney determined that fleet execution encumbered the property and would have to be removed before the sale could be completed.valente contacted fleet,and the bank agreed to release the execution if of the sale proceeds were put into escrow as security for its claim plus interest.valente placed in escrow and the sale closed.since the irs and the state of rhode island had released their liens,valente was able to pay off the citizens bank mortgage and still receive approximately,in addition to the amount in escrow.his son did not receive any of those proceeds.
valente reopened his bankruptcy case on february,and filed a motion to recover the escrow funds.he claimed that since he did not own any property in middletown when fleet executed its judgment,the bank lien never attached to his property and,therefore,its claim remained unsecured when the bankruptcy court discharged his debts in.accordingly,he asked the bankruptcy court to hold fleet in contempt for attempting to enforce a discharged debt and to order the escrow agent to turn over the remaining funds.fleet responded with its own turnover motion on may.the parties prepared a joint statement of facts and law and waived a hearing.
in denying fleet turnover motion on june,the bankruptcy court began its explanation with a lament while it is unfortunate that a debtor playing such a blatant shell game with his real estate might prevail,this one probably gets away with it,strictly by operation of law.the court then evaluated whether rhode island version of the uniform fraudulent transfer act ufta compelled valente to turn the funds over to fleet.calling valente transfers a blatant charade laden with plenty of fraudulent intent,it nevertheless concluded that mere intent was not sufficient to establish fleet claim under the ufta.valente lacked equity in the middletown property when he conveyed it to his son therefore,the court held that the conveyance did not constitute a transfer of an asset as those terms are defined by the ufta.it also held that even if the conveyance did constitute a transfer under the act,fleet could not recover because it filed the turnover motion after the ufta four year statute of limitations had expired.the court ordered the escrow agent to turn over the to valente however,it stayed this order pending appeal.
fleet appealed this decision to the district court,arguing that the ufta did not apply because its action was not a suit to recover property that was fraudulently transferred.instead,its turnover motion was aimed at enforcing a lien on the equitable interest retained by valente when he transferred legal title to the property to his son for no consideration.the district court rejected that argument and upheld the bankruptcy court order.this appeal followed 
rhode island version of the uniform fraudulent transfer act ufta provides creditors with remedies against debtors who transfer assets with intent to hinder,delay,or defraud any creditor of the debtor.laws.a.as the bankruptcy court correctly observed,the act limits its definition of asset to property of a debtor except to the extent it is encumbered by a valid lien.id.i.see also ed peters jewelry,c j jewelry,cir.since the middletown property was only worth but was encumbered by a first mortgage,as well as a number of state and federal tax liens,it did not qualify as an asset under the ufta at the time of the transfer.the bankruptcy court held,therefore,that fleet could not recover under the ufta.that conclusion was correct.however,the court failed to look beyond the ufta to evaluate fleet claim to relief under rhode island common law.
rhode island courts have long granted common law remedies to defrauded creditors when statutory relief was otherwise barred.for example,in monks deslandes,the rhode island supreme court considered whether a creditor could recover assets that the debtor was holding in his wife name to protect them from attachment.the court held that the fraudulent conveyance statute that was in effect at that time,laws,did not provide such relief since the debtor did not actually transfer the property.however,the creditor did have a right in equity to follow and reach the equitable assets of the debtor.id.in taking this approach,the court implicitly concluded that the predecessor to the ufta did not preempt the field of equitable recovery for fraudulent transfers.
the ufta,by its own terms,is consistent with this background.the act states that u nless displaced by the provisions of this chapter,the principles of law and equity,including the law relating to fraud or other validating or invalidating cause,supplement s this chapter provisions.laws.at the very least,this clause demonstrates a desire by the drafters to preserve the common law as a supplement to the ufta unless precluded by the terms of the act.moreover,to find broad preemption in the ufta,in the absence of language of preemption,would be at odds with the presumption that statutes should not be construed to alter common law principles absent an explicit statement of legislative intent to do so.see,shaw.no statute is to be construed as altering the common law,farther than its words import.knowles ponton,it is a well settled rule in the construction of statutes that legislative enactments will be construed to alter the common law only to the extent that the legislature has made that purpose clear.norman singer,sutherland statutory construction revision where there is any doubt about statutes meaning or intent they are given the effect which makes the least rather than the most change in the common law.
our own case law rejects the proposition that the adoption of the ufta by a state preempts all common law remedies relating to fraudulent transfers.in goya foods,unanue,cir,a case with some striking similarities to this case,the district court imposed a constructive trust,under new york law,to allow a creditor to execute judgment against properties that the debtor was concealing under his wife name.the district court concluded that the debtor was the true owner of the properties because he purchased them with his money,lived in the residences,and maintained the properties.goya foods.accordingly,it awarded judgment to the creditor.on appeal,the debtor argued that new york fraudulent conveyance statute,with its four year statute of limitations,should have barred recovery.we responded that the lack of an effective conveyance meant that the ufta did not apply.goya,at.instead,we held that new york general statute of limitations for fraudulent actions applied,and concluded that the district court was correct in holding that the assets were held in constructive trust for the creditor.id.see also in re bushey,cir rejecting the bankruptcy court assertion that a trustee was not entitled to a resulting trust remedy outside of the ufta purview.
courts in other states evaluating claims in other contexts have also rejected ufta preemption of existing remedies.see,macedo bosio,th,d t he ufta is not the exclusive remedy by which fraudulent conveyances and transfers may be attacked.they may also be attacked by,as it were,a common law action.cortez vogt,th,d t he remedies of the ufta are cumulative to the remedies applicable to fraudulent conveyances that existed before the uniform laws went into effect.freitag mcghie,observing that the purpose of the ufta was to discourag e fraud and that within the ufta itself lies a mandate to apply the common law to the extent it is not inconsistent with the provisions of the act bill nay sons excavating neeley constr,utah imposing a resulting trust after concluding that the creditor did not satisfy the requirements for relief under the ufta.but see moore browning,app concluding that the ufta preempted the common law use of the statute of limitations regarding fraudulent actions.given this precedent,both within and without rhode island,we conclude that rhode island adoption of the ufta did not preempt common law remedies applicable to fraudulent transactions.
having concluded that the ufta does not preempt applicable remedies,we must now evaluate whether rhode island common law provides fleet with a cause of action and whether the bank took the necessary steps to avail itself of that relief.fleet claims that valente retained an equitable interest in the property after he transferred it to his son,and that the bank obtained a lien on that interest which it could enforce through the turnover proceeding in the bankruptcy court.to evaluate this claim,we must consider three issues did valente retain an interest in the transferred property pursuant to rhode island law does rhode island common law allow recovery against such interests and did fleet file the necessary action within the proper limitations period to avail itself of applicable relief.
valente interest in the middletown property 
throughout these proceedings,fleet has maintained that valente retained equitable ownership of the transferred property and that this ownership was an attachable interest.this claim has a sound basis in rhode island law,which uses the resulting trust doctrine to explain the nature of this equitable interest for example,when the debtor in tucker denico,took property in his wife name in order to keep that property out of the reach of his creditors,the rhode island supreme court recognized this transaction as a fraudulent transfer and imposed a resulting trust upon the property for the creditors benefit likewise,in mitchell campbell,the court effectively imposed a resulting trust by holding that an attachable interest is created w hen a conveyance for the purpose of defrauding creditors is made of the legal title to real estate without any intention of passing the beneficial interest therein.the equitable interest found by the courts in these cases sufficed to provide the creditors relief from the debtors fraudulent attempts to avoid attachment.
valente fraudulent transaction with his son fits readily into the resulting trust model.according to the restatement second of trusts 
a resulting trust arises where a person makes or causes to be made a disposition of property under circumstances which raise an inference that he does not intend that the person taking or holding the property should have the beneficial interest therein,unless the inference is rebutted or the beneficial interest is otherwise effectively disposed of.

valente transferred the property to his son for no consideration shortly before he declared bankruptcy because he could afford to keep the house any longer.the two had an understanding that valente was going to live in the house,and he continued to treat the property as his own by,inter alia,paying all of the bills,managing the lease and sale of the property,running a business on the premises,and not paying rent.his son admitted that his father aim was to scam somebody or scam something.he also testified that he returned the property,for no consideration,when his father told him that he was interested in selling it.this evidence compels a finding of a resulting trust with valente son holding legal title to the middletown property in trust for his father,who retained the equitable interest in the property at the time of the transfer to his son hence,we must now evaluate whether fleet could have attached that interest or otherwise secured relief in a rhode island court.
fleet cause of action 
fleet claims that its state judgment and execution created a lien on the equitable interest that valente retained in the middletown property.we agree.as we noted in the previous section,the rhode island supreme court,in mitchell campbell,explicitly allowed a creditor to acquire a lien on assets 
when a conveyance for the purpose of defrauding creditors is made of the legal title to real estate without any intention of passing the beneficial interest therein,it is well settled that the equitable estate of the grantor may be attached in a suit at law as well as in equity.
