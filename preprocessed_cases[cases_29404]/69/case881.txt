gerald lampley believed that he had been denied a promotion by onyx acceptance as a result of race discrimination.he complained to the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc and shortly thereafter was fired.lampley then filed a title vii suit against onyx and a jury concluded that he was a victim of race discrimination,awarding him in compensatory damages.the jury also awarded compensatory and punitive damages totaling for retaliatory discharge,although this amount was later reduced by to comply with a statutory cap.onyx appeals the retaliatory discharge award,arguing that the award is excessive and that the punitive damages issue should not have gone to the jury.because we find that a jury could reasonably have determined that punitive damages were warranted and that a total award of was not inappropriate,we affirm.
background 
gerald lampley,an,was employed as an account manager with level buying authority by onyx acceptance,a company engaged in indirect automobile finance.lampley worked out of onyx rosemont,illinois branch office under mike strater,the dealer center manager for that office.strater was an assistant manager when lampley was first hired in february he was promoted to manager in october.beginning in the fall of,lampley repeatedly asked strater to give him level buying authority but his requests were denied.lampley ultimately determined that race discrimination was the reason for strater failure to promote him.
for resolution of discrimination issues,onyx policy was to have employees call the human resources department at corporate headquarters in california.there was a notice in lampley office stating that employees should report suspected discrimination to the eeoc.upon determining that he was a victim of race discrimination,lampley did not call headquarters,but instead talked to michelle bland about a comment lampley found to be racially offensive that he believed strater had made according to lampley,bland advised him to work things out with strater.lampley next went to the eeoc to file a race discrimination claim on november.strater called lampley at that time,and lampley explained that he was at the eeoc filing a complaint 
strater scheduled a meeting with lampley for november.according to lampley,at the meeting which was also attended by joseph long,one of strater assistant managers strater told lampley that w e ca have anybody working here who complains and files complaints to the eeoc.i want your resignation.lampley refused,and strater fired him.lampley then returned to the eeoc and filed a retaliatory discharge claim.during the eeoc investigations of both the race discrimination and retaliatory discharge claims,onyx told the eeoc that strater failure to promote lampley and lampley ultimate termination were due to lampley inadequate performance,and provided supporting documentation.the eeoc dismissed lampley charges and issued him letters.
in april,after settling his claims against strater,lampley pursued a complaint against onyx,claiming race discrimination and retaliatory discharge under title vii of the civil rights act of,et.at trial,he provided data that countered the documentation onyx had sent the eeoc to support its claim that lampley had performance problems.for instance,onyx told the eeoc that lampley obtained and in loans in september and october,respectively.however,lampley documents showed that he had obtained in loans in september and in october.the target loan amount for these months was.lampley,whose wife was pregnant at the time of his termination,explained that he felt devastated upon being fired,and is definitely changed from it.his wife also testified regarding lampley altered emotional state following his termination,describing him as depressed.she also said that although lampley did not seek psychiatric help,the couple eventually received counseling through church services.
strater and long both asserted that at lampley termination meeting,there was no discussion of or reference to the eeoc,and that a meeting had in fact been scheduled for the previous friday for the purpose of terminating lampley.strater further stated that he,long,and kurt wheeler,an assistant manager,had decided to fire lampley on november,and had called rosie hokanson,a and human resources director,on that date to inform her of their decision.
bland and hokanson said that onyx had an policy,but no physical evidence of this policy was provided to the jury hokanson was responsible for providing documentation to the eeoc during the eeoc investigations,including the documents suggesting that lampley was not performing satisfactorily.when about a statement she had sent to the eeoc stating that lampley was given a formal written warning via telephone on november,by his immediate supervisor,kurt wheeler,regarding his performance issues,hokanson said she verified the existence of the written warning by pulling lampley personnel file.however,when she was asked to review lampley personnel file and find the written warning,hokanson acknowledged that it was not there.
the jury ultimately awarded lampley in compensatory damages and no punitive damages on his race discrimination claim.with respect to the retaliatory discharge claim,the jury awarded in compensatory damages and in punitive damages.the district court denied onyx motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,a new trial,and remittitur below the statutory maximum.however,at the request of both parties,the district court reduced the judgment from to in order to satisfy the statutory cap for a company of onyx size.see b.the court did not explain whether the compensatory damages award,the punitive damages award,or both were being diminished.onyx appeals both the compensatory damages award and punitive damages award resulting from the retaliatory discharge claim,asserting that the punitive damages issue should never have gone to the jury,and that the award is excessive even if it is within the statutory cap.
ii.analysis 
sufficiency of the evidence regarding punitive damages 
onyx asserts that there was insufficient evidence to warrant the imposition of punitive damages.the question of whether onyx is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this issue is subject to de novo review,with the evidence and all reasonable inferences taken in the light most favorable to lampley.mathur bd.of trs.of,cir.more specifically,we ask whether no rational jury could have found for the plaintiff.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
a plaintiff may recover punitive damages under title vii if three requirements are satisfied specifically,the plaintiff must establish that the employer acted with knowledge that its actions may have violated federal law and that the employees who discriminated against him are managerial agents acting within the scope of their employment.bruso united airlines,cir citing kolstad am.dental ass n,d.however,even if these two prongs are met and onyx concedes that a jury could find that they are in this case,the employer may avoid liability for punitive damages if it can show that it engaged in good faith efforts to implement an antidiscrimination policy.id.citing kolstad,at.onyx claims that it has engaged in good faith efforts,and thus the district court decision to let the jury assess punitive damages was in error.
we are unpersuaded by onyx argument.onyx allegedly had a formal policy,although it is difficult to ascertain the contours of this policy without physical evidence of its existence.but even assuming that the policy included appropriate procedures,we explained in bruso that although the implementation of a written or formal antidiscrimination policy is relevant to evaluating an employer good faith efforts at title vii compliance,it is not sufficient in and of itself to insulate an employer from a punitive damages award.id.at.here,there was sufficient evidence for a jury to believe that onyx failed to engage in good faith efforts at title vii compliance after it became aware of lampley retaliatory discharge claim.
specifically,lampley provided statistics prepared by wheeler that showed that lampley was meeting and at times greatly exceeding company ex
