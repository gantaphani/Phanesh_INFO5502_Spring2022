plaintiffs appeal from an order denying their application for a preliminary mandatory injunction directing defendant to release a mechanic lien filed against one of plaintiffs residences.they contend that defendant is not entitled to file a mechanic lien because he was not licensed as a contractor at all times during the performance of his work on the property.we conclude that the trial court properly denied the requested injunctive relief.
on april,defendant barry white doing business as western estates construction white entered into a contract with edgar slatkin to build a residence the slatkin residence.on or about july,edgar slatkin transferred ownership of the slatkin residence to lawrence slatkin.after the completion of the house in april,white recorded a mechanic lien against the property for monies allegedly owed for the construction of the residence.thereafter,the slatkins filed a complaint seeking damages for breach of contract and a mandatory injunction to vacate the mechanic lien and to prohibit the filing of any further liens on the ground that white did not have a current valid contractor license from the contractors state license board cslb.
white withdrew the original lien,and filed a new lien limiting its amount to the cost of work performed while his contractor license was not under suspension.he then filed an answer and seeking to foreclose the lien.in his answer,white conceded that his license had been suspended on or about august,because a bonding company had canceled a bond.nevertheless,he claimed he was entitled to file a mechanic lien for work he had performed because he had substantially complied with the licensing requirements.
plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction seeking to order the release of the second mechanic lien.plaintiffs contention that white was precluded from filing a lien because he was not licensed throughout the period of construction was evidenced by the certified record of white licensing history with the cslb white opposed the motion,arguing that he had substantially complied with the licensing requirements.he claimed that he was licensed when he signed the april,contract to construct the slatkin residence.on or about december,more than two years eight months into the project,and with only three months remaining to complete the house,he first received notice from the cslb that his license had been suspended effective august,four months earlier,because of the cancellation of a bond.he claimed this was the first and only time he was advised that his license was not in effect during the period of construction.upon receiving notice of the suspension,white immediately attempted to acquire a new bond.while he did not obtain one until june,with an effective date of march,the delay was caused by the fact that nearly all companies that had previously provided general contractor bonds had left the california construction bond market and once he applied for the bond,he was subject to the bonding company processing time limits.there was nothing he could have done to speed the process along.the cslb reinstated his license retroactively to march,the maximum period allowed by law,as soon as the bond was filed.
at the hearing on the preliminary injunction,plaintiffs relied on white admission that despite receiving the december,notice of his license suspension,he continued to work until the end of april.while his license was reinstated when he secured a bond on june,the reinstatement was retroactive only to march,so that there was a gap of approximately three months in which white knowingly worked without a license.white argued in opposition that plaintiffs were not likely to succeed on their claim to remove the lien and that plaintiffs would not be irreparably harmed by the pendency of the lien.the trial court refused to direct white to release the lien,noting that plaintiffs were seeking a preliminary injunction on limited amounts of evidence.this appeal ensued 
discussion 
at this initial stage in the proceeding,the scope of our inquiry is narrow.we review an order denying a preliminary injunction under an abuse of discretion standard.citations.review is confined,in other words,to a consideration whether the trial court abused its discretion in evaluat ing two interrelated factors when deciding whether or not to issue a preliminary injunction.the first is the likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial.the second is the interim harm that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction were denied as compared to the harm the defendant is likely to suffer if the preliminary injunction were issued.citation.and although we will not ordinarily disturb the trial court ruling absent a showing of abuse,an order granting or denying interlocutory relief reflects nothing more than the superior court evaluation of the controversy on the record before it at the time of its ruling it is not an adjudication of the ultimate merits of the dispute.people ex rel.gallo acuna cal th,d.
california law offers equitable remedies which the owner of property can employ to obtain a speedy hearing on the probable validity of a mechanic lien.connolly development,superior court cal d.after a lien is recorded,an owner can seek a mandatory injunction ordering the claimant to release the lien.id.at.
section of the business and professions code provides,in pertinent part,that no person engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor,may bring or maintain any action,or recover in law or equity in any action,in any court of this state for the collection of compensation for the performance of any act or contract where a license is required without alleging that he or she was a duly licensed contractor at all times during the performance of that act or contract,regardless of the merits of the cause of action brought by the person,subd.a.this prohibition applies to a contractor seeking to foreclose his or her mechanic lien lewis queen ball sons cal d,cash blackett d,and thus,by extension,to an unlicensed contractor right to file a mechanic lien.
however,a contractor may avoid the harshness of section by establishing that he or she has substantially complied with the appropriate licensing requirements.subdivision e of section provides,in pertinent part t he court may determine that there has been substantial compliance with licensure requirements under this section if it is shown at an evidentiary hearing that the person who engaged in the business or acted in the capacity of a contractor had been duly licensed as a contractor in this state prior to the performance of the act or contract,acted reasonably and in good faith to maintain proper licensure,and did not know or reasonably should not have known that he or she was not duly licensed.
plaintiffs challenge white ability to establish that he has substantially complied with the licensing requirements as permitted under subdivision e of section.plaintiffs concede that white was duly licensed when he signed the contract at issue,and for purposes of this appeal,they do not contend that white did not act reasonably and in good faith to maintain proper licensure.however,because white admitted that he received a notice of suspension in december,they contend that as a matter of law he can not establish the third requirement that he did not know that he was not duly licensed,and therefore,he necessarily has not substantially complied with the licensing requirements.
there is an important uncertainty in the meaning of subdivision e of section.the third requirement for establishing substantial compliance with licensure the individual did not know or reasonably should not have known that he or she was not duly no time referent.plaintiffs argument assumes that the statute means that the individual must not have known or had reason to know that he or she was no longer licensed at any time that construction was in progress.however,that is not the only interpretation to which the language is reasonably susceptible.while both subdivisions a and d of section are explicit that the general prohibition against the recovery of payment applies if the contractor
