the los angeles county sheriff department revised its manual of policy and procedures to include this language prior to being interviewed by assigned departmental investigators members of the department who were either involved in or witnessed a shooting may consult individually with legal counsel or labor representatives but shall not consult with legal counsel and or labor representatives collectively or in groups,two or more members consulting at the same time with the same legal representative.emphasis added.the association for los angeles deputy sheriffs alads filed the current action to enjoin the department from implementing its policy revision.the trial court denied alads motion for a preliminary injunction.the issue before us on this appeal is whether the trial court abused its discretion by denying alads motion for a preliminary injunction.we affirm the trial court order.
i.the memorandum of understanding 
alads is the certified representative for the department nonsupervisory deputies,also known as bargaining unit.on a date not clear from the record,alads and the department entered a collective bargaining agreement known as the unit salary memorandum of understanding the mou.the terms and conditions of employment under which the department deputies perform their duties are governed by the parties mou,the act or mmba,et,the public safety officers procedural bills of rights act or pobr,et,and the employee relations ordinance of the county of los angeles county code,tit,ch.
the record before us on appeal does not include a copy of the parties mou or any parts of the mou.alads,however,alleges that the mou includes unwritten terms and conditions of employment under which the department deputies perform their duties.alads alleges that these unwritten terms and conditions of employment have become part of the parties mou because they are consistent and established practices which have been applied to the department deputies for over years.
alads specifically alleges that the parties mou includes an unwritten term and condition of employment to the following effect w hen there are deputies involved in a shooting and the deputies request representation during a department investigation into the shooting incident,deputies who either were shooters in the incident witnessed the shooting shall be entitled to consult with legal counsel labor representatives collectively and in a group,two or more deputies consulting at the same time with the same legal representative.
ii.the sheriff department proposed policy revisions 
in june,the department notified alads of a proposed series of revisions to the department manual of policy and procedures governing shootings.section of the proposed policy revisions explained the basic reasons for the new policies governing shootings 
the use of deadly force by law enforcement personnel is an appropriate and necessary action when confronted by a deadly threat to members of the department third parties.while department members have a record of making appropriate decisions regarding the application of deadly force,the magnitude of such decisions demands they be closely and objectively reviewed.one critical component of this process is the gathering of facts from every available witness.that process must be undertaken promptly and with investigatory integrity.at the same time,the investigatory process must honor the rights and consider the needs of all persons.this policy is intended to ensure the objectivity and integrity of the process while honoring the rights and needs of department members.
as originally drafted,proposed policy revision section provided 
involved personnel will be interviewed by homicide bureau investigators about the shooting incident when the shooting results in death or injury to a person in shootings,involved personnel shall be interviewed by internal affairs bureau iab investigators.upon request,involved personnel may consult individually with legal counsel telephonically or in person before providing interviews to homicide bureau or iab investigators.
in july,august and september,representatives from alads and the department discussed the department proposed policy revisions governing investigations of shootings.on september,alads filed a notice of impasse with the los angeles county employee relations commission,requesting the appointment of a mediator to oversee further negotiations.on october,the department advised alads by letter that,notwithstanding any further negotiations over its policy revisions,the department would,effective november,implement its proposed policy revisions governing investigations of shootings.
on november,the department redrafted section,so that it now provides 
shootings are likely the most critical incidents in which department personnel become involved therefore,they appropriately warrant an and objective analysis.a central component in this process is the collection of statements from every identifiable witness.the investigative process must be undertaken promptly and with the highest level of investigatory integrity,while at the same time,honoring the rights and needs of department members.
the following investigative protocols have been established by the department in order to ensure these objectives 
personnel,either involved in,or a witness to,the event,shall not discuss the circumstances of the incident among themselves or with uninvolved persons prior to being interviewed by assigned department investigators 
members who were either involved in or witnessed the incident may consult individually with legal counsel or labor representatives telephonically or in person before providing an interview with department investigators.members who were either involved in or witnessed the incident shall not consult with legal counsel and or labor representatives collectively or in groups,two or more members consulting at the same time with the same legal representative.
iii.procedural history of alads compliant for injunctive relief 
on november,alads filed a verified complaint against the department,seeking a temporary restraining order,and preliminary and permanent injunctions to preclude the department from implementing section to the extent that it precludes members of the department from consulting with legal counsel and or labor representatives collectively or in groups.alads complaint alleges three causes of action in support of injunctive relief the department policy revision violates the mmba the department policy revision violates the pobr and the department policy revision violates the constitutional right to consult with counsel guaranteed to its deputies under the federal and state constitutions.
in support of its request for injunctive relief,alads submitted declarations from john rees alads executive director,helen schwab an attorney with the law firm of green shinee,which represents alads members in connection with investigations arising from shooting incidents,richard shinee ditto,and elizabeth gibbons ditto.in opposition to alads motion for a preliminary injunction,the department filed extensive objections to the declarations submitted by alads.the record on appeal does not reflect any evidence submitted by the department in opposition to alads motion for a preliminary injunction.the effective thrust of the department opposition to the issuance of a preliminary injunction rested on the position that its policy revision was,on its face,a valid workplace regulation.
the trial court issued an order to show cause,and set a hearing on alads motion for a preliminary injunction.on december,the trial court heard arguments,and took the matter under submission.on december,the trial court entered a minute order denying alads motion for a preliminary injunction.
on january,alads filed a motion for reconsideration.on march,the trial court entered an order denying alads motion for reconsideration,expressly finding that alads had failed to present new or different facts,circumstances,or law which was unknown or unavailable to alads at the time of the original preliminary injunction hearing.
alads filed a timely notice of appeal.
iv.the policy language 
alads has expressed concern that the trial court minute order denying its motion for a preliminary injunction includes language which suggests that the department policy revision not only prohibits deputies from meeting in a group with one lawyer,but also prohibits deputies from consulting separately with more than one lawyer from the same law firm.in other words,alads contends,there is some language in the trial court order which suggests that there can be only one lawyer from one law firm in the initial stages of an investigation into a shooting.
we do not find such language in the trial court order.further,we agree with alads that the language of the department policy does not state that,in connection with a shooting incident,a lawyer may only represent a singe deputy,and that only one lawyer from any given law firm may be involved in the initial investigation.the department policy revision only prohibits a group of deputies from meeting with the same lawyer at the same time.we see no language in the department policy revision which prevents the same lawyer,or different lawyers from the same law firm,from meeting individually with many different deputies.
we agree with alads,and advise the department that multiple deputies may consult with the same lawyer in individual sessions or with different lawyers from the same law firm.
discussion 
i.the appeal is dismissed to the extent it challenges the motion for reconsideration 
before turning to alads substantive arguments on appeal,we address the department jurisdictional contention that we must dismiss part of alads appeal.according to the department,we do not have jurisdiction to consider alads appeal to the extent it challenges the trial court order denying its motion for reconsideration.we lack jurisdiction,argues the department,because an order denying a motion for reconsideration is not an appealable order.we agree.
in freeman state farm mut.auto.ins.cal d,the supreme court suggested without discussion that an order denying a motion for reconsideration is appealable when the motion raised new facts or law.id.at,fn,citing farrar mccormick d.the unspoken but implicit reasoning of freeman is that,where a motion for reconsideration presents new facts or law,the new facts or law can not otherwise be reviewed on the appeal from the underlying order.in the years after freeman,a handful of appellate courts have followed its lead.see,santee santa clara county office of education d.
more recently,however,the prevailing view among our appellate courts has been that an order denying a motion for reconsideration is not an appealable order under any circumstances.see,rojes riverside general hospital d.crotty trader th,d an order denying a motion for reconsideration is never appealable regardless of whether new facts were raised in re marriage of burgard th,d reese stores,th,d annette sharon th,d acknowledging a split of authority but observing that the prevailing view among appellate courts is that a denial of a motion for reconsideration is never appealable under any circumstances.
we have previously adhered to the prevailing view in an unrelated nonpublished opinion,and see no reason to reach a different conclusion in the current case.moreover,the trial court in the current case expressly found that alads had failed to present any material new facts in support of its motion for reconsideration,and we agree with the trial court assessment.thus,even under the broader view that an order denying a motion for reconsideration is appealable when new facts or law have been presented,we would still decline to address alads claims of error connected with its motion for reconsideration 
ii.the trial court properly denied the preliminary injunction 
applicable law 
a trial court decision on a motion for a preliminary injunction does not amount to an adjudication of the ultimate rights in controversy.it merely determines that the court,balancing the respective equities of the parties,concludes that,pending a trial on the merits,the defendant should or that he should not be restrained from exercising the right claimed by him or her.the general purpose of such an injunction is the preservation of the status quo until a final determination of the merits of the action.thus,the court examines all of the material before it in order to consider whether a greater injury will result to the defendant from granting the injunction than to the plaintiff from refusing it.in making that determination the court will consider the probability of the plaintiff ultimately prevailing in the case and,it has been said,will deny a preliminary injunction unless there is a reasonable probability that plaintiff will be successful in the assertion of his rights.in the last analysis,the trial court must determine which party is the more likely to be injured by the exercise of its discretion and it must then be exercised in favor of that party.continental baking katz cal d,internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also langford superior court cal d.in all cases,however,the trial court decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction rests in the sound discretion of the court,based upon its consideration and evaluation of the circumstances of the case.salazar eastin cal th,d.
in light of the discretion vested in the trial court in addressing a motion for a preliminary injunction,appellate review of a trial court ruling on such a motion is deferential.a reviewing court shall not disturb a trial court decision to grant or deny a motion for a preliminary injunction absent a showing that the trial court abused its discretion.salazar eastin,supra,cal th at,d.the test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason.walker superior court cal d.
with these principles set in place as a foundation,we turn to alads arguments on appeal.
iii.alads is not likely to prevail under the public safety officers procedural bill of rights act 
alads first contention involves the pobr.et alads contends the trial court decision to deny its motion for a preliminary injunction must be reversed because the court based its decision on an erroneous interpretation of section,subdivision i.more specifically,alads contends the trial court wrongly interpreted section,subdivision i,to permit a police agency to impose reasonable limits on a police officer statutory right under the pobr to consult with counsel of his or her choosing in connection with an official interrogation.we find no fault with the trial court statutory interpretation.
as relevant to alads current case,section,subdivision i,provides w henever an interrogation focuses on matters that are likely to result in punitive action against any public safety officer,that officer,at his or her request,shall have the right to be represented by a representative of his or her choice who may be present at all times during the interrogation.
reasonable limits may be placed on a police officer right to counsel of choice 
the trial court cited upland police officers city of upland th,d upland,in support of its conclusion that section,subdivision i,permits a police agency to impose reasonable limits on a police officer statutory right under the pobr to consult with counsel of his or her choosing.alads contends the trial court in the current case misread upland,and that upland did not approve an rule that a police agency may impose reasonable restrictions on a police officer right under the pobr to consult with counsel of his or her choosing.alads arguments fail to persuade us that the trial court interpretation of section,subdivision i,is so infected with error that it mandates reversal of the court decision to deny a preliminary injunction.
in upland,a police department served officer nikola kac with a written notice of an internal affairs interrogation.shortly thereafter,the department and officer kac lawyer agreed to conduct the interrogation on a specific date,at a specific time.on the appointed date for the interrogation,officer kac lawyer notified the department that he had been delayed on another matter,and could not attend the interrogation.the department went forward with the interrogation in the absence of officer kac lawyer.officer kac joined by this police officers association thereafter filed suit against the department,and the trial court issued a preliminary injunction which prohibited the department from proceeding with an interrogation of an officer if the representative of his or her choice is unavailable.upland,supra,th at,d.
the court of appeal reversed the order granting the preliminary injunction,finding,in essence,that the injunction was overly broad w e fully support the officer right to be represented by a person of his or her choice during an interrogation.we only hold that such a right is not unlimited.the officer must choose a representative who is reasonably available to represent the officer,and who is physically able to represent the officer at the reasonably scheduled interrogation.but it is the officer responsibility to secure the attendance of his or her chosen representative at the interrogation.if he or she is unable to do so,the officer should selectanother representative so that the interrogation may proceed at a reasonable hour.this is particularly true where,as here,the interrogation has already been scheduled for a mutually agreeable time.neither the department nor the officer should be expected to change their schedules simply to accommodate a busy attorney,particularly since other members of the firm could have represented the officer at the scheduled questioning.upland,supra,th at,d,emphasis added.
the upland court essentially ruled that a police officer right to representation under section,subdivision i,did not the literal language of the injunction absolute the right to represented by any counsel of the officer choosing.to do so,concluded the court,would effectively empower a police officer to prevent any interrogation simply by choosing a representative who would never be available for an interrogation.upland,supra,th at,d.to avoid that result,the upland court ruled that a police officer choice of counsel must reasonably accommodate his or her department interests in conducting a prompt and efficient investigation of an shooting incident.ibid.
returning to alads case,we agree with the trial court that section,subdivision i,as interpreted in upland,permits a police agency to impose reasonable limits on a police officer statutory right under the pobr to consult with counsel of his or her choosing during an interrogation regarding an shooting.
the restrictions here are reasonable 
taking an alternative tack,alads next contends that,assuming section,subdivision i,does allow a police agency to impose reasonable limits on a police officer right to representation,the restrictions the department sought to impose in this instance are not reasonable.we disagree.
this is alads entire argument in support of its assertion that the department policy revisions are unreasonable t he restriction against huddling occurs at a crucial time.statements made by deputies during their interrogations can be used against them not only criminally but also administratively.alads,upon recognizing its duty to provide fair representation to its members,selected the law office of green shinee to represent its deputy sheriffs in officer involved shooting incidents the department unilaterally implemented policy which prohibits deputies from meeting with counsel in a group improperly violates deputies right to counsel as mandated by the state and federal constitutions and by the pobr.this interference was incorrectly deemed reasonable by the trial court.it is not reasonable as it interferes with how a client can interact with counsel before providing very crucial and potentially criminally and administratively harmful statements.
we find alads conclusory assertions to be insufficient to establish that the department policy revisions are unreasonable as a matter of law.alads argument would be more persuasive had the department tried completely to prevent a deputy from meeting with counsel.see long beach police officer city of long beach d.long beach.the department policy revisions,however,expressly protect a deputy right to meet with counsel individually.the only issue,therefore,is whether the department acted unreasonably when it decided to prohibit huddling between multiple deputies and a single lawyer.in our view,the trial court assessment of reasonableness was not incorrect as a matter of law,and,thus,the court decision to deny a preliminary injunction should not be reversed.
we agree with alads that an official interrogation following an shooting incident occurs at a crucial time and that,correspondingly,the officer should have legal representation in the event he or she so desires counsel.the department policy revision recognizes as much.the department policy revision expressly provides that a deputy may consult individually with counsel before being interrogated by an investigator.the department policy only precludes an officer from getting together in a group with other officers and a lawyer,the objective of the policy being to assure the collection of accurate witness accounts before the recollection of witnesses can be influenced by the observation of other witnesses.
after a deputy initial interview,he or she may engage any lawyer that he or she desires and may have any type of relationship with that lawyer individual or communal that he or she desires.in other words,after an initial interrogation,any number of officers may choose to be represented by the same lawyer in any subsequent administrative or criminal proceeding.
juxtaposing the limited and temporary qualification on a deputy right to counsel under the department policy against the rational objectives of that policy,we can not say the department policy revision is unreasonable as a matter of law.in short,we can not find that the trial court abused its discretion by finding that it is unlikely that alads will prevail at trial on its claim that the department policy revision violates section,subdivision i.
iv.alads is not likely to prevail on it constitutional claims 
the trial court found that alads is unlikely to prevail on its constitutional claims,finding t here is no constitutional right to huddle in a group with counsel.alads contends the trial court erroneously distinguished long beach,supra,d,in concluding that the department policy revision will not abridge its deputies constitutional right to consult with counsel.we disagree.
a.the fifth and sixth amendment 
in long beach,the chief of the police department issued a directive prohibiting the department police officers who were involved in a shooting from consulting with an attorney or representative of the police officers association prior to the filing of a written or oral report concerning the incident.long beach,supra,d at.the chief of the police department had determined that the directive was necessary because of prior instances in which an officer consultation with an attorney or the police officers association had interfered with the department investigation of the shooting incident.ibid.the police officers association filed an action to enjoin implementation of the directive,and the trial court issued a preliminary injunction.
division three of our court affirmed the trial court decision to issue injunctive relief,ruling that the police department had violated the requirements of the mmba by unilaterally implementing the new,no attorney policy.as division three explained the police department unilateral decision to abolish the practice of allowing officers to consult with counsel prevented a meaningful and possibly amicable solution to this dispute by negotiation.the police officers association has represented that its attorneys were willing to abide by any reasonable restrictions in the practice.we accept this representation at face value and conclude that the police department unilateral abrogation of the past practice was in violation of the mmba meet and confer provisions contained in section.long beach,supra,d at.
division three then expressly stated that,because it had resolved the appeal on the basis of the collective bargaining agreement and the mmba,it was unnecessary to decide the police officers association claims under the fifth and sixth amendments of the united states constitution.ibid.
with regard to alads current case,we agree with the trial court that the facts and circumstances are significantly and materially different from those which were presented in long beach,where a police department completely prohibited an officer from consulting with counsel.in alads current case,a deputy has the express right to consult with counsel individually,and is precluded only from huddling with a group of other deputies and a common attorney.
more importantly,long beach expressly stated that it did not address the constitutional issue of whether a police agency runs afoul of the constitutional right to counsel when it regulates an officer consultation with counsel.given the issues that were and were not decided in long beach,and given that all of alads constitutional arguments rest on its incorrect assertion that long beach stated that public concern for timely revelation of facts in shooting cases do not outweigh the potential violation of an officer right to counsel under the fifth and sixth amendments,we decline to assign error to the trial court constitutional ruling.alads simply has not met its burden on appeal to persuade us that the department policy revisions operate to effect a violation of a deputy constitutional right to counsel long beach does not support such a proposition.
b.the first amendment 
in a different constitutional vein,alads contends the department deputies have a recognized right of association under the first amendment of the united states constitution,that this first amendment right guarantees the deputies the right to huddle with counsel,and that the department policy revision violates that right the three cases cited by alads do not persuade us to overturn the trial court order denying a preliminary injunction because we disagree that they support the proposition that two or more individuals have a right to huddle with counsel.
denius dunlap cir denius involved a lone plaintiff.the issue in denius was whether an employer could require the plaintiff,as a condition of employment,to waive his privilege,and to divulge communications that plaintiff may have had with lawyers whom he had retained in the past or would retain in the future.the seventh circuit court of appeals said no.denius at.
mothershed justices of supreme court cir also involved a lone plaintiff.the state bar of arizona censured the plaintiff for engaging in the unlawful practice of law because,although the plaintiff was admitted to the bar in oklahoma,he was not admitted to the bar in arizona.the issue in mothershed was whether arizona regulation of its legal,the requirement that a person be admitted to the bar in the state in order to practice law in the interfered with the public right under the first amendment to retain a lawyer of their choosing,to wit,the plaintiff.the ninth circuit court of appeals said no.mothershed,at.
swidler berlin united states,d involved the issue of privilege.nine days before he committed suicide,deputy white house counsel vincent foster met with an attorney to discuss possible criminal proceedings arising from an investigation conducted by the office of the independent counsel.after foster death,the office of the independent counsel subpoenaed foster lawyer to compel him to turnover the notes from his meeting with foster.the supreme court ruled the notes were protected from disclosure by the privilege.swidler berlin,at.at.
alads current case has nothing to do with waiving privilege.denius,supra.the department is not requiring any of its deputies to divulge confidential communications with their lawyers.alads current case has nothing to do with the regulation of the legal profession.mothershed,supra.alads current case has nothing to do with compelled disclosure by subpoena of confidential communications between an attorney and his or her client.swidler berlin united states,supra,d.
although alads legal authorities abstractly support the proposition that an individual first amendment right of association includes a right to hire and consult with an attorney,none of alads legal authorities are helpful in evaluating whether or not the department policy revision unconstitutionally infringes upon that right in the factual context of the current case.
alads is not likely to prevail under the act 
the trial court ruled that alads is unlikely to prevail on its claim that the department unilateral decision to implement its policy revision violated the mmba.et alads contends the trial court decision rested on its erroneous legal conclusion that sections and,as interpreted by the supreme court in claremont police officers city of claremont cal th,d,claremont,did not require the department to meet and confer with alads before the department implemented its policy revision.alads arguments fail to persuade us that the trial court interpretation of sections and is so infected with error that it mandates reversal of the court decision to deny a preliminary injunction.
the purpose of the mmba is to promote full communication between public employers and their employees by providing a reasonable method of resolving disputes regarding wages,hours and other terms and conditions of employment between public employers and public employee organizations.to that end,the mmba establishes a comprehensive,statutory scheme for resolving disputes in the arena of the public workplace.
generally speaking,the mmba implements its purposes through two statutes which attempt to reconcile the interest in resolving disputes between management and workers regarding wages,hours and other terms and conditions of employment,and the interest in allowing management to make necessary decisions for the efficient operation of government,without having to meet and confer about every decision.section provides the scope of representation shall include all matters relating to employment conditions and relations,including,but not limited to,wages,hours,and other terms and conditions of employment,except,however,that the scope of representation shall include consideration of the merits,necessity,or organization of any service or activity provided by law or executive order.section requires a public employer to meet and confer with a recognized employee organization when disputes arise over matters that fall within the scope of representation,when disputes arise over wages,hours,and other terms and conditions of public employment.
a.the claremont test 
in claremont,the police department implemented a tracking program to determine whether police officers were engaging in racial profiling.claremont,supra,cal th at,d.the police officers association filed a petition for writ of mandate to compel the department not to implement the racial profiling tracking program until the department had satisfied the requirements prescribed by the mmba.the basic thrust of the association petition rested on the allegation that the racial profiling tracking program constituted a matter within the scope of representation,and that,as such,the department was required to meet and confer in accord with the provisions of the mmba before implementing the program.the trial court denied the association petition,the court of appeal reversed the trial court,and the supreme court reversed the court of appeal,and held that the police department racial profiling tracking program did not fall within the scope of representation.
the supreme court clarified a test to be applied when determining whether a matter falls within the scope of representation,and,thus must comply with the mmba requirements.first,we ask whether the management action has a significant and adverse effect on the wages,hours,or working conditions of the employees.if not,there is no duty to meet and confer second,we ask whether the significant and adverse effect arises from the implementation of a fundamental managerial or policy decision.if not,then the requirement applies third,if both factors are an action taken to implement a fundamental managerial or policy decision has a significant and
