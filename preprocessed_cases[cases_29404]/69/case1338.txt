introduction 
the owners of property near the former rocky flats nuclear weapons plant rocky flats filed a class action against the facility operators under the act paa,alleging trespass and nuisance claims arising from the release of plutonium particles onto their properties.the district court conducted a lengthy trial,resulting in a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff class.after a series of motions,the district court entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs,awarding a total of just over million,inclusive of compensatory damages,punitive damages,and prejudgment interest.defendants,dow chemical company dow and rockwell international corporation rockwell,timely appealed the judgment,and the class members filed a timely.
exercising appellate jurisdiction pursuant to,this court reverses and remands the case to the district court.we direct the district court to vacate the judgment and conduct further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
ii.background 
rocky flats,located near denver,colorado,was established by the united states government in the to produce nuclear weapon components.the government contracted with dow to operate the facility from to,and then with rockwell from to.operations at rocky flats ceased in june after the federal bureau of investigation and the environmental protection agency searched the facility.rockwell was subsequently charged with,and ultimately pleaded guilty to,certain environmental crimes at the site.the facility has since undergone remediation efforts and is now designated as a wildlife refuge.
property owners,whose properties lie within a thirty square mile area east of rocky flats,filed this class action on january,alleging a public liability action under the paa involving trespass and nuisance claims against dow and rockwell.a public liability action is an action asserting legal liability arising from a nuclear incident plaintiffs most recent amended complaint alleged the release of plutonium at rocky flats resulted in the contamination of the class members properties.plaintiffs sought compensatory damages,measured by the diminution of property values,as well as punitive damages.
in october,the district court certified a class consisting of a ll persons and entities owning an interest including mortgagee and other security interests in real property situated within the property class area,exclusive of governmental entities,defendants,and defendants affiliates,parents,and subsidiaries as of june.in may,the district court split the certified class into two subclasses 
the first shall consist of all class members who owned property within the class area on the later of i january,the date this action was filed or ii the date on which the jury,per restatement second of torts,finds it appeared the trespass nuisance asserted by plaintiffs would continue indefinitely the second consists of all other class members.
the district court generally referred to the first subclass as the prospective damages subclass and the second as the damages subclass.
after over fifteen years of litigation,the district court conducted a jury trial between october and january.in accordance with the district court construction of colorado law the jury instructions did not require plaintiffs to establish either an actual injury to their properties or a loss of use of their properties.with respect to the nuisance claims,the district court instructed the jury that plaintiffs could establish defendants conduct interfered with the use and enjoyment of the class properties by proving defendants conduct exposed plaintiffs to some increased risk of health problems or caused conditions that pose a demonstrable risk of future harm to the class area.as to plaintiffs trespass claims,the district court instructed the jury,plaintiffs are not required to show that plutonium is present on the class properties at any particular level or concentration,that they suffered any bodily harm because of the plutonium or that the presence of plutonium on the class properties damaged these properties in some other way.
plaintiffs evidence regarding the effects of plutonium on their properties consisted of expert testimony indicating any plutonium exposure,no matter how small,increases the risk of cancer.plaintiffs experts did not testify,however,regarding the level of risk of developing cancer from exposure to plutonium released at rocky flats.rather,they suggested any increased risk was small and unquantifiable.
the jury deliberated for three weeks and ultimately returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff class on each of the trespass and nuisance claims.the jury awarded in compensatory damages on the trespass claims and awarded the same amount on the nuisance claims,based on the diminution of the value of the properties.the jury also awarded punitive damages totaling against dow and against rockwell.
after a long series of motions,the district court entered a final judgment against defendants on june,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.including prejudgment interest,the court ordered compensatory damages against dow in the amount of and against rockwell in the amount of.the judgment further stated,however,the total compensatory damages recovered by the plaintiff class shall not exceed.punitive damages were ordered in the same amounts the jury awarded.thus,the judgment awarded a total of just over million to the plaintiff class,including prejudgment interest.the district court judgment,however,did not allocate damages to individual class members rather,the district court attached a plan of allocation to the judgment,which provides for the appointment of a claims administrator to make recommendations as to how the lump sum identified in the judgment should be distributed.the plan of allocation also provides a framework for calculating each class member share and distributing any unclaimed funds.dow and rockwell timely appealed the district court judgment and the class members filed a timely.
iii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
before addressing the merits of an appeal,this court first obligation is to assure itself of jurisdiction to do so.software,reynolds reynolds,cir.this appeal involves two jurisdictional issues whether the district court properly exercised subject matter jurisdiction over this action and whether the district court entered an appealable final judgment.
subject matter jurisdiction 
this court sua sponte raised the issue of whether the district court properly exercised subject matter jurisdiction over this action the court concern arose from the language of n,which provides with respect to any public liability action arising out of or resulting from a nuclear incident,the united states district court in the district where the nuclear incident takes place shall have original jurisdiction without regard to the citizenship of any party or the amount in controversy.at first glance,the statute appears to require proof of a nuclear incident to permit federal subject matter jurisdiction over a paa action.even assuming it imposes a jurisdictional requirement,however,closer inspection indicates n is not the sole source of federal jurisdiction over a paa action.
although the complete history of the paa need not be repeated,a brief overview of its evolution,which this court described more fully in farley,cir,is helpful.see also in re tmi,cir,amended by cir commonwealth edison,cir.in,congress enacted the atomic energy act aea to facilitate a transition from a federal government monopoly over the production and use of atomic materials to a regime in which private industry also would have a role in their production and use,at.to further encourage private development in the nuclear energy field,congress amended the aea in by enacting the paa,which creat ed specific protections from tort liability for the nuclear industry.id.at that time,however,congress opted not to create a federal cause of action for nuclear torts,but instead permitted tort recovery under traditional state causes of action.id.accordingly,unless the diversity statute applied or the action resulted from an extraordinary nuclear occurrence,tort claims typically could not proceed in federal court.see in re tmi litig.cases consol.ii,cir.
the paa was amended several times in subsequent years,most notably in when congress created a federal cause of action for nuclear torts,thereby expanding federal jurisdiction over such claims,at.n now provides 
with respect to any public liability action arising out of or resulting from a nuclear incident,the united states district court in the district where the nuclear incident takes place shall have original jurisdiction without regard to the citizenship of any party or the amount in controversy.upon motion of the defendant or of the nuclear regulatory commission or the secretary of energy,as appropriate,any such action pending in any state court including any such action pending on august,or united states district court shall be removed or transferred to the united states district court having venue under this subsection.
accordingly,the amendments made it clear that any action asserting public liability can be originally filed in or removed to the appropriate federal district court.in doing so,congress also designated the particular venue in which any such action must be tried if it is to proceed in federal court,the united states district court in the district where the nuclear incident takes place.these amendments,however,did not create exclusive federal jurisdiction over paa actions,at.indeed,the express language of n makes it clear state courts are free to resolve paa actions unless a defendant,the nuclear regulatory commission,or the secretary of energy opts to remove the action to federal court.
as indicated,this court was concerned that n could be read as limiting federal jurisdiction to public liability actions arising out of or resulting from a nuclear incident,thus requiring proof of a nuclear incident as a jurisdictional element.we see no indication,however,that congress intended n to be the sole source of federal jurisdiction over paa actions.rather,congress expanded federal jurisdiction to ensure that actions involving a nuclear incident can proceed from their inception in federal court,even if the parties can not otherwise establish the requirements of.congress did not,however,eliminate a party right to proceed in federal court when other jurisdictional bases exist.accordingly,a plaintiff need not establish a nuclear incident under n in order to proceed in federal court with a paa action when another basis for federal jurisdiction is present 
indeed,jurisdictional grounds will always exist for a plaintiff properly pleaded paa claim.as we previously explained,congress amendments created a new federal cause of action,known as a public liability action.hh provides 
the term public liability action,as used in section of this title,means any suit asserting public liability.a public liability action shall be deemed to be an action arising under section of this title,and the substantive rules for decision in such action shall be derived from the law of the state in which the nuclear incident involved occurs,unless such law is inconsistent with the provisions of such section.
as a result,any suit asserting public liability under is a civil action arising under the laws of the united states over which a federal court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to.
accordingly,we need not decide whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction under n,because the district court clearly had subject matter jurisdiction under 
finality of the judgment 
having concluded the district court exercise of subject matter jurisdiction was proper,we now turn to defendants motion to dismiss this appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.specifically,defendants argue the district court judgment is not sufficiently final to warrant certification under federal rule of civil procedure b.rule b allows the district court to direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more,but fewer than all,claims or parties so long as the district court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay.the general rule,however,is that an order which determines liability but leaves damages to be calculated is not final.harbert healthcare servs.group,cir.nonetheless,in strey hunt international resources,this court explained that when damages are not allocated to specific class members,the resolution of class liability claims may warrant rule b certification if the district court establishes both the formula that will determine the division of damages among class members and the principles that will guide the disposition of any unclaimed funds,cir.
here,the district court purported to enter judgment under rule b,stating the total damages against each defendant and determining there is no just reason for delaying entry of judgment.the judgment did not,however,distribute the aggregate class award among individual members.instead the district court attached a plan of allocation to the judgment,which provides a thorough framework for determining each individual class member damages.having thoroughly reviewed the plan of allocation,we conclude it complies with the requirements of strey.
the plan of allocation provides for the appointment of a claims administrator,who is directed to determine the proper allocation of damages based on specific data.the claims administrator must determine ownership of each class property as of the relevant dates as well as each property assessed value based on county property and tax records.this value is to be expressed as a fraction of the total value of all properties within the same category,specifically residential,commercial,or vacant property.the class administrator is directed to use this fraction to determine the total damages to be allocated to each property and make recommendations to the district court based on this calculation.the plan of allocation also provides for the distribution of any unclaimed funds.
the plan of allocation simply requires the application of mathematical principles to a formula involving identifiable property records and the jury verdict.in doing so,the plan of allocation directs the method of allocating damages among the individual class members,while also explaining how unclaimed funds shall be distributed.contrary to defendants argument,the plan of allocation does not require resolution of complex issues or calculations.while it is true that certain class members may wish to challenge the ultimate allocation of damages to them,the guidelines provided by the plan of allocation are straightforward and mechanical.moreover,any such challenges would not affect the total damages owed by defendants,which are clearly identified in the judgment.consequently,this court concludes the plan of allocation basic formula for determining individual damages sufficiently complies with strey and the rule b judgment entered by the district court is final.defendants motion to dismiss for lack of appellate jurisdiction is therefore denied.
threshold elements of a paa claim 
turning to the merits of the appeal,defendants argue the district court erred by refusing to instruct the jury that in order for plaintiffs to prevail on their paa claims,they must establish a nuclear incident occurred by showing loss of or damage to property,or loss of use of property.as an initial matter,we note that an issue was raised at oral argument as to whether or not defendants forfeited this argument.it is arguable defendants failed to preserve the issue of whether a nuclear incident must be established as a threshold element of a plaintiff paa claim.nonetheless,plaintiffs themselves failed to adequately present any such forfeiture argument in their appellate brief.at oral argument,plaintiffs admitted they did not expressly raise a forfeiture argument,but instead asserted that their brief sufficiently presented the argument by generic references to defendants novel argument and defendants failure to identify with clarity the specific rulings of which they seek review,or the locations in the record where their points were raised.we disagree.plaintiffs brief only makes reference to defendants lack of citations to rulings below in explaining the difficulty they had in responding to certain arguments.the brief does not raise a forfeiture challenge.accordingly,plaintiffs have themselves forfeited any forfeiture argument they may have on this issue,and this court will consider the merits of defendants argument.see united states heckenliable,cir explaining the government waived the waiver by failing to argue defendant forfeited his challenge on appeal see also soo line louis sw.ry,cir holding plaintiff waived any waiver defense it might have had by failing to argue defendant forfeited its appellate argument due to a judicial admission.
this court review s de novo whether,as a whole,the district court jury instructions correctly stated the governing law and provided the jury with an ample understanding of the issues and applicable standards.martinez caterpillar,cir quotation omitted.as we previously mentioned,the amendments to the paa created a federal cause of action known as a public liability action.a public liability action means any suit asserting public liability.hh.in turn,public liability is defined as any legal liability arising out of or resulting from a nuclear incident.w.
in keeping with these definitions,defendants argue plaintiffs must establish that any liability does in fact arise out of or result from a nuclear incident.a nuclear incident is defined as any occurrence causing bodily injury,sickness,disease,or death,or loss of or damage to property,or loss of use of property,arising out of or resulting from the radioactive,toxic,explosive,or other hazardous properties of source,special nuclear,or byproduct material.q.consequently,defendants argue plaintiffs must prove as a threshold element of their paa claims that they suffered one of the injuries enumerated in q.
this court analyzed a similar question in june union carbide,cir.there,defendants uranium mining and milling operations exposed nearby residents to radiation to such an extent that the community had to be evacuated and all structures were razed as part of the remediation effort.id.at.plaintiffs claimed the mining and milling operations increased their risk of developing illnesses and pursued medical monitoring claims to help detect the onset of disease.id.at.this court affirmed the dismissal of the medical monitoring claims because they did not implicate bodily injury,which was the only potentially applicable injury under q.id.at.
though june did not expressly determine the circumstances in which a plaintiff must establish injury we now confirm that the occurrence of a nuclear incident,and thus a sufficient injury under q,constitutes a threshold element of any paa claim.consequently,we reject plaintiffs suggestion that they need only assert liability arising out of a nuclear incident.the presence of a nuclear incident is the hallmark of a public liability action.were a plaintiff only required to plead the presence of a nuclear incident,but never establish one,a public liability action would be completely indistinguishable from whichever state tort claim a particular paa action incorporates.in creating a federal cause of action under the paa,however,congress made clear its intention to limit recovery to the discrete group of injuries enumerated in q while simultaneously utilizing state law to frame the substantive rules for decision.hh.plaintiffs provide no reason why we should render the statute nuclear incident requirement superfluous outside of the pleading stage.see w.accordingly,we conclude a plaintiff must establish an injury sufficient to constitute a nuclear incident as a threshold,substantive element of any paa claim.
the only injuries listed in q which can establish a nuclear incident in the case at hand are loss of or damage to property and loss of use of property.this court has never defined these terms either individually or in a manner that would differentiate one from the other.our recent decision in june,however,provides significant guidance.as we previously noted,the plaintiffs in june claimed the defendants uranium operations increased their risk of developing health problems and thus pursued medical monitoring claims.at.the district court determined medical monitoring claims do not involve a bodily injury and dismissed the action.id.at.this court affirmed and held dna damage and cell death do not constitute a bodily injury in the absence of the manifestation of an actual disease or injury,despite the increased risk of developing disease in the future.id.at.in short,june makes clear that only an existing physical injury constitutes bodily injury under the paa the mere subclinical effects of radiation exposure are insufficient.id.at.
our characterization of damage to property is informed by the analysis in june,as the logic applies equally to the issue before us in this appeal.just as an existing physical injury to one body is necessary to establish bodily injury,so too is an existing physical injury to property necessary to establish damage to property.without a demonstrable manifestation of injury,the presence of plutonium can,at best,only establish a risk of future damage to property.as this court indicated in june,however,mere risk of future damage is insufficient.id.at.rather,the physical damage must actually be manifest at the time the paa claim is asserted.this requirement does not heighten a plaintiff burden of proof,but simply provides that a plaintiff wishing to sue under the paa for a property injury involving damage to property must first establish actual damage to the property in question.
here,plaintiffs argue the mere presence of radioactive plutonium particles on their property establishes the requisite damage.in their supplemental brief,plaintiffs point out a nuclear incident is defined as any enumerated injury arising out of or resulting from the radioactive,toxic,explosive,or other hazardous properties of special nuclear material.q.without question,special nuclear material includes plutonium.aa.according to plaintiffs,this compels the conclusion that plutonium contamination itself is enough to establish damage to property.this argument misses the point.the statute does not indicate that the mere presence of plutonium is per se injurious to property.if mere contamination without actual damage were enough,congress could have easily listed contamination as an injury falling within q definition of nuclear incident.instead,congress required a showing of damage to property.
in order to prove damage to property,plaintiffs must necessarily establish that plutonium particles released from rocky flats caused a detectable level of actual damage to the class properties jury instruction confirmed that plaintiffs must prove the presence of plutonium on class properties to prevail on their trespass claim.the language of instruction,however,underscored the limited nature of that proof plaintiffs are not required to show that plutonium is present on the class properties at any particular level or concentration,that they suffered any bodily harm because of the plutonium or that the presence of plutonium on the class properties damaged these properties in some other way.accordingly,plaintiffs were never required to,and did not,present evidence of actual physical damage to the property.
damage to property is not,however,the only property injury that a plaintiff can prove to establish the paa threshold element of a nuclear incident a plaintiff who establishes a loss of use of property may also recover under the paa.the express statutory language indicates that more than a mere interference with an owner use is necessary a particular use of the property must actually be lost.
plaintiffs did present evidence relevant to a loss of use.specifically,they tried their nuisance claims under the theory that the presence of plutonium particles on their properties places them at an increased risk of health problems.we agree that when the presence of radioactive materials creates a sufficiently high risk to health,a loss of use may in fact occur.for instance,a residential or business use may be lost due to an increased risk to health so high that no reasonable person would freely choose to live on or work at the property.similarly,agricultural use may be lost where the soil can no longer produce crops that are safe for consumption due to the presence of the radioactive substance.in short,where the evidence indicates the property has been affected by the radioactive material to such an extent that an otherwise appropriate use of the property is lost,a plaintiff has established the threshold injury element of his paa claim 
here,plaintiffs were never required to establish a loss of use of property.instead,jury instruction only required the jury to find that defendants interfered with class members use and enjoyment of their properties in one of two ways b y causing class members to be exposed to plutonium and placing them at some increased risk of health problems or b y causing objective conditions that pose a demonstrable risk of future harm to the class area.plaintiffs experts merely testified that any exposure to plutonium whatsoever increases the risk of health problems to some degree.without an accompanying estimate or calculation of the increased risk,however,this evidence is insufficient to establish a loss of use under q.plaintiffs must instead prove that the particular level of risk created by defendants conduct had the effect of actually depriving them of a specific use.
during supplemental briefing,this court directed plaintiffs to identify any evidence presented at trial that could establish a loss of use of property plaintiffs supplemental brief confirms they attempted to make out their paa claims solely by establishing an increased health risk.plaintiffs submissions,however,do not reveal evidence of an increased health risk that would be sufficient to permit a reasonable to find a loss of use.indeed,plaintiffs experts testified only that the actual dosage of radiation to which plaintiffs have been exposed creates a small and unquantifiable increased risk of health problems.nonetheless,we need not review the sufficiency of the evidence,as the jury was never properly instructed on the threshold elements of plaintiffs paa claims.on remand,plaintiffs will be tasked with producing additional evidence that could support a jury finding that a nuclear incident occurred,in the form of loss of or damage to property,or loss of use of property under q.
because the jury was not properly instructed on an essential element of plaintiffs paa claims,the verdict must be set aside and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
federal preemption 
defendants also challenge the district court ruling that federal nuclear safety standards do not preempt state tort standards of care under the paa essentially,defendants argue they are exempt from liability if their conduct complied with federal nuclear safety standards,even if they could be held liable under a more restrictive state tort standard of care.whether federal law preempts state tort law is a question of law which this court reviews de novo.dobbs anthem blue cross blue shield,cir.
plaintiffs argue the language of hh makes it clear state tort standards of care apply to a paa action.defendants argue,on the other hand,that because state tort standards of care conflict with the paa scheme,they are preempted by federal nuclear safety regulations.
hh provides 
a public liability action shall be deemed to be an action arising under section of this title,and the substantive rules for decision in such action shall be derived from the law of the state in which the nuclear incident involved occurs,unless such law is inconsistent with the provisions of such section.
we agree with the district court that hh does not expressly preempt state law.the clear meaning of this section is that state law is only expressly preempted when it is inconsistent with the provisions of.see june,at lujan regents of of,cir.the parties agree itself contains no federal safety standards that could provide the standard of care in a paa action.instead,primarily addresses the indemnification and limitation of liability components of the paa.accordingly,hh does not expressly preempt state tort law.
defendants remaining preemption arguments focus on conflict preemption state law is preempted due to its conflict with federal law where it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements,or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.english,citation and quotations omitted.defendants argue the federal government regulation of nuclear safety conflicts with the application of state tort law in a public liability action.while the supreme court has indicated only the federal government can directly regulate nuclear safety,neither this court nor the supreme court has analyzed whether state tort standards of care,which may have some indirect effect on nuclear safety,are preempted by federal law.see pac.gas state energy res.conservation dev.comm n.
because defendants advocate preemption,they bear the burden of showing that federal and state law conflict.see silkwood.the court is sympathetic to defendants generic argument that directing a nuclear facility to comply with federal safety regulations,while also permitting tort recovery under a generic state tort standard of care,may lead to confusion regarding the levels at which the facility must operate to avoid liability the existence of such a conflict could defeat one of the paa primary purposes,the encouragement of private nuclear development.the record,however,is not clear as to the particular federal regulations or statutes defendants believe actually conflict with any applicable state tort standards of care during the relevant periods.nor do defendants pinpoint any state tort standards of care in the trespass and nuisance context they believe have been displaced by federal nuclear safety regulations.
the district court orders shed no additional light on this issue.the district court never fully conducted this analysis because it believed the supreme court decision in silkwood established congress intent that state tort law broadly govern public liability actions.in silkwood,the supreme court concluded punitive damages could be awarded against the operator of a nuclear facility because under the statutory scheme,including the paa,congress intended to permit any tort remedies available under the applicable state law.id.at.applying that principle here,the district court determined the amendments did not alter this regime,but rather expressly maintained the applicability of state tort law in paa actions.see hh.
but the paa requirement that the substantive rules for decision in a public liability action shall be derived from the law of the state in which the nuclear incident involved occurs does not displace otherwise applicable federal law.hh.it merely provides that the paa itself does not displace state law,unless there is a conflict with.there are other possible sources of federal law that might preempt state law,and the paa does not expressly make these standards irrelevant to resolving a plaintiff paa action.if defendants are able to identify federal statutes,regulations,or other binding safety standards that controlled their conduct with respect to the class properties during the relevant time period,the district court must determine whether those particular standards are in conflict with any applicable state tort standard of care 
on remand,the district court shall permit defendants to identify the particular federal regulations or statutes they believe preempt state law.specifically,the district court shall consider whether the federal standards defendants identify carry the force of law or controlled defendants conduct with respect to the contamination that occurred here.defendants must also indicate the particular standards of care applicable to a state law trespass or nuisance claim they believe are in conflict with any such regulations.finally,the district court must determine whether any such federal standards actually conflict with the relevant state tort standards of care 
plaintiffs nuisance claims 
defendants next argue the district court instructions on plaintiffs nuisance claims were legally incorrect.specifically,defendants argue colorado law does not permit a theory of nuisance which lacks scientific foundation.defendants also argue that in order to prove they substantially and unreasonably interfered with plaintiffs use and enjoyment of their property,colorado law requires plaintiffs to show defendants emissions exceeded any relevant federal or state safety standards.the court reviews these questions of law de novo.martinez,at.
irrational fear as a substantial and unreasonable interference 
under colorado law,a plaintiff asserting a nuisance claim must establish an interference with the use and enjoyment of his property that is both substantial and unreasonable.public serv.of van wyk.the district court instructed the jury that plaintiffs could meet their burden of establishing an interference with the use and enjoyment of their properties if they proved plutonium contamination from the activities at rocky flats exposed them to either some increased risk of health problems or a demonstrable risk of future harm.we agree with the district court that a jury may find the presence of radioactive contamination creates an actual risk to health and thereby interferes with a plaintiff use or enjoyment of his land if the contamination disturbs the plaintiff comfort and convenience,including his peace of mind,with respect to his continued use of the land.see cook rockwell int l,d.but that is not the end of the inquiry.any interference with a plaintiff use and enjoyment of his property must be both substantial and unreasonable.under colorado law,an interference is deemed substantial if it would have been offensive or caused inconvenience or annoyance to a reasonable person in the community.saint john church in wilderness scott.in determining whether an interference is unreasonable,the jury must weigh the gravity of the harm and the utility of the conduct causing that harm.van wyk,at.
the jury was properly instructed on the elements of a nuisance claim as well as the definitions of substantial and unreasonable.while the resolution of these issues typically involves questions of fact,a scientifically unfounded risk can not rise to the level of an unreasonable and substantial interference.to the extent plaintiffs rely on anxiety from an increased risk to their health as an interference with the use and enjoyment of their properties,that anxiety must arise from scientifically verifiable evidence regarding the risk and can not be wholly irrational.the district court concluded otherwise in light of its review of restatement second of torts,cmt.f,which states 
in determining whether the harm would be suffered by a normal member of the community,fears and other mental reactions common to the community are to be taken into account,even though they may be without scientific foundation or other support in fact.thus the presence of a leprosy sanatarium in the vicinity of a group of private residences may seriously interfere with the use and enjoyment of land because of the normal fear that it creates of possible contagion,even though leprosy is in fact so rarely transmitted through normal contacts that there is no practical possibility of communication of the disease.
this court previously cast doubt on whether colorado would follow this rule,given the potential for anachronistic results.boughton cotter,cir.instead,we suggested in boughton that colorado courts would require some evidence to substantiate the fears.id.otherwise,a plaintiff could state a viable nuisance claim any time neighboring property owners contracted a misunderstood disease,whether contagious or not.such a result would be absurd.
plaintiffs are unable to point to any colorado case in the fifteen years since boughton that has endorsed the restatement position.more importantly,the restatement conflicts with colorado unreasonableness requirement,which expressly requires the trier of fact to weigh the gravity of the harm and the utility of the conduct causing that harm.van wyk,at.no reasonable jury could find that irrational anxiety about a risk that can not be scientifically verified tips this balance so as to render the interference unreasonable.accordingly,we now confirm what we previously suggested in boughton and predict that the colorado supreme court would not permit recovery premised on a finding that an interference,in the form of anxiety or fear of health risks,is substantial and unreasonable unless that anxiety is supported by some scientific evidence.the district court erred in concluding otherwise.
the role of federal and state safety standards 
defendants also argue the district court erred in trying the nuisance claims without reference to applicable federal and state safety regulations.specifically,defendants argue the jury should have been instructed that if plutonium contamination in the property class area falls within the applicable federal or state safety levels,it can not be deemed unreasonable.the defendants point to the colorado supreme court decision in van wyk,where the plaintiffs claimed the defendant upgrades to electrical lines created an intentional nuisance due to increased noise,electromagnetic fields,and radiation particles invading the property.id.at.the defendant argued the relevant agency approval of the voltage involved in the upgrades rendered any interference per se reasonable.id.at.the colorado supreme court indicated that to the extent an agency regulations actually quantify the standard of reasonableness for the particular conduct involved,this determination controls in the nuisance context.id.under the facts of van wyk,however,the court concluded the agency determination of reasonableness lacked any specificity with respect to electromagnetic fields and noise such that the complaint stated a viable nuisance claim because it alleged the defendant conduct was unreasonable to the extent it exceeded the noise and electromagnetic fields the agency anticipated might occur.id.at.under the circumstances,the court concluded the plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded a nuisance claim.
in light of van wyk,defendants proposed jury instructions stating defendants release of plutonium could only be found unreasonable if the release did not comply with controlling state and federal standards.the district court rejected this instruction,concluding van wyk dealt with determinations that differ in nature from the federal and state regulations identified in defendants proposed jury instructions.the district court believed the safety regulations offered by defendants were more akin to zoning regulations and ordinances and,under colorado case law,compliance with zoning statutes does not insulate a defendant from nuisance liability.hobbs smith.
this court need not decide whether van wyk applies here because we agree with the district court alternative ruling that none of the regulations referenced in defendants proposed jury instructions are on point.for instance,defendants rely on a regulation issued by the colorado state board of health which states,contamination of the soil in excess of disintegrations per minute bq of plutonium per gram of dry soil presents a sufficient hazard to the public health to require the utilization of special techniques of construction upon property so contaminated.regs.this regulation says nothing about the minimum level at which such contamination becomes unreasonable.it merely indicates special care must be taken for construction on property contaminated at the particular level indicated.similarly,defendants point to documents issued by the atomic energy commission and the department of energy.it is not clear whether any of these documents have the force of law or apply to safety levels outside a nuclear facility,and the issue is inadequately briefed for resolution here 
accordingly,defendants have failed to establish that any of the state or federal standards referenced in their proposed jury instructions overcome the general rule that the jury must determine whether a given interference is unreasonable by weighing the harm against the utility of the interference.
plaintiffs trespass claims 
defendants next argue the district court erred in failing to require plaintiffs to prove physical damage to the property as part of their trespass claims.according to defendants,this is because plaintiffs can only pursue intangible trespass claims,given the nature of the contamination at issue.the court reviews this question of law de novo.martinez,at.
we note defendants position that plaintiffs must establish physical damage to the property as an element of their trespass claims overlaps with the paa damage to property standard.a plaintiff,however,is not limited to proving damage to property in order to proceed with a paa claim.rather,a plaintiff may establish any of the injuries listed in q to meet the paa threshold requirement of proving a nuclear incident occurred.for instance,a plaintiff who establishes a loss of use of their property has met his threshold requirement under q,but must still prove physical damage to the property in order to prevail on a colorado intangible trespass claim.accordingly,we proceed to the issue of whether plaintiffs trespass claims must be tried under an intangible trespass theory.
the parties agree that to prevail under a traditional colorado trespass claim,a plaintiff must establish only a physical intrusion upon the property of another without the proper permission from the person legally entitled to possession.van wyk,p d at.a plaintiff need not establish any injury to his legally protected interest in the land or damage to the land itself.id.in van wyk,the colorado supreme court recognized the viability of trespass claims involving invasions that are intangible,such as noise,radiation,or electromagnetic fields.id.at.unlike a traditional trespass claim,however,the court made it clear an intangible trespass claim requires an aggrieved party to prove physical damage to the property was caused by such intangible intrusion.id.defendants argue the instant case can only proceed as an intangible trespass claim,requiring the plaintiff class to establish the existence of physical damage to their properties in order to prevail.consequently,we must determine whether the colorado supreme court would require a trespass claim involving the invasion of plutonium particles onto real property to proceed as a traditional or intangible trespass claim.
in van wyk,the colorado supreme court defined intangible invasion in the context of the plaintiffs inverse condemnation claim,and the court held that invasions in the forms of noise,electromagnetic fields,and radiation waves are intangible invasions.id.at.the court explained 
the meaning of the term intangible is something that is impalpable,or incapable of being felt by touch we conclude that noise,despite being perceptible through hearing,is impalpable,and thus,intangible.
similarly,we also conclude that electromagnetic fields and radiation waves emitted by powerlines are intangible.neither electromagnetic fields nor radiation waves produced by electric lines can be perceived by any of the senses.instead,they are both similar to television and radio waves,which surround us at all times but which are completely imperceptible while such waves and fields might have some sort of physical effect upon the body,electromagnetic fields and radiation waves of the type at issue here are ubiquitous and our senses are incapable of perceiving them.as such,we agree that electromagnetic fields and radiation waves emitted by powerlines are intangible intrusions upon land.

in recognizing that other jurisdictions permitted trespass claims involving intangible intrusions to proceed,the colorado supreme court did more than examine cases involving intrusions such as noise,electromagnetic fields,and radiation waves.the court also examined cases involving the deposit of particulate not visible to the human eye,as well as the deposit of radioactive materials.id.at.at no time did the court in van wyk draw a distinction excepting these impalpable intrusions from its general analysis.
it is clear from the colorado supreme court discussion of this issue in van wyk that,under colorado law,whether a trespass claim falls under the traditional rubric or must be pursued as an intangible trespass is determined by whether the intrusion is palpable.plaintiffs do not dispute that the plutonium particles present on their properties are impalpable and imperceptible by the senses.although we recognize the particles in question have mass and are physically present on the land,our interpretation of colorado law compels us to conclude that because the particles are impalpable,the trespass alleged here must be tried as an intangible trespass.consequently,plaintiffs are required to prove actual physical damage to their properties in order to prevail on their trespass claims.
plaintiffs argue the discussion of intangible invasions in van wyk should not control because a more recent case,hoary united states in re hoary,recognized that contamination physically present within property supports a traditional trespass claim.in hoary,the colorado supreme court decision addressed only the two narrow questions certified by the tenth circuit pertaining to whether the contamination of the property constituted a continuing trespass or nuisance.we agree with defendants that,in hoary,the colorado supreme court treated the presence of contaminants as if it were not in dispute.indeed,the decision explains,for purposes of answering the certified questions before us,no dispute exists about whether the united states released tce into the ground and by doing so,invaded hoary property.id.at.because no dispute existed,the hoary court only examined whether the facts in question could support a claim that the trespass or nuisance was continuing.the case does not stand for the proposition that impalpable contamination of property constitutes a tangible invasion that can be tried as a traditional trespass claim.in fact,it is not clear from hoary whether the contamination in question was impalpable.the colorado supreme court never discussed the issue because it was not presented.
jury instruction directed that to prove their trespass claims,
plaintiffs are not required to show that plutonium is present on the class properties at any particular level or concentration,that they suffered any bodily harm because of the plutonium or that the presence of plutonium on the class properties damaged these properties in some other way.
this was erroneous as a matter of colorado law and on remand,plaintiffs shall be required to prove the plutonium contamination caused physical damage to the property in order to prevail on their trespass claims.van wyk,at.
class certification 
as the district court class certification analysis failed to consider whether plaintiffs could establish various elements of their paa claims,supplied both by federal and state law,this court must reverse the district court class certification ruling.upon remand,the district court shall revisit the class certification question to determine whether plaintiffs can establish the elements of their claims,including the paa threshold requirements,on a basis.because we now reverse the district court class certification ruling,we need not reach the question of whether the district court subdivision of the class for damages purposes was proper.
punitive damages 
defendants also argue the district court erred in instructing the jury that it could award punitive damages in the instant action.defendants argue the paa precludes punitive damages against them because their agreement with the federal government requires the government to indemnify them for any such damages.the court reviews this question of law de novo.martinez,at.
in,the paa was amended to preclude awards of punitive damages when a defendant in a paa action will be indemnified by the federal government for damages it states 
no court may award punitive damages in any action with respect to a nuclear incident against a person on behalf of whom the united states is obligated to make payments under an agreement of indemnification covering such incident 
s.the district court concluded this provision applied only as to nuclear incidents occurring on or after august,the date the amendments took effect,and permitted plaintiffs to pursue punitive damages with respect to nuclear incidents on or after that date.
this court agrees that s is only applicable to nuclear incidents occurring on or after august.defendants do not dispute that congress opted not to make s retroactive.consequently,the bar against punitive damages in this section does not apply to any conduct occurring before the amendments took effect.the supreme court decision in silkwood recognized the availability of punitive damages under the paa,prior to the amendments,without reference to an exception in the presence of an indemnity agreement.at.rather,the court recognized that in enacting and amending the paa,congress assumed that remedies,in whatever form they might take,were available to those injured by nuclear incidents.id.at.the silkwood decision made it clear that prior to the enactment of the amendments,federal law included no prohibition whatsoever on the availability of punitive damages.
defendants argue,however,that s merely codified the law as it already existed prior to the amendments.but defendants cite to no binding legal authority suggesting punitive damages were always barred when an indemnification agreement was in place.nor do defendants point to any amendments case prohibiting punitive damages in such an instance.additionally,the defendants never explain why the federal government is not entitled to enter into a binding agreement to indemnify a party for punitive damages.
instead,defendants rely on two sentences from a senate report which states,the bill clarifies that an award of punitive damages is prohibited if the award would result in any obligation of the united states to make any payments for public liability.this reflects the longstanding policy that the federal government should not be liable for punitive damages,at,reprinted in.the senate report cited by the defendants,however,could just as easily be read to conflict with defendants position,because after describing the provisions relating to punitive damages,the report states,the bill does not otherwise affect current law regarding punitive damages.id.this suggests those portions of the amendments dealing with punitive damages did alter the law as it existed at that time,and the bar against punitive damages for amendments conduct is the only alteration to the scheme.absent any indication punitive damages against an indemnified party were prohibited prior to the amendments,we can not agree with defendants position 
defendants also argue that even if punitive damages are recoverable under the paa,the district court instruction was erroneous as a matter of law.specifically,defendants argue the district court erred by permitting the jury to award punitive damages based on conduct occurring prior to august,even if plaintiffs sustained no injury prior to that date.in issuing its ruling,the district court noted that the definition of nuclear incident refers to any occurrence within the united states causing damage to property arising out of or resulting from the radioactive,toxic,explosive or other hazardous properties of source,special nuclear,or byproduct material.q.focusing on occurrence,the district court reasoned,it is the date of such occurrences,not the date on which the relevant occurrences caused property damage,that determines application of the section bar on punitive damages awards.cook,d at.as a result,the court instructed the jury 
for plaintiffs to recover punitive damages,they must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the conduct of the defendant that committed the trespass nuisance was wilful and wanton.in deciding this question with respect to any conduct relating to plutonium or other radioactive materials,you can only consider the defendant conduct up to august,including conduct occurring before this date that resulted in harm on or after that date.
defendants argue this instruction was error,because it is undisputed the amendments bar punitive damages against indemnified parties with respect to any nuclear incident occurring after august.because any occurrence deemed a nuclear incident must cause some injury,defendants suggest that no nuclear incident can exist until the date of the injury.in other words,defendants believe the jury should not have been permitted to consider any conduct unless it actually caused a paa injury under q prior to august.according to defendants,by instructing the jury it could consider conduct occurring prior to august,which did not result in a paa injury until after august,the district court equated conduct with nuclear incident and allowed the jury to consider nuclear incidents for which punitive damages are expressly barred by the paa amendments.
defendants confuse the findings necessary to establish a compensable injury,however,with the findings necessary to support a punitive damages award.as explained earlier,a plaintiff can not proceed with a paa claim unless it first establishes a nuclear incident occurred.n.a plaintiff must establish that the occurrence in question actually caused a paa injury.q.all elements of the paa claim must be proved to recover compensatory damages for the injury.with respect to punitive damages,however,once a plaintiff establishes a nuclear incident,the jury focus must turn to the conduct of the defendant rather than the injury sustained by the plaintiff.the purpose of punitive damages is to punish the defendant willful and wanton conduct and deter others from engaging in similar conduct.lira shelter ins.the injury resulting from the conduct is compensated separately.
as the district court ruled,the statutory definition makes it clear the relevant date of any nuclear incident is the date of the occurrence,not the date of the injury.section q defines a nuclear incident as any occurrence causing bodily injury,sickness,disease,or death,or loss of or damage to property,or loss of use of property,arising out of or resulting from the radioactive,toxic,explosive,or other hazardous properties of source,special nuclear,or byproduct material.in determining whether a particular occurrence is a nuclear incident,the jury must simply determine whether that occurrence ultimately caused one of the specified injuries.if so,the occurrence constitutes a nuclear incident.had congress intended for the injury to control the timing of the nuclear incident,it could have defined nuclear incident as the infliction of an injury upon person or property arising from the use of nuclear substances.instead,congress focused the definition on an occurrence,the event which sets the causal chain in motion.therefore,the date of the occurrence controls when determining whether the nuclear incident took place prior to august.
for instance,if a defendant release of plutonium in caused an injury in,a proper explanation of that event in light of the statutory definition would be that the occurrence was a nuclear incident because it ultimately caused a paa injury.it would be nonsensical to say the injury constitutes the nuclear incident even though the conduct occurred years before.the definition directly ties the occurrence to the nuclear incident.
while the district court decision to focus on the date of the occurrence was correct,its instruction failed to instruct the jury how to identify the date of the occurrence.here,the occurrence constituting a nuclear incident in a paa action must arise from defendants release of plutonium onto plaintiffs properties.the jury instruction ultimately given,however,permits consideration of defendants conduct prior to august,regardless of whether an occurrence causing plaintiffs injury took place prior to that date.this is an important distinction,because certain conduct prior to august,might contribute to a nuclear incident,even though the release of plutonium might not have occurred until after august.for instance,if a defendant began improperly storing drums containing nuclear waste in and consistently failed to maintain them,but no waste leaked from the drums until after august,a jury could not find the occurrence took
