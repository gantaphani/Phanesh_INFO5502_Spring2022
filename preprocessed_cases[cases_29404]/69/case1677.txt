civil code section permits a payee seeking to recover on a dishonored check to collect a service charge,or treble the amount of the dishonored check if certain statutory requirements are met.section governs the award of prejudgment interest on damages.we granted a request by the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit cal.rules of court,rule to decide a question of california law whether a debt collector recovering on a dishonored check may recover both a service charge under section and prejudgment interest under section.
we conclude that the statutory damages prescribed in section are exclusive in the sense that a debt collector who recovers a service charge pursuant to section may not also recover prejudgment interest under section.
factual and procedural 
on july,brandy hunt wrote a check to pak n save,a supermarket operated by safeway,safeway.the check was returned unpaid due to insufficient funds.safeway referred the matter to imperial merchant services,doing business as check recovery systems crs for collection.

hunt filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of california the bankruptcy action.shortly thereafter,hunt filed a putative class action against crs in the united states district court for the northern district of california seeking damages under the fair debt collection practices act et the fdcpa action.hunt asserted that crs demand for a section service fee precluded crs from seeking interest on the amount of the unpaid check.hunt alleged that crs thus violated the fdcpa by demanding interest to which it was not entitled under california law 
on december,crs filed a claim in the bankruptcy action for,a sum intended to cover the amount of the unpaid check,a service fee and interest.on october,the bankruptcy court filed a judgment of nondischargeability the bankruptcy judgment in favor of crs in the amount of,consisting of for the amount of the check and the service fee and in costs,but nothing for interest payments.the bankruptcy court concluded that because crs was awarded a service fee under section,it was not entitled to interest under section.crs filed an appeal from the bankruptcy judgment in the district court.
meanwhile,in the fdcpa action,hunt and crs filed for summary judgment on the question of whether crs,having demanded payment of a service fee under section,was additionally entitled to interest under section.in a published opinion filed on march,the district court jenkins,held that california law precluded crs demand for interest and that its demand letters thus violated united states code sections a and.hunt i,supra,d at.accordingly,the district court granted hunt motion for summary judgment in part as to the causes of action based on these provisions of the fdcpa and denied crs summary judgment motion.the court also denied crs request to enter partial summary judgment fed.rules civ,rule b,or to certify the case for immediate appeal b.
while the summary judgment motions in the fdcpa action were pending,crs appeal from the judgment in the bankruptcy action was transferred to judge jenkins.on may,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy action judgment for the reasons stated in the opinion of this court issued in the fdcpa action.
crs appealed the district court judgment in the bankruptcy action,denying interest,to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit.on may,the ninth circuit requested that this court decide the purely legal issue of whether,under california law,a debt collector may recover both section damages and section prejudgment interest on a dishonored check.imperial merchant services,hunt cir hunt ii.on july,we granted that request.
ii.discussion 
crs claims that section and its legislative history do not prohibit the collection of both interest and the statutory service charge for a dishonored check.on the other hand,hunt contends that the rules of statutory construction and the legislative history of section preclude collection of both amounts.as explained below,we agree with hunt.
section sets forth the procedures for collecting on dishonored checks.subdivision a of that section provides notwithstanding any penal sanctions that may apply,any person who passes a check on insufficient funds shall be liable to the payee for the amount of the check and a service charge payable to the payee for an amount not to exceed dollars for the first check passed on insufficient funds and an amount not to exceed dollars for each subsequent check to that payee passed on insufficient funds.
if the payee sends the check writer a certified letter seeking the amount due on a dishonored check,the debtor has days from the date the written demand was mailed to pay the amount of the check,the statutory service charge,and the cost of mailing the written demand for payment,subd.a.failure to comply with subdivision a renders the check writer liable for treble the amount of the outstanding balance on the check the face value of the check minus any partial payments made within this window,which shall not be less than or more than.ibid.if a check writer is liable for treble damages,he is not required to pay the statutory service charge or the cost of mailing the written demand.ibid.
section is silent regarding the availability of prejudgment interest in addition to the fixed service charge.the federal court opinions that have addressed this issue have unanimously held that a debt collector is limited to the remedies explicitly prescribed in section,which do not include prejudgment interest.hunt i,supra,d at palmer stassinos d,stassinos i palmer stassinos d,stassinos ii irwin mascott d,irwin mascott cir.of these five opinions,however,only two,hunt i and stassinos i,explored in depth the issue presented here,whether a debt collector may recover both prejudgment interest under section and the service charge under section.it appears that no california court has spoken on this issue.
because this contention involves a question of statutory construction,our review is de novo.people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,d.under settled canons of statutory construction,in construing a statute we ascertain the legislature intent in order to effectuate the law purpose,fair employment housing com.cal d.we must look to the statute words and give them their usual and ordinary meaning.dafonte,cal th,d.the statute plain meaning controls the court interpretation unless its words are ambiguous.green state of california cal th,d,see also gattuso shoppers,cal th,d.if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,courts may consider other aids,such as the statute purpose,legislative history,and public policy.coalition of concerned communities,city of los angeles cal th,d.
because section says nothing about the availability of interest in light of the service charge and treble damage provisions,the plain meaning rule provides no assistance.see stassinos i,supra,d at.we therefore address,in turn,the statutory construction and legislative history of section.
statutory construction and legislative history of section 
statutory construction 
where more than one statutory construction is arguably possible,our policy has long been to favor the construction that leads to the more reasonable result.webster superior court cal d.this policy derives largely from the presumption that the legislature intends reasonable results consistent with the apparent purpose of the legislation.harris capital growth investors xiv cal d.thus,our task is to select the construction that comports most closely with the legislature apparent intent,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the statutes general purpose,and to avoid a construction that would lead to unreasonable,impractical,or arbitrary results.people jenkins cal th,d,people simon cal th,d,fields eu cal d.
like the other courts that have addressed this issue,we begin our statutory construction by focusing on subdivisions a,h,and k of section.as noted above,subdivision a and provides for fixed statutory damages and,alternatively,treble damages where the statutory requirements are met,n otwithstanding any penal sanctions that may apply,subd.a and.subdivision h states that t he requirements of this section in regard to remedies are mandatory upon a court,subd.h.subdivision k states,in relevant part,that n othing in this section is intended to condition,curtail,or otherwise prejudice the rights,claims,remedies,and defenses under division commencing with section of the commercial code of a drawer,payee,assignee,or holder in connection with the enforcement of this section,subd.k.
hunt argues that the legislature enumeration in section,subdivision k,of other remedies that coexist with subdivision a and impliedly excludes other remedies not specified therein.hunt bases her argument on the rule of statutory construction expressio unius est exclusio alterius,or to express or include one thing implies the exclusion of the other.black law dict.ed.under the maxim of statutory construction,expressio unius est exclusio alterius,if exemptions are specified in a statute,courts may not imply additional exemptions unless there is a clear legislative intent to the contrary.citation.rojas superior court cal th,d.hunt reading of the statute effectively limits a debt collector to three remedies those expressly provided for in section,california criminal law,and division of the california uniform commercial code,governing negotiable instruments.none of these remedies provides for the collection of prejudgment interest in this case.
on the other hand,crs contends that the legislature addition of subdivision k does not imply that the remedies prescribed in section are exclusive.instead,we should read section together with the rest of the civil code,which generally permits the recovery of interest on all debts.it is a rule of statutory construction that,if possible,the codes are to be read together and blended into each other as though there was but a single statute citations,and that the existence of a particular statute does not negate the effect of a general statute lara board of supervisors d.crs argues that w here multiple codes are to be construed,they must be regarded as blending into each other and forming a single statute.citation.accordingly,they must be read together and so construed as to give effect,when possible,to all the provisions thereof.tripp swoap cal d,disapproved on another ground in frink prod cal d.
crs urges us to read section with sections and,subdivision a,as though they were but a single statute.lara board of supervisors,supra,d at.section provides that t he detriment caused by the breach of an obligation to pay money only,is deemed to be the amount due by the terms of the obligation,with interest thereon.section,subdivision a,provides in relevant part that e very person who is entitled to recover damages certain,or capable of being made certain by calculation,and the right to recover which is vested in him upon a particular day,is entitled also to recover interest thereon from that day reading section together with sections and,subdivision a,crs claims that it is legally entitled to interest payments in addition to section fixed statutory fee as a matter of california law.
however,crs argument that section should be read with the rest of the civil code would render subdivision k express exemption superfluous.if the legislature had intended that all other civil remedies remained available to a payee seeking section damages,there would have been no need to include a provision to single out remedies pursuant to division of the california uniform commercial code.statutes must be interpreted,if possible,to give each word some operative effect.walters metropolitan educational enterprises,d.we do not presume that the legislature performs idle acts,nor do we construe statutory provisions so as to render them superfluous.shoemaker myers cal d.thus,the fact that the legislature expressly designated specific damage remedies while omitting others,such as prejudgment interest,reflects that it intended the prescribed remedies to be exclusive.
legislative history 
an analysis of section evolution,general pattern of amendment,and the reasoning behind those amendments further reveals the legislature intent to limit recovery of damages to those explicitly prescribed in the statute.
a.the enactment 
the legislature enacted section in.stats,ch.as enacted,section provided that if a check were dishonored,the check writer would be liable for the amount of the check plus damages of treble the amount so owing no less than but no more than if the check writer failed to pay the check amount within days of a written demand letter from the payee sent via certified mail.the purpose of the bill was to provide a cost effective means for small businesses to collect unpaid accounts,and to deter bad check writing.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may.this legislative reference to the bill as a cost effective measure was a recognition of the barriers to debt collection on bad checks.bad checks written for small amounts do not often justify either expensive criminal enforcement or the time the small business owner would need to devote to appear in court in order to collect on the debt.ibid.by authorizing treble damages in section,the legislature effectively incentivized small businesses to collect on dishonored checks written for small amounts.
b.the amendments 
in,the legislature amended section in two respects that are relevant here it increased the treble damages cap from to in subdivision a and added subdivision h,which makes section remedies binding on the courts.stats,ch.
subdivision h of section codified the decision in mughrabi suzuki d.rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended june.in mughrabi,the court of appeal reversed a trial court decision to withhold treble damages despite the merchant compliance with section.the court observed that t he manifest purpose of section is to discourage the issuance of bank checks,drafts or orders when the maker funds are insufficient.by increasing the stakes for a defendant,it serves as a statutory incentive to refrain from the writing of bad checks.mughrabi,supra,d at.the court held that,because the unambiguous language of section mandated the imposition of treble damages whenever the statutory requirements were met,the trial court had no discretion in the matter and was required to grant the merchant request for treble damages.mughrabi,at.
c.the amendments 
in,the legislature moved the treble damages provision to subdivision a of section and added a service charge provision under subdivision a,which allowed the payee of a bad check to collect a service charge of or in addition to the face amount of the check.stats,ch.the addition of a fixed statutory service charge was in response to newman checkrite california.newman.see assem.floor analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,assembly floor analysis of assembly bill.
in newman,the court held that a merchant who seeks to collect a dishonored check and demands that the debtor pay a service charge must prove the amount of the service charge is commercially reasonable under section of the california uniform commercial code newman,supra.at.after newman,merchants expressed concern about the onerous burden of having to prove the reasonableness of a statutory service fee every time a check was dishonored.see assembly floor analysis of assembly bill,supra,at.moreover,newman appeared to be in tension with california court opinions that,in other contexts,did not require merchants to prove in each case the commercial reasonableness of charges and fees because of the impracticability,difficulty,and expense of proving actual damages.assembly floor analysis of assembly bill.accordingly,the legislature added the provisions of subdivision a to include a fixed service charge designed to represent a reasonable endeavor to fix the probable loss resulting to the merchant ibid.the legislature further amended subdivision a to provide that the service charge could not be collected in the event that treble damages were recoverable,subd.a.
the legislature in also added subdivisions i and k.subdivision i states the assignee of the payee or a holder of the check may demand,recover,or enforce the service charge,damages,and costs specified in this section to the same extent as the original payee,subd.i.although the legislative history is silent as to the reasons behind the addition of subdivision i,it appears to have been largely driven by the newman decision as well.in newman,the court left unresolved the issue of whether an assignee of a bad check debt,a debt collection agency may collect service charges under the statute to the same extent as the original payee.newman,supra.at.the legislature responded to that question in the affirmative by adding subdivision i.
as noted above,subdivision k provides that the rights,claims,remedies,and defenses under division of the california uniform commercial code remain in full effect notwithstanding any of the provisions of section,subd.k.while the legislative history is also silent as to the reasons for the addition of subdivision k,the legislature appears to have been at least partially motivated by cohen disner th,d cohen.in cohen,plaintiffs argued that because former section articulated only a stop payment defense,defendants who had written dishonored checks were precluded from asserting other defenses for negotiable instruments otherwise available under division of the california uniform commercial code cal,et.cohen,supra,th at,d.the court disagreed,and concluded that the maker of a dishonored check may raise defenses under the california uniform commercial code to establish that a check is unenforceable.id.at,d.shortly after cohen,the legislature added subdivision k.
as explained below,the legislative evolution and the reasoning behind section amendments confirm that the legislature intended that the statute serve as an exclusive damage scheme for the collection of dishonored checks.
first,the statutory scheme expressly provides for the collection of the face amount of the check and civil remedies of either a service charge and mailing fees where a check writer pays within the period or treble damages but no service charge or mailing costs where the check writer does not timely pay.it does not provide for the additional collection of interest.as california and federal courts decided important issues regarding the construction of section,the legislature acted to incorporate those provisions into the statute.these inclusions demonstrate that the legislature intends that section represent the sole recovery mechanism for bad debt collectors and that courts should not look beyond the statute unless failing to do so would result in an absurd interpretation.stassinos i,supra,d at.
we can not conclude that the denial of prejudgment interest is an absurd result.the legislature authorized fixed service charges so that merchants would be compensated for losses flowing from a dishonored check without having to prove actual damages.thus,the service charge was intended to be a reasonable substitute for actual,damages,including interest.see assembly floor analysis of assembly bill,supra,at referring to the statutory fee as a representation of actual damage incurred and a reasonable endeavor to fix probable loss.if the check writer refuses to pay within the window period,treble damages are recoverable instead of the statutory service charge.such recovery suggests that the treble damage provision is intended to cover all losses suffered as a result of the bad check.stassinos i,supra,d at,italics added see hunt i,supra,d at.the recovery of the statutory remedies and the additional collection of prejudgment interest would therefore constitute impermissible double recovery.greater westchester homeowners city of los angeles cal d.
second,as discussed above,the legislature implicitly precluded other civil remedies by expressly singling out division of the california uniform commercial code as an alternative civil remedy,subd.k.when the legislature added subdivision k to section,it included rights,claims,and remedies under division of the california uniform commercial code in addition to that code defenses in a section dispute that were at the heart of the cohen decision.cohen,supra,th at,d.division does not authorize the collection of prejudgment interest on a negotiable instrument unless the instrument itself otherwise provides for it,subd.a.were we to accept crs argument that all other civil remedies remain available to a payee or assignee seeking section damages,we would render the rights,claims,and remedies language of subdivision k superfluous.we decline to do so.
finally,the addition of subdivision i,which extended section rights to assignees,reflects that section is not only intended to be the exclusive remedy for bad check collections but one that replaces previously existing forms of relief.treble damages are punitive in nature hoban ryan cal,and punitive damages generally inure only to the person damaged.people superior court cal d.as here,when the statute requires the court to grant recovery to a party not traditionally entitled to such recovery,an assignee,the legislature has effectively conveyed its intention to replace previous forms of recovery with the statutory remedy provided.if the statutory remedy replaces previous forms of recovery,permitting interest on the amount of the check would result in double recovery.stassinos i,supra,d at.
we note that a merchant or other payee has the option of bypassing section,if it deems the service charge to be inadequate,and of suing on the underlying obligation instead.section,subdivision b,contained in division of the california uniform commercial code,allows a merchant or other payee to enforce either the instrument or the obligation thus,a payee who accepts a check for goods or services that is later dishonored may enforce the instrument,the returned check,by availing itself of the section statutory remedies.alternatively,a payee may choose to enforce the obligation and seek damages,including prejudgment interest,based on breach of the agreement to pay for goods or services.see,ballard equifax check services,d,ballard abels jbc legal group,d,abels.
crs other claims 
relying on currie workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,currie,crs argues that absent a specific legislative statement to the contrary,section prejudgment interest is permitted in addition to the fixed damages under section.currie is distinguishable in several critical respects.
the issue in currie was whether an employee was entitled to prejudgment interest in an award for backpay under labor code section,which makes it unlawful to wrongfully deny an employee reinstatement because of an industrial injury.currie,supra,cal th at,d.we held that nothing in labor code section expressly or impliedly precludes prejudgment interest.currie,cal th at,d.because the legislature was silent as to the availability of prejudgment interest,we determined that the intent of labor code section was to make employee victims of discrimination whole,at least to the extent of their lost wages.currie,cal th at,d.we reasoned that without prejudgment interest the backpay remedy may lose a significant portion of its value,and the employee left less than fully reimburse d,par.for his or her lost wages.currie,cal th at,d.accordingly,we concluded that the workers compensation appeals board may and must,when the criteria of civil code section are met,add to its awards reimbursing employees for lost wages and work benefits interest from the dates such wages and benefits would have become due had the employer not acted in violation of labor code section.currie,cal th at,d.
unlike the statute at issue in currie,the legislative history and structure of section implicitly preclude an award of prejudgment interest.additionally,whereas the employee in currie would not have been made whole if the statutory remedy were considered to be exclusive,crs has made no similar showing.in contrast to the employee in currie,a payee of a dishonored check is presumably made whole by the service charge or
