factual and procedural 
factual background 
decedent francisco castaneda was imprisoned by the state of california following a december,criminal conviction and held in the custody of the california department of corrections doc until his early release date,march.several times during his approximately incarceration,castaneda met with doc medical personnel regarding a raised lesion,then measuring approximately two centimeters square,on the foreskin of his penis.twice,in late december and late february,doc medical providers recommended that castaneda be referred to a urologist,and that he undergo a biopsy to rule out the possibility of squamous cell cancer.this referral never occurred during castaneda detention by doc,and on march,castaneda was transferred to the custody of immigration and customs enforcement ice at the san diego correctional facility sdcf.
immediately upon his transfer,castaneda brought his condition to the attention of the sdcf medical personnel,members of the division of immigration health services dihs by this time,the lesion on his penis had become painful,growing in size,bleeding,and exuding discharge.castaneda met with phs physician assistant lieutenant anthony walker who recommended a urology consult and a biopsy asap,noting both castaneda history of genital warts and his family history of cancer his mother died at age of pancreatic cancer.that consultation with an outside urologist,john wilkinson,did not occur until june.wilkinson agree d that castaneda symptoms require d urgent urologic assessment of biopsy and definitive treatment,citing the potential for considerable morbidity from even benign lesions which are not promptly and appropriately treated.although wilkinson notes indicate that he offered to admit castaneda for a urologic consultation and biopsy,dihs physicians indicated their wish to pursue outpatient biopsy which would be more cost effective.that biopsy,however,did not occur.instead,plaintiffs allege that dihs officials deemed the biopsy,a standard diagnostic procedure to detect a disease to be an elective outpatient procedure and declined to approve it.
castaneda symptoms grew worse and worse.on june,he filed a grievance report,asking for the surgery recommended by wilkinson and stating that he was in a considerable amount of pain and in desperate need of medical attention.on june,he reported to walker that his lesion was emitting a foul odor,continued to leak pus,and had increased in size,pressing further on his penis and increasing his discomfort.he complained of increased swelling,bleeding from the foreskin,and difficulty in urination.on july,instead of scheduling a biopsy,ice brought castaneda to the emergency room at scripps mercy chula vista.the emergency room physician noted the fungating lesion on castaneda penis and referred castaneda to urologist daniel hunting,who,following a brief examination,determined that the lesion was probably condyloma,or genital warts.hunting referred castaneda back to his primary treating urologist at dihs.four days later,walker noted that the lesion continued to grow.on july,another physician assistant explained to castaneda that while a surgical procedure might be recommended,that does not imply that the federal government is obligated to provide that surgery if the condition is not threatening to life,limb or eyesight.
on august,castaneda saw another urologist,robert masters,masters concluded that castaneda had genital warts and was in need of circumcision,which would both relieve the ongoing medical side effects of the lesion including infection and bleeding and provide a biopsy for further analysis.this treatment was again denied as elective in nature.the following month,walker noticed another condyloma type lesion forming and foul odor emitting from uncircumcised area with mushroomed wart.on november,dihs noted that castaneda symptoms have worsened.states he feels a constant pinching pain,especially at night.states he constantly has blood and discharge on his shorts also complains of a swollen rectum which he states makes bowel movements hard.castaneda was prescribed laxatives.the following day,castaneda complained that the lesion was growing,that he could not stand and urinate because the urine sprays everywhere,and that the lesion continued to leak blood and pus,continually staining his sheets and underwear.dihs responded by increasing castaneda weekly allotment of boxer shorts.
on november,castaneda was transferred from san diego to ice san pedro service processing center.the medical summary of federal in transit filed in connection with this transfer listed no current medical problems.nevertheless,an examination at the los angeles santa ana staging area noted the presence of other penile anomalies.
in early december,castaneda counsel from the aclu became involved in his case,sending multiple letters notifying ice and health service administration officials of castaneda medical problems and urging that he receive the biopsy he had been prescribed almost a year earlier.apparently in response,castaneda was sent to yet another urologist,lawrence greenberg,on december.greenberg described castaneda penis as a mess,and stated that he required surgery.the aclu continued to demand treatment,to no apparent avail.days later,january,castaneda was seen by asghar askari,who diagnosed a fungating penile lesion that was most likely penile cancer and,once again,ordered a biopsy.
on february,rather than provide the biopsy prescribed by doctors wilkinson,masters,greenberg,and askari,ice instead released castaneda,who then proceeded on his own to the emergency room of hospital in los angeles.he was scheduled for a biopsy on february,which confirmed that castaneda was suffering from squamous cell carcinoma of the penis.on february,castaneda penis was amputated,leaving only a stump.
the amputation did not occur in time to save castaneda life.in addition to creating a tumor in his penis,the cancer had metastasized to his lymph nodes and throughout his body.castaneda received chemotherapy throughout,but the treatment was ultimately unsuccessful.francisco castaneda died february.he was years old.
procedural background 
this action began november,as a suit brought by castaneda against the united states and a number of state and federal officials and medical personnel.castaneda alleged inadequate medical care while in doc and ice custody that amounted to malpractice,and a violation of his constitutional rights.he asserted various malpractice and negligence claims against the united states under the ftca and against the individual defendants under california law,and asserted constitutional claims violations of the fifth,eighth,and fourteenth amendments against the individual defendants under bivens and.he sought compensatory and punitive damages and declaratory relief.following castaneda death,yanira castaneda,castaneda sister and his estate personal representative,and vanessa castaneda,castaneda daughter and sole heir,filed an amended complaint,substituting themselves as plaintiffs and adding various claims under california wrongful death statute,civ.proc.et,and survival statute,civ.proc.et.
on january,commander chris henneford,captain eugene migliaccio,and commander stephen gonsalves,all commissioned officers of the phs,and timothy shack,and esther hui,both civilian employees of phs collectively,phs defendants,moved to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b.the phs defendants argued that they had absolute immunity from bivens actions because a provides that an ftca suit against the united states is the exclusive remedy for tortious acts committed by phs officers and employees in the course of their medical duties.
on march,the district court denied the motion to dismiss,holding that the plain language of a express ly preserv es plaintiffs constitutional claims.castaneda united states,d.rejecting the reasoning of the second circuit decision in cuoco moritsugu,cir,the district court held that a,through its reference to b,incorporated by reference the entirety of the ftca,including the general exclusivity provision of b,which expressly exempts constitutional claims from the ftca exclusivity,b a.castaneda,d at.it also held that the legislative history of both a and b supported the conclusion that a was not intended to preempt bivens actions.id.at.the phs defendants timely appealed.

discussion 
in bivens,the supreme court established that victims of constitutional violations by federal agents have a cause of action under the constitution to recover damages.as the supreme court later clarified,however,this remedy has limits 
such a cause of action may be defeated in a particular case,however,in two situations.the first is when defendants demonstrate special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by congress.the second is when defendants show that congress has provided an alternative remedy which it explicitly declared to be a substitute for recovery directly under the constitution and viewed as equally effective.
carlson green,d internal citations omitted quoting bivens,at.under carlson,then,a bivens remedy will not lie when an alternative remedy is both a explicitly declared to be a substitute and b is viewed as equally effective,or in the presence of special factors which militate against a direct recovery remedy.
carlson provides the starting point for our analysis in this case.the facts and posture of carlson closely resembled those here in carlson,the plaintiff,the mother of a deceased federal prisoner,brought suit against federal prison officials on behalf of her son estate,alleging eighth amendment violations.specifically,she alleged that the federal officials deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs,amounting to an eighth amendment violation,caused the decedent,a chronic asthmatic,to die of respiratory failure.id.at.the defendants argued that the ftca provided a substitute remedy preempting one under bivens.after noting the two ways in which a bivens remedy can be preempted,the court held that n either situation obtains in this case.id.at.first,the court held that the case involve d no special factors counseling hesitation.id.second,there was no congressional declaration foreclosing the bivens claim and making the ftca exclusive.no statute declared the ftca to be a substitute for bivens,and subsequent legislative history made it crystal clear that congress views ftca and bivens as parallel,complementary causes of action.id.at.the court further noted four ways in which the remedy in the ftca could not be seen as an equally effective substitute for a bivens remedy.id.at.see also infra.
in this case,too,we have an individual who has died,allegedly due to the deliberate indifference of the federal officials charged with his health and safety.once again,the decedent survivors bring a bivens action,alleging fifth and eighth amendment violations and,once again,the officials argue that the ftca preempts any bivens remedy.the difference is that this time,they do so on the basis of a,which provides a remedy under the ftca,rather than on the basis of the ftca itself.
a provides 
the remedy against the united states provided by sections b and of title for damage for personal injury,including death,resulting from the performance of medical,surgical,dental,or related functions by any commissioned officer or employee of the public health service while acting within the scope of his office or employment,shall be exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding by reason of the same against the officer or employee whose act or omission gave rise to the claim.
there is no dispute that the phs defendants were,during all relevant times,commissioned officers or employees of the public health service,and were acting within the scope of their offices or employment.the phs defendants claim that the exclusivity provision in a acts either to expressly substitute the ftca for a bivens remedy,or as a special factor that would preclude the bivens remedy.we examine each of these arguments in turn.
does a expressly establish the ftca as a substitute remedy for bivens 
as noted above,carlson established a test for express bivens preemption congress must provide an alternative remedy that is explicitly declared to be a substitute for bivens rather than a complement to it and congress must view that remedy as equally effective.at.both these elements must be present for a court to find the bivens remedy expressly displaced.we first address the equally effective question discussed in carlson.
viewed as equally effective 
the alternative remedy in carlson,like the remedy here,was the ftca.in carlson,the supreme court held that congress does not view the ftca as providing relief that is equally effective as bivens relief.there is no basis here on which to distinguish that holding from the case before us if anything,the ftca is a less effective remedy now than it was when carlson was decided.
carlson enumerated four factors,each suggesting that the bivens remedy is more effective than the ftca remedy.at.first,bivens damages are awarded against individual defendants,while the ftca damages are recovered from the united states.because the bivens remedy is recoverable against individuals,it is a more effective deterrent than the ftca remedy against the united states.it is almost axiomatic that the threat of damages has a deterrent effect,particularly so when the individual official faces personal financial liability.id.at.citations omitted.second,punitive damages are not available under the ftca,further undermining its deterrent effect.punitive damages are a particular remedial mechanism normally available in the federal courts,and are especially appropriate to redress the violation by a government official of a citizen constitutional rights but punitive damages in an ftca suit are statutorily prohibited.thus ftca is that much less effective than a bivens action as a deterrent to unconstitutional acts.id.at.quoting bivens,at.citations omitted.third,bivens cases may be tried before a jury ftca cases can not.id.at.just as suffrage ensures the people ultimate control in the legislative and executive branches,jury trial is meant to ensure their control in the judiciary.blakely washington,d.this is particularly important in the context of constitutional torts,where the actions of the government itself are on trial.moreover,juries are to the task of apportioning damages.as congress noted in explaining the need for jury trials under title vii,j uries are fully capable of determining whether an award of damages is appropriate and if so,how large it must be to compensate the plaintiff adequately and to deter future repetition of the prohibited conduct.i,at.lastly,the ftca limitation that the united states may be held liable in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred,b,would violate the policy obvious ly motivating bivens that the liability of federal officials for violations of citizens constitutional rights should be governed by uniform rules.carlson,at.this last factor was especially important to the supreme court.in carlson,the plaintiff action would have failed under the survivorship law of the forum state,indiana.id.at.the court emphasized that only a uniform federal rule of survivorship will suffice to redress the constitutional deprivation here alleged and to protect against repetition of such conduct.id.at.
none of the factors listed by the supreme court is any less present in the case before us.the ftca would be no more a deterrent here than it was in carlson,because ftca damages remain recoverable only against the united states and because punitive damages remain unavailable.likewise,an ftca plaintiff still can not demand a jury trial.moreover,the ftca remedy continues to depend on the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.b.
nowhere does this reliance on state law present a greater threat to uniformity of remedy than in actions for damage for personal injury,including death,resulting from the performance of medical,surgical,dental,or related functions.a.since carlson was decided in,the united states has witnessed a revolution in state tort law,focusing on medical malpractice in particular.reacting to a crisis in medical malpractice insurance costs and availability,many states began in the to enact legislative changes designed both to deter frivolous lawsuits and to limit the size of damage awards even in meritorious ones.see generally cong.budget office,the effects of tort reform evidence from the states,available at.pdf.states,for example,have abolished the rule,often permitting payments to offset damage awards.am.tort reform ass n,tort reform record july,available at.similarly,states have placed statutory limits on damages,many limiting medical malpractice awards in particular.id.at.statutory damage caps for malpractice can range from,see,cal.b,to million,a see also.stat.stat.ann.a million.other states have introduced procedural innovations to screen out meritless suits and encourage early settlement,such as requiring that plaintiffs,prior to suit,obtain expert certificates of merits,or submit their claims to medical screening panels,alaska stat,or participate in other compulsory alternative dispute resolution bodies,cts.jud.proc.were plaintiffs sole remedy for the alleged mistreatment and death of castaneda a common law malpractice suit against the united states,as the phs defendants argue,the damages they could recover,and the procedural hurdles they would have to surmount to bring suit in the first place,would vary from state to state even more now than in.
the supreme court has never revisited its conclusion that the ftca dependence on the vagaries of the laws of the several states prevents it from serving as an equally effective remedy for constitutional violations.carlson,at.while the supreme court has,in subsequent years,found that the congressional institution of other remedial schemes that are not fully compensatory may be a special factor precluding bivens relief,see schweiker chilicky,d social security bush lucas,d federal civil service see also adams johnson,cir federal income tax,those cases can not serve as a basis for distinguishing the supreme court explicit determination in carlson that the very remedy at issue here,the ftca,is not viewed by congress as equally effective as bivens.moreover,every one of those subsequently examined schemes,however otherwise undercompensatory,nonetheless provided a uniform remedy across the united states.carlson holding that the ftca,in particular,is not equally effective because of its lack of deterrent effect,its absence of a right to a jury trial,and its dependence on variable state law remains binding on this court,and,accordingly,following carlson,we hold that a does not preempt bivens relief.
explicitly declared to be a substitute 
a careful analysis of the first prong of the carlson explicit substitute and equally effective remedy standard,carlson,at,also compels the conclusion that a does not preclude relief under bivens.the phs defendants maintain that,in a,congress explicitly declared the ftca to be a substitute for recovery directly under the constitution.id.specifically,the phs defendants urge that we read a command that the ftca remedy shall be exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding to necessarily include actions or proceedings seeking a bivens remedy.we decline to do so.
the plain text alone of makes it clear that congress did not explicitly declare a to be a substitute for a bivens action.the section does not mention the constitution or recovery thereunder,let alone explicitly declare itself to be a substitute for recovery directly under the constitution.carlson,at.
moreover,a can not be read as an expression of congress desire to substitute the ftca in place of bivens relief for the simple reason that bivens relief did not exist when a was enacted.see emergency health personnel act of,stat.bivens,d.carlson requires an intention to substitute one form of relief for another,but substitution does not occur,and is in fact impossible,if the person or thing being replaced does not exist.because bivens relief did not exist at the time of a enactment,as well as because there is no mention of constitutional torts in its text,we can not read the text of a as a declaration of congress intent to substitute the ftca for bivens relief.
our conclusion that a does not constitute an explicit declaration that the ftca is a substitute for bivens actions is supported by the history of the legislation in question.that history demonstrates that the exclusivity provision of a was intended to preempt a particular set of tort law claims related to medical malpractice.
although codification can produce the illusion of a timeless,unitary law,statutes are passed in particular historic and legal contexts and their language must be read and interpreted with that context in mind.o ur evaluation of congressional action in must take into account its contemporary legal context.cannon of chicago,d see also se.cmty.coll.davis,d describing courts obligation to honor the clear meaning of a statute,as revealed by its language,purpose,and history emphasis added aldridge williams,how.stating that courts interpreting legislation should look,if necessary,to the public history of the times in which it was passed.thus,although the term any other civil action or proceeding may appear clear in a historical isolation,t he certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context.fda brown williamson tobacco,d.
as the court noted in carlson,the ftca was enacted long before bivens recognized a right of action under the constitution.at.section a,too,predated bivens it was passed december,almost six months before bivens was decided the following june,and almost six years before the supreme court decision in estelle gamble,d,established the deliberate indifference standard for prisoner medical care under the eighth amendment.emergency health personnel act of,stat.it is therefore unsurprising that a says nothing about preempting direct constitutional remedies were not recognized at the time of its passage.an ordinary reader,at the time of a passage,would have understood any other civil action or proceeding with respect to personal injury,including death,resulting from the performance of medical,surgical,dental,or related functions to refer instead to a host of and statutory malpractice actions 
this understanding is borne out by the legislative history of a,which reveals that congress exclusive concern was with common law malpractice liability.the only two statements on the floor of either house of congress respecting the bill mentioned only medical malpractice,with nothing being said about constitutional violations.see cong.rec.statement of staggers so they have asked,if in the event there is a suit against a phs doctor alleging malpractice,the attorney general of the united states would defend them in whatever suit may arise.cong.rec.statement of javits i am pleased to support the provision for the defense of certain malpractice and negligence suits by the attorney general.representative staggers noted that the surgeon general had requested the amendment because phs physicians just can not afford to take out the customary liability insurance as most doctors do.cong.rec.the section itself was titled in the statutes at large defense of certain malpractice and negligence suits.stat.at see united states,d t he title of a statute and the heading of a section are tools available for a resolution of a doubt about the meaning of a statute.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,not only is the authoritative text of the statute silent as to constitutional torts in particular,but the title and legislative history,if anything,indicate an exclusive concern with state malpractice claims 
subsequent congressional action has revealed no inclination to make the ftca a substitute remedy for bivens actions.see brown williamson,at.at the time a statute is enacted,it may have a range of plausible meanings.over time,however,subsequent acts can shape or focus those meanings.the ftca itself has been modified to add an express exclusivity provision and to provide that the provision does not bar actions for constitutional torts.in response to the supreme court decision in westfall erwin,d congress passed the federal employees liability reform and tort compensation act of lrtca.the lrtca expanded b,which previously made the ftca the exclusive remedy for injury resulting from a federal employee operation of a motor vehicle,to encompass any injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death arising or resulting from the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment.b.because,under the ftca,the united states is substituted as the defendant in place of employees acting within the scope of their official duties,the lrtca acts as a general grant of immunity to government employees for all such acts.the amendment went on to clarify that general immunity does not extend or apply to a civil action against an employee of the government which is brought for a violation of the constitution of the united states.id.b a.in so doing,congress made explicit what,when carlson was decided,had previously been implicit that constitutional claims are outside the purview of the federal tort claims act.billings united states,cir.it would defy logic to suppose that a must be read,despite the lack of any statutory language or legislative history counseling such a reading,to smuggle them back in again for this one subset of defendants.
what is more,the legislative history of the lrtca makes it clear that congress viewed the general grant of immunity it was extending to all employees,which expressly exempted constitutional claims,to be identical to the immunity it had already extended to phs officers and employees sixteen years earlier the house report,in discussing the effect of the lrtca,noted 
there is substantial precedent for providing an exclusive remedy against the united states for the actions of federal employees.such an exclusive remedy has already been enacted to cover the activities of certain federal employees,including 
medical ftca is the exclusive remedy for medical or dental malpractice on the part of the medical personnel of most federal employees.
at,reprinted in,citing.the same report noted the sharp distinction between common law torts and constitutional or bivens torts and suggested that a constitutional tort involves a more serious intrusion of the rights of an individual that merits special attention.id.at,at.the report emphasized that the exclusive remedy provision was intended to substitute the united states as the sole permissible defendant in all common law tort actions,but declared that the provision expressly does not extend to constitutional torts,id.at.
testifying before the house committee on the judiciary,a senior justice department official stated 
t he exclusive remedy provision of b is based on a very precedent.seven such exclusive remedy provisions already exist.they apply to drivers of vehicles,to physicians employed by various agencies,and to department of defense attorneys.
the lrtca simply extends those provisions to all federal employees.because of this precedent,we have considerable experience with such exclusive remedy provisions.they work well and fairly,have been widely accepted,and are not controversial.

the phs defendants argue that to construe a to preempt only common law and statutory tort actions would render it superfluous,since,phs officers and employees are already immune from those actions under b.even if were now superfluous because of the subsequent enactment of the lrtca some years later,it unquestionably was not superfluous at the time it was enacted.
we would certainly hesitate to read a statute in a manner that would leave an entire subsection superfluous,and we do not do so here.see christensen comm r,cir we should avoid an interpretation that would render entire subsections redundant.the canon against redundancy is rooted in the notion perhaps aspirational that congress would not do anything as preposterous as to pass a statute that was,in part or in whole,a nullity ab initio.int l ass of machinists aerospace workers bf goodrich aerospace aerostructures group,cir a bsent clear congressional intent to the contrary,the legislature did not intend to pass vain or meaningless legislation.quoting coyne delany blue cross blue shield of,cir alterations omitted.the presumption applies more weakly in situations,like this one,in which the provision is potentially rendered superfluous by language contained in a separate,later statute.boise cascade,cir we must mak e every effort not to interpret a provision in a manner that renders other provisions of the same statute inconsistent,meaningless or superfluous.emphasis added.indeed,r edundancies across statutes are not unusual events in drafting.bank germain,d,and it would not be surprising to a frequent reader of federal statutes that congress might pass a later,more comprehensive statute that has the effect of rendering an earlier statute redundant,at least in part the supreme court has already held that b applies to all federal employees,regardless of whether they were covered by immunities.see united states smith,d the liability reform act plain language makes no distinction between employees who are covered under immunity statutes and those who are not.
in any event,we disagree that our reading makes the text of a superfluous.a review of the rest of reveals why subsection a remains the lynchpin of the entire balance of the section.see dolan united states postal,d interpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text,considering the purpose and context of the statute,and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis.other subsections of have extended subsection a protection to private persons and entities who are not otherwise employees covered by ftca by stating that they are to be deemed to be an employee of the public health service.still other subsections involve the administration and limitation of this preemption section a,by defining the scope of immunity granted uniquely to phs employees respecting only the performance of medical,surgical,dental,or related functions,allows phs and the attorney general to provide a limited grant of immunity to volunteers and recipients of federal funds.after the lrtca,then,the ongoing function of,read as a whole,is to extend the ftca exclusivity to private entities,much like many other statutes scattered throughout the.see,g immunizing official acts by employees of national academy of sciences carrying out the future strategic highway research program f a volunteers of the domestic volunteer services d a health and human services contractors involved in research and development activities related to qualified countermeasures against certain weapons of mass destruction b government contractors under atomic testing liability act.it would,indeed,be superfluous to add an explicit exemption for such deemed employees from bivens actions because such private actors are not subject to bivens actions.corr.serv.malesko,d.
in addition to historical context,individual statutes are located within a greater statutory and remedial context.we must find that interpretation which can most fairly be said to be imbedded in the statute,in the sense of being most harmonious with its scheme and with the general purposes that congress manifested.united states alghazouli,cir quoting comm r engle,d.as we have noted,a is not the only statute that makes the ftca the exclusive remedy for injuries committed by certain classes of federal employees although their meaning is not before us here.most,like a,concern federal medical personnel.some expressly limit themselves to actions involving malpractice or negligence.a state department medical personnel a a veterans health administration.others specify in the text only a negligent or wrongful act or omission.a department of defense,armed forces retirement home,and central intelligence agency medical personnel nasa.additionally,department of defense lawyers are given immunity for any negligent or wrongful act or omission connected with their provision of legal services.a.all,like a,mention malpractice in their title.all of these classes of employee might,absent b,face substantial common law and statutory malpractice liability granting these individuals,along with all federal employees driving motor vehicles the former function of b,immunity from state negligence actions served a very real,obvious common purpose 
phs defendants and amicus the united states,however,have provided no explanation for why congress would want to provide these persons with the privilege,shared with no other federal employees,to violate the constitution without consequence.see malesko,at.stevens,dissenting nor have we ever suggested that a category of federal agents can commit eighth amendment violations with impunity.why should the physicians who treat our soldiers families be immune from constitutional torts while the physicians who treat our veterans are not why distinguish the bureau of prisons medical personnel who allowed a man in federal custody to die in carlson from the phs personnel who allegedly relegated a man in immigration detention to a similar outcome here what is it about department of defense attorneys,alone among our government legions of legal personnel,that they deserve such solicitude 
the lrtca was passed to abolish such arbitrary distinctions.in his written statement to congress,the deputy assistant attorney general noted the absurdity of treating doctors,drivers,and defense department lawyers differently from all other federal employees.for example,lawyers involved in department of commerce contracting should be protected from personal liability for their professional advice,just like their counterparts in the department of defense.willmore testimony at.yet twenty years later,his successors at the justice department would have us the exact same disparity in miniature,immunizing one set of doctors and lawyers from bivens liability,and leaving the rest on the hook.
had congress intended this result,it surely would have said the statute itself,in its title,or in the legislative history.instead,the statute is silent as to the constitution,and both the title and contemporary and subsequent legislative history suggest that congress intended to preclude only common law malpractice claims.this can not be what the supreme court meant by an explicitly declared substitute.we therefore hold that a does not explicitly declare the ftca to be a substitute remedy for bivens actions against phs officers and employees.
cuoco moritsugu 
we recognize that our holding in this case conflicts with the second circuit decision in cuoco moritsugu.in cuoco,the court relied on dicta in carlson which it read to imply that a was an expressly declared substitute for bivens.id.at.in carlson,the supreme court wrote that its conclusion that the ftca complements bivens,rather than replaces it,
is buttressed by the significant fact that congress follows the practice of explicitly stating when it means to make ftca an exclusive remedy.see a,a,a,and a malpractice by certain government health personnel b operation of motor vehicles by federal employees and k manufacturers of swine flu vaccine.
at.emphasis added.in the middle of a discussion about bivens preemption,it is easy to skip over what,buried in a string citation,the supreme court actually said was preempted under a,et,actions for malpractice.indeed,the court also cited a,which by its terms expressly limited veterans health administration medical personnel immunity to actions allegedly arising from malpractice or negligence.moreover,before the passage of the lrtca general exclusive remedy provision,the enumerated statutes were the only statutes that provided that the ftca to be exclusive of any remedy.we believe that the better reading of the court dictum in carlson is that just as congress,through certain statutes,made the ftca a substitute remedy for medical malpractice actions,so it did the ftca to be a substitute remedy for federal constitutional claims.
cuoco also failed to discuss whether congress viewed the remedies provided under the ftca as equally effective as those provided under bivens,a question that the carlson court explicitly answered in the negative.because,under carlson,compliance with its equally effective prong is a necessary for holding a statutory remedy to be a substitute for a bivens cause of action,cuoco failure to address that prong or the answer provided by carlson is contrary to governing supreme court precedent.accordingly,we can not agree with the second circuit analysis or application of carlson.
do special factors exist here warranting a finding of implicit preemption 
both the supreme court and this court have recognized that even where congress fails to explicitly declare a remedy to be a substitute for recovery directly under the constitution or to provide a remedy that is as effective a remedy for a constitutional tort,a bivens action may still be precluded.as carlson noted,a bivens action will not lie when defendants demonstrate special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by congress.at.quoting bivens,at.the presence of a deliberately crafted statutory remedial system is one special factor that precludes a bivens remedy.moore glickman,cir.phs defendant henneford and the united states contend that,even if a is not an explicit substitution of the ftca for bivens,it nonetheless constitutes a deliberately crafted statutory remedial system,henneford br.at such that we ought to find that the ftca impliedly displaces bivens for suits against phs officers and employees.
neither henneford nor any other phs defendant appears to have raised any argument based on the presence of special factors before the district court.generally,in order for an argument to be considered on appeal,the argument must have been raised sufficiently for the trial court to rule on it.ambulance,county of monterey,cir 
in any case,we reject this argument as well.first,while the supreme court and this court have subsequently found various other remedial schemes to be special factors precluding bivens relief,see,chilicky,at.kotarski cooper,cir,those decisions have not overruled carlson square holding that there are no special factors that preclude a bivens action in a case whose facts and posture mirror this one.at.holding that the case involves no special factors counseling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by congress.as noted earlier,here,as in carlson,we have an individual who has died,allegedly due to the deliberate indifference of the federal officials charged with his health and safety.as in carlson,the decedent survivors bring a bivens action premised on violations of the fifth and eighth amendments,and the officials argue that no bivens remedy is available.because the present case is functionally identical to carlson,carlson holding that no special factors preclude bivens relief is binding on this court 
second,chilicky and kotarski hold that courts should not create a bivens remedy where the complexity of a federal pr
