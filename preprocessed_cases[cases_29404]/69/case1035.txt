background 
mills,a general contractor in brookings,south dakota,contracted with the city of brookings to construct the brookings agriplex,a series of buildings to be used for various purposes.one of the buildings to be constructed was a steel clear span arena feet long by feet wide.due to the building size and the fact that its construction would require the use of cranes,mills decided to subcontract with a steel erection company for construction of the arena.double diamond,a steel erection company located in lincoln,nebraska,submitted a bid for the project,which mills accepted.the parties entered into a subcontract dated march,under which double diamond agreed to provide the labor and equipment and mills agreed to provide the prefabricated steel and other component parts for the building.mills obtained the prefabricated steel for the building from american buildings company abc.mills agreed to pay double diamond a total of under the subcontract.
double diamond had to construct the building in two phases.the first phase,called the phase,involved erecting the building frame.generally,this phase involves setting columns onto concrete foundations,bolting them down,and bracing them with struts,pipe braces,and girts.once the columns are erected,steel mainframes or rafters are set onto the columns and braced together with purlins,pipe braces,and.the second phase is the phase,which involves attaching metal sheeting to the frame to form the sides and roof of the building.double diamond never reached the second phase of construction because the structure collapsed before any sheeting could begin.
under the subcontract,the delivery of materials was to begin the week of april.however,mills,through abc,did not make its first delivery until april,and some of the materials needed for the early stages of the building were not delivered until later shipments.as a result,construction was delayed.when double diamond was able to begin working on the building,it discovered numerous problems with the component parts supplied by mills.many of the steel components did not fit together properly,some of the mainframes were twisted,and other parts were missing or the wrong length.
double diamond reported the problems to mills,who told double diamond to contact abc directly.double diamond made numerous calls to abc,but abc did not resolve the problems.on may,double diamond ceased working on the project and informed mills and abc that nothing else could be done until the problems were corrected.on may,wilma miller wrote a letter to mills,abc,the city of brookings,and the project architects,in which she recounted the problems encountered during construction and expressed concern about the structural integrity of the structure.
on may,dave roberts,an abc representative,visited the construction site to examine the structure.a videotape of his inspection documented the many problems with the structure and materials.before leaving the site,roberts concluded that the structure did not need additional bracing and would be fine unless hit by a tornado.later that evening,the structure collapsed in the wind.a climatologist testified that the wind speed at the approximate time of the collapse was miles per hour,but he also noted that an observer at the scene reported wind speeds of nearly fifty miles per hour at the time of the collapse.
after the collapse,double diamond submitted to mills an invoice dated may,in the amount of for work completed on the project up to the date of collapse.the amount of the invoice was based on double diamond estimate that phase one of the construction had a contract value of and that double diamond had completed eighty percent of the work on phase one.mills previously had paid double diamond on an invoice dated april.mills paid double diamond in response to the may invoice but refused to pay any more.on june,double diamond informed mills that it would not return to work on the project unless mills paid the balance due on the invoice and executed a new contract with double diamond for completion of the project.when the parties did not reach a new agreement,mills completed the project on its own.
mills submitted a claim to its insurer for the damages it sustained when the building collapsed.in its claim,mills included double diamond invoice plus for additional costs.in a june,letter from mills to its insurance agent,mills project manager explained why these costs were reasonable.mills insurer approved for structural steel erection plus nearly sixteen percent for profit and overhead,which amounted to approximately.
on february,double diamond filed what amounted to a claim against mills,seeking damages in the amount of.double diamond later amended its complaint to add an alternative theory of recovery of the same amount based on quantum meruit.mills denied liability and asserted counterclaims based on negligence and breach of contract for failure to construct in a good and workmanlike manner.one of mills affirmative defenses was that double diamond breached the contract and was not entitled to recover because it voluntarily discontinued work on the project after the collapse,and failed to return to work despite numerous requests by mills.
following a bench trial,the district court held that mills breached the contract by failing to provide the appropriate materials.the district court stated that the sheer number of problems made it impossible for double diamond to perform under the contract.the district court also found that the collapse was not the result of negligence on double diamond part and that mills could not maintain an action against double diamond for breach of contract because mills did not substantially comply with its obligations under the contract.even if mills could maintain an action against double diamond,the district court found that double diamond performance under the contract was not substandard.
the district court awarded double diamond damages of,after finding that double diamond proved by a preponderance of the evidence that eighty percent of the work was completed for a total amount of and subtracting the previously paid.the district court also awarded consequential damages of for charges from the date of collapse through the end of the contract term,finding that the damages were proximately caused by mills breach after entry of judgment,the district court amended the judgment to add in prejudgment interest.
ii.discussion 
breach of contract 
mills and van tol assert on appeal that the district court erred in its determination of breach of contract because this claim was not included in double diamond amended complaint.the claims in double diamond amended complaint are based on mills refusal to pay the amount due to double diamond for its work on the building through the date of collapse,not on mills failure to provide appropriate materials.while we acknowledge that double diamond amended complaint does not allege that mills breached the contract by providing defective building materials,we conclude that the parties tried the issue by consent.
federal rule of civil procedure b provides that w hen issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties,they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.a party consent may be implied if evidence to support the claim was introduced at trial without objection.shen leo daly,cir.thus,under rule b,the district court could consider any theory of liability tried and argued by the parties,regardless of whether it was included in the pleadings.see karlen ray friedman.commodities,cir.
a review of the record reveals that double diamond argued the issue of mills failure to provide appropria
