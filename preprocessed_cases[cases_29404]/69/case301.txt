background 
the ryan white comprehensive aids resources emergency act of the act was enacted to provide emergency relief funding to localities that were disproportionately affected by the epidemic.see.the act was modified on may,by the ryan white care act amendments of the amendments and on october,by the ryan white care act amendments of.the purpose of the statute as so amended was to make financial assistance available to states and other public or private nonprofit entities to provide for the development,organization,coordination and operation of more effective and cost efficient systems for the delivery of essential services to individuals and families with hiv disease.id.the county plaintiffs were among the recipients of this funding.
on december,congress passed the ryan white treatment modernization act of the act.before the act,nassau and suffolk counties were classified together as a single locality for the receipt of emergency funding,which funds were then distributed to the other plaintiffs.after the act enactment,however,dhhs reduced the funding.plaintiffs contend that the funding decrease was contrary to the statutory mandate expressed in the act.
i.the iterations of the act 
the original act established standards for determining which localities would qualify for funding.under the act,areas selected for funding were deemed eligible metropolitan areas emas.see a.for a locality to qualify as an ema in a given fiscal year,the act set forth the following requirements 
there has been reported to and confirmed by the director of the centers for disease control cdc a cumulative total of more than cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome within the locality or the per capita incidence of cumulative cases of such syndrome computed on the basis of the most recently available data on the population of the area is not less than.
id.under the act,nassau suffolk qualified as an ema and received emergency funding.
b.the amendments 
the amendments established different eligibility requirements,stating in pertinent part 
a eligible areas 
the secretary shall,subject to subsections b through d of this section,make grants to any metropolitan area for which there has been reported to the director of the cdc a cumulative total of more than cases of aids for the most recent period of calendar years for which such data are available.
b requirements regarding confirmation of cases 
c requirements regarding population 
d continued status as eligible area 
notwithstanding any other provision of this section,a metropolitan area that was an eligible area under this part for fiscal year is an eligible area for fiscal year and each subsequent fiscal year.
the amendments thus provided a grandfather clause that protected the future funding of all emas that had qualified for funding in fiscal year.
the act again amended the standards under which areas could qualify for funding.it provides 
a eligible areas 
the secretary shall,subject to subsections b through c of this section,make grants to any metropolitan area for which there has been reported to the director of the cdc a cumulative total of more than cases of aids for the most recent period of calendar years for which such data are available.
b continued status as eligible area 
notwithstanding any other provision of this section,a metropolitan area that is an eligible area for a fiscal year continues to be an eligible area until the metropolitan area fails,for three consecutive fiscal years 
to meet the requirements of subsection a of this section and 
to have a cumulative total of or more living cases of aids reported to and confirmed by the director of the cdc as of december of the most recent calendar year for which such data is available.
a b.the effect,therefore,of the act was to drop the grandfather clause and replace it with a clause that would cut off ema status if the metropolitan area had failed both of two requirements for the last three consecutive fiscal years the requirement that the metropolitan area have more than aids cases reported to the director of the cdc for the most recent period for which data are available,and the requirement that the metropolitan area have a cumulative total of or more living aids cases as of december of the most recent calendar year for which data are available.
the act also provided for a new category of areas that would receive reduced funding compared to emas.a metropolitan area could qualify as a transitional grant area tga as follows 
b transitional areas 
for purposes of this section,the term transitional area means,subject to subsection c of this section,a metropolitan area for which there has been reported to and confirmed by the director of the cdc a cumulative total of at least,but fewer than,cases of aids during the most recent period of calendar years for which such data are available.
c certain eligibility rules 
fiscal year 
with respect to grants under subsection a of this section for fiscal year,a metropolitan area that received funding under subpart i for fiscal year but does not for fiscal year qualify under such subpart as an eligible area and does not qualify under subsection b of this section as a transitional area shall,notwithstanding subsection b of this section,be considered a transitional area.
continued status as transitional area 
a in general.notwithstanding subsection b of this section,a metropolitan area that is a transitional area for a fiscal year continues,except as provided in subparagraph b,to be a transitional area until the metropolitan area fails,for three consecutive fiscal years 
i to qualify under such subsection as a transitional area and 
ii to have a cumulative total of or more living cases of aids reported to and confirmed by the cdc as of december of the most recent calendar year for which such data is available.
notably,certain localities that never before qualified for funding as emas could now possibly qualify as tgas.furthermore,tgas would enjoy analogous protections from the loss of funding that emas enjoyed.
ii.plaintiffs funding 
nassau suffolk qualified as an ema under the act.in fiscal year fy,although nassau suffolk did not meet a requirement of having more than reported aids cases over the previous period for which data was available,the locality funding continued under d,the amendments grandfather clause.under that clause,nassau suffolk status as an ema,and therefore its funding,would continue indefinitely because of its status as an ema for fy.see d a metropolitan area that was an eligible area under this part for fiscal year is an eligible area for fiscal year and each subsequent fiscal year.emphasis added.nassau suffolk continued status as an ema,however,became the subject of dispute with the passage of the act.
on february,after the enactment of the act,defendant dhhs informed nassau suffolk that the locality would no longer qualify as an ema for fy but would now be categorized as a tga because nassau suffolk had cases reported to and confirmed by the cdc in the applicable period.nassau suffolk disputed dhhs application of the act and brought this suit seeking a judgment declaring that dhhs interpretation of was erroneous.nassau suffolk also moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction requesting the district court to enjoin defendants from downgrading nassau suffolk from an ema to a tga.
iii.the parties arguments and the proceedings below 
the parties differ sharply as to the effect of the act.dhhs argues that the act repealed the amendments grandfather clause.it contends that nassau suffolk failed to qualify as an ema for fy because the locality did not have enough cases to meet the requirements of a of the act.dhhs argues further that b,which provides that an area that is eligible for a fiscal year generally continues to be an eligible area,is inapplicable because nassau suffolk had never,in the first instance,qualified as an ema for fy.dhhs claims,however,that nassau suffolk will receive funding for fy as a tga under a because it had between and cases during the relevant period.
nassau suffolk argues that the act did not change its status.it notes that all versions of the statute have specifically used the term fiscal year when discussing eligibility requirements,and that plaintiffs fy began on october.the act,however,was not enacted until december.thus,the amendments and specifically,their grandfather clause were still in force at the beginning of fy.nassau suffolk contends that as of october,it was still protected by that clause and therefore qualified as an ema for fy.
when the grandfather clause was replaced more than two months later by the act,nassau suffolk claims that it was nevertheless saved because b of the act continued its status as an ema.that subsection provides that a metropolitan area that is an eligible area for a fiscal year continues to be an eligible area until it fails,for three consecutive fiscal years,to meet the cumulative total in subsection a and to have a cumulative total of living aids cases.b.plaintiffs argue that because nassau suffolk was an eligible area for fy pursuant to the amendments and had more than living aids cases in the last three fiscal years,it continue d to be an eligible area entitled to funding until it failed to meet both of b conditions.
the district court sided with dhhs,finding that the act essentially wiped the slate clean regarding the status of all localities.the district court reasoned that the act not the amendments controlled the determination of a locality status for fy,notwithstanding the lag between the start of fy and the passage of the act.under this view,nassau suffolk never qualified as an ema in fy,and,as a result,b of the act could not save nassau suffolk status.the district court also found this view to be consistent with an excerpt of the legislative history that states emas that received funding in fiscal year but were not eligible for tier one as emas in fiscal year would be added to the tier two category as tgas,pt.b,at.the district court concluded,based on this interpretation of the statute,that nassau suffolk had failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits and denied the injunction.plaintiffs nassau suffolk now appeal.
discussion 
legal standard 
when reviewing a district court denial of a preliminary injunction,we review the district court legal holdings de novo and its ultimate decision for abuse of discretion.ex rel.city bd.of,cir.a party seeking a preliminary injunction in this circuit must show irreparable harm in the absence of the injunction and either a a likelihood of success on the merits or b sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly in the movant favor.nxivm ross,cir.w hen,as here,the moving party seeks a preliminary injunction that will affect government action taken in the public interest pursuant to a statutory or regulatory scheme,the injunction should be granted only if the moving party meets the more rigorous standard.wright giuliani,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.that is,plaintiffs must establish a clear or substantial likelihood of success on the merits.sussman crawford,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.because the district court denied plaintiffs injunction based on the absence of a likelihood of success,we examine that ground.
ii.plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits 
the outcome of this appeal turns on statutory interpretation.statutory construction is a holistic endeavor.in interpreting statutes,this court reads statutory language in light of the surrounding language and framework of the statute.field day,llc county of suffolk,cir alteration,internal quotation marks,and citation omitted see also robinson shell oil,d the plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.in ascertaining the plain meaning of the statute,the court must look to the particular statutory language at issue,as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.k mart cartier,d.
b applies to metropolitan areas that qualified as emas for fy and looks back in time to determine eligibility for the current fiscal year 
as we explain in detail below,the only way that all sections of the act can function harmoniously is if we interpret b as applying to metropolitan areas including those such as nassau suffolk that qualified as emas for fy under the amendments and looking back in time to ascertain whether such localities have failed to meet both of b requirements for three consecutive fiscal years.this conclusion is supported by our determination that b can not operate in a solely prospective manner,and by other provisions of the statute.
b applies to metropolitan areas that qualified as emas for fy under the amendments 
section b is entitled continued status as an eligible area.b.it provides that a metropolitan area that is an eligible area for a fiscal year continues to be an eligible area until the area fails both of the section requirements for three consecutive fiscal years.id.the use of the phrase continued status indicates congress intent that b operate to determine if a previously qualified ema continues to qualify for ema status in the next fiscal year.there is no question that nassau suffolk qualified as an ema for fy.thus,b could operate by determining its continued status for fy.dhhs maintains and the district court found,however,that b is simply inapplicable to previously qualified emas and only applies to metropolitan areas that have qualified as emas under the act.we now turn to this argument.
the act sunset provision persuades us that the solely prospective application of b is unlikely to have been what congress intended 
section a of the act sets the requirements for initially determining a metropolitan area eligibility for ema status.simply stated,it provides that if a metropolitan area has more than aids cases reported to the cdc in the most recent period for which data are available,that area qualifies as an ema for the fiscal year.see a.as noted earlier,however,b allows a qualified metropolitan area to continue its ema status until it fails both of two requirements for three consecutive fiscal years subsection a requirement of having more than aids cases reported,and the requirement that the area cumulatively have at least living aids cases as of december of the most recent calendar year for which data are available.id.b.
there is no question that,for fy,nassau suffolk can not meet the requirements of a because it had only reported cases in the applicable period.but b may nevertheless operate to continue nassau suffolk ema status because nassau suffolk has not failed to meet the second requirement of b for three consecutive fiscal years.the dispositive question is does b apply to metropolitan areas like nassau suffolk that qualified as emas for fy under the amendments but that can not qualify under the act initial eligibility provision as stated in a dhhs maintains that the answer is no.we disagree.
dhhs argues that b is inapplicable to emas that qualified prior to the act because congress intended that provision to apply only prospectively.acc
