middleton motors,a struggling ford dealership near madison,wisconsin,sought managerial and financial assistance from lindquist ford,a successful ford dealership located in bettendorf,iowa.the ensuing negotiations centered on middleton need for management services and a cash infusion from lindquist.the two dealerships generally agreed that craig miller,lindquist general manager,would take over as manager of middleton and that lindquist would be compensated for these services based on middleton profits after miller turned the dealership around.a more specific agreement,however,was not reached.
in the meantime,miller assumed management responsibilities over both dealerships,and the parties continued to discuss the details of the compensation for miller services,the contemplated cash investment by lindquist,and other terms of a possible joint venture.the negotiations ultimately fell apart because lindquist did not come forward with any cash.middleton,still sustaining losses,fired miller without having paid for his services.
lindquist and miller sued middleton for breach of contract,promissory estoppel,quantum meruit,and unjust enrichment,seeking recovery for the eleven months of management services miller provided middleton.the district court granted summary judgment for middleton on the first two claims,and the latter two claims proceeded to trial.the court excluded a large amount of background evidence,believing that the only issues for trial were whether middleton could overcome a presumption that compensation was owed and the amount of damages.after a bench trial,the court entered judgment for lindquist under both quantum meruit and unjust enrichment damages were awarded based on the court determination of the market rate of compensation for general managers or consultants in the field.middleton appeals.
we reverse.quantum meruit and unjust enrichment are both theories,but the two claims have different elements and damages measures under wisconsin law.the district court got off on the wrong foot by misconstruing these causes of action.this was understandable given some confusing phraseology in wisconsin caselaw,but as a result of its misstep,the court failed to try the key issues,erroneously excluded relevant evidence,and failed to weigh the particular equities at stake in the commercial circumstances of this case.accordingly,we remand for retrial.
background 
a.a failed business relationship 
middleton motors,is a ford dealership located in middleton,wisconsin,and owned and operated by brothers robert,dave,and dan hudson.in the months leading up to the events at issue in this suit,middleton was experiencing heavy financial losses,and the brothers disagreed about how to best manage the dealership.for assistance middleton looked to lindquist ford,a ford dealership located in bettendorf,iowa.in and early,dave hudson and craig miller,lindquist general manager,spoke generally about the possibility of lindquist becoming involved in middleton operations and ownership.meanwhile,middleton situation worsened.in march dave hudson told miller that he and robert had placed dan on a leave of absence,that middleton continued to sustain losses,and that middleton needed lindquist help.before entering into more serious negotiations,the parties signed a confidentiality agreement drafted by lindquist.it included the following relevant provisions 
in connection with the interest of lindquist,in exploring the possible acquisition the transaction of all or a portion of the business the business owned by you,we are requesting that you or your representatives furnish certain information relating to the business 
we acknowledge and agree that unless and until a written definitive agreement concerning the transaction has been executed neither you,any of your representatives,us nor any of our representatives,will have any liability to the other with respect to the transaction,whether by virtue of this agreement of sic any other written or oral expression with respect to the transaction otherwise.
on april,the two dealerships met to hammer out a deal.middleton sought miller services as a general manager and a cash infusion from lindquist in exchange for a agreement.a general understanding was reached that miller would take over as general manager of middleton and lindquist would be paid for these services on a basis,but the specifics of an agreement were not resolved at this meeting.nevertheless,the parties agreed that miller would begin working at middleton on april,and they would negotiate further terms and commit the agreement to writing sometime later.on april miller started working as general manager of middleton while maintaining the same position with lindquist.
the next attempt at a written agreement came in a june fax from miller to middleton.this proposal specified that t he only compensation to lindquist will be the fee,the use of one vehicle,and the reimbursement of travel,meals and lodging costs.the fee was defined as of middleton profits payment was to begin the first month that middleton showed a net profit.on july,middleton accountant sent an email to lindquist accountant explaining that he middleton accountant had met with miller and rejected the june proposal because it did not require lindquist to make an cash investment in middleton.the email also asserted that lindquist understood from the april meeting that its compensation for miller services would come only from middleton profits once the dealership was in the black.
on august middleton accountant circulated a letter of understanding for the relationship among the parties to be legally formalized at a later point.the letter stated that the parties have agreed to enter into an agreement whereby lindquist would provide a cash infusion into middleton and take over management of the operations for the fees discussed below.those fees included,first,of profits for recovery of expenses and time associated with the assistance provided by lindquist and,second,of the remaining real income to be paid for management of the operations.the letter of understanding reiterated that payment would begin the first month that middleton reported a net profit.the letter also called for lindquist to invest in exchange for a equity stake in middleton.
over the next several months,the parties continued to negotiate but never came to terms on the specifics of an agreement lindquist never made a cash investment in middleton.on march,fed up and still sustaining losses,middleton fired miller.on may,miller sent a letter to middleton demanding payment for his services.despite middleton persistent losses,miller asked for as final payment for the calendar year,of adjusted profits per the letter of understanding for,and an additional of adjusted profits for.middleton rejected miller demand,saying it owed nothing because miller never turned the dealership profitable.
lindquist files suit middleton moves for summary judgment 
lindquist commenced this action in iowa state court seeking recovery for miller services.middleton removed the case to federal court,and the parties agreed to transfer venue to the western district of wisconsin.lindquist filed an amended complaint asserting claims for breach of contract,promissory estoppel,quantum meruit,and unjust enrichment.middleton moved for summary judgment on all counts.the district court granted summary judgment for middleton on the and not challenged on this appeal.
proceeding to the claim,the judge framed t he ultimate inquiry as whether the parties came to a mutual agreement by their words,conduct or course of dealing,as shown by the parties external expressions of intention.citing theuerkauf sutton,the judge said that lindquist must show that defendant requested plaintiffs to perform services plaintiffs complied with the request and the services were valuable to defendant.if lindquist made these showings,the court continued,it was entitled to a rebuttable presumption that the parties had agreed to payment.the court then denied summary judgment on this claim,reasoning that a reasonable fact finder could conclude that all three elements were satisfied.
middleton had argued that because the parties expected compensation to be based on profits and there were no profits,lindquist could not recover.the judge rejected this argument,concluding that the parties expectations became irrelevant once the claim was dismissed.the court also denied summary judgment on the claim,holding that there were material facts for trial on the value of miller services and the equities of permitting middleton to retain the benefit of his services without paying for them.
lindquist and claims then proceeded to a bench trial.before opening statements,lindquist made two motions in limine relevant to this appeal.first,it asked the district court to exclude as irrelevant any evidence of the parties understandings and expectations that lindquist would be paid for miller services based on profits alone.picking up on an aspect of the district court ruling,lindquist argued that this evidence was immaterial because the claim had been dismissed.lindquist counsel maintained that the elements of the quantummeruit claim are that the plaintiffs requested the services and that the services were rendered,and because those elements were essentially undisputed,all we need to prove is the reasonable value of the services.second,lindquist asked the court to exclude large portions of the proposed expert testimony of middleton accountant,including his conclusion that lindquist decision not to come through with the contemplated investment in middleton had increased middleton risk.
the district court granted the motions in limine.the judge emphasized that the scope of the trial was limited 
w e going to try the question whether there was any benefit received by defendant for miller services while he was there.there is the single question that is at issue,was middleton motors enriched by miller services,or as it feared,if the agreement did go through,did miller run it into the ground 
so what we going to be deciding today is was middleton motors enriched did it receive a benefit from miller services.if it did,it does owe lindquist for any money for those services.if it was enriched,it does owe for whatever benefit it received.
the district court reiterated this understanding of the issues for trial later in the pretrial hearing we not looking at the terms of the contract that was never entered into to determine what the value of the services were and how they would be calculated.
the bench trial that followed thus focused narrowly on whether miller conferred a benefit on middleton and if so,what it was worth.in an oral ruling,the district court concluded that miller services benefited middleton and entered judgment in lindquist favor.the court awarded damages of based on a determination that this represented the going rate for general managers of auto dealerships in the relevant market and alternatively,that miller would have charged a similar amount had he been hired as a consultant.the judge did not mention the claim in her oral ruling.
the court later amended the judgment by written order.recapping the pretrial and trial proceedings,the judge said that when summary judgment on the claim was denied,the court had determined that lindquist had established all three elements set forth in theuerkauf,at.thus,the judge continued,lindquist was entitled to a rebuttable presumption that the parties intended fair payment.this left the possibility that at trial,defendant could avoid liability by coming forward with evidence sufficient to rebut and overcome the presumption of the existence of an implied contract in fact.quoting theuerkauf,at.the judge noted that middleton had not rebutted the presumption at trial,and therefore lindquist was entitled to recover on the claim.the court then slightly adjusted its prior damages calculation to down from,plus costs.
in the order amending the judgment,the court also held that middleton would be unjustly enriched if it did not pay for miller services.the court determined that the damages on this claim were identical to the damages on the claim because that is what a general manager services were worth in the marketplace and defendant failed to prove that it received less value from miller than what a manager is worth in the marketplace.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
middleton challenges the district court handling of almost every aspect of this case.it argues that it was entitled to summary judgment on the and claims the district court erroneously excluded large amounts of relevant evidence at trial the district court erred in granting judgment for lindquist on both claims and the district court erred in calculating damages.we review the denial of summary judgment de novo.guzman sheahan,cir.because the district court granted judgment following a bench trial,we review the district court legal conclusions de novo,its factual findings for clear error,and its decision to grant an equitable remedy for abuse of discretion.see marseilles hydro power,llc marseilles land water,cir legal and factual conclusions eeoc laborers int l union of,local,cir equitable determinations.
confidentiality agreement 
we first address one of middleton central,but weak,liability arguments.middleton claims that the confidentiality agreement precludes liability altogether and that the district court erred by disregarding it.according to middleton,the parties drafted the confidentiality agreement to be as inclusive as possible,and they explicitly agreed that neither party would be liable to the other in the absence of a written definitive agreement.because there was no written agreement,middleton contends it is not liable for miller services.we review de novo the interpretation of an unambiguous contract.estate of sustache am.family mut.ins.
like the district court,we conclude that the language of the confidentiality agreement does not support middleton interpretation.the agreement is not as broad as middleton suggests.the provision only bars liability with respect to the transaction.emphasis added.the contract,in turn,defines transaction as the explor ation of the possible acquisition of all or a portion of middleton.hiring miller as a general manager lies outside the transaction as defined in the agreement.furthermore,the confidentiality agreement only bars liability based on this agreement o r any other written or oral expression with respect to the transaction otherwise.emphasis added.it does not preclude liability based on the provision of services,especially those that stem from a later agreement.
quantum meruit and unjust enrichment under wisconsin law 
with that preliminary question resolved,we come to the heart of this appeal,which requires a close analysis of quantum meruit,unjust enrichment,and the difference between and contracts under wisconsin law.we note for starters that wisconsin caselaw in this area can be confusing the nomenclature and elements of proof are sometimes mixed up,leading to misconceptions about the nature and requirements of these discrete causes of action this has produced considerable confusion in this case.we think it helpful,therefore,to restate some first principles.
generally speaking,if the parties have made an enforceable contract and there is no ground for rescission,then principles will govern the dispute.in the absence of an enforceable contract,however,a plaintiff may turn to theories of relief.watts watts,arjay inv.kohlmetz.unjust enrichment and quantum meruit are two such actions.though related in theory and residing in the domain of contract law under the heading of,each of these claims has its own distinct elements of proof and measure of damages.ramsey ellis,q uantum meruit is a distinct cause of action from an action for unjust enrichment,with distinct elements and a distinct measure of damages.
unjust enrichment 
in wisconsin unjust enrichment is a legal cause of action governed by equitable principles.the action is grounded on the moral principle that one who has received a benefit has a duty to make restitution where retaining such a benefit would be unjust.watts,at.to prevail on an claim,a plaintiff must prove three elements a benefit conferred upon the defendant by the plaintiff,appreciation by the defendant of the fact of such benefit,and acceptance and retention by the defendant of the benefit,under circumstances such that it would be inequitable to retain the benefit without payment of the value thereof.seegers sprague,internal quotation marks omitted accord ramsey,at.
the measure of damages under unjust enrichment is limited to the value of the benefit conferred on the defendant any costs the plaintiff may have incurred are generally irrelevant.mgmt.computer,hawkins.the value of the benefit may be calculated based on the prevailing price of plaintiff services as long as those services benefited the defendant.see,shulse city of mayville,in ordinary cases,particularly those involving money and service,the amount of the plaintiff recovery is the amount of money advanced or the reasonable value of the services rendered but,if the service is rendered upon some project which is of no value or benefit to the city or the city only partially benefits,the city is liable only to the extent of the benefits received.
quantum meruit 
like unjust enrichment,quantum meruit is a legal cause of action grounded in equitable principles.tri state home improvement mansavage.unlike under unjust enrichment,however,a plaintiff can recover under quantum meruit even if he confers no benefit on the defendant.see,barnes lozoff,allowing recovery for architect who created blueprints that were valueless to the defendant because defendant did not own some of the land at issue in the blueprints.under quantum meruit,damages are measured by the reasonable value of the plaintiff services,ramsey,at,and calculated at the customary rate of pay for such work in the community at the time the work was performed.mead ringling.
to take advantage of the more liberal recovery rule of quantum meruit,a plaintiff must prove two elements,both relating to the parties course of conduct.as explained by the wisconsin supreme court in ramsey,to recover under quantum meruit,the plaintiff must prove that the defendant requested the plaintiff services and the plaintiff expected reasonable compensation for the services.at.
ramsey second element is potentially problematic as phrased.we have not found any wisconsin case denying recovery under quantum meruit because the plaintiff expected unreasonable compensation.this makes sense.suppose a defendant asks a plaintiff to paint his house and the plaintiff complies,expecting compensation.suppose further that the plaintiff expected an unreasonable rate of,when the house is small and the painting services are worth far less.that the plaintiff subjectively expected unreasonable compensation rather than reasonable compensation should not necessarily defeat recovery under quantum meruit,properly understood.rather,the outcome in this hypothetical case should be an award of damages for the plaintiff,albeit it at a lower rate based on the community standard.we suspect what the ramsey court meant was that the plaintiff must reasonably expect compensation,not that he must expect reasonable compensation.see richard lord,williston on contracts,at ed hereinafter williston the courts have generally allowed recovery for services rendered when a party confers a benefit with a reasonable expectation of payment.
furthermore,we must not lose sight of the fact that quantum meruit is rooted in equity.if equity does not lie with the plaintiff,he will not recover under quantum meruit.as the leading contracts treatise puts it 
although the remedy of quantum meruit was developed as part of the common law of contracts to avoid unjust enrichment under a contract implied by law,equitable considerations influence the determination of whether recovery is warranted in a given case.the duty to pay arises not from the intent of the parties but from the law of natural justice and equity.
williston,at footnote omitted see also seegers,at respondent desire to call their action quantum meruit does not avoid the clear decisional law that regards unjust enrichment as an element necessary for recovery in these circumstances.there are at least two ways to conceptualize the equity underpinnings of quantum meruit.one is to treat equity as another element of liability,as some states have.see,amend,t he essential elements of quantum meruit are the performance of valuable services accepted by the recipient or at his request the failure to compensate the provider would be unjust and the provider expected compensation at the time services were rendered.another is to treat equity as absorbed under ramsey slightly tweaked requirement that a plaintiff must reasonably expect compensation if equity does not lie on the plaintiff side under the circumstances,his expectation of compensation is necessarily unreasonable.under either approach,the result is the same.
several of wisconsin cases involve women who provided household services to unrelated decedents and then sued their estates after the decedents deaths,brooks steffes in re estate of steffes,gename benson,schroeder estate of voss in re estate of voss.in these cases,the guiding equitable principle is apparent if the plaintiff expected to provide these services gratuitously,she should not recover if she expected to provide them for a fee,she should recover 
based on this line of cases,lindquist suggests that there is recovery in quantum meruit under wisconsin law whenever a plaintiff does not render the services gratuitiously.we think this argument goes too far.in the cited cases,the courts considered the underlying domestic factual setting.in that context,under ordinary circumstances,it is reasonable to believe that the plaintiffs either expected to be paid or did not expect to be paid the services are either gratuitous or not,and there is little room for a middle ground.this generalization does not necessarily apply across the board or so easily translate to the commercial sphere where the negotiations of sophisticated parties focus on contingencies and other complex considerations.
an example highlights our concern about extending the gratuitous factor outside the domestic context in which it usually appears.imagine that a client asks a lawyer to represent her in litigation.the lawyer agrees to accept the case on a basis but demands of the verdict.the client accepts the arrangement but balks at the figure.they battle back and forth without agreeing on percentage.the two decide nevertheless that the lawyer will represent the client.the case goes to trial,and the client loses.
under lindquist theory of quantum meruit,because the legal services were not performed gratuitously,the lawyer prevails in a action against the client.the inequity of this result is readily apparent.payments are well established in legal practice,and under any conceivable understanding,the lawyer would have recovered nothing when his client lost.in the language of quantum meruit,the lawyer reasonably expected compensation,but only if he won the case he did not expect his expectation of compensation was he lost.now suppose the lawyer had won the case and he seeks to collect under quantum meruit.the court equitably supplies a price term,looking to the parties negotiations,the percentage other lawyers collect in the community for similar work,the prevailing ethical standards in the profession,and the like.tonn reuter,providing payment to lawyer with contract who is discharged without cause prior to occurrence of contingency.
in this example,if courts were to pay a lawyer under quantum meruit when he wins and when he loses,the lawyer will be grossly overcompensated.he is better off,or as well off,in either state of the world because he did not enter into the contract.this result in effect requires the client,perhaps too poor to have paid the lawyer by the hour,to supply insurance against a risk the two parties appreciated when they formed their relationship.furthermore,such a result twists incentives.ex ante the lawyer now prefers not to contract and is more indifferent to his client success,undermining a key rationale for contingency for a lawyer,as in this hypothetical,or a general manager,as in our case.the only fair and administrable rule is to let the lawyer take the
