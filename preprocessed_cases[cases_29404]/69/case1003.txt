background 
we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.united states selwyn,cir.
denise hite began working for vermeer on december,as a drill operator and progressed to cnc lathe machine operator in may.prior to joining vermeer,hite had been diagnosed with major depressive disorder by her physician,nancy vander broek.major depressive episodes hampered hite work ability.beginning in january,hite exercised her rights to take leave under the fmla to address the severe depression bouts which recurred periodically in and.
when hite needed to use fmla leave,she would contact her supervisor directly or leave a message for him prior to the start of her shift.in addition,hite would notify pam montegna,vermeer fmla coordinator.hite would then fill out a disability application with vander broek to give to montegna.vander broek would also certify when hite could return to work.
in february,vander broek recommended intermittent fmla leave for hite because of the sporadic nature of her illness.intermittent leave enabled hite to use fmla leave for periods of time less than an entire shift.hite used this intermittent fmla leave when she arrived at work or minutes late or wanted to leave work early due to her condition.
hite difficulty exercising fmla leave began when rick leedom became hite supervisor.from the beginning of his supervision,leedom reacted negatively to hite use of fmla leave.when hite missed work,leedom would question whether she was really sick under the fmla guidelines.leedom would call hite into his office and tell her he could see anything wrong with her and therefore she needed to be at work.he also said that because of her absences,her production levels would be called into question.in addition,leedom commented to his assistant that fmla was bad for the company and complained regularly to martin van wyk,vermeer human resources manager,and montegna about hite use of fmla leave.
leedom also routinely transferred hite to different machines upon her return from leave.the machines were of a lower classification than the cnc lathe machine and were more difficult for hite to operate.leedom informed hite that he was transferring her because the cnc lathe was a critical machine that needed to be run every day,every shift,hours a day and because of her fmla leave.when hite would complain to van wyk about leedom moving her,she would eventually be returned to the cnc lathe machine however,leedom continued to transfer her to different machines.her pay was never adversely affected by the transfers.
during employee evaluations on december,leedom informed hite that he would permanently remove her from the cnc lathe machine if she continued to use fmla leave.the evaluation noted that hite had seven unexcused absences,which were days that hite used her fmla leave.leedom told hite that if she continued to use fmla leave,her job at vermeer would be in jeopardy.
during january,hite used her vacation time because she was ill and wanted to receive pay.vermeer policy required the employee to call in and request a vacation day.the employee received the vacation day the same day she requested it.pursuant to the policy,hite called in on three consecutive days asking for vacation time.on the fourth day,however,leedom called back and left a voice message on hite answering machine,stating that her vacation time was denied and that she must report to work the next day or she would lose her job.leedom told hite that for the rest of,she had to give a notice to use her vacation days.hite requested vacation leave the day her grandfather died but was denied because of the notice leedom imposed.also leedom disciplined hite for every sick day that was not covered by fmla,vacation time,or personal time,something that was solely at leedom discretion and for which he did not punish other employees.
hite frequently complained to van wyk and montegna about leedom reaction to her use of fmla leave.leedom treated hite differently than other employees by citing her for minor rule violations not commonly used with other workers.after one such citation,hite met with leedom and van wyk regarding the disciplinary action.hite refused to sign the disciplinary form.after the meeting,hite had an anxiety attack and went to the fmla office to meet with montegna.hite told montegna that leedom and van wyk were making it impossible for her to be at work and were harassing her about using fmla leave.she expressed her fear that she would lose her job because of her complaints,as well as her use of fmla leave.montegna told hite she would talk to van wyk about hite concerns.after that meeting,hite went to see vander broek and took two weeks fmla leave.
when hite returned to work,she had another meeting with montegna and van wyk.prior to the meeting,leedom requested that van wyk remove hite from the cnc lathe machine because of her absences and their effect on productivity.during the meeting,montegna,van wyk,and hite decided that if hite would agree to move to a different job,all harassment and retaliation by rick leedom against hite for her disability would be stopped.while the new machine hite operated was more difficult for her to operate and was physically too demanding for her,she worked at the machine until her termination.
after hite transfer,becky nichols,a contract nurse hired by vermeer,frequently contacted vander broek seeking clarification of hite use of fmla leave hite never gave anyone at vermeer permission to contact vander broek seeking information about her use of fmla leave.
hite last use of fmla leave was on june.about two months later,hite requested and received permission from leedom to place a cell phone call on company property on the same day,leedom informed human resources manager cornelis van walbeek and,according to van walbeek testimony,recommended to van walbeek that he terminate hite.subsequently,van walbeek summarized hite disciplinary history,taking into account hite entire disciplinary history contrary to company practice of only considering one year.van walbeek review of hite attendance records familiarized him with hite fmla usage.
van walbeek,leedom,and hite met on august.at the meeting,hite was informed that she was being terminated for using her cell phone outside the plant and away from her machine during company time.when hite tried to explain to van walbeek that leedom gave her permission to use her cell phone prior to making the call,van walbeek responded that he did not care.in addition to the alleged cell phone policy violation,van walbeek considered additional disciplinary actions in determining to terminate hite employment.as of august,hite had received written warnings and received coaching and counseling c c regarding attendance,safety,and conduct on eleven occasions.only four of the eleven disciplinary actions occurred within a year of her termination date.
hite filed suit against vermeer and rick leedom,alleging retaliation under the fmla.at trial,hite presented the testimony of ruth johnson and stacy wharton,former vermeer employees,about vermeer retaliatory practices.johnson testified that after she began taking fmla leave for her anxiety disorder,she began having disciplinary problems at vermeer.montegna told johnson to get her act together or she would lose her job.johnson testified that she was ultimately terminated as a result of the fmla absences.similarly,wharton testified that she experienced adverse employment actions after using fmla leave.wharton also testified that her father,a supervisor at vermeer,told her that hite had been targeted for termination because of her fmla absences.
the jury returned a verdict in favor of hite,awarding her back pay in the amount of.the district court subsequently awarded hite in front pay,liquidated damages in an amount equal to that awarded by the jury for back pay,and attorney fees and costs of.vermeer and leedom filed motions for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial and to amend or alter the judgment.the district court denied their motions.
ii.discussion 
vermeer and leedom raise three arguments on appeal that the district court erred in finding that there was sufficient evidence of fmla retaliation that the district court erred in finding there was sufficient evidence to support the award of liquidated damages plus interest and that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to amend the judgment to reduce the back pay award.
fmla retaliation claim 
vermeer and leedom first argue that the district court should have granted their motion for judgment as a matter of law because insufficient evidence supports a finding of a causal link between vermeer termination of hite and her use of fmla leave,or,in the alternative,insufficient evidence exists to support a finding of pretext.we review a district court denial of judgment as a matter of law de novo.kipp.highway transp.comm n,cir.we review a court denial of a motion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion.adzick unum life ins.of,cir.
under the fmla,eligible employees are entitled to take leave from work for certain family or medical reasons,including a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee.cooper olin,winchester,cir quoting a reynolds phillips temro,cir.the fmla provides eligible employees up to workweeks of unpaid leave during any period.darby bratch,cir citing.it prohibits employers from discriminating or retaliating against an employee for asserting her rights under the act.id.citing a.therefore,an employer may not consider an employee use of fmla leave as a negative factor in an employment action.id.basing an adverse employment action on an employee use of leave,or in other words,retaliation for exercise of leave act rights,is therefore actionable.smith allen health,cir.
an employee can prove retaliation through circumstantial evidence,using the mcdonnell douglas analysis.id.citing mcdonnell douglas green,d.first,the employee must establish a prima facie case of retaliatory discrimination by showing that she exercised rights afforded by the act,that she suffered an adverse employment action,and that there was a causal connection between her exercise of rights and the adverse employment action.id.second,once the employee establishes a prima facie case,the burden shifts to the employer to article a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its actions.id.at.finally,the burden shifts back to the employee to demonstrate that the employer proffered reason is pretextual.id.the employee must present evidence that creates a question of fact regarding whether the defendant reason was pretextual and creates a reasonable inference that the defendant acted in retaliation.id.
we recognize that w hen the parties have developed a full trial record,we are not concerned with plaintiff prima facie case.eeoc kohler,cir.instead,once the jury makes a finding of retaliation and that judgment is being considered on appeal,the mcdonnell douglas presumptions fade away,and the appellate court should simply study the record with a view to determining whether the evidence is sufficient to support whatever finding was made at trial.id.at internal quotations and citation omitted.we must affirm the jury verdict unless,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,we conclude that a reasonable jury could not have found for that party.id.at internal quotations and citation omitted.we do not lightly set aside a jury verdict.id.
thus,the principal issue before us is whether hite produced sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable jury to find that vermeer retaliated against her.id.at.
vermeer questions whether hite sufficiently established causation.we evaluate the evidence in light of all the evidence in the record.id.at.to establish a causal link between the employee exercise of fmla rights and her termination,the employee must prove that an employer retaliatory motive played a part in the adverse employment action.kipp,at quoting sumner united states postal,cir.e vidence that gives rise to an inference of a retaliatory motive on the part of the employer is sufficient to establish a causal link.id.quoting rath selection research,cir couty dole,cir.
an employee can establish a causal link between her protected activity and the adverse employment action through the timing of the two events.eliserio united steelworkers of,cir.a pattern of adverse actions that occur just after protected activity can supply the extra quantum of evidence to satisfy the causation requirement.smith,at.the mere coincidence of timing,however,is rarely sufficient to establish the causation element.haas kelly,cir.cases in which we have determined that temporal proximity alone was sufficient to create an inference of the causal link have uniformly held that the temporal proximity must be very close.wallace sparks health,cir.
even if temporal proximity alone is insufficient to establish causation,the employee may attempt to prove causation by providing evidence of the employer discriminatory comments.see watson,cir finding a causal connection between the employee protected activity and the adverse employment action where one supervisor said that he was not going to let a nigger manage my bitches,while another supervisor commented that the employee would never excel in the agency because he assisted in a employment discrimination case against the supervisor.furthermore,where an ultimate decisionmaker relies on the discriminatory comments of another employee or supervisor in deciding to terminate the employee,the employee may be able to establish a causal connection.see fast southern union,cir.
an employee may attempt to shorten the gap between her protected activity and the adverse action by showing that shortly after she engaged in the protected activity,the employer took escalating adverse and retaliatory action against her.kasper federated mut.ins,cir.when the employee presents such background information,we may consider it as evidence of discrimination.henderson ford motor,cir see also bassett city of minneapolis,cir holding that excessive pattern of protected activity followed by disciplinary measures established causation kim nash finch,cir declining to decide whether each act in itself constituted actionable adverse employment action because the employee essentially claimed that the employer had systematically retaliated against him,that is,that all the acts were taken in response to his filing the employment discrimination charge and were thus connected to one another.
we find that sufficient evidence supports the jury finding of a causal link between vermeer termination of hite and her use of fmla leave.while hite last used her fmla leave two months before her termination,she presented additional evidence other than temporal proximity to establish the causation element.
first,as in watson,leedom made comments to hite in which he specifically told her she would lose her job if she continued to use fmla leave.furthermore,van walbeek,the ultimate decisionmaker,testified that leedom recommended hite termination and that while he could recall whether he and leedom discussed hite use of fmla leave,he was aware of all the fmla time hite had used when he terminated her.based on van walbeek testimony,the jury could infer that van walbeek did rely,at least in part,on hite fmla usage in terminating her.
second,hite presented evidence that vermeer and leedom took escalating retaliatory action against her for using fmla leave.each time hite returned from fmla leave,leedom questioned her about whether she really was sick under the fmla guidelines and spoke negatively of her use of fmla leave.leedom moved hite to different machines,telling her he was doing so becau
