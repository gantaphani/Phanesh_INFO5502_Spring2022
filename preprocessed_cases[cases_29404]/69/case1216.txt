plaintiffs in this case are northwest environmental advocates,san francisco baykeeper,and the ocean conservancy.are the states of illinois,michigan,minnesota,new york,pennsylvania,and wisconsin.plaintiffs and challenge a regulation originally promulgated by the environmental protection agency epa in exempting certain marine discharges from the permitting scheme of sections a and of the clean water act cwa.that regulation,a,provides that the following vessel discharges into the navigable waters of the united states do not require permits discharge of effluent from properly functioning marine engines discharge of laundry,shower,and galley sink wastes from vessels and any other discharge incidental to the normal operation of a vessel,including the discharge of ballast water.
the district court concluded that the epa had exceeded its authority under the cwa in exempting these discharges from permitting requirements.the district court vacated a,effective september.we affirm the decision of the district court.
background 
a.the cwa and a 
in,congress enacted sweeping amendments to the federal water pollution control act of.after another round of substantial amendments in,the statute became known as the clean water act.the cwa declares a national goal that the discharge of pollutants into the navigable waters be eliminated by.a.
section a of the cwa provides that,subject to certain exceptions,the discharge of any pollutant by any person shall be unlawful.id.a.one of these exceptions is for discharges authorized by a permit granted pursuant to the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes,a system set forth in section of the act.id.a.the combined effect of sections a and is that t he cwa prohibits the discharge of any pollutant from a point source into navigable waters of the united states without an npdes permit.plains res.council fid.exploration dev,cir.the epa administers the npdes.d.
obtaining a permit under the cwa need not be an onerous process.for example,in appropriate circumstances a discharge may be allowed under a general permit requiring only that the discharger submit a notice of intent to make the discharge.as we explained in natural resources defense council epa,cir 
npdes permits come in two varieties individual and general.an individual permit authorizes a specific entity to discharge a pollutant in a specific place and is issued after an informal agency adjudication process.see.general permits,on the other hand,are issued for an entire class of hypothetical dischargers in a given geographical region and are issued pursuant to administrative rulemaking procedures.see id,a.general permits may appropriately be issued when the dischargers in the geographical area to be covered by the permit are relatively homogenous.see id.a.after a general permit has been issued,an entity that believes it is covered by the general permit submits a notice of intent to discharge pursuant to the general permit.id.b.a general permit can allow discharging to commence upon receipt of the notice of intent,after a waiting period,or after the permit issuer sends out a response agreeing that the discharger is covered by the general permit.id.b iv.
in,the epa exempted by regulation several categories of vessel discharges from npdes permitting requirements under the cwa.see npdes,may.the regulation provides that t he following discharges do not require npdes permits 
any discharge of sewage from vessels,effluent from properly functioning marine engines,laundry,shower,and galley sink wastes,or any other discharge incidental to the normal operation of a vessel.this exclusion does not apply to rubbish,trash,garbage,or other such materials discharged overboard nor to other discharges when the vessel is operating in a capacity other than as a means of transportation.
a.the cwa expressly exempts sewage discharges from vessels from the permitting process and regulates these discharges by other means.see a.because a does not itself exempt sewage discharges but instead merely recognizes the statute exemption of sewage discharges,the sewage clause in a is not subject to the ultra vires claim made here.see also chevron,hammond,cir contrasting the express statutory exemption of sewage with regulation relating to deballasting by ships.therefore,three categories of discharges exempted by a are at issue in this case marine engine discharges graywater discharges laundry,shower,and galley sink wastes and any other discharge incidental to the normal operation of a vessel.
the first proposed draft of the regulation would have excluded only marine engine discharges.see npdes,c proposed.the epa subsequently added the exclusions for graywater and other discharges incidental to normal vessel operations.when promulgating the final regulation in may,the epa explained its anticipated effect most discharges from vessels to inland waters are now clearly excluded from the permit requirements.at,b ii.the epa stated that t his type of discharge generally causes little pollution.id.the epa stated,further,that the exclusion of vessel wastes from the permit requirements will reduce administrative costs drastically.id.decades later,an epa administrator declared that in 
w e were faced with many,many other much higher priority situations such as raw sewage being discharged,municipal plants having to be built,very large paper mills or steel mills and the like discharging.at the time we thought that was not an important area to deal with vessels were not important to the overall scheme of things at that time.
craig vogt,epa,epa pub.meeting,ocean discharge criteria.the epa amended the regulation in in minor respects that do not affect our analysis.see npdes,revision of regulations,june,see also npdes,revision of existing regulations,i c,describing the proposed changes.
the text of the cwa does not exempt from npdes requirements marine engine discharges,graywater discharges,or other discharges incidental to the normal operation of vessels.however,the epa contended in,and continues to contend,that it has the power to provide these exemptions by regulation.the administrator of the epa prefaced the draft january regulation with a statement that a discharger could discharge lawfully only if the discharger possesses a valid permit or is excluded from coverage by law or regulation.npdes.at emphasis added.the final rules similarly stated that a ll discharges of pollutants are unlawful,unless the discharger has a permit or is specifically relieved by law or regulation from the obligation of obtaining a permit.npdes.at,a emphasis added.
the first category exempted by a,marine engine discharges,includes unburned fuel and various kinds of oil.the second category,graywater discharges,can include pathogens such as fecal coliform,enterococci,and coli and pollutants such as ammonia,arsenic,copper,lead,nickel,and zinc.see,epa draft cruise ship discharge assessment report,available at ships pdf disch assess.the third category,any other discharge,includes,among other discharges,ballast water from ships.a a i defining this broad other discharge category for purposes of a different cwa section.
plaintiffs have made clear,both here and in the district court,that their primary environmental concern stems from the discharge of ballast water.we quote a passage from the district court order granting plaintiffs motion for permanent injunctive relief that describes the purpose of ballast water and the effects of its discharge 
ballast water is water that is taken on by cargo ships to compensate for changes in the ship weight as cargo is loaded or unloaded,and as fuel and supplies are consumed.ballast water may be used for a number of different purposes,such as maintaining stability,maintaining proper propeller and bow immersion,and to compensate for weights.thus,ballast water is essential to the proper functioning of cargo ships,as well as to the safety of its crew.
because ballast water is primarily used to compensate for changes in cargo,it is generally taken in or pumped out at the ports along a ship route.when a ship takes on ballast water,whether freshwater or saltwater,organisms found in that water are typically taken in as well.these organisms are carried in the ballast tanks of the ship until the ship arrives at its next port,where,due to changes in the distribution of the ship cargo,they may be released into a new ecosystem.due to the size of ballast tanks on modern cargo ships,and the speed with which these ships can reach their destinations,organisms are increasingly able to survive the journey to a new ecosystem.all told,more than marine species each day hitch rides around the globe in the ballast water of cargo ships.a number of these species are released into waters in the more than billion gallons of ballast water released in the united states each year.
if these foreign organisms manage to survive and reproduce in the new ecosystem,they can cause severe problems in the natural and human environment.for example,zebra mussels,native to the caspian sea region of asia,were brought into the great lakes in the ballast water of cargo ships.zebra mussels have clogged the water pipes of electric companies and other industries infestations in the midwest and northeast have cost power plants and industrial facilities almost million between and.as another example,according to a epa report,
a n introduced strain of cholera bacteria,possibly released in the bilge water of a chinese freighter,caused the deaths of people in latin america in.this cholera strain was then imported into the united states from latin america in the ballast tanks of ships that anchored in the port of mobile,alabama.fortunately,cholera bacteria were detected in oyster and finfish samples in mobile bay and no additional deaths occurred from exposure to this pathogen.
with a lack of natural predators,invasive species can multiply rapidly and quickly take over an ecosystem,threatening native species.indeed,invasive species are a major or contributing cause of declines for almost half the endangered species in the united states.once established,invasive species become almost impossible to remove,leading s cientists,industry officials,and land managers to recogniz e that invasive species are one of the most serious,yet least appreciated,environmental threats of the century.
in economic terms,invasive species can also have a devastating effect.the department of agriculture spends millions of dollars per year to detect and prevent invasive species.one study cited by the general accounting office concluded that total annual economic losses and associated control costs are about billion a than double the annual economic damage caused by all natural disasters in the united states.

procedural history 
in january,plaintiffs petitioned the epa,asking that the agency repeal a.see petition for repeal of cfr a petition for rulemaking.plaintiffs contended that the regulation was not authorized by the cwa and was thus ultra vires.plaintiffs sued the epa a year and a half later,alleging unreasonable delay in responding to their petition.the district court ordered the epa to respond to the petition,but the epa obtained a stay from this circuit.under a subsequent consent decree,the epa agreed to grant,deny,or grant in part and deny any remaining part of nwea petition by september.nw.envtl.advocates epa,cir.on the day of the deadline,the epa denied plaintiffs petition in its entirety.see epa,decision on petition for rulemaking to repeal a,epa decision on petition see also availability of decision on petition for rulemaking to repeal regulation related to ballast water,giving notice of the denial.

iii.discussion 
the epa argues that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs suit,and that we therefore have subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal only insofar as necessary to order the district court to dismiss the suit for want of jurisdiction.on the alternative assumption that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction,the epa argues that the statute of limitations bars the ultra vires claim contained in the plaintiffs first cause of action that the district court erred on the merits in finding that the cwa did not authorize the exemptions contained in a and that the district court abused its discretion in choosing its remedy.
subject matter jurisdiction 
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs suit under the general federal question statute,unless some other statute divested the district court of jurisdiction.the only statute that could have had that effect is section b of the cwa.see b.section b specifies seven categories of agency action for which a challenge must be brought as an original proceeding in a court of appeals rather than in a district court.the epa contends that plaintiffs ultra vires challenge to a falls within two of these seven categories.if the epa is right as to either category,the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction,and we must review the epa action by means of plaintiffs petition for review filed directly in this court.
we do not lightly hold that we have jurisdiction under section b.we have counseled against its expansive application.league of wilderness mountains biodiversity project forsgren,cir.the specificity and precision of section,and the sense of it,persuade us that it is designed to exclude epa actions that congress did not specify.longview fibre rasmussen,cir.indeed,n o sensible person would speak with such detail otherwise.id.
we address the two potentially relevant categories of section b in turn,concluding that the agency action falls in neither category.the district court therefore had subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs suit.
section b e 
subsection b e provides for review by a court of appeals of epa actions in approving or promulgating any effluent limitation or other limitation under section,or of this title.see b e referring to sections,and of the cwa.the cwa defines an effluent limitation as any restriction on quantities,rates,and concentrations of chemical,physical,biological,and other constituents which are discharged from point sources see also same,b establishing a procedure for adopting effluent limitations guidelines.
section b e authorizes original court of appeals jurisdiction for challenges to regulations that establish numerical limitations and similar limits.for example,in natural resources defense council epa,nrdc,the circuit exercised jurisdiction under section b e over a challenge to regulations setting forth a complex set of procedures for issuing or denying npdes permits.in upholding its jurisdiction,the circuit characterized the regulations as restrict ing who may take advantage of certain provisions or otherwise guid ing the setting of numerical limitations in permits,and as constituting a limitation on point sources and permit issuers and a restriction on the untrammeled discretion of the industry that existed before passage of the cwa.id.at quoting.power costle,cir.
the regulation in this case can be characterized as approving or promulgating any effluent limitation or other limitation only if those words are understood in a pickwickian sense.the regulations in nrdc.established procedures under which limitations on discharges of effluent would be implemented.unlike the regulations in that case,a provides no limitation whatsoever.
we conclude that section b e does not authorize original jurisdiction in the court of appeals in this case.section a does not involve the approval or promulgation of any effluent limitation or other limitation,but rather creates the categorical and permanent exemptions of three types of discharges from any limit imposed by a permitting requirement.
section b f 
section b f provides for review by a court of appeals of epa actions in issuing or denying any permit under section of this title.see b f referring to section of the cwa.
in crown simpson pulp costle,d,the supreme court held that section b f also covers epa actions functionally similar to the denial of permits.the facts of the case make clear that the court understood functional similarity in a narrow sense.the state of california,which had been delegated permit granting authority under the cwa,proposed granting point source permits to pulp mills discharging pollutants into the ocean.see id.at.if california had not been delegated permit granting authority,the epa would have granted or denied the permits directly.see id.at.the epa vetoed the proposed permits.see id.at.because the epa was not the entity,the plaintiff contended that the epa action was not the issuance or denial of a permit within the meaning of section b f.see id.at.the court concluded instead that the fortuitous circumstance that this case arose in a state with authority should not produce a different jurisdictional result from a case involving a state without such authority.id.at.see also.epa,cir exercising original jurisdiction over denial of a variance pac.legal found.costle,cir exercising original jurisdiction over extension of a permit,rev on other grounds,d.
in american mining congress epa,cir,we exercised jurisdiction under section b f over a challenge to an epa regulation of stormwater discharges from inactive mining operations.the epa concluded that these discharges required permits because they were associated with industrial activity under section p b of the cwa.the challenged regulation therefore required permits for most inactive mines,but,based on temporary permitting delays provided by section p,the regulation exempted reclaimed inactive coal mines from the permit requirement until the expiration of a moratorium.id.the mining congress,representing inactive mines required to obtain permits,challenged the portion of the regulation requiring permits.id.at.the mining congress used the exemption of reclaimed mines to argue that other inactive mines should receive the same favorable treatment.id.at.american mining congress is inapplicable to our case because the mining congress challenged the requirement that certain mines obtain a permit,not an exemption.
we have applied section b f in two cases involving challenges to stormwater regulations where those regulations were based in part on exemptions specified in the text of the cwa.in natural resources defense council epa nrdc cir,cir,we exercised jurisdiction under section b f over a challenge to a complex set of regulations governing discharges from stormwater runoff.see id.at.two statutory provisions formed the basis for the regulations.first,as mentioned above,section p of the cwa,p,established deadlines by which certain storm water dischargers must apply for permits,the epa or states must act on permits and dischargers must implement their permits.nrdc cir,at.this section required that particularly important categories of discharges be regulated quickly,and exempted less important categories of discharges from regulation until.id.at see also envtl.def,epa,cir exercising jurisdiction over challenge to stormwater discharge regulations promulgated under section p.second,cwa section l,l,exempted certain stormwater discharges by mining,oil,and gas facilities from cwa permitting requirements.see nrdc cir,at.the natural resources defense council argued that the epa had extended the deadline for storm sewer discharges beyond the dates authorized by cwa section p that the epa had defined improperly what constituted certain kinds of storm sewer discharges,so that some discharges were exempted from permitting requirements for a longer period than section p allowed and that the epa had erred in defining what constituted stormwater discharges from mining,oil,and gas facilities,improperly expanding the exemption from the permitting requirement contained in section l.nrdc cir,at.
in natural resources defense council epa nrdc cir,cir,we exercised jurisdiction under section b f over a challenge to a regulation exempting certain stormwater discharges from mining,oil,and gas facilities.id.at.two cwa provisions lay behind the regulation.first,section l,mentioned above,exempted discharges from mining,oil,and gas facilities.second,an amendment to the cwa specified that the exemption contained in section l included discharges from construction activities at mining,oil,and gas facilities.see energy policy act of,stat,codifying the amendment to section.the natural resources defense council challenged the regulation as exempting a broader category of discharges than permitted under cwa sections l and.nrdc cir,at.
in both of these cases in which we exercised jurisdiction under section b f,statutory provisions explicitly provided the underlying exemptions.the challenged regulations sought to define more precisely those discharges that came within statutory exemptions and thus did not need permits and those that did not come within statutory exemptions and thus needed permits.in contrast,the case now before us challenges a regulation providing exemptions not contained in section or in any other section of the cwa.this case thus does not involve the issuing or denying of any permit under section.see natural res.def.council train,aff sub nom.natural res.def.council costle.
we conclude by agreeing with the district court analysis in a suit very similar to the one before us.in environmental protection information center pacific lumber,d,the court addressed an epa regulation that permanently exempted an entire class of silvicultural discharges from any npdes permitting requirement.the district court noted that the court of appeals in nrdc.had upheld original jurisdiction under section b on the ground that if there were no such jurisdiction,there would be a perverse situation in which the court will be able to review the grant or denial of the permit,but will be without authority to review directly the regulations on which the permit is based.id.at quoting natural resources defense council,epa nrdc.the district court wrote 
because plaintiff challenges a decision that in effect excludes sources from the npdes program,the circuit courts will never have to confront the issuance or denial of a permit for these sources.the ninth circuit,by virtue of the regulation,will never have to consider on direct review an action involving the denial of an npdes permit for pollutant discharges within the exemption provided by the regulation.thus,a district court taking jurisdiction over a challenge to the silvicultural regulation does not create the same awkwardness for a circuit court as that described in nrdc.
id.at footnote omitted upholding its own jurisdiction under.
we conclude that b f does not authorize original jurisdiction in the court of appeals in this case.section a does not involve the issuance or the denial of a permit or a functionally similar action,but rather the permanent exemptions of three types of discharges from any permitting requirement.
statute of limitations 
the applicable statute of limitations provides that every civil action commenced against the united states shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues.see a.the epa promulgated the final version of a in.the epa denied plaintiffs petition for rulemaking in september.plaintiffs filed suit in december.whether their first cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations depends on whether their right of action first accrued in the when the epa promulgated the regulation or in when the epa denied plaintiffs petition.the epa conceded in the district court and in its brief to this court that the statute of limitations does not bar plaintiffs second cause of action.see nw.envtl.advocates i,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
our decision in wind river mining united states,cir,controls our analysis.in wind river,the bureau of land management blm had classified certain federal lands as wilderness study areas wsas in.mining was forbidden in a wsa.id.at.in and,the wind river mining corporation asked the blm to declare that its decision to create a wsa was invalid.id.the blm denied the request,and the interior board of land appeals denied wind river administrative appeal in.wind river filed suit in alleging that the blm action in creating the wsa was ultra vires.id.at.we held that the statute of limitations began to run with the final administrative action denying wind river request 
a substantive challenge to an agency decision alleging lack of agency authority may be brought within six years of the agency application to the specific challenger the right to bring a civil suit challenging an agency action accrues upon the completion of the administrative proceedings.the blm finally rejected wind river attempts to have wsa declared invalid in wind river complaint for review was filed less than months later,and therefore was timely.

our case is indistinguishable from wind river.plaintiffs asked the epa to repeal a in their petition for rulemaking,and the epa denied that request in.plaintiffs filed suit a few months after that denial,alleging that epa had acted ultra vires in promulgating a.the epa denial of the petition for rulemaking in was thus an adverse application of a within the meaning of wind river.see at.the date of that decision is the date of first accrual for purposes of the statute of limitations under a.we therefore conclude that plaintiffs suit was timely filed in the district court.
ultra vires challenge 
in their first cause of action,plaintiffs allege that the cwa does not authorize the exemptions of vessel discharges provided in a.according to plaintiffs,the epa acted ultra vires in promulgating a.see c covering agency actions in excess of statutory jurisdiction,authority,or limitations,or short of statutory right.if plaintiffs are right,the regulation is invalid.in their second cause of action,plaintiffs allege that the epa did not act in accordance with law when the agency denied the petition for rulemaking asking the epa to repeal a.see a.as in their first cause of action,the premise of the second cause of action is that the epa acted ultra vires in promulgating a.because both causes of action present a question of law,we start at step one of chevron and apply the same standard of review.see,defenders of wildlife browner,cir on questions of statutory interpretation,we follow the approach from chevron.
the epa makes three arguments.the first is procedural the second and third are substantive.first,the epa argues that the petition for rulemaking challenged only the exclusion for ballast water provided by a.therefore,the epa argues,plaintiffs are now limited to challenging only this exclusion.second,the epa argues that the cwa authorized the epa to promulgate a,or that at least the statute is ambiguous and therefore this court should defer to the agency interpretation of the statute.third,the epa argues that even if the cwa did not authorize the promulgation of a when the cwa was enacted,congress has now acquiesced in its promulgation.we consider these arguments in turn.
scope of plaintiffs petition for rulemaking 
the epa argues that at most we should vacate a as it applies to ballast water discharges.the agency argues that we should not address the exemptions for marine engine and graywater discharges or discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel other than ballast water because plaintiffs did not object to those exemptions in their petition for rulemaking to the epa.the district court considered and rejected this argument.see,nw.envtl.advocates ii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at plaintiffs have consistently made clear that their overall aim is the repeal of the exemptions contained in a.
we agree with the district court.it is clear that the plaintiffs always have been most concerned with the environmental effects of ballast water discharges,but it is equally clear that they challenged all three exemptions contained in a when they petitioned the epa in.for example,plaintiffs petition for rulemaking was titled petition for repeal of cfr a.in that petition,they challenged the exemption in a of ballast water discharges and other discharges.in responding to plaintiffs petition,the epa stated that its decision addressed a petition for rulemaking to repeal a.the epa denial of plaintiffs petition quoted the full text of a and explicitly noted that plaintiffs sought a repeal of the entire regulation.the record in this case is replete with evidence that the plaintiffs position was clear to the epa.coal.rumsfeld,cir as amended.
text of the cwa 
our first substantive inquiry is whether a is invalid under the plain meaning of the cwa.our inquiry is guided by chevron.the court wrote 
when a court reviews an agency construction of the statute which it administers,it is confronted with two questions.first,always,is the question whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.
section a of the cwa mandates that the discharge of any pollutant by any person shall be unlawful.a.this prohibition is t he cornerstone and fundamental premise of the clean water act.se.alaska conservation council army corps of eng rs,cir citations omitted.section of the cwa provides that a point source can obtain a permit for the discharge of any pollutant or combination of pollutants.a.t he act categorically prohibits any discharge of a pollutant from a point source without a permit.comm.to save mokelumne river bay mun.util,cir.
the text of the statute clearly covers the discharges at issue here.a discharge of any pollutant is any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.a.a point source is any discernable,confined and discrete conveyance,including a vessel or other floating craft,from which pollutants are or may be discharged.id.n avigable waters are the waters of the united states,including the territorial seas,which begin near the coast and extend seaward a distance of three miles.id.pollutant is defined as dredged spoil,solid waste,incinerator residue,sewage,garbage,sewage sludge,munitions,chemical wastes,biological materials,radioactive materials,heat,wrecked or discarded equipment,rock,sand,cellar dirt and industrial,municipal,and agricultural waste discharged into water.the term biological materials includes invasive species.see,wildlife fed consumers power,cir.
the question before us of whether the cwa authorizes the epa regulatory exemptions was answered by the circuit more than thirty years ago.see natural res.def.council costle costle.the same year that the epa issued the regulation in our case,the agency promulgated a different but conceptually identical regulation.costle addressed an ultra vires challenge to that regulation.
the regulation entirely exempted several categories of point sources from npdes requirements 
all silviculture point sources all confined animal feeding operations below a certain size all irrigation return flows from areas less than contiguous acres or noncontiguous acres that use the same drainage system all nonfeedlot,nonirrigation agricultural point sources and separate storm sewers containing only storm runoff uncontaminated by any industrial or commercial activity.
id.at.in a unanimous opinion by judge leventhal,the circuit held that the epa acted ultra vires in promulgating this regulation.id.at.
the analysis of the circuit in costle,with which we agree,is dispositive of our case.the only possible textual source of authority for the exemptions at issue in costle and in our case is section of the cwa.in relevant part,that section provides that the epa administrator 
may,after opportunity for public hearing,issue a permit for the discharge of any pollutant,notwithstanding section a,upon condition that such discharge will meet either a all applicable requirements under sections,and of this act,or b prior to the taking of necessary implementing actions relating to all such requirements,such conditions as the administrator determines are necessary to carry out the provisions of this act.
section uses the word may,but only in the context of issu ing a permit for the discharge of any pollutant.the administrator may issue a permit under two circumstances either on the condition that the discharge meets all of the requirements specified in the section or,prior to implementation of those statutory requirements,on such conditions as the administrator determines are necessary to carry out the provisions of the act.that is,section allows the administrator to issue a permit,but it does not provide that the administrator may entirely exempt certain categories of discharges from the permitting requirement.as the circuit concluded,the use of the word may in means only that the administrator has discretion either to issue a permit or to leave the discharger subject to the total proscription of.this is the natural reading,and the one that retains the fundamental logic of the statute.costle,at.
the circuit confirmed the correctness of its reading of the cwa by consulting the legislative history of the act.it wrote,t he legislative history makes clear that congress intended the npdes permit to be the only means by which a discharger from a point source may escape the total prohibition of a.id.at.because the statutory language is unambiguous,we do not need to revisit the legislative history.congress intent was clear t he epa administrator does not have authority to exempt categories of point sources from the permit requirements of.id.at.
we therefore conclude that congress expressed a plain intent to require permits in any situation of pollution from point sources.id.at see also plains res.council,at sierra club epa,cir nrdc cir,at,forsgren,at.in its argument to us,the epa does not seriously contest this conclusion.rather,the epa central argument is that congress has acquiesced in the epa ultra vires action in promulgating a.we now turn to that argument.
acquiescence by congress 
the epa argues that even if the cwa as originally enacted did not authorize the epa to promulgate a,congress subsequently acquiesced in the agency interpretation of the cwa.this is a heroic argument,for the standard for a judicial finding of congressional acquiescence is extremely high.
in solid waste agency of northern cook county army corps of engineers swancc,d,the court considered a challenge to an expansive definition of navigable waters under the cwa.the army corps of engineers had promulgated a regulation containing that definition in.the corps argued that congress had acquiesced in the regulation definition.id.at.the court responded,although we have recognized congressional acquiescence to administrative interpretations of a statute in some situations,we have done so with extreme care.id.at.the court continued in a footnote 
in bob jones united states,d,for example,we upheld an internal revenue service irs revenue ruling that revoked the status of private schools practicing racial discrimination because the irs interpretation of the relevant statutes was correct because congress had held hearings on this precise issue,making it hardly conceivable that in this setting,any member of not abundantly aware of what was going on and because no fewer than bills introduced to overturn the irs interpretation had failed.absent such overwhelming evidence of acquiescence,we are loath to replace the plain text and original understanding of a statute with an amended agency interpretation.
id.at.emphasis added see also rapanos united states,d plurality op.noting the court skepticism towards reading the tea leaves of congressional inaction gonzales,cir en banc finding no acquiescence under swancc overwhelming evidence standard.
the epa points to a number of statutes in which congress has addressed the forms of pollution exempted by a,particularly ballast water.according to the epa,those statutes satisfy the high standard for acquiescence set forth in swancc.for the reasons that follow,we disagree and hold that congress has not acquiesced in a.
ndaa and dshmra 
the epa relies most heavily on two statutes.the first is the national defense authorization act of ndaa,stat,codified at a,j,n.the second is the deep seabed hard mineral resources act of dshmra,stat,codified at et.
in the ndaa,congress statutorily exempted discharges incidental to the normal operation of united states military vessels from cwa permitting requirements and established discharge controls specifically tailored to those vessels.congress was well aware of a when it enacted the ndaa.indeed,the statute cited the regulation as a partial aid in defining what the category discharge incidental to the normal operation of a vessel did not include.see a b iii.
a senate report accompanying the senate bill explained that discharges from military vessels,like those from other vessels,already were exempted from npdes permitting requirements by epa regulation.but the report went on to explain why,nonetheless,a broader exemption was desirable 
the navy wishes to clarify the regulatory status of certain discharges from navy vessels.vessels are point sources of pollution under the clean water act.any discharge of pollutants from a point source,including a vessel,into the waters of the united states is prohibited unless specifically permitted under section or of the act 
although epa regulations generally exempt nonsewage discharges from vessels from th
