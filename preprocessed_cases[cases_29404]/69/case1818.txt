in this first impression case,we construe the independent wholesale sales representatives contractual relations act of the act to avoid an absurd result,et we resolve this pure question of law to further the express legislative intent to provide unique protection to qualifying sales persons.this case also illustrates the power of the trial court to serve as a gatekeeper by exercising its discretion to grant a new trial to prevent what it perceives as a miscarriage of justice.

appellant evidence 
appellant employment career has always been in the retail or wholesale nursery business.in early he was delivering plants for pacific orchid express and earning about an hour.sheridan shimp,who worked for respondent,told appellant that respondent wanted to hire a new salesman.respondent was a hard goods distributor in the horticultural industry.shimp said that the salesman would receive a percent commission on all sales.she also said that ramon hernandez,one of respondent salesmen,earned about per month.
appellant applied for the job and was interviewed by mahmood and omead jafroodi.mahmood jafroodi was respondent owner and president.omead jafroodi was respondent operations manager.after two interviews the jafroodis said that they would start him on a salary,but he would eventually earn a commission of percent on his sales.they produced a contract that appellant signed.the contract was signed on respondent behalf by the jafroodis and shimp.appellant was not given a copy of the contract.
the second page of the contract provided that appellant would receive commission on all sales that are at or above gross profit margin,unless otherwise and specifically agreed upon.the contract mentioned nothing about commission on sales with a gross profit margin of less than percent.
the third page of the contract was entitled first year compensation plan reviewed on a monthly basis and subject to change based on performance.pursuant to the compensation plan,for the first six months appellant would be paid a base salary of per month.thereafter,appellant would be paid per month as a draw against commission.but after the first six months appellant continued to receive the base salary of per month because he allegedly was selling enough to make it on commission.
starting in january,appellant went on straight commissions.instead of receiving a monthly draw of as provided in the contract,he received a monthly draw of.on approximately the day of each month after january,respondent paid appellant commissions earned for the preceding month to the extent that the commissions exceeded the draw.for example,on february,respondent paid appellant because he had allegedly earned commissions of during the preceding january.respondent never provided appellant with any information as to how his monthly commissions had been calculated.
appellant gave conflicting testimony concerning the commission he would be entitled to receive on sales with a gross profit margin of less than percent.on the one hand,appellant testified that it was his understanding from the beginning that,even if the gross profit margin dropped as low as percent,he would still get his full percent commission unless there was a specific agreement authorizing a commission reduction.no such agreement was ever made.based on what shimp and the jafroodis had told him,appellant expected to earn a percent commission on all sales irrespective of the gross profit margin.
on the other hand,appellant testified that he did not expect to receive a full percent commission on sales with a gross profit margin of less than percent.he expected to be paid on these sales,but he never had any set commission rate in mind.appellant believed that his commission should be prorated so that the s ame percentage off of the percent gross margin should be the same percentage off the percent commission.a few months after appellant had started working for respondent,shimp told him that on volume sales with low margins,the commission would be adjusted,and omead jafroodi would pay him.
appellant testified that his total sales for were,but for that year he received commissions of only.on february,appellant wrote a letter of resignation stating that he had accepted a sales position with another company at much better pay.appellant specified three reasons for leaving,one of which was as follows i will know how my commissions are calculated.
prior to his resignation,appellant procured two new clients for respondent bell rock growers and watkins valley color.appellant claimed that he was entitled to commissions on sales made by respondent to these two companies after his resignation.this included equipment sales of to watkins valley color.appellant testified that he had sold the watkins valley color program.
jason engel,a certified public accountant,calculated appellant damages and opined as follows the total commission paid to appellant was.but based on a commission rate of percent on all sales with a gross profit margin of less than percent,appellant was entitled to additional commission of for the period from january,through his resignation in february.engel also applied a percent commission rate to the alleged in sales of equipment to watkins valley color.the commission for the equipment sales came to.engel then applied a percent commission rate to additional sales to watkins valley color and bell rock growers from march,through october.the commission for these additional sales came to.moreover,engel applied a percent commission rate to estimated sales to watkins valley color and bell rock growers for the period from november,through august,the approximate date of trial.the commission for this period was.accordingly,through august,engel opined that the total unpaid commission owed to appellant was.
engel assumed that respondent relationship with watkins valley color and bell rock growers would continue for a period from september,through august.he estimated that appellant percent commission for each of these three years would be,or for the entire period.engel discounted the over three years to a present value of.thus,according to engel calculations,the unpaid commission owed to appellant totaled historical commission projected commission.engel estimated that appellant incidental expenses would be two percent of the total commission figure,or.engel subtracted these incidental expenses and arrived at a grand total of in unpaid commission owed by respondent to appellant.
respondent evidence 
sheridan shimp worked for respondent as a branch manager.she was present when the sales representative contract between the parties was signed in july.shimp gave appellant a copy of the contract,but she did not have him sign a receipt acknowledging that he had received a copy.after the first six months of his employment,appellant did not go on straight commission because h e was struggling to make enough sales to pay for his salary.shimp never told appellant that he would receive a percent commission on all sales.at some time after appellant was hired,she told him that,on sales with a gross profit margin of less than percent,he would get a commission but it would be less than percent.
omead jafroodi did not tell appellant that he would get a percent commission on all sales irrespective of the gross profit margin.jafroodi told him that he would need to make a percent gross profit margin if he was expecting a percent commission.appellant never discussed with jafroodi an agreement for commission on sales with less than a percent gross profit margin.
pursuant to the contractual percent commission on sales with a gross profit margin equal to or greater than percent,the total commission due to appellant was.respondent,however,paid appellant,which was more than he was entitled to receive.the overpayment occurred because omead jafroodi would give appellant something extra for the effort if he had actually solicited an order with less than a percent gross profit margin.jafroodi went beyond what the contract required and gave appellant bonuses or additional sums of money in order to help him along,in order to motivate him and to develop a relationship.for example,on one sale to bell rock growers the gross profit margin was only eight percent,but respondent paid appellant a commission of.
to cover its overhead costs excluding commissions,respondent needed an average gross profit margin of percent.thus,if respondent paid a percent commission on sales with a gross profit margin of less than percent,it would lose money on those sales.over half of respondent sales had a gross profit margin equal to or greater than percent.
when respondent gave appellant his paycheck,it did not provide him with information on how his commission had been calculated.
appellant did not initiate the contact with watkins valley color.the owner of the company telephoned respondent and inquired about its products.omead jafroodi told appellant about bell rock growers after respondent had established a relationship with the company.jafroodi presented the opportunity for bell rock to appellant.there is no written contract between respondent and watkins valley color or bell rock growers requiring the companies to purchase anything from respondent.
the equipment sales for which appellant claims an commission related to a contract between respondent and sun grow horticulture distribution,sun grow.the contract was signed in march after appellant resignation.appellant had nothing to do with the negotiation of this contract,which provided for the sale of equipment by sun grow,not respondent,to watkins valley color.the contract stated that,i n consideration for the delivery of the equipment,watkins valley color has agreed to purchase a minimum volume of sun grow products through the distributor of the products.the contract designates respondent as the distributor.
martin walls testified as follows he is the owner of bell rock growers.his company purchases pots from respondent.appellant did not bring the company account to respondent.roy siemens introduced bell rock to respondent.appellant serviced the company account until he resigned.walls did not want to deal with appellant because he provided poor service and made mistakes.at one point,walls contemplated stopping purchasing stuff from respondent because appellant was the sales person.there is no contract requiring bell rock growers to purchase any goods from respondent.
jury verdict 
the jury credited jason engel calculation of damages and returned a special verdict in appellant favor.on the breach of contract cause of action,the jury found that respondent had failed to pay appellant commissions due under the contract.it awarded him damages of.on the promissory fraud cause of action,the jury found that respondent had intentionally concealed an important fact from appellant with the intent to deceive him.it also awarded him damages of on this cause of action.on the quantum meruit cause of action,the jury found that appellant had performed services for respondent benefit that were not governed by the contract.the jury determined that the reasonable value of these services was.
trial court reasons for granting a new trial 
the trial court granted a new trial on the grounds of insufficiency of the evidence,and excessive damages it did so with precision,virtually insuring that its ruling and rationale are not assailable on appeal 
the trial court concluded that respondent had actually overpaid appellant for his sluggish sales over the commission period.the court noted that the contract provided appellant with a commission on all sales that are at or above gross profit margin,unless otherwise and specifically agreed upon.the court stated that respondent apparent sin was to pay appellant more than his contractual entitlement.the court reasoned according to appellant forensic accounting expert,of all sales over gross profit margin for the entire term of appellant sales agency totaled.despite that,appellant was actually paid by respondent,based on adjustments made for respondent to compensate appellant for sales made on products where the gross profit margin did not rise to the contractual threshold.
the trial court did not credit appellant testimony that he had procured watkins valley color and bell rock growers as customers for respondent and that he was entitled to an commission for the sale of equipment to watkins valley color the owner of bell rock vehemently denied this and there was no credible evidence to support appellant claims regarding valley color growers sic,should be watkins valley color.the evidence was clear that appellant was not a good salesperson,slow and laconic and prone to mistakes.
the court observed that,before appellant was hired,he had been told that respondent experienced salespersons were earning about.the court was convinced that a job in which the most experienced salespersons might earn per month would not entitle appellant,an inexperienced and relatively incompetent salesman,to a compensatory entitlement of per month,already paid compensatory award divided by months 
standard of review,new trial 
the standards for reviewing an order granting a new trial are well settled.after authorizing trial courts to grant a new trial on the grounds of e xcessive damages or i nsufficiency of the evidence,code of civil procedure section provides o n appeal from an order granting a new trial upon the ground of the insufficiency of the evidence or upon the ground of excessive or inadequate damages,such order shall be reversed as to such ground only if there is no substantial basis in the record for any of such reasons.italics added.thus,an order granting a new trial under section must be sustained on appeal unless the opposing party demonstrates that no reasonable finder of fact could have found for the movant on the trial court theory.citation.moreover,a n abuse of discretion can not be found in cases in which the evidence is in conflict and a verdict for the moving party could have been reached citation.in other words,the presumption of correctness normally accorded on appeal to the jury verdict is replaced by a presumption in favor of the new trial order.citation.the reason for this deference is that the trial court,in ruling on a new trial motion,sits as an independent trier of fact.citation.therefore,the trial court factual determinations,reflected in its decision to grant the new trial,are entitled to the same deference that an appellate court would ordinarily accord a jury factual determinations.the trial court is in the best position to assess the reliability of a jury verdict and,to this end,the legislature has granted trial courts broad discretion to order new trials.the only relevant limitation on this discretion is that the trial court must state its reasons for granting the new trial,and there must be substantial evidence in the record to support those reasons.citation.lane hughes aircraft cal th.
our observations in people andrade th,are equally apposite in the civil context a trial court serves as a gatekeeper on a motion for new trial.it opens the gate only rarely,a testament to the fact that the vast majority of trials are fairly conducted.in these cases,motions for new trial are routinely made,routinely denied,and are routinely affirmed on appeal.in the remaining cases,however,the trial court grants the motion,and we affirm those rulings in the absence of a clear showing of abuse of discretion.citation.
the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting a new trial 
on each of the causes of action for breach of contract and promissory fraud,the damages awarded were.these awards corresponded exactly to jason engel estimate of the amount of damages.engel estimate was based on appellant entitlement to a percent commission on all sales through the date of his resignation with a gross profit margin of less than percent,plus a percent commission on in sales of equipment to watkins valley color,plus a percent commission on sales to watkins valley color and bell rock growers from appellant resignation through august.
the trial court reasonably concluded that appellant was not entitled to a percent commission on sales with a gross profit margin of less than percent.according to omead jafroodi,respondent would lose money on such sales if it paid a percent commission.the contract provided for a percent commission only on sales with a gross profit margin equal to or greater than percent,unless otherwise and specifically agreed upon.jafroodi testified that appellant had never discussed with him an agreement for commission on sales with less than a percent gross profit margin.jafroodi denied telling appellant that he would get a percent commission on all sales.as an independent trier of fact lane hughes aircraft,supra,cal th at,the trial court was free to accept jafroodi testimony and reject appellant.the judge presented with a motion for new trial on the grounds of insufficiency of the evidence or excessive damages may review conflicting evidence,weigh its sufficiency,consider credibility of witnesses,reject any testimony believed false and draw any reasonable inferences from the evidence.roseboro rawlings d.
moreover,appellant testimony on the commission rate was conflicting.on the one hand,he testified that he did not expect to receive a full percent commission on sales with a gross profit margin of less than percent.he believed that the commission on such sales should be prorated.on the other hand,appellant testified that,based on what shimp and the jafroodis had told him,he expected to earn a percent commission on all sales irrespective of the gross profit margin.
the trial court also reasonably concluded that appellant was not entitled to a percent commission of on sales to watkins valley color and bell rock growers from his resignation through august.no evidence was presented that the gross profit margin on such sales would be equal to or greater than percent.furthermore,there was no assurance that these companies would continue to do business with respondent through august.martin walls,the owner of bell rock growers,testified that he buys pots from respondent because of the price and that he is not contractually bound to purchase anything from respondent.
in addition,the trial court reasonably rejected appellant claim that he was entitled to commissions on sales to watkins valley color and bell rock growers after his resignation because he had procured these companies as customers for respondent.walls,the owner of bell rock growers,testified that appellant had not procured his company account.according to walls,roy siemens introduced bell rock to respondent.as to watkins valley color,omead jafroodi testified that appellant had not initiated the contact with that company.according to jafroodi,the owner of watkins valley color telephoned respondent and inquired about its products.the testimony of walls and jafroodi constituted substantial evidence in support of the trial court finding that appellant had not procured watkins valley color and bell rock growers as customers for respondent.
furthermore,the trial court reasonably concluded that appellant was not entitled to a percent commission on in alleged sales of equipment to watkins valley color.omead jafroodi testified that the alleged sales related to a contract between respondent and sun grow.the contract was signed in march after appellant resignation,and appellant had nothing to do with its negotiation.moreover,the contract provided for the sale of equipment by sun grow,not respondent,to watkins valley color.
as to the quantum meruit cause of action,the jury awarded appellant damages of.this amount is exactly equal to engel figures of a percent commission on all sales through the date of appellant resignation with a gross profit margin of less than percent plus a percent commission on the in alleged sales of equipment to watkins valley color.for the reasons explained above,the trial court reasonably concluded that these damages were also excessive.
third cause of action.et.
the trial court granted respondent motion for a directed verdict on appellant third cause of action for violation of the act.et pursuant to section,respondent was required to enter into a written contract with appellant,id.subd.a,and the contract was required to include the following information the rate and method by which the commission is computed.the time when commissions will be paid.the territory assigned to the sales representative.all exceptions to the assigned territory and customers therein.what chargebacks will be made against the commissions,if any,subd.b.respondent was further required to give a copy of the contract to appellant and assure that he signed a receipt acknowledging receipt of the signed copy,subd.c.moreover,when respondent paid appellant his commissions,it was required to provide him with written information and documentation showing how the commissions had been calculated,subd.d.respondent concedes that it failed to comply with section in certain respects 
section of the act provides a manufacturer,jobber,or distributor who willfully fails to enter into a written contract as required by this chapter or willfully fails to pay commissions as provided in the written contract shall be liable to the sales representative in a civil action for treble the damages proved at trial.appellant second amended complaint alleges that respondent violations of the act were willful.appellant therefore prays for the court to treble the damages awarded by the jury.
trial court ruling et.
the trial court found that respondent had c learly failed to comply with the statute section in multiple ways.but the court granted respondent motion for a directed verdict because there no evidence whatsoever of willfulness of violating the statutory requirements.the court interpreted section of the act as allowing damages only for willful violations.
judgment was subsequently entered in respondent favor on the third cause of action.pursuant to section,the judgment awards attorney fees and costs to respondent as the prevailing party.section provides in a civil action brought by the sales representative pursuant to this chapter,the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs in addition to any other recovery.
