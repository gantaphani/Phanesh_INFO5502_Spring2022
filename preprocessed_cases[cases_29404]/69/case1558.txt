background 
in january,congress passed the nuclear waste policy act of,stat.codified as amended at u.hereinafter nwpa,under which all nuclear utilities entered into a standard contract with energy.these contracts obligated the utilities to pay fees into the nuclear waste fund.in return,energy was obligated to pick up and store the utilities snf and radioactive waste hlw.the nwpa and standard contract obligated energy to begin pick up by january.however,the contracts also contained an unavoidable delays clause.in,congress amended the nwpa,requiring energy to develop only one permanent geologic repository for nuclear waste and forbidding energy from constructing an interim storage facility until the nuclear regulatory commission authorized the permanent facility.in part because of these constraints,energy was unable to begin accepting snf in as required by the statute and by contract.
on july,plaintiffs filed their complaint in the claims court,alleging partial breach of contract.in,the court granted summary judgment on liability,finding that the government had partially breached the standard contract by failing to begin accepting snf in january.there is no issue on appeal as to liability liability in these snf cases has been established.see.pub.power dist.united states,en banc.the facts revolve around two main calculation of plaintiffs damage award and the government alleged waiver of its unavoidable delays defense with respect to expectancy damages.
in,the claims court held a trial on damages.the plaintiffs sought reimbursement of their actual costs spent mitigating energy delays.nuclear,fed.cl.at.these costs were for construction of storage at their plants that would not have been necessary had energy performed its contractual obligations.in essence,the parties agreed that damages were the costs the plaintiffs actually incurred to store snf in the real world less the costs that the plaintiffs would have incurred to store snf had energy performed.
the plaintiffs alleged that they incurred additional storage costs at three different power plants plant hatch,plant farley,and plant vogtle at plant hatch,they sought damages for the cost of constructing an independent spent fuel storage installation isfsi as well as the cost of dry storage casks for the isfsi and the expenses incurred in loading the casks onto the isfsi.isfsis are essentially concrete pads constructed to store dry storage casks and located adjacent to rather than inside reactor buildings.dry storage casks are steel containers designed to hold and prevent leakage of snf when it is removed from the reactor.at plant farley,plaintiffs also sought reimbursement for an isfsi as well as for storage casks and loading costs.lastly,at plant vogtle,plaintiffs sought damages for the cost of reracking.reracking is a method of increasing wet storage,storage inside the reactor pool,as opposed to using dry storage casks.it involves purchasing higher density storage racks so that more snf can be stored in the wet pools adjacent to the core rather than transferred to a dry storage installation like an isfsi outside of the reactor building.the united states argued that these storage costs at all three plants would also have been incurred in the world,if energy had performed and that,therefore,the government breach did not cause the plaintiffs to make these expenditures.
however,determining what costs would have been incurred absent energy breach proved difficult because the standard contract itself did not specify a rate at which energy was obligated to pick up snf.instead,the standard contract required energy to issue annual capacity reports acrs,stating which plants would be granted allocations first and projecting how much snf would be accepted by energy.the acrs,issued annually,included both an rate and projected allocations for each individual plant.in,we held in pacific gas electric united states,that the standard contract required energy to accept snf at the rates set forth in the acr.however,the claims court issued its opinions in this case in and this appeal was stayed.therefore,at the time of the decision,neither the parties nor the claims court knew that the acr rates were contractually required.
at trial,the government argued that the court should use the acr acceptance rates,approximately metric tons of uranium mtu per year,as the rates required by the standard contract.the plaintiffs,conversely,urged the court to use a mtu per year acceptance rate to determine how much snf energy would have picked up in the world.neither party advocated for the acr rates,which ramped up to approximately mtu per year.the claims court explicitly declined to determine a particular contractual acceptance rate.instead,the claims court concluded that the reracking at plant vogtle and the dry storage at plants hatch and farley would not have occurred if energy had been performing at any reasonable rate defined as between and mtu per year.nuclear,fed.cl.at.it then continued that,e ven at the lower rates under the december acr,storage shortages would likely have been accommodated in the world,the additional storage facilities would not have been required.id.therefore,the claims court concluded that the plaintiffs mitigation measures were incurred as a result of energy breach,and it awarded for the rerack at plant vogtle,for dry storage costs at plant farley,and for dry storage costs at plant hatch.id.at.
with respect to plant hatch,the plaintiffs conceded that two bathtub racks a type of wet storage used within the reactor building for storing snf,which they purchased in the real world,would also have been purchased for in the world and that during the period in question here they would have saved the costs of installing one of the two bathtub racks.the claims court offset the plaintiffs damage award by only,even though the claims court recognized that the bathtub racks at plant hatch would have been purchased absent energy breach.the court awarded plaintiffs for the purchase of these bathtub racks when totaling damages.on appeal,both parties agree that the award was made in error.
after trial,the united states filed a motion for reconsideration,arguing that the claims court should have determined a specific rate at which energy was contractually obligated to accept snf and that the court erred in stating that at the acr rates plaintiffs would not have built additional storage.on november,the claims court denied the motion,reiterating that even if it had accepted the government proposed rate as set forth in the acr,the dry storage expenditures awarded would not have been incurred.nuclear operating.united states,fed.cl,hereinafter reconsideration op.the claims court concluded that at the acr rates,with the sufficient lead time in the nonbreach world,and with fuel management,burnup adjustments,swaps,increase in pickups etc,given the enormous expense and effort to build an isfsi for a relatively small amount of snf,dry storage would not have been built at plant hatch.id.at.the references are all types of fuel management techniques that can be used to avoid the need for dry storage.a burnup adjustment refers to changing how much energy is extracted from the nuclear fuel source.increasing fuel burnups would reduce the amount of snf discharge created by the process.a swap would involve the trading of acceptance allocations between different plants.an increase in pickups refers to an option available under the standard contract that would increase the plant allocations.
with respect to the unavoidable delays issue,the claims court held that the united states waived a defense based on the unavoidable delays clause of the standard contract.it found that the government did not raise the unavoidable delays clause as an affirmative defense,nor contend that but for the mandamus order issued by the district of columbia circuit,the unavoidable delays clause would be raised in its pleadings or at trial.fed.cl.at.furthermore,it noted that the united states had raised the absence of a repository as a defense or had raised challenges to the jurisdiction of the district of columbia circuit in other cases.it stated,q uestions of the validity or applicability of the circuit mandamus in this court could have been raised but were not.id.at.
the united states timely appealed both the damage award and the unavoidable delays decision in.we stayed the appeal until pending the outcomes of yankee atomic electric united states,nebraska public power,at,and carolina power light united states.this court has jurisdiction under a.
discussion 
we review legal conclusions of the claims court,including contract interpretation,de novo.yankee atomic,at.factual findings are reviewed for clear error.power united states.
as recognized by plaintiffs,damages amounted to the costs southern actually incurred to store snf less the costs that southern would have incurred to store snf had energy performed its contracts.appellee br.the united states argues on appeal that the claims court failed to apply the contractually mandated acr rates to determine precisely which costs that plaintiffs incurred in the real world would have been avoided in the world.appellants br.according to the government,remand is required as to plant hatch and plant vogtle under yankee atomic and carolina power light to allow discovery and expert testimony about plaintiffs hypothetical expenditures at the acr rates.the united states concedes that remand is unnecessary to calculate damages at plant farley because the damage award would not be any different under the acr rates.
the plaintiffs contend that remand is unnecessary because the damage award as to plant hatch and plant vogtle would not differ using the acr rates.they argue that the claims court,in its reconsideration opinion,applied the acr rates to determine damages at plant hatch and,in its initial opinion,concluded that the plaintiffs storage measures at all three plants would not have been necessary even at the acr rates,which were more favorable to the government than the rates.
with respect to plant hatch,the government on appeal no longer challenges the claims court conclusion that the plaintiffs would not have constructed dry storage absent energy breach.however,the government argues that the award should be reduced because of saved costs.these saved costs resulted from the fact that plaintiffs allegedly would have been required to employ certain alternative fuel management techniques at the acr rates in the world to avoid building dry storage.in fact,the government asserts that the claims court itself recognized the necessity of alternative fuel management techniques when it stated that with fuel management,burnup adjustments,sawps,increase in pickups etc,dry storage would not have been built at plant hatch in the world.reconsideration op.at emphasis added.hence,it argues that the cost of these fuel management techniques was avoided in the real world and urges that remand is necessary for the claims court to calculate the costs of these techniques and deduct them from the final damage award.
the united states admits that it did not present any evidence to the claims court about what costs would have been avoided at plant hatch in the world and hence should be offset from the damage award at the acr rates or any other rate.it explains that it did not do so because its position was that all of the costs allegedly incurred by plaintiffs at plant hatch,the isfsi,dry storage casks,and the cost of loading the casks would also have been incurred if energy had performed at the rates,but that other avoided costs,fuel management techniques,burnup adjustments,would not have been incurred.the government claims that,had it known the rates were controlling,it would instead have agreed that dry storage would not have been necessary in the world but that the damage award should be offset by avoided costs.although the government does not state precisely what these avoided costs would have been,it suggests that they would include,inter alia,the fuel management techniques,burnup adjustments,swaps,increase in pickups,mentioned by the claims court in its reconsideration opinion.reconsideration,at.
at plant vogtle,the government argues that plaintiffs would have needed to perform a rerack in even if energy had performed because the acr rates did not grant any snf allocations to plant vogtle until and the plaintiffs therefore would have exceeded their storage capacity before energy began accepting snf.therefore,it claims,remand is necessary for the claims court to determine whether the cost of the rerack should have been included in the damage award or whether plaintiffs would have incurred that cost anyway in the world albeit at a later date 
the government asserts that yankee atomic and carolina power require use of the rate and require remand for the claims court to permit discovery,hear expert testimony,and thoroughly compare the expenditures in the breach and worlds at the acr rates.in yankee atomic,we remanded because the claims court did not select any contractual rate and hence did not acknowledge that causation depended on some comparison of the hypothetical world to the expenses actually incurred.at.similarly,in carolina power,we remanded the case when the government challenged the claims court use of a rate more favorable to the plaintiffs than the acr rates to construct the hypothetical world.at.although the plaintiffs failed to introduce evidence concerning damages under the rates at trial,we excused the failure because they could not be expected to have forecasted the outcome of our intervening decision in pacific gas.carolina power,at.also,we noted that while the and rates might be immaterially different,the case required remand because equivalency between the two had never been tested during discovery or subject ed to at trial.id.at.such a determination,we said,was a profoundly factual endeavor.id.
as in carolina power,the claims court opinion here the pacific gas decision.the government could not have been expected to predict our adoption of the rates.whatever the merits of allowing the record to be reopened for the submission of evidence as to what would have occurred at the rates,we are bound by the carolina power decision.the latitude we have given to plaintiffs to reopen the record under carolina power must also be afforded to the government.however,we think that question should be addressed in the first instance by the claims court.remand is appropriate so that the claims court,in the first instance,may consider the impact of pacific gas,yankee atomic,and carolina power on this particular case,and to determine whether the government should be allowed to reopen the record and engage in additional discovery or introduce new evidence like expert reports and expert testimony with respect to the costs that would have been incurred by plaintiffs at plant hatch and plant vogtle at the acr rates.in this connection,we note the government remarkable silence about the nature and amount of the costs it alleges the plaintiffs avoided by constructing their storage facilities at plant hatch.in order for the claims court to determine whether to reopen the record in this case,it will be necessary for the gover
