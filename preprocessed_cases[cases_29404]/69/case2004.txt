introduction 
appellants are three affiliated insurance casualty insurance company ohio casualty,west american insurance company west american,and american fire and casualty company american fire they appeal from the superior court denial of their petition for writ of administrative mandamus or writ of mandate the petition.the petition challenged an order of the california insurance commissioner the commissioner requiring appellants to pay certain assessments imposed by california fair plan association fair access to insurance requirements,et fair plan for and,totaling over million.
established in,the fair plan obligates all real and personal property insurers to establish a program to apportion among themselves the responsibility for providing basic property insurance for those who,after diligent efforts,are unable to obtain insurance through normal market channels,subd.a.by statute,the cost of writing and issuing fair plan policies,including profits and losses,are borne proportionately by california property insurers based on the amount of business each insurer conducted in the state two years earlier,subd.c.
in this appeal,appellants claim the trial court erred in denying their petition and upholding the commissioner decision because it was based on the erroneous conclusion that the fair plan statutory scheme requires insurers who have decided to withdraw from the california market to remain fair plan members and continue writing new fair plan catastrophic exposure for two years after they surrender their certificates of authority or cease writing new insurance business in california.urging reversal,appellants claim the commissioner decision was based on a misinterpretation of the fair plan statutes,and was issued in derogation of the rights of insurance companies attempting to withdraw from the california market,as set out in travelers indemnity gillespie cal d,travelers.we disagree and affirm.however,we reverse as to the amount of interest awarded in this case,and remand the matter to the trial court for a recalculation of the interest to be included as part of the overall award.
facts and procedural history 
appellants held certificates of authority to do business in california for many years and earned reputations as providers of insurance products and services.however,in may,appellants parent company decided to withdraw appellants from the california insurance market for business reasons and planned to commence the withdrawal process by the end of the year.
in june,appellants informed the california department of insurance the department of their intention to withdraw from the state and submitted a withdrawal plan for the department approval.the plan proposed that appellants would file withdrawal applications and surrender their certificates of authority on december.after that date,appellants would cease writing new or renewal policies but would continue to service existing business until all policies had expired or terminated.appellants requested the department to waive the statutory reinsurance and assumption requirements applicable to withdrawing insurers,but the department denied the request.
after further discussions with the department,appellants adopted a modified plan under which appellants would withdraw in two stages.in the first stage,ohio casualty and west american would surrender their certificates of authority to the commissioner after reinsuring their primary liabilities with american fire.during this stage,american fire would maintain its certificate of authority until its own primary liabilities and the liabilities ceded to it by ohio casualty and west american had terminated.in the second stage,american fire would apply to withdraw and surrender its certificate of authority to the commissioner.
on december,in accordance with appellants modified withdrawal plan,american fire assumed and reinsured ohio casualty and west american basic property insurance liabilities.on december,ohio casualty and west american submitted applications to withdraw and surrendered their certificates of authority to the commissioner.american fire retained its certificate of authority for the purposes of running off its own business and fulfilling its obligations as a reinsurer according to the withdrawal plan.american fire continued to service its existing property insurance policies but,like ohio casualty and west american,wrote no new or renewal business in california after december.the commissioner did not cancel appellants certificates of authority until.
nearly one year after appellants stopped writing new or renewal insurance policies in california,they each received a letter dated november,from the fair plan.in these letters,the general manager of the fair plan informed appellants that i t is necessary to assess member companies for the losses arising out of the recent brush fires in southern california.appellants were informed they were being assessed a total of,based on their and participation in the fair plan.
by letters dated november,appellants responded,claiming that they were not subject to the and assessments since they surrendered their certificates of authority or stopped writing property insurance in the state on december.
on april,the fair plan sent appellants a second assessment notice,informing them that it was necessary for the fair plan to assess member companies for losses arising from the northridge earthquake of january.these new assessments brought the total for and to,but appellants were warned that losses from the northridge earthquake are still developing,and it is possible that a further cash call may be necessary.
on november,appellants were sent a further cash call for additional fair plan losses arising from the northridge earthquake.the fair plan also advised appellants that their original participation rate ha d been revised,and that appellants purported share of the previous assessments for the brush fires and earthquake had therefore been recalculated.as a result,the total assessments for and were 
appellants refused to pay the assessments on the ground that they were not members of the fair plan during and.they claimed the clear and unambiguous language of the fair plan statute,the legislative history,and the plan of operation expressly limit membership in the association to those licensed insurers that are engaged in writing property insurance in the state.appellants claimed that none of the companies qualified for fair plan membership during pool years and because none of the companies were engaged in writing new or renewal property insurance in california since december.moreover,two of the companies ohio casualty and west american had not been licensed to write property insurance in the state since december,when they surrendered their certificates of authority to the commissioner with the intention of withdrawing from the california insurance market.
the fair plan,on the other hand,contended that appellants were obligated to pay their shares of the assessments for pool years and,because they had premiums written two years earlier,in and,the years that formed the statutory basis for participation in losses in pool years and.under the fair plan statutes,each insurer must participate in the profits and losses of the association in the proportion that its premiums written during the second preceding calendar year bear to the aggregate premiums written by all insurers in the program,excluding that portion of the premiums written attributable to the operation of the association,subd.c.
invoking this statute,the fair plan took the position that an insurer participation in the fair plan profits and losses is in direct proportion to the insurer share of direct written premiums written two years earlier,as reported by the insurer to the department.it is undisputed that appellants were licensed and actively engaged in writing california basic property insurance during and.thus,the fair plan claimed that ohio casualty and west american could not relieve themselves of their assessment obligations by surrendering their certificates of authority on december,and that none of the three companies escaped liability,as they contended,by ceasing to write new insurance in california after that date.
appellants eventually appealed the assessments to the commissioner,who assigned the appeal to an administrative law judge.the commissioner adopted the administrative law judge decision,which was reached after six days of live testimony and the introduction of hundreds of documents.the commissioner determined that appellants could not escape their fair plan assessment liabilities by surrendering their certificates of authority or by ceasing to issue new policies.to the contrary,the commissioner found appellants remained fair plan members during and,and were therefore liable for fair plan assessments for those years,because appellants reported positive premiums written for calendar years,the years that form the basis for their fair plan liabilities.the commissioner reasoned,under the fair plan statutes an insurer duty to participate in association pools arises when it enters the basic property insurance market in california.that duty continues until the member insurer has no premiums written in the second preceding calendar year,subd.c.
appellants filed their petition challenging the commissioner order.the superior court,however,denied their petition,essentially adopting the commissioner construction of the fair plan statute.moreover,the court ordered appellants to pay interest on the assessments at a rate of ten percent per annum starting thirty days after the date of notice for each assessment.these appeals followed 
discussiona.standard of review 
appellants have repeatedly disclaimed any intention of challenging the commissioner factual findings and have adamantly insisted that they are only challenging the legal conclusions reached by the commissioner.we have taken appellants at their word.consequently,we discuss the legal questions involved while presuming that the underlying findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence.citation.see state farm mutual automobile ins.quackenbush th,d.
in examining appellants statutory obligations to the fair plan,respondents claim we should defer to the commissioner decision upholding these assessments because the legislature has delegated to the commissioner the power to interpret and implement the fair plan statutes,subd.g,subd.on appeal from a fair plan governing committee decision,the commissioner may make any order to implement the purposes of the chapter and the plan.although we independently determine the meaning of a statute,if an agency charged with administering the statute issues its own interpretation,we will give great weight and respect to the administrative construction citations.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,yamaha.
but the weight to be accorded to an agency interpretation is fundamentally situational and depends upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.citation.yamaha,supra,cal th at,d,italics omitted,quoting skidmore swift.an agency consistent maintenance of the interpretation under scrutiny,especially if it is,is a circumstance which weighs in favor of judicial deference.yamaha,supra,cal th at,d,quoting culligan water conditioning state bd.of equalization cal d.applying these principles,we determine whether appellants have demonstrated that the commissioner interpretation of the fair plan statutes,as embodied in his order upholding these assessments,was unreasonable or conflicted with legislative intent.
since,ordinarily,the best indication of legislative intent is the language of the statute itself,we proceed to examine the fair plan statutory scheme.we turn first to the words of the statute itself,seeking to give the words employed by the legislature their usual and ordinary meaning.see hoechst celanese franchise tax bd.cal th,d.as particularly relevant here the language must be construed in the context of the statutory framework as a whole,keeping in mind the policies and purposes of the statute citation,and where possible the language should be read so as to conform to the spirit of the enactment.citation.rudd california casualty ins.d.israni superior court th,d.
b.the california fair plan statutory scheme 
established in,the fair plan is an involuntary association of all property insurers within california,subd.a.the fair plan is obligated to write insurance for all properties that meet its underwriting standards,even if those properties are located in areas deemed uninsurable by the normal insurance market,subd.a see wolfe state farm fire casualty ins.th,d.the fair plan does not have insurance agents.instead,it is obligated to establish a statewide telephone number to accept applications from every licensed property and casualty insurance professional,as well as directly from insureds,subd.h.the fair plan association issues fair plan property insurance policies on behalf of its members.under the plan of operation,each member is considered to be a direct insurer for its share of the plan writings.all insurers participate in the fair plan profits and losses according to the amount of business they write in the state two years earlier,subd.c.since,the fair plan fiscal year has begun october and ended september,so that insurers could report to the department on a calendar year basis the annual fair plan financial results.
when the fair plan was created,the association was to consist of all insurers licensed to write and engaged in writing basic property insurance on a direct basis in california.as new insurers became licensed to write and engaged in writing property insurance in california they,too,were required to participate in the fair plan.ibid.the statute provides that every insurer so described that becomes a fair plan participant shall remain a member as a condition of its authority to transact basic property insurance in this state,subd.a.
appellants appear to concede that,at least by,they all were both licensed to write and engaged in writing basic property insurance,or some component thereof,in california,on a direct basis consequently,under section,subdivision a,appellants became fair plan members as a condition of their authority to transact basic property insurance in this state.appellants fair plan membership obligations are spelled out in section all insurers,on and after the effective date of this chapter,by continuing to hold a certificate of authority to transact insurance business shall be deemed to have consented to the responsibilities imposed by this chapter.italics added.so,at least by,by continuing to hold their certificates of authority,appellants had consented to the responsibilities of fair plan membership as defined by the fair plan statutes.
respondents stress that the fair plan is not a voluntary association.they also stress that nowhere in the fair plan statute does it state that a solvent insurer is relieved of its fair plan participation responsibilities by either surrendering its certificate of authority or by ceasing to write property insurance in california to the contrary,respondents claim that appellants continued participation in the fair plan is governed by section,subdivision c,which mandates that each insurer shall participate in the fair plan writings,expenses,profits and losses in the proportion that its premiums written during the second preceding calendar year bear to the aggregate premiums written by all other insurers in the fair plan,excluding operating expenses.italics added.
in defending these assessments below,the fair plan explained its view of the obligations imposed by section,subdivision c p remiums written in one year form the basis of a company pool participation two years later.consequently,when appellants had premiums written of million in and million in,the rights and obligations it held by were established for all time.put another way,each premium dollar appellants received from production in or was impressed with an obligation that became fixed in proportion to its fellow association members production in each of the same years.once the relationship among members became fixed,appellants could not alter it by simply filing a petition to withdraw from the state.throughout its history,invoking section,subdivision c,the fair plan has required each insurer to continue participating in the fair plan until that insurer no longer has premiums written during the second preceding calendar year.for convenience and brevity,the fair plan construction is called the statutory participation rule.
the commissioner endorsed the statutory participation rule in his opinion,saying under the fair plan statutes,as we have noted,an insurer duty to participate in association pools arises when it enters the basic property insurance market in california.that duty continues until the member insurer has no premiums written in the second preceding calendar year,subd.c.
despite the administrative acceptance and endorsement of the statutory participation rule,appellants argue that by and,the years the fair plan policies covering the losses were written,appellants were excluded from fair plan membership.appellants claim,the fair plan statute repeatedly makes clear insurers become and remain members by being licensed to write and engaged in writing property insurance appellants emphasize that n one of the companies was engaged in writing basic property insurance in california in or each stopped writing any insurance as of december.for this reason alone,the clear and unambiguous statutory language makes clear that the companies no longer are members of the fair plan association and can not be liable for plan losses sustained in and.
appellants derive the statutory framework for their argument from the phrase insurers licensed to write and engaged in writing property insurance as used in several sections of the fair plan statutes.for example,section,subdivision a,states that the fair plan is a joint reinsurance association formed by insurers licensed to write and engaged in writing basic property insurance within this state italics added.in both sections and,subdivision a,the legislature specifically focused on what it required to happen w ithin days after the effective date of this chapter section required that all insurers licensed to write and engaged in writing in this state,on a direct basis,basic property insurance or any component thereof in multiperil policies,shall establish an industry placement facility,the california fair plan association italics added.
similarly,section,subdivision a focused expressly upon a deadline of w ithin days following the effective date of this chapter for the fair plan to submit for the commissioner review a proposed plan of operation,consistent with the provisions of this chapter,creating an association consisting of all insurers licensed to write and engaged in writing in this state,on a direct basis,basic property insurance or any component thereof in homeowners or other dwelling multiperil policies.italics added.
we first note the obvious.the plain language of the licensed to write and engaged in writing phrases in sections,subdivision a,and,subdivision a focused upon the creation of the fair plan or the deadline for proposing the original plan of operation.ignoring the context of those sections,appellants assert the legislature intended that language to define the scope and duration of participation in the fair plan.however,those section do not address the issue involved here,which is how long an insurer that has become a fair plan participant must continue to participate after deciding to withdraw from the california market.
on closer analysis,the precise language used in the statutes governing fair plan membership answers that question,and refutes appellants argument that an insurer remains a fair plan member only so long as that insurer is both licensed to write and engaged in writing basic property insurance.to the contrary,once an insurer becomes a fair plan member,that insurer shall remain a member as a condition of its authority to transact basic property insurance in this state,subd.a,italics added.as the commissioner pointed out,an insurer withdrawing from california still has statutory authority to transact basic property insurance after it surrenders its certificate of authority and after it ceases writing insurance,because,in closing out its affairs,the insurer handles matters subsequent to and arising out of the insurance contracts remaining on its books,subd.d travelers,supra,cal d at fn.in the instant case,appellants had authority to transact property insurance during pool years and.consequently,appellants remained fair plan members,whether or not they continued to be licensed to write or engaged in writing basic property insurance in california.
appellants also seek to avoid the application of section,subdivision c,which mandates fair plan participation until they have no premiums written during the second preceding year,by asserting that insurer as used in that section refers only to insurers licensed to write and engaged in writing basic property insurance in the state.however,the words used in the statute to describe participating insurers do not support that contention.section,subdivision c does not say that only such insurers that are licensed to write and engaged in writing shall participate in fair plan profits and losses,as claimed by appellants it requires each insurer with premiums written during the second preceding calendar year to participate proportionately.italics added.
when considering appellants arguments on this point,they place their strongest reliance upon an administrative interpretation of the fair plan statutes in the statutorily mandated plan of operation.the version of the plan of operation in effect at the time of these assessments provided the fair plan association shall be authorized t o write and issue policies of insurance as provided in this plan of operation on behalf of its insurers the plan then defines insurer as a ny insurance company or other organization which is authorized to write and is engaged in writing property insurance business,on a direct basis,in this state italics added fn.omitted.appellants claim the plan of operation confirms that only those companies authorized to write and engaged in writing property insurance on a direct basis are required to participate in the issuance of fair plan policies,even if the company had actively engaged in selling insurance in the state two years earlier.
however,it is an elementary proposition that statutes control administrative interpretations and,as we have seen,appellants interpretation is contrary to the governing fair plan statutes.the select portion of the plan of operation in question can not alter or redefine the statutory parameters of fair plan participation and to the extent that it can be read to do so,it is void.see generally california of psychology providers rank cal d,see also agricultural labor relations bd.superior court cal d,city of san joaquin state bd.of equalization d.it is fundamental that an administrative agency may not usurp the legislative function,no matter how altruistic its motives are.pulaski occupational safety and health stds.bd.th,d.
in any event,it would be nonsensical to interpret the plan of operation definition of insurer as a sub silentio endorsement of a legal proposition that would effectively gut the statutory participation rule when the fair plan has consistently taken the position that its member insurers must participate in the fair plan profits and losses until they have no premiums written in the second preceding year,even after they have commenced the withdrawal process and ceased writing new business 
in considering appellants proposed interpretation,respondents arguments implicate the rule which requires this court,in cases where uncertainty exists regarding the meaning of a statute,to consider the consequences flowing from a particular interpretation.santa clara county local transportation authority guardino cal th,d,harris capital growth investors xiv cal d,fair employment housing com.cal d.in so doing,we endorse respondents concern about the grave public policy implications which would result if appellants interpretation of the fair plan statutes was adopted.
allowing insurers to escape assessments simply by surrendering their certificates of authority ceasing to write insurance could lead to widespread insurer withdrawal any time disaster strikes,thereby interfering with the fair plan statutory purpose of assuring the availability of basic property insurance.see,subd.a.in fact,under appellants view,insurers newly licensed by the state could write property insurance here for two years and never insure fair plan risks if they ceased writing insurance or surrendered their certificates by the end of the second year.thus,resolution in appellants favor could create a property insurance market characterized by entries and departures,thus destabilizing the property insurance market in california.see,subd.a.predictably,insurer withdrawal would unfairly impact insurers who continuously operate in the california market,and their policyholders,as they would be left to assume the obligations of the withdrawing insurer,thus shouldering an inequitable distribution of fair plan risks.consequently,adoption of appellants proposed interpretation of the fair plan statutes would have grave adverse public policy consequences to the public as well as those insurers who shoulder their fair share of fair plan responsibilities.we can not presume the legislature intended such consequences 
because the commissioner thoroughly considered the issue and reached a reasonable conclusion in harmony with the fair plan statutes,administrative construction,and public policy considerations,we see no reason to overturn his decision upholding these assessments.see yamaha,supra,cal th at,d.

emphasizing the ostensible tension between appellants rights as withdrawing insurers and their obligations under california fair plan,appellants next claim that respondents statutory participation rule must be rejected because it is inconsistent with the supreme court decision in travelers.italics added underscoring omitted.both the commissioner and the trial court found that travelers was manifestly inapplicable to this case and could not be read to relieve a property insurer withdrawing from california from its obligations to the fair plan under the statutory participation rule.we agree.
in travelers,the supreme court considered whether section,subdivision c,which prohibited insurers from refusing to renew automobile insurance policies unless specified grounds are present hereafter mandatory renewal provision,applies to insurers that have commenced the statutory withdrawal process the travelers court concluded that the mandatory renewal provision,which was adopted as part of the initiative measure known as proposition,was not meant to apply in these circumstances travelers,supra,cal d at.requiring mandatory renewal of existing automobile policies is fundamentally inconsistent with the act of withdrawing and would greatly burden and complicate the withdrawal process id.at.the supreme court repeatedly made clear that it was evaluating only proposition and that it was doing so,because,a n insurer who is precluded from cancelling and is required to renew its automobile policies can not discontinue its california business.id.at.
by contrast,both the commissioner and the trial court found that fulfilling the obligations imposed by the fair plan does not prevent an insurer from the orderly winding up of its affairs in california nor impose a burden on an insurer that would preclude it from being able to withdraw from california.we agree.in travelers,the supreme court was concerned that compelling an insurer to renew automobile policies during the pendency of its withdrawal application would prevent the insurer from withdrawing from the california market for the indefinite future.travelers,supra,cal d at.the travelers court observed that proposition mandatory renewal provisions would pose such a barrier to withdrawal,that it is difficult to see how an insurer with automobile policies in force could ever leave the state.id.at.
in contrast to being indefinitely burdened with renewal obligations,the fair plan requires an insurer to fulfill its statutory participation obligations as part of its withdrawal from the state.evidence was presented at the administrative hearing that in the years since the fair plan statute came into existence,many property insurers have fulfilled their fair plan participation responsibilities and have successfully withdrawn from the state.consequently,the record in this case clearly demonstrates that the statutory participation rule does not impose the same burden on withdrawing insurers as does proposition mandatory renewal provisions.
the travelers court also focused on the statutory scheme under which an insurer withdraws from the california market.et the court stated that the most reasonable interpretation of the applicable statutes is that once the withdrawal process has been properly commenced by compliance with the statutory withdrawal application requirements,including the surrender of the insurer certificate of authority to the commissioner for cancellation,the applicant has the particular status of a withdrawing insurer travelers,supra,cal d at.the travelers court explained that the surrender of the certificate of authority is not purely symbolic.id.at.a n insurer,by the act of surrendering its certificate for cancellation,has committed itself to the orderly winding up of its affairs in this state and may not thereafter write new business in this state while its certificate remains in the commissioner possession.consequently,a withdrawing insurer differs from other admitted insurers in at least one highly significant respect it may not write new business,fn.omitted.
appellants rely on this language to argue that the statutory participation rule can not be invoked to require ohio casualty and west american to take on fair plan business written after they surrendered their certificates of authority on december.underscoring in original.appellants argue that r equiring an insurer to be a direct insurer of new property admittedly potential catastrophic two or more years after surrendering its certificate is also fundamentally inconsistent with the act of withdrawing underscoring omitted.in making these arguments,appellants repeatedly characterize themselves as direct insurers who are involuntarily required to write new business even though they are attempting to withdraw from the california insurance market.
however,the administrative record brings appellants arguments into question.appellants fair plan participation does not require appellants to issue new insurance policies that they would have to underwrite and administer themselves.the fair plan,rather than appellants,performs all the functions of an insurer on the policies it issues.it underwrites the policies,pays producers sales commissions,bills and collects premiums,renews or cancels policies,adjusts any claims and does the accounting related to the plan operations.consequently,appellants perform no direct operational functions on fair plan policies other than participation in the profits or losses for the years of fair plan participation.
moreover,appellants vastly overstate the significance of a provision in the plan of operation which states that an insurer participating in the fair plan is considered to be a direct insurer for its share in such writings.italics added.it was explained at the administrative hearing that this nomenclature was adopted to reflect that for every risk we write,the insurance company is the direct writer for that percentage that reflects their participation in the california insurance market.consequently the obligations imposed on appellants as direct insurer s are simply those prescribed by the statutory participation rule.
on this record,appellants argument that they are being forced to assume the onerous financial and administrative burdens of direct insurers writing new insurance business in california is both misleading and incomplete.the commissioner has expressed no interest in forcing a company that is withdrawing from the california market to wr
