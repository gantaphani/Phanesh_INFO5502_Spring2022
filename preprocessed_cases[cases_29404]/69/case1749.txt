the child,the infant son of the mother,was detained,declared a dependent,and placed in foster care.over the course of the dependency,the mother repeatedly yelled and cursed at employees of the county department of children and family services the department,including not only social workers,but also security guards and receptionists.she tied up the department phone lines with harassing and calls.she also threatened employees of the department eventually,she pleaded guilty to one count of making a criminal threat.
shortly after the review hearing,a therapist told the assigned social worker that the mother had threatened to shoot the social worker.in response,the department applied for an injunction prohibiting the mother from contacting its employees,except through her counsel.the application was based in part on hearsay,including the therapist statements,as set forth in a declaration by the social worker.
the juvenile court issued the requested injunction,although it allowed the mother not only to contact the department through her counsel,but also to contact her assigned social worker in writing or in response to a contact initiated by the social worker.
the mother appeals,contending 
the juvenile court did not have the authority to issue this type of injunction.
there was insufficient nonhearsay evidence to support the issuance of the injunction.
the injunction violates the mother constitutional rights to due process and freedom of speech.
in the published portion of this opinion,we will hold that,even if the juvenile court lacked statutory authority,it had inherent authority to issue the injunction.we will further hold that,under welfare and institutions code section,as construed in in re malinda cal d,the hearsay contained in the social worker declaration was admissible this hearsay,when combined with the other evidence,was sufficient to support the injunction.in the nonpublished portion of this opinion,we will hold that the mother forfeited her constitutional claims by failing to raise them below.for this reason,we express no opinion on whether the injunction would have been equally appropriate if these claims had been raised.
we will affirm.
procedural background 
in february,when the child was less than a year old,the department detained him and filed a dependency petition concerning him.
in april,the juvenile court sustained jurisdiction based on failure to protect.welf,subd.b.it formally removed the child from the parents custody,and it ordered reunification services.in september,however,the juvenile court suspended the mother visitation,finding it detrimental to the minor at this time.in january,at the review hearing,the juvenile court terminated the mother reunification services though not the father.her visitation remained suspended.
on february,the department filed an application for an injunction against the mother,along with an application to shorten time.the trial court issued a temporary restraining order ex parte and granted the application to shorten time.
on march,after a hearing,the trial court issued an injunction.the injunction named as protected persons a ll employees and staff of the department and also the family of social worker pamela keyes.it required the mother to stay at least yards away from any protected person,from any protected person home or vehicle,and from department offices.it also prohibited the mother from contacting any protected person,except as follows she could communicate with the department through her counsel she could communicate with her social worker in writing and she could communicate with her social worker if the social worker initiated the communication.the injunction was to remain in effect for three years.
the juvenile court authority to issue the injunction 
the mother contends that the juvenile court did not have the authority to issue the injunction.
we may assume,without deciding,that the injunction was not authorized under either welfare and institutions code section or welfare and institutions code section even if so,it was authorized under code of civil procedure section,which allows an employer to obtain an injunction prohibiting unlawful violence or threats of violence against its employees.code civ,subd.f see also,subd.a.
such an injunction can contain stay away and no contact provisions,if reasonably necessary to prevent future harm along the lines suggested by the defendant past threats.for example,in city of san jose garbett th,the trial court issued an injunction under code of civil procedure section ordering the defendant to stay yards away from protected persons and from city hall,except during city council meetings to use only specified entrances and staircases at city hall to be subject to search before entering the city council chambers and to file documents with the city clerk only by mail or through an intermediary,and not in person.city of san jose,at,fn.the appellate court held that these restrictions were not overbroad.id.at.
the judicial council is authorized to develop forms for use in connection with code of civil procedure section.code civ,subd.m.the restraining order form that it has adopted allows for both stay away and no contact provisions.judicial council forms,form wv,restraining order after hearing to stop workplace violence.the judicial council interpretation of the permissible scope of an injunction under code of civil procedure section is not binding on us,but it is highly persuasive.see sara superior court cal th.
code of civil procedure section can apply in a dependency case.a line of older intermediate appellate decisions seems to suggest code of civil procedure requirements do not apply to a juvenile dependency case unless the welfare and institutions code so provides.citations.in re th.however,t he better view is that application of a statute outside the welfare and institutions code and not expressly made applicable is not necessarily barred from dependency proceedings.courts should determine whether the statute at issue is consistent with the overall purposes of the dependency system.citation.id.at vexatious litigant statutes,code civ,et,apply in dependency proceedings see also in re claudia th,declaratory relief statute,code civ,applies in dependency proceedings in re mark cal.app th,sanctions statute,code civ,applies in dependency proceedings.
the juvenile court is a special department of the superior court whose powers are limited to those granted by the juvenile court law citation plus those incidental thereto.citations.under the juvenile court law,the juvenile court is authorized to make orders pertaining to abused or neglected children who come within the court jurisdiction.citations.in re ashley th,fn.omitted.an order preventing a parent from harassing the social services agency and its employees is reasonably pertinent to the protection of the child.admittedly,the agency could just file a petition for an injunction in a different department of the superior court.however,the juvenile court is in a better position to fine tune the injunction to the legitimate needs of the parent and the agency,as well as the child.the parent is also better off,because,if indigent,he or she has a right to a lawyer.welf.thus,code of civil procedure section,at least as applied in this case,is not merely consistent with but affirmatively furthers the overall purposes of the dependency system.
even if code of civil procedure section did not exist,however,the juvenile court would still have inherent power to issue an injunction like the one in this case.all courts have inherent powers which enable them to carry out their duties and ensure the orderly administration of justice.the inherent powers of courts are derived from article vi,section of the california constitution and are not dependent on statute.citations.in re amber th.
for example,in hernandez vitamin shoppe industries,th,when the lead plaintiff in a class action was about to settle,her attorney wrote to other class members,urging them to opt out and to retain him to represent them in a separate class action asserting the same claims against the same defendant.id.at.the trial court ordered him not to communicate with such class members.id.at.the appellate court sustained the order.it explained,a ll courts possess inherent supervisory or administrative powers to enable them to carry out their duties,albeit subject to certain limitations.citation.in a class action,a trial court has the authority and the duty to protect the rights of all parties,and to prevent abuses which might undermine the proper administration of justice.citation.where a trial court identifies a potential for abuse,the court has both the duty and the broad authority to exercise control over a class action and to enter appropriate orders governing the conduct of counsel and parties.citation.id.at.
in a dependency,no less than in a class action,the court has the inherent authority to prevent abuses that could undermine the proper administration of justice.i n performing some functions in juvenile dependency cases the social services agency serves as an arm of the court.citations.in re ashley,supra,th at.the agency proper performance of its duties is essential to the protection of the child.assuming that the mother was threatening employees of the department so as to intimidate them and prevent them from carrying out their duties,the juvenile court had not only the authority but also the duty to intervene.
the sufficiency of the evidence to support the injunction 
the mother contends that there was insufficient evidence to support the injunction,particularly once hearsay evidence,to which she objected below,is disregarded.
additional factual background.
along with its application,the department filed declarations by two of its employees.
declaration of jean texera.
jean texera was a child welfare services manager.she testified that,on february,the mother was told that her visitation was suspended.the mother then caused a disturbance in the lobby of the department offices at the carousel mall,yelling and cursing at a social worker.
texera met with the mother in a visitation room,accompanied by a security guard and a police officer.the mother began yelling and screaming obscenities at texera and at the security guard.she also made threatening and offensive statements and movements toward the security guard.texera was afraid that the mother was going to hit her.when the mother would not calm down and continued to shout obscenities,texera terminated the meeting.at first,the mother refused to leave,but eventually,t he guards were able to get her out of the building.
declaration of pamela keyes.
matters that keyes testified to based on personal knowledge.
pamela keyes was the social worker assigned to the case.she testified to the following matters that she had personally observed.
during a visit in march,keyes told the mother that the child seemed to be having some hearing problems,and he was going to be tested.he was sleeping the mother made noises with rattles and toys close to his head and snapped her fingers near his ears.when he did not wake up,she became very upset.she accused the foster parent of making the child deaf.at the end of the visit,she began yelling and screaming profanities at keyes.a security guard told her to leave the office,but she began cursing at him and repeating,y ou ca make me fucking leave.in keyes opinion,it was clear the mother behavior was escalating toward the potential for physical violence the police were called,and they arrested the mother.
in april,during a phone call with keyes,the mother said,i know a lot of people get physical with you all.as she kept talking about what other people do,keyes asked if she was referring to what she intended to do.the mother replied,i do talk about my intentions,i just do them.
in may,during a phone call,the mother said she did not want keyes to be at a certain upcoming meeting,because something bad will happen.
in december,prior to a scheduled meeting,the mother told keyes,y ou better have the police on.
matters that keyes testified to based on hearsay.
keyes also testified to the following matters,all of which had been reported to her by others,including police officers,department receptionists,and other social workers.
in february,when the mother was first informed that the department was going to detain the child,she yelled and cursed in the lobby of the department offices,preventing the conduct of business.she did not calm down until the police arrived.
when the child was in fact detained,the mother yelled and cursed at the social worker,despite the presence of police officers.she also lunged at the social worker,leading the officers to physically separate them.
on february,during a supervised visit,the mother called one social worker a fuck bitch and a damn motherfucker she added,f uck you,bitch.
on february,the juvenile court suspended the mother visitation.after the hearing,she refused to leave the courtroom.a bailiff escorted her out,but when she continued to shout and argue,he arrested her.he released her several hours later.
in april,the mother hung up on two receptionists and called one of them a stupid bitch.the next day,she phoned the department about times,making harassing,prank phone calls.the day after that,she continued to call repeatedly,tying up the phone lines and direct ing profanity at staff later in april,when she renewed this behavior,she was charged with making annoying telephone calls.
also in april,at the department offices,when the mother saw a particular social worker,she flipped the social worker off and she directed profanity at the social worker.
in may,the mother phoned and said she was on her way to fuck all you bitches up.the police were called.when she arrived,security guards prevented her from entering the building,but she threatened two social workers,saying she would kill them and their offspring.
two days later,the mother started making harassing phone calls again.as a result,a police officer went to her home.the officer either made or obtained a tape recording of the mother making threats against keyes and the entire c ounty.the officer arrested the mother and charged her with making criminal threats.on may,she pleaded guilty to making criminal threats,as a misdemeanor.she was sentenced to days in jail.as a condition of probation,she was ordered to stay away from receptionist april whitfield and social worker courtney roushion.she was also ordered not to make phone calls to the department unless they call first or unless for a lawful purpose.
in december,the mother made unspecified threats to receptionist whitfield.she also engaged in some stalking behavior near a bus stop that whitfield used.
most recently,on february,the mother told a therapist,natalie haghani,that if the father got custody,she was going to shoot keyes at the department offices.alternatively,if the father did not get custody,she had a plan for sneaking a gun into court,and she was going to use it to shoot keyes,the judge,and everyone else in the courtroom.as a result,the mother was arrested and charged with making criminal threats 
documentary evidence.
at the hearing,counsel for the department introduced two registers of actions,one from the may case in which the mother had pleaded guilty to making a criminal threat and one from the case in which she was charged with making a criminal threat.he also introduced a letter from therapist haghani regarding the mother recent threat to shoot keyes.
additional procedural background.
the mother did not file any written opposition to the department application,nor did she offer any evidence.at the hearing on the application,however,her counsel objected to keyes testimony about matters that she had learned from others,as hearsay.he also objected to the letter from haghani as hearsay.he then argued that the matters to which keyes had testified based on personal knowledge were stale,having occurred a year or so earlier,and did not involve any direct threats toward keyes.he pointed out that texera declaration also related to an incident that had occurred over a year earlier.
counsel for the department argued that the juvenile court was authorized to issue an injunction under welfare and institutions code section based on hearsay.alternatively,howeve
