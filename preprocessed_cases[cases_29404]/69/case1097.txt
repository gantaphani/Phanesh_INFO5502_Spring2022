defendant cb i constructors,cb i negligently caused a june wildfire that burned roughly acres of the angeles national forest in southern california.the united states brought a civil action against cb i to recover damages for harm caused by the fire.cb i does not contest its liability or the jury award of roughly million in fire suppression,emergency mitigation,and resource protection costs.it challenges only the jury additional award of million in intangible environmental damages.
the district court denied cb i motions for judgment as a matter of law and a new trial or remittitur,concluding that under california law the government could recover damages for all of the harm caused by the fire,including intangible harm to the environment.the court held that the government provided sufficient evidence for the jury to determine the amount of environmental damages,and that the resulting award was not grossly excessive.we affirm.
background 
factual background 
the angeles national forest covers roughly acres in the san gabriel mountains,just north of metropolitan los angeles.it was set aside for watershed protection and public use in as the first federal forest reserve in california.see anthony godfrey,the ever changing view a history of national forests in california.the forest service administers the forest for outdoor recreation,range,timber,watershed,and wildlife and fish purposes.it is part of a national forest system dedicated to the benefit for present and future generations.id.a.
the angeles national forest is an important environmental and recreational resource for southern californians,representing about percent of all open space in los angeles county.it is also a refuge for native plants and animals,including several threatened and endangered species.san francisquito canyon,a chaparral and sage scrub ecosystem surrounded by high ridges in the northwestern part of the national forest,contains known populations of several species protected under the endangered species act,including the bald eagle,california condor,southwest willow,and california red legged frog.the red legged frog was once widespread throughout the region,but now has only three known populations in southern california.the largest of the three populations is in san francisquito canyon,where the frog remains extremely vulnerable to local extinction.
in april,a county water district hired merco construction engineers,merco to build four water storage tanks for a housing project in the city of santa clarita.merco subcontracted with cb i to construct two of the steel tanks.the site was on private land,next to a hillside about a half mile from the national forest.as the general contractor,merco maintained a superintendent at the construction site for part of the work day.cb i encouraged its employees to work quickly by offering them a financial bonus if they completed the tanks in fewer hours than initially projected.
on june,the air temperature at the work site exceeded degrees.a crew from cb i worked through the heat to perform tasks that posed known fire hazards.neither cb i nor merco had taken several recommended fire prevention precautions,such as clearing brush feet from the tanks,regularly watering dry vegetation,or keeping a fire watch on the ground while the crew worked on the roof.
at about,a cb i employee was on the roof of the tank operating an electric grinder.the grinder cuts and smooths metal with a rotating abrasive disc that sends out a trail of sparks and hot metal slag.the employee was directing the sparks away from his coworkers and off the edge of the tank toward the dry brush.he saw that the sparks ignited a fire,but by the time the crew descended from the roof the fire was out of control.
as the fire spread,it burned about acres of private and property.it quickly reached the national forest where it burned another acres,or more than square miles.federal,state,and county firefighters fought the fire for nearly a week before they contained it on june.the government incurred roughly million in fire suppression costs.the fire became known as the copper fire.
the cb i welding crew returned to work the day after starting the fire.company employees eventually received a bonus for completing the water tanks in fewer hours than originally projected.
within the national forest,some of the greatest fire damage occurred in san francisquito canyon.the fire burned pretty much all of the native chaparral and sage scrub vegetation in the canyon,opening the door to invasive,nonnative plants that increase the risk of future fires.for example,the copper fire spread an infestation of arundo donax a highly invasive giant reed that grows as fast as eighteen inches per day,outcompetes native vegetation,and clogs waterways.the fire also created a serious flood hazard by destroying vegetation that normally intercepts the flow of rainwater and allows for filtration of the water into the soil.first english evangelical lutheran church of glendale los angeles,d discussing a july forest fire and resulting february flood in the angeles national forest.the copper fire increased the rates of sedimentation in the canyon watershed by up to three times its normal amount.much of san francisquito creek filled in with ash and dead trees.
the forest service assembled a burned area emergency rehabilitation baer team of specialists to coordinate immediate erosion control measures after the fire.the team included a hydrologist,soil scientist,botanist,biologist,and archeologist.based on the team recommendations,the forest service installed drainage on forest roads and built a large,catchment basin to trap mudflow from denuded hillsides.the total cost of baer work was about.the government also estimated about in anticipated resource protection costs,such as manually removing arundo dorax from about burned acres and surveying and reestablishing boundary markers damaged by the fire.
in september,as part of the baer process,the forest service closed public access to areas where the national forest most needed to recover.the forest service prohibited all users in these areas for one year,and horseback riders,bicycles,and vehicles for two.vegetation had regrown by roughly when the closures ended in september.however,researchers estimated it would take as long as to years for the national forest to recover from the fire.
the fire and subsequent floods destroyed more than of the california red legged frog habitat in the national forest.in,before the fire,about to adult california red legged frogs lived along san francisquito creek.by,researchers saw only about to frogs.researchers expressed concern that the small size of the remaining population would result in a lack of genetic diversity,making the population more susceptible to diseases and other threats.
the copper fire also caused extreme damage to the hazel dell mining camp,an abandoned graphite mine in the national forest with historically significant cabins and from the early twentieth century.the fire consumed all of the camp wooden structures and contents and collapsed two horizontal mining tunnels.it left the vegetation at the site moonscaped and burned beyond recognition.damage from the fire reduced the site historical value and integrity to the point where the camp was no longer eligible for listing on the national register of historic places.
procedural background 
in june,the united states filed a civil action against cb i and merco to recover tort damages resulting from the copper fire.during a jury trial in september,the government presented evidence of monetary costs for its fire suppression,baer,and resource protection efforts.the government also called expert witnesses who testified about environmental harm to scenic views,recreational use,soil stability,water quality,plant life,wildlife habitat,the red legged frog population,and the mining camp.however,the government did not elicit testimony that put a dollar amount on the environmental harm.it maintained that the environmental damages are not susceptible to empirical calculation because they are measured by their value to the public and for posterity.
in its closing argument,the government described the intangible environmental harm as a category of damage that you,the jury,are going to decide based on your assessment of the evidence.the government asked the jury,what is the fact that the hazel dell mining camp is there anymore worth what is it worth that the california red legged f rog has been compromised and the gene pool polluted what is it worth that the grasses have been changed and other aspects of the angeles national forest have been changed the government suggested two possible ways the jury could calculate an award for the intangible environmental damages first,by applying a multiplier to the hard damages or second,by determining a price per acre for the acres of burned national forest land.
the district court instructed the jury,the united states does not have to prove the exact amount of damages that will provide reasonable compensation for the harm.however,you must not speculate or guess in awarding damages.the court also instructed the jury not to include any punitive damages for the purpose of punishing or making an example of the defendant.
the jury returned a special verdict finding cb i and merco liable for negligence and trespass by fire,allocating of the fault to cb i and to merco.it awarded roughly million for fire suppression,baer,and resource protection costs in the amounts requested by the government.the jury also awarded the government an additional million for intangible environmental damages,or per acre of burned national forest land.
merco had settled with the government for million just before the jury returned its verdict.in november,the district court entered a judgment against cb i,offsetting its damages liability based on the merco settlement.pursuant to california civil code,the court held cb i jointly and severally liable for the million in economic damages,but only severally liable for its share of the million in intangible environmental damages.cb i share of the environmental damages award was million.
in december,cb i renewed an earlier motion for judgment as a matter of law.the company did not challenge its liability,or the jury award of million in economic damages.rather,cb i argued that the intangible environmental damages were not compensable.the company also moved for a new trial or remittitur,arguing that the million award was excessive.
in january,the district court denied both motions.it wrote 
in burning acres of the angeles national forest,the copper fire harmed lands held in trust for this and future generations.the government should be able to recover damages for all of the damages caused by the fire,including the intangible environmental damages,and the trial provided sufficient evidence for the jurors to quantify that harm.
cb i timely appealed.energy utilities that operate transmission lines in california forests,and tree companies that trim or remove trees for the utilities,filed amicus briefs supporting cb i on appeal collectively amici.

iii.discussion 
on appeal,cb i makes three primary arguments challenging its share of the million jury award for intangible environmental damages.first,cb i argues that intangible noneconomic damages are not compensable in tort suits alleging harm to property.second,it contends that the government did not produce sufficient evidence for the jury to determine the amount of environmental damages in a rational way.finally,cb i argues that the jury award was grossly excessive.we take the three arguments in turn.
compensability of intangible environmental damages 
state law governs the federal government recovery of damages for harm caused by fires in national forests.see united states california,cir.
california general tort statute provides that the proper measure of damages is the amount which will compensate the plaintiff for all the detriment proximately caused thereby,whether it could have been anticipated or not.cal.there is no fixed rule for the measure of tort damages under civil code section.the measure that most appropriately compensates the injured party for the loss sustained should be adopted.santa barbara pistachio ranch chowchilla water dist,th,d.what is apparent from the cases is the flexibility employed in the approach to measuring damages and the broad scope of alternative theories applied to fit the particular circumstances of a case.id.at,d see also witkin,summary of california law,torts ed.the different kinds of real property and varying types of injury make it unwise to establish a fixed rule governing damages,and consequently a number of alternative theories are applied.
california also has a specific statutory provision governing liability for negligently set fires.it provides 
any person who personally or through another wilfully,negligently,or in violation of law,sets fire to,allows fire to be set to,or allows a fire kindled or attended by him to escape to,the property of another,whether privately or publicly owned,is liable to the owner of such property for any damages to the property caused by the fire.
cal.health safety code.based on the provision broad language and history of liberal construction,a california court of appeal held that section places no restrictions on the type of property damage that is compensable.mckay california,th,d.california courts have neither deviated from nor limited the reach of the provision,and generally treat it as an addition to rather than deduction from plaintiffs general protections against negligent harm.anderson united states,cir.
landowners in california may recover damages for all the harm,including environmental injuries,caused by negligently set fires.in people southern pacific,d,the court recognized that a private landowner was entitled to both the fair market value of destroyed timber as well as the cost of restoring the property through reforestation.id.at.the court reasoned that the fire damaged plaintiff property not only through destruction of trees used for timber,but through damage to the soil these are separate injuries.see also mckay,th at,d permitting recovery of lost agricultural profits,as well as diminution in value of a burned acre farm.
more recently,a california court of appeal upheld a negligence award of more than million against cb i for damage that the copper fire caused to a private,acre ranch near santa clarita.kelly cb i constructors,th,d.the fire destroyed about oak trees on the property,damaged several structures,and was a substantial factor in subsequent mudslides that gouged a foot long gully across a pasture.id.at,d.the court of appeal affirmed an award of more than million in restoration costs including roughly million for erosion and flood control,streambed reconstruction,and removing silt and sand from a pasture even though these damages substantially exceeded the market value of the property before the fire.id.at,d.the court also upheld an additional in damages for harm to trees on the property.id.at,d.
federal courts have allowed the government to recover environmental damages for negligently set forest fires on protected public land in california.in feather river lumber united states,cir,we affirmed a damages award against a negligent lumber company for harm caused to merchantable timber in the national forest as well as to young growth,which while it had no market value,had a value to its owner.id.at.we explained that the measure of damages for the merchantable timber was the market value of the trees,but that the measure of damages for young growth in the national forest,which could not be sold,was the damage actually sustained,that is to say,what was required to make the government whole.id.we held that this amount might properly include the cost of restoring the land to th
