we are once again asked to consider whether the california department of health care services department director,david director,should be enjoined from implementing state legislation reducing payments to certain medical service providers.in this latest set of appeals,california pharmacists,a group of adult day health care centers adhcs,hospitals,pharmacies,and beneficiaries of the state medicaid program,challenge a five percent reduction in those payments we affirm,and hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting california pharmacists motion for a preliminary injunction because the state failed to stud y the impact of the five percent rate reduction on the statutory factors of efficiency,economy,quality,and access to care prior to implementing the rate reductions.indep.living ctr.of,cir independent living ii.
factual and procedural background 
medicaid and 
under title xix of the social security act the medicaid act,et,the federal government provides funds to participating states to enabl e each state,as far as practicable to furnish medical assistance on behalf of families with dependent children and of aged,blind,or disabled individuals,whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services.medicaid is a cooperative program that directs federal funding to states to assist them in providing medical assistance to individuals.katie ex rel.ludin los angeles county,cir.as we have stated many times,it is the states that choose whether to participate in medicaid.should a state choose to participate in the medicaid program,it must comply with federal medicaid law.id.california has chosen to participate in the program.
to receive federal funds,states must administer their programs in compliance with individual state plans for medical assistance,which require approval by the federal secretary of health and human services.the state plan must s pecify a single state agency established or designated to administer or supervise the administration of the plan.the agency,the department,is the state agency responsible for the administration of california version of medicaid,the program.orthopaedic hosp.belshe,cir orthopaedic ii.
the medicaid act provides detailed requirements for state plans.see a.one of those provisions is a a hereafter a,the provision at issue in this appeal.under a,a state plan must 
provide such methods and procedures relating to the payment for care and services as may be necessary to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area.
id.a a.thus,a state plan must establish health care provider reimbursement rates that are,among other things consistent with medical care quality of care and sufficient to enlist enough providers to ensure that medical services are generally available to medicaid recipients access to care.indep.living ctr.of,shewry,cir independent living i.
ii.assembly bill 
on february,the california legislature enacted assembly bill ab in special session.see cal.legis.serv.ch.ab reduced by ten percent payments under the program for physicians,dentists,pharmacies,adhcs,clinics,health systems,and other providers for services provided on or after july.cal.welf.b.section of the california welfare institutions code also reduced payments to managed health care plans by the actuarial equivalent of the ten percent payment reduction.id.b.finally,ab reduced payments to acute care hospitals not under contract with the department for inpatient services.id.c.under ab,these cuts were scheduled to take effect on july.
in independent living ii,a group of pharmacies,health care providers,senior citizens groups,and beneficiaries brought an action under the supremacy clause,alleging that ab conflicted with the requirements of a.we agreed,and held that under orthopaedic ii a requires the director to set provider reimbursement rates that bear a reasonable relationship to efficient and economical hospitals costs of providing quality services,unless the department shows some justification for rates that substantially deviate from such costs.indep.living ii,at quoting orthopaedic ii,at.we explained that orthopaedic ii interpreted a to require the director to rely on responsible cost studies,its own or others,that provide reliable data as a basis for its rate setting.id.at quoting orthopaedic ii,at.however,prior to enacting ab,
t he director failed to provide any evidence that the department or the legislature studied the impact of the ten percent rate reduction on the statutory factors of efficiency,economy,quality,and access to care,nor did the director demonstrate that the department considered reliable cost studies when adjusting its reimbursement rates.
iii.assembly bill 
on september,the california legislature passed assembly bill ab,which became effective on september.see cal.legis.serv.ch.ab amended b to provide that the ten percent rate reductions previously called for in ab would end on february.id.ab also added and amended of the california welfare institutions code,for either one percent,five percent,or ten percent rate reductions,depending on provider type.see cal.welf.
on january,california pharmacists challenged the ab reimbursement rate reductions.california pharmacists sought to enjoin the director from implementing ab five percent reduction in payments to adhcs.adhcs provide an alternative to institutional care,responding to the state need to establish and to continue a system of quality adult day health care which will enable elderly persons or adults with disabilities to maintain maximum independence.cal.health safety code.though recognizing the need for custodial care,the california legislature has concluded that overreliance on custodial care has proven to be a costly panacea in both financial and human terms,often traumatic,and destructive of continuing family relationships and the capacity for independent living.id.
the district court granted the preliminary injunction.it held that california pharmacists had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits for three reasons.first,the legislative history showed no indication that the legislature considered a prior to passage of ab.second,since the department was given no discretion to alter the rate reductions imposed by the legislature,any analysis that the department completed in february,and thus after the reductions were enacted,did not satisfy the requirements of orthopaedic ii.and third,any analysis conducted by the department was inadequate because the department relied on costs incurred at intermediate care facilities,which the district court considered to be an inadequate proxy for adhc costs.the district court also held that california pharmacists had demonstrated a risk of irreparable harm and that the balance of equities and public interest weighed in favor of injunctive relief.the director timely appealed.
the director raises three issues on appeal.first,the director argues that the district court erred in holding that the legislature itself was required to conduct cost studies or analyses prior to enactment of ab to determine whether the proposed rate reductions complied with the efficiency,economy,and quality of care provisions of a.second,the director contends that even if the legislature was required to conduct the relevant analysis,the district court committed clear error in concluding that the legislature did not adequately consider the a factors prior to enacting ab.third,the director argues that the district court erred in concluding that california pharmacists had met their burden of demonstrating irreparable harm with respect to reduced reimbursement rates under ab.

discussion 
in seeking a preliminary injunction in a case in which the public interest is involved,a plaintiff must overcome four hurdles.thus,california pharmacists must show that they are likely to succeed on the merits they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief the balance of equities tips in their favor and an injunction is in the public interest.cal.pharms.ass,cir citing winter.at see also am.trucking ass ns,city of los angeles,cir.
likelihood of success on the merits 
in orthopaedic ii,we held that a requires 
the director to set hospital outpatient reimbursement rates that bear a reasonable relationship to efficient and economical hospitals costs of providing quality services,unless the department shows some justification for rates that substantially deviate from such costs.to do this,the department must rely on responsible cost studies,its own or others,that provide reliable data as a basis for its rate setting.
we address the director arguments in turn.
a.the body responsible for complying with a 
first,the director argues that orthopaedic ii did not hold that rate setting must be based upon legislative studies undertaken and completed by the legislature itself prior to legislative action authorizing a state department to implement rate reductions.according to the director,at issue in orthopaedic ii were statutorily mandated rate changes not unlike those set pursuant to ab.however,despite those enactments,we focused solely on the department actions,rather than on the legislature,and thus only the department is required to consider the a factors.we disagree.
in orthopaedic ii,none of the disputed was actually set by the legislature.see orthopaedic hosp.kizer,wl,orthopaedic i.to the contrary,the legislative enactments granted the director broad discretion to set the applicable rates in the face of general governing criteria.see,orthopaedic i,wl,at describing that reimbursement rates for rural hospitals were to be set at a level which will provide incentives for rural hospitals to focus on the provision of outpatient services and reduce the financial losses incurred by the facilities id.at describing that for delivery services rates the department shall eliminate the reimbursement differential for obstetrical services by equalizing reimbursement for caesarean and section deliveries id.at statute required the department to amend the method for reimbursing disproportionate share hospitals for outpatient services,to which the department responded by developing a new payment methodology.since the director set the challenged rates,orthopaedic ii addressed whether the medicaid act requires the department to consider the costs hospitals incur in delivering services when setting specific payment rates under a.at emphases added.looking to the clear language in the statute,we noted that a provides that payments for services must be consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care,and that those payments must be sufficient to enlist enough providers to provide access to medicaid recipients.id.we reasoned that costs were an integral factor to be considered in the payment calculus,since t he department can not know that it is setting rates that are consistent with a relevant factors without considering the costs of providing such services.id.emphasis added.thus,we held that payments for hospital outpatient services must bear a reasonable relationship to the costs of providing quality of care incurred by efficiently and economically operated hospitals.id.
unlike the statutes at issue in orthopaedic ii,the state has taken a different approach to setting rates under ab.under ab,the legislature mandated that the director reduce provider payments by a fixed percentage.see,cal.welf.b p ayments to the following classes of providers shall be reduced by percent for benefits.thus,the director is misguided in arguing that our focus on the department in orthopaedic ii absolves the legislature of the same requirements when it sets rates.in other words,in orthopaedic ii,there was no question that the department set reimbursement rates.those rates provided payments for the medical service at issue under the state,hospital outpatient services.we had no reason to focus on what the state legislature considered before rates were set since the legislature was one step removed from the regulations promulgated by the department.as noted,the legislature merely outlined broad goals for the department,a process separate and distinct from determining the effect of a specific rate reduction on the statutory factors of efficiency,economy,quality,and access to care.yet if the legislature elects to the department,and set rates itself,it must engage in the same principled analysis we required of the director in orthopaedic ii.
moreover,in orthopaedic i,the director made the inverse of the argument he asserts here.there,he argued that in enacting the governing statutes,the legislature considered the relevant a factors,thus excusing the department need to do the same when it set rates based on the legislature commands.see orthopaedic i,wl,at.the district court rejected this argument,holding first that the statutes did not purport to establish any specific payment rates,id.at,and second that even if the legislature had considered the relevant factors,that did not relieve the department of the obligation to further consider the relevant factors in exercising what discretion it had in implementing the legislature general mandate,id.at.in addition,the court noted,nor is there adequate evidence in the record demonstrating that the state legislature at any time considered the relevant factors in connection with the equalization of rates.id.the district court explained 
in sum,if there was evidence both that in setting the challenging rates,the department had merely in rote fashion been implementing a statutory enactment that did not permit the department to exercise any significant discretion whatsoever,and further,that the legislature in enacting the statute had expressly considered efficiency,economy,and quality of care,the court might agree that the department need not have considered efficiency,economy,and quality of care,at all.but there is convincing evidence of neither.
id.thus,we are not telling the state something new.
indeed,we find no distinction between the method by which rates were set under either ab or ab.under ab,the california legislature enacted a statutorily mandated rate reduction.in holding that the director violated a when he implemented ab rate reductions,we held t he director failed to provide any evidence that the department or the legislature studied the impact of the ten percent rate reduction on the statutory factors prior to enacting ab.indep.living ii,at emphases added.we noted several times our concern with the context in which the legislation was passed,and focused on what state officials failed to consider prior to enactment.see id.at holding that the state decision to pass legislation reducing reimbursement rates for purely budgetary concerns violated federal law id.at concluding that the state legislative analyst was the only state official to have alone studied the impact of the rate reduction on services provided to beneficiaries id.at nothing in the record connects the decision to cut reimbursement rates by ten percent to a factfinding process initiated by state officials.such an approach is consistent with that of our sister circuits,where in the context of legislative,as opposed to agency,they too have focused on ensuring that the legislative body had information before it so that it could properly consider efficiency,economy,quality of care,and access to services before enacting rates.see.homecare ass n,gomez,cir holding that although the agency did not provide any formal a analysis to the legislature,lobbyists actively participated in the legislative session such that the legislature adequately considered a when it raised reimbursement rates.med.soc y,reynolds,cir refusing to consider evidence offered during agency hearings regarding the effect of rate cuts on accessibility because it could only be confirmed by historical data accumulated after the cuts were made 
in sum,we find nothing remarkable in holding that the final body responsible for setting medicaid reimbursement rates must study the impact of the contemplated rate reduction on the statutory factors of efficiency,economy,quality of care,and access to care prior to setting or adjusting payment rates.we emphasize that the state need not follow any prescribed method of analyzing and considering the a factors.homecare ass n,at orthopaedic ii,at refusing to impose a rigid formula for the department to follow.but as we stated in orthopaedic ii,congress intended payments to be flexible within a range payments should be no higher than what is required to provide efficient and economical care,but still high enough to provide for quality care and to ensure access to services.at.the only way to ensure that congress intent is realized is for the state to study the impact of the contemplated rate change on the statutory factors prior to setting rates.thus,in no way do we mean to suggest that the state is proscribed from setting or adjusting reimbursement rates.we simply reaffirm that if it does so,it must comply with federal law.
legislative consideration prior to setting rates 
having determined that the state legislature was required to study the impact of the five percent rate reduction on the statutory factors of efficiency,economy,quality,and access to care prior to enacting ab,we next consider whether it did so.the director argues that even though the legislature was not required to do so,the district court committed clear error in concluding that the legislature did not adequately consider the a factors prior to implementing ab.
in support of his argument,the director submits the declaration of the department deputy director for legislative and governmental affairs.the deputy director states that in may,the senate and assembly proposals were released in public hearings held by the senate and assembly budget committees.according to the deputy director,department employees provid ed information,technical assistance,and responses to numerous inquiries to legislative staff members concerning the various and rate reductions that were included in ab.the director also references the may,agenda released by the assembly budget subcommitee on health and human services.that agenda lists certain items to be heard including proposed actions to maintain essential health care services and eligibility,such as restore provider rate cut for physicians and other healthcare providers and partially restore care rate reductions enacted in ab x reduce cut from to.the only proposed action that includes a discussion relevant to adhcs explains that individuals with developmental disabilities living in intermediate care facilities are eligible for adhc services,and that such clarification in a trailer bill is necessary so that the state department of developmental services will no longer have to fund these adhc services at percent general fund cost.
next,the director points to the california senate committee on budget and fiscal review for may,which includes recommendations for modification of several rate reductions or elimination of services.with respect to adhc services,one entry contains the same description of the proposed trailer bill needed to clarify that individuals with developmental disabilities in intermediate care facilities are eligible for participation in the adhc program.the other entry relevant to adhcs is a brief explanation of the department request for an increase in funds for adhc services due to an increase in enrollees.
the director also points to the june,subcommittee health,human services,labor,and veterans affairs major action report.that report notes certain of the department highlights for the program.the deputy director calls particular attention to the entry that indicates that the budget bill provided a partial restoration to the rates reimbursed under by providing a percent restoration to the percent reduction as proposed by the governor and taken in special session through ab.in the program,this resulted in an increase of about million million general fund.the report also noted adoption of the adhc proposals set forth above.
the director further points to the budget conference committee action list dated july,which shows seven items that the assembly and senate voted on,ultimately contained in ab,such as partial restoration of provider payments and partial restoration of pharmacy rate.the director argues that this action list illustrates that the assembly and senate voted on the very rate reduction language that was ultimately contained in ab.the july summary overview budget conference committee report summarizes many of the rate reductions enacted as part of ab.finally,the director refers to the state legislative analyst office analysis of the budget,which includes recommendations from the state legislative analyst concerning the governor proposed reductions to provider reimbursement.
the district court explicitly mentioned the legislative history described above with the exception of the legislative analyst office analysis,and determined that it does not show that there was consideration of the a factors.we agree,since the legislative history nowhere mentions any of the a factors,see orthopaedic i,wl,at not dispositively the terms efficiency,economy,and equality sic of care appear nowhere in these documents,and is concerned solely with budgetary matters,see indep.living ii,at state budgetary concerns can not be the conclusive factor in decisions regarding medicaid.internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,the legislative history contains no indication that,in adjusting rates under ab,the state rel ied on responsible cost studies,its own or others,that provide reliable data as a basis for its rate setting.id.at quoting orthopaedic ii,at.the legislative analyst office analysis of the budget appears to be the very same report we referenced in independent living ii.see id.at.it discusses the governor proposal of a ten percent provider rate reduction,which the state own legislative analyst recommended rejecting for all providers except hospitals because those rate reductions had the potential to negatively impact the operation of the program and the services provided to beneficiaries by limiting access to providers and services.it is hardly clear error for the district court to have failed to mention a report conducted without regard to the specific rate reductions before it.accordingly,we will not disrupt the district court factual findings,as they are not clearly erroneous.
c.the department analysis 
the director also argues that the district court erred in failing to consider the analysis conducted by the department,completed after the law enactment.in rejecting the department analysis,the district court held that ab did not provide the department with any discretion,citing cal.welf.a,which provides that n otwithstanding any other provision of law,in order to implement changes in the level of funding for health care services,the director shall reduce provider payments.emphasis added.the district court reasoned that since the department was not given any authority to alter the rate reduction imposed by the legislature,the department post hoc analysis does not satisfy the requirements of orthopaedic ii.the district court went on to hold that even if a post hoc analysis was sufficient,the department relied on an inadequate proxy for adhc costs when it considered data for.
to satisfy a,any analysis of reimbursement rates on the statutory factors of efficiency,economy,quality,and access to care,must have the potential to influence the process.see indep.living ii,at holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that post hoc rationalizations of the disputed reimbursement rates do not satisfy the procedural requirements of orthopaedic ii see also orthopaedic ii,at t he department must consider hospitals costs based on reliable information when setting reimbursement rates emphases added.med.soc y,at.yet the department analysis of ab with respect to adhcs was issued on february,more than five months after the legislature enacted ab,but prior to the cuts implementation.therefore,for the department analysis to have the requisite potential effect,the director would have to have discretion regarding implementation of the rates.
in his reply brief,and for the first time in this litigation,the director argues that the department study is sufficient because the department retained discretion under ab not to implement the reductions before march.thus,the director argues,the department february,analysis would still be meaningful because the director had authority to affect rates by deciding not to implement them although the director has clearly waived this argument by failing to raise it in his opening brief,see indep.towers of washington,cir,we nevertheless consider and reject the director argument on the merits.
the director argues that if the department determined that the reduced payments for any services would not comply with the relevant a factors,the department retained the not to implement those reductions.as a result,the legislature made implementation of the rate reductions dependent on whether the department determined that they complied with federal law 
the director relies on i,which states 
the department shall promptly seek any necessary federal approvals for the implementation of this section.to the extent that federal financial participation is not available with respect to any payment that is reduced or limited pursuant to this section,the director may elect not to implement that reduction or limitation.
cal.welf.i.the director also points to the enabling statute,cal.welf.a 
the director shall prescribe the policies to be followed in the administration of this chapter,may limit the rates of payment for health care services,and shall adopt any rules and regulations as are necessary for carrying out,but are not inconsistent with,the provisions thereof.
subsection a goes on to provide 
in order to implement expeditiously the budgeting decisions of the legislature,the director shall,to the extent permitted by federal law,adopt regulations setting rates that reflect these budgeting decisions within one month after the enactment of the budget act and of any other appropriation that changes the level of funding for services.
cal.welf.a.
the director is not the most natural reading of the statute.section i does not clearly invest the director with the discretion not to implement the legislature rate reductions.rather,it first directs the department to seek any necessary federal approvals to implement the rate reductions.cal.welf.i.only then does it permit the director not to implement any reduction t o the extent that federal financial participation is not available.id.emphasis added.thus,the most natural reading would seem to be one of budgetary concern if federal money is not available for any particular payment reduction,the director may choose to save the state money by not implementing the reduction.such a reading comports with the budgetary nature of ab legislative history.see.state bd.for charter sch.dep t of,cir when a natural reading of the statute leads to a rational,commonsense result,an alteration of meaning is not only unnecessary,but also extrajudicial.
the director asks that we read into the statutory text a process by which the department could first analyze the impact of the five percent payment reduction on the a factors and then elect to implement the reduction based on that analysis.however,regardless of whether any such process was contemplated in the statute,the record clearly demonstrates that no process of the kind the director envisions took place.first,on september,the department submitted its state plan amendment,incorporating ab rate reductions.in its state plan amendment,the department stated that it had determined that payments will continue to comply with any upper spending limits contained in part that were adopted to implement the efficiency,economy,and quality of care provision of a.beneficiaries will continue to have access to covered services as required by part.yet the department did not issue a a analysis until february,and produced nothing that would indicate that it studied the impact of ab on efficiency,economy,quality,and access to care prior to september.the state plan amendment also does not mention the department discretion not to implement the rate reductions based on federal participation.
in addition,on february,the state published notice in the california regulatory notice register that section of the welfare and institutions code is reducing the payments that would otherwise be paid for adult day health care services under the current rate methodology from percent to percent for dates of service on or after march.the state notice further provided that the department 
is mandated by state law to implement the above change in reimbursement.the department has considered the impact of this reimbursement on providers and beneficiaries.the department assessment is that reimbursement will continue to compensate a high percentage of costs incurred for these facility services and that beneficiaries will continue to have access to these services consistent with a.
as with the state plan amendment,the notice any analysis issued by the department,yet definitively announces payment reductions from ten to five percent.moreover,the notice states that the department is mandated to implement the rates,further undermining the director reading of i.
in sum,the director argument that he retained discretion not to implement ab rate reductions is not supported by the record.the department february analysis issued well after decisions had been made to reduce payments by five percent,and nothing in the record indicates that the department retained the discretion not to implement the rate reductions based on a a analysis.to comply with a,the state must study the impact of the contemplated rate reduction on the statutory factors of efficiency,economy,quality,and access to care prior to legislative enactment or in a manner that allows meaningful consideration of such input prior to implementation.here,the state did neither.
in addition,regardless of whether the director retained the discretion to act in the manner he posits,we agree with the district court that the department analysis was insufficient.reviewing for clear error,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the department reliance on rather than adhc data was inadequate.the department looked to the average costs of only six facilities,with widely varied costs,as a proxy for the adhcs in the program.in its adhc analysis,completed in february,the department explained that it had just begun the process of auditing the costs of adhcs for purposes of establishing rates under the new costs based methodology that is scheduled to go into effect on august,and therefore,in order to assess how adhc reimbursement compares to the costs that may be incurred by an adhc in pr
