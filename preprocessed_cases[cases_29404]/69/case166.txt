background 
we begin by summarizing briefly the relevant facts as found by the district court.wheeled coach,a florida corporation,manufactures ambulances for sale throughout the united states.in,wheeled coach sold its first ambulance in puerto rico,and from that first sale onward,a puerto rico corporation,initiated and managed wheeled coach relations with its clients in puerto rico.until the events that brought about this suit,had been involved in every sale of a wheeled coach ambulance in puerto rico.

ii.analysis 
law was enacted to remedy the abusive practices of suppliers who arbitrarily eliminated distributors after they had invested in the business and had successfully established a market in puerto rico for the supplier product or service.triangle trading,robroy,cir quoting gonzález brown group,internal quotations omitted.to this end,act regulates the termination of a supplier relationship with a dealer,providing that,regardless of any unilateral right to terminate present in a contract,no principal or grantor may directly or indirectly perform any act detrimental to the established relationship,except for just cause.laws ann.
provisional remedies under law are provided by the statute 
in any litigation in which there is involved the termination of a dealer contract,the court may grant,during the time the litigation is pending resolution,any provisional remedy ordering any of the parties,or both,to continue,in all its terms,the relation established by the dealer contract,to abstain from performing any act or any omission in prejudice thereof.in any case in which the provisional remedy herein provided is requested,the court shall consider the interests of all parties concerned and the purposes of the public policy contained in this chapter.
laws ann.article the question before us is whether there has been a sufficient showing that is a dealer who may take advantage of law provisional remedies.
this court has jurisdiction to hear interlocutory appeals of preliminary injunction orders under a.in reviewing a preliminary injunction,we scrutinize abstract legal matters de novo,findings of fact for clear error,and judgment calls with considerable deference to the trier.new comm wireless,sprintcom,cir citing langlois abington hous,cir.despite wheeled coach contentions to the contrary,our review of the evidence before the district court at the preliminary injunction hearing fails to indicate clear error in the district court findings of fact thus,on the basis of the facts found by the district court,we review de novo the question of whether the relationship between and wheeled coach warrants protection for preliminary injunction purposes as a dealer under law.
law defines a dealer as a person actually interested in a dealer contract because of his having effectively in his charge in puerto rico the distribution,agency,concession or representation of a given merchandise or service.laws ann.a.a dealer contract is defined as a relationship established between a dealer and a principal or grantor whereby and irrespectively of the manner in which the parties may call,characterize or execute such relationship,the former actually and effectively takes charge of the distribution of a merchandise,or of the rendering of a service,by concession or franchise,on the market of puerto rico.laws ann.b.
both federal and puerto rico courts have recognized that this broad definition of a dealer encompasses a wide range of actors within the distribution process and threatens to extend act protective sweep well beyond the end that the statute sought to achieve.triangle trading,at.in triangle trading,we outlined the factors to be considered in determining whether an actor is a dealer protected by law,relying on the supreme court of puerto rico decision in roberco,oxford,offic.trans,wl 
the roberco court reviewed the legislative history of act and the existing case law,of both puerto rico and the federal courts,to develop an inclusive list of factors to be weighed equally in consideration of whether a party has the requisite autonomy to be a dealer under the act.observing that something beyond mere contact with the product as it moves down the chain from manufacturer to supplier is necessary,the court restricted the definition of a dealer to an independent entrepreneur who has established a continuing relationship,either fixed or indeterminate,with another principal for the distribution of a product or service geared to create,develop,and coordinate a market and to obtain new clients.from this definition the court derived the following characteristics of a dealership promotion of the product,keeping an inventory,fixing prices,delivery and billing responsibilities,authority to extend credit,advertising campaigns,assumption of risk,purchasing the product,maintaining facilities,and offering services to clients.
triangle trading,at citing roberco,offic.trans.at,internal quotations omitted.triangle trading makes clear that must do more than provide evidence that it developed a market for wheeled coach and made a financial investment,because those facts alone are not dispositive as they apply to any sales agent or middleman.id.at.
wheeled coach urges this court to conclude that is not a dealer for the purposes of law because,inter alia,does not purchase the ambulances for resale,does not maintain an inventory of wheeled coach ambulances in puerto rico,and does not assume a risk of financial loss beyond any fees or fines imposed in the case of late or failed delivery of ambulances.contends that its failure to purchase or maintain an inventory of wheeled coach ambulances and the resulting diminution of some of the typical financial risks of distributorship are due to the customized nature of the item being sold,since each ambulance must be manufactured to meet the precise specifications of the client.
the district court agreed,concluding that since,has performed the duties traditionally performed by a distributor,tempered to the particular product to be distributed,in this case,custom made ambulances,wheeled coach,d.in reaching this conclusion,the district court noted that the supreme court of puerto rico has made it clear that when considering the factors in roberco not all had to be satisfied in order to determine that a plaintiff is an act distributor.instead,a trial court must consider said factors in light of the evidence presented.id.at.the court distinguished the case of cobos liccia dejean packing,where the plaintiff was denied dealer status under law because it failed to fulfill even one of the roberco criteria.id.at.
here,fulfills several of the roberco criteria,including active promotion and closing of contracts,exerting control over prices taking responsibility for delivery as evidenced by their exposure to fines for late delivery,and assuming the risks and responsibility of its actions,if a client subsequently decides not to purchase an ambulance after it is ordered,must compensate wheeled coach.
wheeled coach argues that can not be a dealer under law because it never obtains title to the ambulances,directing the court attention to franceschini riley,a n act distributor is not a mere agent of the principal but acts on its own with full ownership of the goods sold.in franceschini,however,the court decided that the plaintiff was not a law dealer because it was a mere forwarder of orders who did not have the authority to close or conclude the sales contracts it promoted.id.at.despite the court reference to ownership,then,the decision in franceschini relies on its conclusion that the ultimate matter to be determined is whether all activities performed,be they warehousing,delivery,advertising,add up to the development of a market through promotion and closing of sales contracts.id.at.so,while purchasing the product is one of the roberco factors to be considered,it is not dispositive.roberco,offic.trans.at no single factor is conclusive by itself and none has more weight or importance than the others.
in a related argument,wheeled coach contends that is not entitled to invoke law because is not a law dealer but rather an exclusive sales representative within the meaning of puerto rico sales representative act of,laws ann.law law was enacted to protect sales representatives and other local agents who fell short of the requirements for dealership status under law.innovation mktg.tuffcare,d,tavarez champion.it is modeled closely on law and,with limited exceptions,provides identical remedies.see codecom,alcatel standard,d.law,however,applies only to sales representative contracts formed after december.innovation,d at tavarez.at.wheeled coach argues that its relationship with is a sales representation contract under law,which means that the puerto rico legislature did not expect law to apply in this context.suit under law,wheeled coach continues,is simply an attempt to evade the prospective limitation on law claims 
it is a plausible argument.law defines a sales representative as an independent entrepreneur who establishes a sales representation contract of an exclusive nature,with a principal or grantor,and who is assigned a specific territory or market,within the commonwealth of puerto rico.it includes the figure known as manufacturer representative.laws ann.a orba,mbr,d.a sales representation contract,in turn,is defined as follows 
the agreement established between a sales representative and a principal,through which the party of the first part commits himself to making a reasonable effort and due diligence in the creation or expansion of a market which is favorable for the products that the principal sells,directed at capturing clientele to offer it a product or service marketed by him in puerto rico,and the party of the second part is bound to comply with the commitments that may result from the sales representative efforts and coordination and to pay the commission or remuneration.
laws ann.c.aspects of relationship with wheeled coach do appear,at first glance,to fall within this example,wheeled coach pays a commission or remuneration for each vehicle sold wheeled coach is bound by sales made by and never acquires title in the ambulances.as previously discussed,however,these facts,when viewed within the context of a product,can likewise be seen to fit within the duties traditionally performed by a distributor,tempered to the particular product to be distributed,in this case,custom made ambulances,d at.the distinction between a law dealer and a law sales representative is essentially a one.innovation,d at triangle trading robroy.on the basis of the evidence before it at the preliminary injunction hearing,it was not clear error for the district court to determine that is a law dealer rather than a law sales representative.
we conclude that the district court did not err in determining that deserved the provisional protections provided to dealers by law.thus,the district court was within its discretion in finding that public policy and the interests of the parties would be best served by strict temporary enforcement of the letter of the agreement.demoss,at.of course,wheeled coach has the opportunity to present further evidence and to argue anew the question of status as a dealer at trial.see luis rosario,amana refrigeration,cir.
iii.conclusion 
the preliminary injunction issued by the district court is affirmed.
this was a standard agreement sent to by wheeled coach.wheeled coach argues that,because it has not been able to locate in its records the signed copy of the agreement claims to have sent back to wheeled coach,the agreement was never executed by.the district court found that signed the agreement and that it has been in effect since.
has subsequently dismissed its claims against bill de león.
the terms dealer,distributor,and distributorship are used interchangeably in the caselaw concerning law.
this does not mean,however,that the procedural safeguards provided by the rules of civil procedure are inapplicable to the provisional remedies provided by law.aybar.on appeal,wheeled coach argues that the district court abused its discretion by imposing on an inadequate injunction bond of.wheeled coach has subsequently filed a motion in the district court requesting an increase to the bond,and in an order dated november,the district court increased the bond to.
although failing to describe some details of the commercial transactions between and wheeled coach,particularly the role of the ford dealerships associated with,the district court findings provide a summary of the relevant aspects of the relationship sufficient for the purposes of determining whether is a dealer under law.
wheeled coach argues that because its price list determines the price of the ambulances,does not exert control over prices.however,determines the final sales price of the ambulances and in doing so also determines its own remuneration in a manner consistent with the role of a dealer under law.
argues that wheeled coach forfeited any argument concerning law by failing to raise the issue in t
