american states insurance company asic paid the defense and indemnity costs to settle claims made against its insureds.however,because national fire insurance company of hartford national had issued policies that provided coverage for the same insureds for later time periods,and because asic contended some of the damages manifested during the period covered by national policies,asic filed this action against national pleading claims for equitable contribution and declaratory relief.
national demurred to the complaint,alleging asic causes of action for equitable contribution and declaratory relief were barred by expiration of the statute of limitations.before the court ruled on that demurrer,asic filed a first amended complaint pleading that asic was the assignee of the insured claims for damages against national.national again demurred to the complaint,and the court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.asic then filed a second amended complaint,alleging a claim labeled subrogation,to which national again demurred on statute of limitations grounds.the court concluded asic claim sounded in equitable contribution and ruled that,because the statute of limitations applied to the claim,asic claim was.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,and this appeal by asic followed.
on appeal,asic argues that even if the court properly treated asic equitable subrogation claim as a claim for equitable contribution,the statute of limitations should apply to claims for equitable contribution.asic alternatively argues the court should have applied the statute of limitations to its claim because asic properly may pursue reimbursement from national under an equitable subrogation claim.
factual and procedural backgrounda.the facts 
asic issued general liability policies to vision systems,and interstate glass the insureds covering the period april,through april.national the successor by merger to transcontinental insurance company issued general liability policies to the same insureds covering the period april,through april.both asic policy and national policy provided the insureds with coverage for property damage during the policy period caused by an occurrence.
the insureds were named as additional defendants in a lawsuit brought by a homeowners association the underlying action.the underlying action was settled,and the action against the insureds dismissed,by april.asic contributed on behalf of interstate glass,and on behalf of vision systems,to settle the actions against the insureds.national did not contribute to fund the settlements on behalf of either insured.the insureds assigned to asic the insureds rights against national for the damages the insureds suffered as a result of national not contributing to the defense and indemnity costs for settlement of the underlying action.
b.the initial pleadings 
asic filed an action against national in may,alleging it was entitled to equitable contribution from national for a portion of the amounts paid by asic to settle the underlying action.national demurred to the complaint on the grounds the action was commenced more than two years after the accrual of asic cause of action for equitable contribution and was therefore by code of civil procedure section,subdivision.
before the scheduled hearing on national demurrer,asic filed a first amended complaint seeking equitable contribution.the amended pleading alleged asic action was founded on written instruments,within ambit of the statute of limitation specified in section because both national and asic had issued written policies of insurance to the insureds,and the insureds had in writing assigned their rights against national to asic.national again demurred to the complaint,noting that asic action was in fact one seeking equitable contribution rather than an action pursued by asic as a subrogee of any rights held by the insureds.national therefore asserted the statute of limitations applicable to contribution claims rather than the statute applicable to claims founded on a written instrument governed asic action,and the action was.the trial court agreed and sustained the demurrer,but granted asic the opportunity to amend the complaint to plead a subrogation claim.
c.the operative complaint 
asic filed a second amended complaint purporting to plead a subrogation claim.that complaint alleged asic had a written assignment from the insureds of the damages caused to the insureds as a result of national not defending and indemnifying the insureds in the underlying action asic action was founded on written instruments the insurance policies issued by asic and national and the written assignment from the insureds to asic asic had settled the underlying action and had paid for property damages occurring during national coverage period asic had been damaged by paying for the release and settlement of claims primarily the responsibility of national and j ustice requires that that portion of the settlement representing damage occurring during national coverage be shifted to national under principles of subrogation.
national demurred to the complaint,asserting asic action remained a claim for equitable contribution and was barred by the statute of limitations.national argued asic effort to relabel the claim as one for subrogation,to make applicable the statute of limitations,was ineffective because asic had not pleaded and could not plead the elements essential to a subrogation claim.national also argued that,to the extent asic claim attempted to plead it was pursuing the action as assignee of the insureds,the insureds had suffered no losses and therefore had nothing to assign to asic.asic opposed the demurrer,asserting it adequately pleaded the elements necessary to pursue a subrogation claim,the fact the insureds were fully indemnified did not mean the insured had suffered no loss,and equity should shift to a breaching insurer its equitable share of the claim.
the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.asic timely appealed.
