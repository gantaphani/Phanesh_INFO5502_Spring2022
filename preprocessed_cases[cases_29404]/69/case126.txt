charter communications charter,a cable television operator,filed separate suits against thomas burdulis burdulis and miguel sánchez sánchez for unauthorized reception of cable programming.after both burdulis and sánchez defaulted in their respective cases,the district court entered judgment in favor of charter and awarded damages.in this consolidated appeal,charter contends that the district court erred in determining the amount of damages to which it is entitled.after careful consideration,we affirm.
background 
charter is a cable operator that provides cable television programming to its customers.charter customers pay a monthly fee based on the level of service they desire.for example,customers can choose to receive only the channels included in charter basic service tier or expanded basic tier.however,they can elect to pay additional money each month and receive certain premium channels,hbo or showtime as part of their cable package.customers can also pay,on a basis,for individual movies or special event programming.
charter itself receives most of its programming from radio signals sent by satellite,and it retransmits these signals to customers via cable or wire.charter cable signals for premium channels and services are electronically coded or scrambled,so they must be decoded by electronic decoding equipment for the signals to be viewed clearly on a television.to decode the signals,charter provides subscribers of these services with electronic decoding devices known as converters.charter programs each of its converters specifically to permit subscribers to view only the level of service purchased.there also exist,however,unauthorized converters,known as descramblers or black boxes devices that have been designed or modified to defeat the security functions of charter cable system.
the instant cases arose following productions of business records from manufacturers of illegal cable descrambling devices in time warner cable of new york city visual communications.july,and at t broadband modern.the business records revealed that in august,burdulis had purchased one illegally modified cable descrambler device.they also revealed that in february and july,sánchez had purchased twelve quickboards designed to effect the unauthorized reception of charter premium and programming.sánchez also purchased a specialized type of screwdriver that allowed him to insert the quickboards into the converters.
using this information,charter filed separate suits against burdulis and sánchez pursuant to unauthorized interception or reception of any communications service offered over a cable system and unauthorized interceptions of any communication by radio burdulis,however,did not respond at all to charter complaint.although sánchez did respond to charter complaint and the parties had subsequently agreed to settle the case,sánchez failed to sign the settlement agreement and disappeared.charter therefore moved in each case for an entry of default and an award of statutory damages,plus attorneys fees and costs,under and.
on january,the district court issued a joint memorandum and order joint order in cases involving burdulis and two other charter defendants,holding that did not apply to theft of radio signals transmitted over a cable network the district court also ruled that the amount of statutory damages awarded should be limited to the estimated value of the cable services stolen,without consideration of other harms to charter or of the role of damages in deterring cable theft following charter request for reconsideration,the court issued an amended memorandum and order,discussing only the case of burdulis,in which it reaffirmed its earlier conclusions the burdulis order 
shortly after the release of the amended memorandum and order,the district court issued an additional memorandum and order pertaining to the sánchez case the sánchez order.in the sánchez order,the district court adopted the reasoning of the burdulis order and held that remedies did not apply to theft of radio signals over a cable network.the court also issued a separate ruling that,under,not more than one award of statutory damages of up to would be allowed for all twelve of sánchez established statutory violations 
in this consolidated appeal,charter contends that the district court,in handing down its rulings in both the burdulis and sánchez cases,erred in three ways in determining the amount of damages to which charter is entitled.first,charter contends that the district court was incorrect in holding that does not apply to theft of radio signals transmitted over a cable network.second,the cable operator argues that the district court was wrong to hold that under only one award of statutory damages of up to is allowed,even when multiple statutory violations are established.finally,charter contests the district court ruling that statutory damages should be limited to the value of the cable services used,without consideration of other harms to charter or of the value of damages in deterring cable theft.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
the three issues in this case are purely legal questions reviewed de novo.see united states leja,cir stating that t he district court resolution of legal questions is reviewed de novo motors darling,cir noting that s tatutory interpretation typically raises questions of law engendering de novo review.
b.the applicability of remedies under 
the first issue in this appeal is whether the remedies provided for under,which applies to the theft of radio communications,are available to charter in these cases section provides a plaintiff with enhanced damages of up to,additional fines,and mandatory awards of attorneys fees the district court,however,held that was inapplicable in this case and that charter could only benefit from the remedies set forth in.the district court noted that applied only in cases involving unauthorized radio communications,and not in cases involving wire or cable communications.since burdulis and sánchez were involved in theft of cable communications,communications offered over a wire or cable system,remedies were unavailable.charter contends that the district court ruling was erroneous and provides a number of arguments designed to demonstrate that the district court should have applied remedies in this case.we address charter arguments in turn.
statutory text and the regulatory framework 
charter begins by focusing on the statutory text.it asserts that nowhere in the relevant statutes does congress expressly state,or by clear implication provide,that can not apply to services delivered over a cable network.as a result,charter contends that it should be allowed to recover from burdulis and sánchez under.
we,however,believe that the statutory text does make clear that is not to apply to signals delivered by wire over a cable network.and if there is any doubt,we think that the structure of the regulatory regime provides the necessary clarity.
regarding the statutory text itself,the district court correctly points out that is noteworthy for its general exclusion of communications by wire or cable.as we discuss below,does make reference to communications by wire or cable in a few,very limited instances.most of these instances,however,have no relevance to the instant case.the vast majority of is devoted to communications by radio.moreover,congress clearly understood the difference between communication by radio and communication by wire,as it defined separately the two methods of communication.see,defining communication by radio id.defining communication by wire.we presume that had congress meant for communication by wire to be a pivotal part of the regulatory regime,it would have stated as much.i t is a general principle of statutory construction that when congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.barnhart sigmon coal,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the fact that deals almost exclusively with communication by radio speaks volumes,and we think there was no need for congress to make specific reference to its general desire to exclude communication s by wire from the regulatory framework.
the structure of the regulatory regime in this area also provides convincing evidence that congress did not intend for to regulate communications by wire.as the district court relates,congress devised the regulatory regime in such a way that regulation was to depend on the method of radio or by wire.section deals with communications traveling through the air via radio,whereas covers communications traveling over cable wire.the legislative history to demonstrates conclusively that congress distinguished between communication s by radio and communication s by wire in establishing this bifurcated regulatory framework 
the committee intends the phrase service offered over a cable system in to limit the applicability of to theft of a service from the point at which it is actually being distributed over a cable system.thus,situations arising with respect to the reception of services which are transmitted or through another technology,but which are also distributed over a cable system,continue to be subject to resolution under section to the extent reception or interception occurs prior to or not in connection with,distribution of the service over a cable system.
at,as reprinted in.
in this case,the fact that the transmissions were intercepted as they were transmitted via cable,not radio,is dispositive.as the district court relates in the sánchez order,t he change in form of transmission of the communication,from an airborne signal to a signal traveling over a cable wire,changes the applicability of the statute when the communication is stolen as it is being transmitted over a cable wire,not,applies.given this clear demarcation between the two forms of regulation,there was no need for congress to state specifically in the statutory text that does not apply to services delivered over cable.
in three different ways,however,charter contests such a characterization of the statutory text and the regulatory,the notion that was designed to deal only with radio transmissions and only with cable transmissions.first,it notes that contains language referring to wire,the standing rules in defining who is entitled to sue for a violation of the statute.section d states that the term any person aggrieved referenced in e a shall include any person with proprietary rights in the intercepted communication by wire or radio d emphasis added.charter asserts that this reference to communication by wire in d demonstrates that congress did indeed intend for to regulate at least some communication by wire.
we reject this argument.although we can find no definitive guidance regarding congress intent in including the reference to communication by wire in d,we note that the report accompanying the amendment that added d indicated that the purpose of the section was,in part,expanding standing to sue.ii,at,as reprinted in.the relevant portion of the legislative history reads as follows 
section of the satellite home viewer act of amends of the communications act pertaining to the piracy of satellite cable programming.the committee amendment is intended to deter piracy practices by stiffening applicable civil and criminal penalties,expanding standing to sue,and making the manufacture,sale,modification of devices or equipment with knowledge that its primary purpose is to assist in unauthorized decryption of satellite cable programming expressly actionable as a criminal act.
id.emphasis added.
the resulting legislation expand ed standing to sue because it affirmed the right of cable operators who transmitted communications to consumers via wire or cable to sue for unauthorized interceptions of radio or satellite communications.what drove the legislation was the understanding that a transmission emanating from a satellite potentially made several intermediate stops before reaching the ultimate consumer.we see congressional recognition of this fact,for example,in d,where congress defined satellite cable programming as video programming which is transmitted via satellite and which is primarily intended for the direct receipt by cable operators for their retransmission to cable subscribers.see also id.at,at cable systems pay satellite carriers a per subscriber fee for delivering to the system a broadcast signal the systems then send out the signal over the wire to their subscribers.
under such a conception of the telecommunications process,the cable operator stands to lose just as the satellite owner does if the satellite transmission is stolen.the cable operator,after all,loses out on a potential customer if the transmission is intercepted.had the cable pirate not stolen the transmission,he or she may very well have doled out the money to purchase cable from the cable operator.
what charter fails to grasp is that if the cable operator does decide to sue by taking advantage of the standing rules articulated in d,the substantive law that is applied is,not.in other words,d does expand standing to sue and allows cable operators to sue regarding a theft of communications that occurred before the communications ever reached them.however,this does not mean that congress is regulating,via,communications by wire.what is being regulated is the theft of radio or satellite signals.as such,charter argument that regulates the theft of cable signals is incorrect.
in its second attempt to break down the wall congress created between radio and cable communications,charter notes how federal courts in the early,when confronting the sale and use of illegal cable descramblers,held apparently unanimously that applied to radio signals transmitted over a cable network.charter may be correct that federal courts in the early did apply to radio signals transmitted over a cable network.this,however,was a function of the fact that at the time,there existed a gap in the regulation of theft of cable services.as the district court correctly points out,the adoption of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of crime control act,stat,removed most references to wire cable transmissions in,leaving to apply only to radio transmissions.moreover,had not yet been enacted.thus,courts in the early,in the absence of any explicit and tailored regulatory framework,were in essence compelled to use as a means of preventing the theft of cable services.with,however,the adoption of in in the cable communications policy act,congress provided a new regulatory framework that courts could use to combat the theft of cable services,and courts were no longer bound to rely on to deal with the problem.thus,charter reliance on certain federal court decisions from the early of which,incidentally,predate the passage of misplaced 
in charter final attempt to show that does apply to certain aspects of communication s by wire,it contests the district court conclusion that the protections in for wire communications would be largely unnecessary if applied to radio signals over a cable network.charter states that even with applying to radio signals over a cable network,the protections in would play a specific and important role.according to charter,with its standing rules,only allows cable operators to sue for interceptions of satellite cable programming,including signals over a cable television network section,however,provides no protection against theft of services that can travel over example,services such as private line data transmission and shopping and banking.to charter,congress enacted specifically to deal with the theft of these services.
we disagree with this characterization of the regulatory framework.we believe that was intended to play a much more significant role in the regulatory scheme than in the mere protection of services.although services such as private line data transmission and shopping and banking are commonplace today,in,when congress passed the cable communications policy act and enacted and reenacted,such services were restricted to a tiny subset of the population.see,at,as reprinted in at noting,for example,that private line data services are in their infancy and that private line data services are only a small fraction of the current data transmission market.what was more in the forefront of congress collective mind was the threat posed by the theft of traditional video cable services.see id.at,at stating that the house energy and commerce committee was extremely concerned about the theft of cable services and noting that the theft of cable services poses a major threat to the economic viability of cable operators and cable programmers.it makes no sense that congress would go out of its way to come up with an entirely new regulatory regime in the form of to combat what at the time was only a limited threat.in fact,the legislative history indicates clearly that this was not congress intention.see id.at,at noting that at the time of the enactment of the cable communications policy act in,several proceedings were then underway to determine the regulatory treatment of services provided over cable systems,such as data transmission and voice services.rather,we believe that congress,in enacting,was attempting to create a comprehensive regulatory regime covering the theft of all communications transmitted over a wire or that had largely been unregulated since the enactment of the crime control act in and the removal of most references to communications by wire from.in tkr cable cable city,cir,and united states norris,cir,the third and seventh circuits,respectively,supported such an interpretation.as the district court correctly noted,the evidence is overwhelming that congress intended to address the serious,widespread problem of cable piracy,not a microscopically small range of conduct.
since was enacted to combat the theft of all communication s by wire,and not merely services that can travel over cable,we think that the provisions of were intended by congress to be the primary protections for cable communications.we agree with the district court that such protections would be superfluous if also provided protection to certain communication s by wire.
statutory interpretation 
charter next attempts to utilize two established principles of statutory interpretation to support its view that encompasses signals over a cable network.first,charter notes that because congress in reenacted the existing version of,the presumption is that congress also intended to adopt the reasoning of the existing case law interpreting the the precedents,discussed above,that interpreted as applying to theft of cable.see lorillard pons,d congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it a statute without change internal citations omitted.
under normal circumstances,we would indeed presume that congress adopted all of the existing case law associated with when it reenacted that section without change.in this instance,however,we believe that the congressional adoption of associated case law is limited.because congress reenacted at the same time it enacted,we think that congress adopted only the case law applicable to communication by radio.as suggested above,if congress were to adopt all of the case law traditionally associated with the precedents applying to incidents of cable would have been no need at all for it to enact.
second,charter notes that because both and are remedial statutes,each statute provisions are to be construed expansively to assist the party seeking this instance,charter.see tcherepnin knight,d recognizing the familiar canon of statutory construction that remedial legislation should be construed broadly to effectuate its purposes.charter is correct to recognize the existence of such a canon.however,for us to read these statutes as charter desires would require that we not only read the statutes broadly,but indeed beyond what congress intended.we decline to do so.
legislative history 
charter also argues that the legislative history to both and indicates that congress intended for to be applicable to the theft of cable services.
we have already cited to certain aspects of the applicable legislative history to support our view of the relevant law in this case.charter,however,cites to additional legislative history to support its arguments.we think that this additional legislative history does little to support charter position.for example,charter cites to several paragraphs in a report issued by the house of representatives regarding what eventually became,at,as reprinted in at.charter points in particular to a sentence stating that n othing in is intended to affect the applicability of existing section to the theft of cable service.id.this statement,however,must be read in light of congress own perceptions of the regulatory scheme.it is clear that congress viewed as a means of combating the theft of cable service where the cable service took the form of communications,not communication s by wire.see at s ection has provided broad protection against the unauthorized interception of various forms of radio communications.it is the committee intention that the amendment preserve these broad protections.emphasis added.that congress would declare that remained applicable to the theft of radio communications,while intending for to provide a new protection against the theft of communications provided over wire or cable,is not at all surprising.thus,charter attempts to use legislative history to support its arguments fail.
policy argument 
charter final argument is based on policy.it argues that congress has repeatedly identified theft of cable services as a national problem and that it defies belief that congress would have singled out cable,operators for substantially worse treatment compared to their wireless video competitors.
we,however,think that charter fails to appreciate the congressional prerogative in setting up the regulatory framework and in setting the applicable penalty amounts.as discussed above,congress,at the time of enacting in,noted the major threat posed by the theft of cable services.the provisions enacted as part of were intended to combat this threat.just four years later,however,congress realized that problems persisted,particularly with regard to the piracy of wireless video.see.ii,at,as reprinted in,noting that piracy has become an increasingly distressing problem to the satellite industry and seriously threatens to undermine the industry survival.as a result,it made a legislative judgment to increase the penalties applicable to theft of wireless services under.see.
thus,it is not that congress is singling out cable operators for substantially worse treatment wireless video competitors.it is merely that congress has made a decision to stiffen the applicable penalties for piracy of wireless services.we decline to disturb this legislative judgment.if congress finds that theft of cable continues to be a major problem,it certainly possesses the power to raise the penalty amounts for cable theft,so that such penalties are on a par with the amounts for wireless theft.until that time,however,charter will have to remain content with the penalty amounts available under.
limits on recovery 
having determined that charter can pursue remedies only under,we now turn to the second issue in this there are any limits to charter recovery under.the district court held that allows only one statutory damages award of not more than even when there are multiple violations of a which prohibits the unauthorized reception of communications services offered over a cable system.charter contests this holding,arguing that it should be permitted to recover up to for each violation committed.
we,however,believe that the district court was correct.the district court described the relevant statutory framework,and its application to this case,as follows 
section creates both civil and criminal penalties for the unauthorized reception of cable service.the statute is organized into three sections a defines the violation and relevant terms,b provides criminal penalties,and c provides civil penalties.section a allows the plaintiff to seek either actual or statutory damages.here,charter elected to pursue statutory damages under c a ii.
the court went on to note that c a ii provides that a plaintiff may recover an award of statutory damages for all violations involved in the action,in a sum of not less than or more than as the court considers just emphasis added.by contrast,the text of b,the criminal remedies section,states that f or purposes of all penalties and remedies established for violations of subsection a of this section,the prohibited activity established herein as it applies to each such device shall be deemed a separate violation.this language in b was added by congress through a amendment.
we think that the plain text of demonstrates conclusively that charter,in these civil actions,can recover only one statutory damages award of not more than,irrespective of the number of violations committed by burdulis or sánchez.the statutory text of c a ii clearly states that a plaintiff may recover an award of statutory damages for all violations involved in the action,in a sum of not less than or more than as the court considers just emphasis added.thus,as was noted by the third circuit in instrument of,cir,c a ii anticipates multiple violations and a single award of damages,the latter of which is limited to.id.at.thus,it is clear from a simple reading of the statutory text that a plaintiff can only recover a maximum of in statutory damages under c a ii,regardless of the number of violations.
that this is the case is all the more certain after comparing c a ii with the criminal remedies section in b.as mentioned above,congress amended b in.the ninth circuit noted in cont l cablevision,poll,cir,that one can not overlook the fact that congress changed the statute on the criminal side yet left unchanged the word all on the civil side of the statutory remedies.id.at.we again cite the important canon of statutory construction that when congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.barnhart,at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.because congress acted to alter the criminal section of the statute,yet decided to leave the civil section unchanged,we believe that congress was clear in its desire to have violations of a be considered collectively,rather than individually,when such violations form the basis of a civil action.
in prior cases,we have held that i f the plain language of the statute points unerringly in a single direction,an inquiring court ordinarily should look no further.herman héctor nieves transport,cir.charter,however,argues that the plain meaning of the statutory text is deceptive and that there are other indications that congress wanted to allow plaintiffs to recover up to for each violation of a.
charter makes three arguments to support its position.first,it points to the language included by congress in its amendment of b.section b states,in relevant part,that f or purposes of all penalties and remedies established for violations of subsection a of this section,the prohibited activity established herein as it applies to each such device shall be deemed a separate violation.charter focuses on the phrase f or purposes of all remedies and claims that the inclusion of this phrase is proof that congress intended for the rule to apply to civil remedies,as well as criminal ones.what charter fails to grasp,however,is the congressional placement of the quoted phrase.for purposes of all remedies is included only in the criminal section of,b.we think it is significant that congress chose to include the phrase here,rather than at the beginning of placement that would have made it applicable to both the criminal and civil provisions of.by placing the relevant phrase only within the limited confines of b,congress,it seems to us,intended for the rule to apply only to criminal penalties.
charter second argument is.it argues that congress,for pragmatic reasons,could only have intended to enable a plaintiff to recover up to for each violation of a.if a plaintiff could only recover a maximum of no matter how many violations occurred,contends charter,it would lead to the absurd situation in which the plaintiff would simply bring separate c civil actions with respect to each individual violation and secure multiple awards,at an unnecessarily increased cost in party and judicial resources.
it is true that the statutory scheme does,in many cases,permit a cable operator to bring separate c civil actions with respect to each individual violation and secure multiple awards,at an increased cost in party and judicial resources however,we decline to label this result absurd,since,instead of limiting the options available to the plaintiff,it actually increases them.the statutory scheme operates in such a way that,in cases where a plaintiff can not show actual damages,the plaintiff is given the choice of whether to expend the resources to sue for each individual violation or whether to simply combine all of the violations together in a single suit.the former requires additional litigation,yet potentially provides the plaintiff with a greater recovery.the latter option limits the amount of litigation required but also limits the potential recovery.what course a particular plaintiff decides to pursue depends on the nature of the particular violation s committed,as well as the resources available to the plaintiff.we think that this expansion of options available to the given the possibility that it results in increased in accord with congress desire to provide cable companies and other potential plaintiffs with the tools they need to combat cable piracy.
we also wish to point out here a related policy reason militating strongly in favor of capping statutory damages at for all violations combined.as the ninth circuit correctly noted in poll,if an award of for each violation is allowed,then few if any plaintiffs would ever avail themselves of actual damages,because recovery of statutory damages,which requires no proof of loss,will likely be as high or higher than actual damages.poll,at.actual and statutory damages,however,can serve very different purposes,and to think that congress meant to completely obliterate the regime developed to support actual damages is unthinkable.
charter final argument is that the district court ignored the fact that in several of the cases the court cited from other jurisdictions,notably the ninth circuit decision in poll,the courts supported their conclusions as to the capped statutory damages for all violations under by relying on the assumption that cable operators retained access to the more potent statutory remedies.however,in this case,notes charter,cable operators do not have access to the more potent statutory remedies as a result of the district court decision.thus,there is no easily discernible reason for capped statutory damages under.
charter,however,misreads the precedents it cites in support of its position.although the ninth circuit in poll does refer to congress desire to bring certain sanctions for violations of into conformity with certain sanctions for violations of,the court in that case does not state that the rationale for capped damages under is the ready availability of remedies.in other words,the fact that civil remedies under are capped is independent of the availability of remedies.accordingly,we reject charter argument.
permissible factors to consider under c a ii 
having determined that charter,under c a ii,may only receive,at most,one award totaling for all violations,we now turn to the final issue in this,what factors the district court may consider in deciding what amount to award under c a ii.in this case,the district court calculated statutory damages based solely on the estimated value of the services stolen,without consideration of other harms to charter or of other policies favoring deterrence.charter contests such a method of calculating damages,arguing vehemently that statutory damages should include amounts for,among other things,injury to its goodwill,injury to its future growth and profitability,and injury to the quality of cable services received by charter paying subscribers.charter also contends that any statutory damages award should include an amount that would further the policies of deterrence with respect to cable piracy.
in arriving at its decision to base damages solely on the estimated value of the services stolen,the district court,in the absence of any guidance from us on the matter,relied heavily on the reasoning of a prior district court case,comcast of.i,naranjo,d.in that case,the cable operator had argued,as charter does here,that the court should consider a number of factors in calculating damages,including actual damages,the willfulness of a defendant violation,the importance of deterrence,and defendant cooperation with the plaintiff.the court,however,rejected such a proposal,holding that statutory damages should be as reasonable an estimate of actual damages as the facts allow,not greater.id.at.
the court in naranjo noted that according to the plain language of the statute,statutory damages are merely an alternative to actual damages.the statute creates no difference between the two.thus,although it is possible to conclude that the statutory damages provision is intended to allow a court to impose greater damages than available under the actual damages provision,the plain language offers no identified reason to reach that conclusion.id.the court also noted that the award for deterrence that the plaintiff sought to build into the statutory damages award was actually served by other subsections of,which provided enhanced damages for willfulness and an injunction to prevent future violations.id.at referring to c a,c b.finally,the court stated that the position articulated by the plaintiff in that case would lead to absurd results.the court wrote 
under plaintiff theory,an aggrieved party may receive as statutory damages premiums to deter future conduct in addition to actual or estimated actual damages.statutory damages,however,may not exceed.as a result,parties that have suffered large actual damages greater than can not receive any deterrence premiums.but if any violators require an additional deterrence premium,it is those who have caused the largest amounts of harm.
id.at.accordingly,the court in naranjo held that statutory damages should be calculated based solely on an estimate of actual damages.
the district court in the instant case agreed with the approach taken in naranjo and applied its rule,noting that that approach best satisfies the command of the statute and the judicial interest in promoting predictability and transparency.we agree.we find the reasoning of naranjo to be persuasive and believe it represents the correct view of the law.charter,however,makes several arguments designed to show that the naranjo approach is incorrect and that statutory damages should include more than merely the estimated amount of actual damages.
first,charter contends that nothing in the statutory text or legislative history indicates a court should limit statutory damages only to the cost of video services stolen.this may be true,but the statutory text and legislative history also do not state that a court should look at all harms to the cable operator,as charter desires.in actual fact,the only guidance we receive from congress on this matter is that the issue of damages is at the discretion of the judge.see c a ii noting that the party aggrieved may recover an award of statutory damages as the court considers just emphasis added.given that there are convincing reasons,as discussed in naranjo,for limiting the damage award to a reasonable estimate of actual damages,we believe that the district court was correct in the exercise of its discretion and refusing to follow the approach advocated by charter.
second,charter argues that the remedies provisions in contain a statutory goal of restitution to the cable operator.it contends that the damages it,injury to its goodwill,injury to its future growth and have been taken into account in any determination of damages,so as to ensure that it received restitution for its damages from the violations.charter does not tell us exactly what remedies provisions in it is referring to,so we are unable to assess whether these provisions do contain an explicit statutory goal of restitution.
similarly,charter does not explain with specificity what it means by restitution in this context.at times,restitution is understood as a substitute for damages.see gilpin am.fed.of state,county,and mun.employees,cir noting that restitution.is ordinarily although not invariably a substitute for rather than a form of damages.in such instances,it is,needless to say,essential to distinguish between restitution and damages.as one authority describes the difference,t he damages recovery is to compensate the plaintiff,and it pays him,theoretically,for his losses.the restitution claim,on the other hand,is not aimed at compensating the plaintiff,but at forcing the defendant to disgorge benefits that it would be unjust for him to keep.dan dobbs,handbook on the law of remedies cited in gilpin,at.
applying such definitions to the instant case,we simply do not see how the remedy sought here by charter can be considered restitution.if a court was to provide charter with compensation for,say,injury to charter growth and profitability,the court would be addressing the plaintiff the realm of damages rather than an gain of the defendants for the defendants in this case did not wrongly appropriate charter future growth and profitability for their own gain.
charter,however,may instead be using restitution in a more colloquial sense,such that it desires to recover from the defendants for all the damage they caused as a result of their piracy.such a usage of the term restitution would mean both that the defendants would disgorge any gains,and that the plaintiff would be able to recover for any other losses it incurred as a result of the defendants misconduct.with this definition,charter would indeed be able to recover fully for injury to its goodwill,injury to its future growth and profitability,and injury to the public,not to mention actual damages.
we,however,are unclear which definition of restitution charter is utilizing in its brief.without any additional guidance from charter on this matter,we find ourselves unable to evaluate the merits of its claim.see united states zannino,cir it is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way,leaving the court to do counsel work,create the ossature for the argument,and put flesh on its bones.as we recently said in a closely analogous context judges are not expected to be mindreaders.consequently,a litigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly,or forever hold its peace.citations and some internal quotation marks omitted.
charter final argument is that the district court exclusive focus on the estimated value of the services stolen in awarding statutory damages fails to account for the need to deter cable pirates.deterrence,charter claims,is an implicit consideration in deciding the discretionary amount of statutory damages under c a ii.we disagree.although charter cites to a passage in the legislative history demonstrating that deterrence was indeed on the minds of congressional drafters as they prepared what became the cable communications policy act,the passage cited has nothing to do with the determination of statutory damages.in other words,although congress did express a desire to deter cable pirates,nowhere did it key this desire for deterrence to the determination of statutory damages.
this makes sense,for,as the district court in naranjo pointed out,congress addressed the need for deterrence in other statutory provisions.section c a,for example,allows a court to impose an injunction on defendants,thus preventing future violations.congress similarly focused on deterrence in enacting c b,which authorizes enhanced damages for certain willful conduct.with the existence of these separate provisions addressing deterrence,there was no need for congress to ask courts to address the issue when determining statutory damages.moreover,asking courts
