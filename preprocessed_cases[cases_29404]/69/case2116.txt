patscheck appeals asserting the penalty provision in section can only be awarded in a disciplinary action before the contractors state license board cslb,the trial court miscalculated the interest and penalties,and morton was not entitled to payment for the extra work.

discussion 
i.the penalty in section is recoverable in a civil action 
section provides that upon receipt of a progress payment,the contractor must pay any subcontractor within days the amounts allowed the contractor for the work performed by the subcontractor.the contractor may withhold from a progress payment up to percent of any amount over which a good faith dispute exists.two sanctions are provided in the event that a contractor fails to pay the subcontractor as required a disciplinary proceeding a penalty of percent per month on the outstanding balance payable to the subcontractor percent penalty.in the event an action is instituted to collect funds wrongfully withheld,the prevailing party is entitled to recover attorney fees and costs.the issue raised by this appeal is whether the subcontractor can recover the percent penalty in a disciplinary proceeding before the cslb,or in a civil action,or in both.there is no published authority interpreting the statute.
our primary task in construing a statute is to determine the legislature intent.brown kelly broadcasting cal d.we first turn to the words themselves for the answer.people knowles cal d.when statutory language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,and we will not indulge in it.solberg superior court cal d.we will not speculate that the legislature meant something other than what it said.nor will we rewrite a statute to posit an unexpressed intent.woodmansee lowery d.if the intent of the legislature can not be gleaned from the language of the statute,we may consider the legislative history of the statute.people snook cal th,d,fair employment housing com.cal d.
neither of the two sanctions found in section state the forum in which it can be recovered.naturally,only the cslb can discipline a contractor.however,it does not automatically follow that the percent penalty can only be recovered in proceedings before the cslb.since section does not limit recovery of the percent penalty only to disciplinary proceedings,the plain meaning of the statute would appear to allow recovery of the percent penalty in either a disciplinary proceeding or a civil action.
patscheck contends that had the legislature intended the percent penalty to be recoverable in a civil action,it would have included the provision in the sentence that authorizes recovery of attorney fees and costs to the successful civil litigant.according to patscheck,by including the penalty in the sentence that also exposes a violating contractor to discipline before the cslb,the legislature evinced the intent to allow recovery of the percent penalty only in actions before the cslb.in other words,the first sentence is limited to proceedings before the cslb and the second sentence is applicable to civil actions.
we do not find the emphasis on which sentence the percent penalty is included to be justified.the first sentence indicates the two sanctions to which a contractor who violates section may be subject.the second sentence is not a sanction against the contractor.the subcontractor who institutes the collection action also is subject to attorney fees if the court rejects his or her claim.a provision that has equal application to both parties is not a sanction against one of the parties.therefore,we conclude that placing the sanctions and attorney fees provision in separate sentences does not indicate an intent on the part of the legislature to allow recovery of the percent penalty only in disciplinary actions.
we look to the legislative history of the statute if it is susceptible to more than one interpretation to assist in determining the intent of the legislature.robinson fair employment housing com.cal th,d.the percent penalty was added to the statute by amendment in.prior to this amendment,the only sanction was a disciplinary action before the cslb.despite the threat of discipline,the legislature found there was a continuing problem with subcontractors receiving timely payment for their work the amendment was to provide an incentive for contractors to pay subcontractors in a timely manner by providing remedies to the unpaid subcontractor.repeated references are made to subjecting the contractor to a penalty of percent per month and attorney fees 
the optimum method to achieve the stated goals of this legislation is to allow recovery of the penalty both in disciplinary proceedings and in civil actions.the numerous references in the legislative history to subjecting the contractor to the percent penalty and attorney fees supports our interpretation since a contractor is exposed to both items of recovery only in a civil action.
we do not agree with patscheck that allowing recovery of prejudgment interest,and the percent penalty would result in a double recovery for the subcontractor.patscheck ignores the distinct purposes of the two items of recovery.prejudgment interest is intended to compensate the subcontractor for loss of use of the funds.wisper california commerce bank th,d.the percent penalty is intended to penalize the contractor for failing to comply with statutory requirements.to preclude recovery of both the percent penalty and prejudgment interest would defeat the purpose of the statute and reduce the impact of the percent penalty.if the legislature had intended this result,it would have so stated.see,pub.contract code.
patscheck reliance on the legislative history of the amendment to section is misplace
