background 
during a tour of property owned by kan pacific,taniguchi,a professional baseball player in japan,fell through a wooden deck.immediately after the accident,taniguchi stated that he did not need medical attention.
two weeks after the incident,taniguchi informed kan pacific that he had sustained various cuts,bruises,and torn ligaments from the fall.as a result of these injuries,taniguchi allegedly incurred various medical,hospital,and rehabilitative expenses and was compelled to cancel contractual obligations,resulting in a loss of income.

iii.discussion 
kan pacific entitlement to costs 
taniguchi contends that the district court erred by awarding costs to kan pacific,because kan pacific insurance company assumed responsibility for all costs incurred by kan pacific during the litigation.taniguchi relies on united states aetna casualty surety,for the proposition that the case must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.a.however,that case is not persuasive because it addressed a situation where the insurance company satisfied the insured claim and then sued the tortfeasor as the insured.see id.at.a question was raised regarding whether the insurance company could bring the action in its own name rather than in the name of the insured.see id.the united states supreme court ruled that an insurer who has paid an entire loss suffered by the insured,is the only real party in interest id.at citation omitted.there is no analogous situation in this case.
similarly,in hilbrands far east trading company,cir,we held that the case must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.however,that case also involved a claim paid to the injured party by the insurance company and a question as to whether the case could be prosecuted by the insurance company who paid the benefits.see id.at.the same analysis does not apply to a defendant whose defense costs are paid by its insurer.unlike an insured whose claim has been fully satisfied,the defendant who remains liable for any money damages awarded to the plaintiff is still very much an interested party.see,manor healthcare lomelo,cir permitting the recovery of costs paid by an insurer.if we were to adopt taniguchi suggested analysis,a plaintiff could file lawsuits against an insured defendant without incurring litigation costs after losing on the merits.id.at.in essence,taniguchi reasoning punishes a prevailing party for being insured and violates the provisions and intent of rule d of the federal rules of civil procedure,which directs the award of costs to a prevailing party.thus,we hold that kan pacific was entitled to seek an award of costs even though the cost of litigation was paid by its insurer.
b.the award of translation costs 
taniguchi contends that the district court erred in awarding costs for translation services used by kan pacific during the litigation.taniguchi cites to and to support his argument.however,taniguchi reliance on u.and is unavailing because the district court judge awarded costs for translation fees pursuant to under,the district court has discretion to award fees for the compensation of interpreters in addition to the costs of special interpretation services under section id.
as recognized by the parties,there is a circuit split concerning the statutory interpretation of.the seventh circuit has determined that interpretation and translation have distinct meanings and has declined to award costs for translation services.see extra equipamentos e exportação ltda.case,cir.the seventh circuit described t he specificity of section,and the character of section as a whole to explain its expressed reluctance to include translators of written documents within the definition of interpreters.id.at.the seventh circuit relied on what it thought to be the common understanding of an interpreter as one who translates the spoken word rather than the written word.see id.
the seventh circuit acknowledged that the dictionary definition of interpreter could conceivably encompass interpretation of a document.id.at.however,the court was of the view that including translation of written documents within the definition would stretch the language of too far.see id.having drawn that line,the seventh circuit denied the award of translation fees.
in contrast,the sixth circuit reasoned that courts have the authority to interpret the meaning of items listed in,and thus,awarding costs for translation of documents necessary for litigation is appropriate.bdt products,lexmark int l,cir.the sixth circuit relied on a dictionary definition of interpret,which included to translate into intelligible or familiar language.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.in essence,the sixth circuit concluded that translation services and interpretation services are interchangeable.see also quy air america,holding that a cost award for translation of vietnamese deposition testimony to english was explicitly authorized by.
we are persuaded by the sixth circuit reasoning.district courts are free to interpret the meaning of the cast of categories listed within.see alflex underwriters laboratories,cir.in,the word interpreter can reasonably encompass a translator,both according to the dictionary definition and common usage of these terms,which does not always draw precise distinctions between foreign language interpretations involving live speech versus written documents.more importantly,the sixth circuit analysis is more compatible with rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,which includes a decided preference for the award of costs to the prevailing party.see.d providing that absent a federal statute,rule or court order to the contrary,costs should be allowed to the prevailing party see also quy,at concluding that translation of deposition testimony was necessary.we therefore agree with the sixth and circuits that within the meaning of,the prevailing party should be awarded costs for services required to interpret either live speech or written documents into a familiar language,so long as interpretation of the items is necessary to the litigation.
as taniguchi alleged that his injuries caused him to lose compensation from his negotiated contract deals,it was necessary for kan pacific to have taniguchi documents and medical records translated to adequately prepare its defense.because we conclude that contemplates the award of costs for translation services,we hold that the district court acted within its discretion when it determined that translation services were necessary to render pertinent documents intelligible to the litigants.see,double rainbow gourmet ice creams,cir stating that district courts have discretion to determine what costs should be awarded.
iv.conclusion 
the district court acted within its discretion when it awarded costs to kan pacific for expenses incurred to translate relevant documents.
taniguchi challenge to the entry of summary judgment in favor of kan pacific on the merits of the action,and other issues raised by taniguchi on appeal are resolved in a separate memorandum disposition filed contemporaneously with thi
