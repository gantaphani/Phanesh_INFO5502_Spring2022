background 
mitutoyo owns the patent,which recites a device for electronically measuring the movement of one object in relation to another,the movement of a caliper slide relative to its scale.on february,mitutoyu and mac filed suit against central for patent infringement and breach of contract.they alleged that central sale of digital calipers manufactured by guanglu measuring instrument company,ltd,infringed the patent,both literally and willfully,and breached their settlement resolved a patent infringement dispute,also involving the patent,and provided that central would refrain from any future importation or sale of infringing products.central counterclaimed for invalidity,unenforceability,and.in,however,central had brought a declaratory judgment action against mitutoyo,alleging that the patent was invalid and unenforceable and it lost.accordingly,under principles of res judicata,the trial court granted summary judgment on validity and enforceability in favor of mitutoyo central does not challenge this ruling.
with respect to infringement,the parties dispute turned only on whether the accused devices meet the phase position identification limitation of claim of the patent.the parties stipulated to the following construction of phase position the amount by which the received signal is displaced or shifted in time relative to a supply electrode signal.this is commonly referred to as phase angle in the art.based on this claim construction and central admissions,the trial court found that central literally infringed,because its devices determined phase angle in accordance with claim.liability order,wl,dist.lexis,at.when calculating the phase angle,however,central calipers do not directly compare the received signal to the supply signal,but rather compare the received signal to a reference signal,which is generated from the same clock as the supply signal.therefore,the trial court necessarily concluded,although without explicitly so stating,that central infringes under the stipulated claim construction,because the phase position identification limitation is met regardless of whether the phase angle is ascertained via a direct or an indirect comparison of the received signal to the supply signal.
in light of the infringement finding,the trial court also found central liable for breach of contract.id.at wl,dist.lexis,at.to the extent that it is liable for infringement,central does not dispute breach of contract liability.however,the trial court found that mitutoyo had insufficiently pled,and failed to properly prosecute,its claim for willful infringement.accordingly,but without citing any authority as a basis for its action,it dismissed the willfulness claim and denied a jury trial on the issue.willful infringement order.
next,the trial court found that mac was not a proper party to the action,because it concluded that it lacked standing.although mac is the exclusive distributor of mitutoyo products in the united states,mitutoyo admitted that it allowed other parties,namely general tool,to sell products covered by the patent in the united states.the trial court,therefore,concluded that mac did not possess the exclusive right to sell in the united states under the patent,as required to maintain licensee standing under ortho pharmaceutical genetics institute.damages order,wl,dist.lexis,at.
with respect to damages,the trial court found that mitutoyo was not entitled to a lost profit award,either for infringement or breach of contract,because it failed to establish any market overlap between its goods and central.whereas mitutoyo calipers retailed from to and have advanced functionality,central calipers sold from to and have more basic features.given these facts and mitutoyo failure to introduce any direct evidence of market overlap,the trial court accepted central argument that its calipers were directed exclusively at who,in the absence of its products,would have either purchased another caliper or not purchased one at all.id.at wl,dist.lexis,at.the trial court did,however,award mitutoyo damages based on a reasonable royalty.it determined that was an appropriate rate based on its conclusion that mitutoyo would not have accepted less than its profit margin of and central anticipated profit margin was.but,without offering any explanation for its decision,it used both central and hftusa sales of the accused calipers in calculating the royalty base.id.at wl,dist.lexis,at.while the two companies have a strong business relationship,they are independent corporate entities,with different owners,and mitutoyo introduced no evidence that central would have otherwise agreed to pay royalties based on hftusa sales.

beginning with infringement,we address each of the parties challenges in turn.
infringement 
we review the trial court grant of summary judgment of infringement de novo.oddzon,just toys.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c aquatex,techniche solutions.thus,summary judgment may be granted when no reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.anderson liberty lobby,d.because central admits that its products meet all other limitations of claim,the only question is whether the trial court properly applied the parties stipulated claim construction for the phase position identification limitation to the undisputed facts of this case.we conclude that it did.
central argues that it does not literally infringe because the signal recorded by the receiving electrode in its devices is a sinusoidal wave,whereas the signal generated by the supply electrode is a square wave.because these waves can not be directly compared to determine the phase angle between them,it argues that its accused devices do not satisfy the phase position identification limitation.this argument,however,is without merit,and is based on an impermissibly narrow understanding of what claim and the stipulated claim construction embody.
neither the stipulated claim construction nor the language of claim require calculation of the phase angle by direct comparison of the supply signal and the received signal.instead,they merely require the phase angle to be calculated based on some comparison of those two signals,even an indirect one.therefore,a reference signal,generated by the same signal clock as the supply signal,and which has not undergone any phase shifting,provides an appropriate basis from which to calculate phase angle based on a comparison between that reference signal and the received signal.moreover,this understanding of the phase position identification limitation is consistent with the specification,which expressly provides for determination of the phase angle via an indirect comparison of the supply signal and the received signal using a reference signal.patent,ll.see also phillips awh,en banc the specification is always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis.usually,i
