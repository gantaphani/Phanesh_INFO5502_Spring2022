following the trial court failure to rule on his request for accommodation of his disabilities,marc stern appeals from issuance of a restraining order against him and from a default judgment awarding a condominium to his former wife as her separate property.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
proceedings 
marc stern and respondent daniela biscaro married in.their marriage produced no children.in june,respondent filed a petition for dissolution.appellant did not file a response.in may,the court entered appellant default.
on september,respondent filed an ex parte application for a temporary restraining order against appellant arising from a fight a month earlier between appellant and respondent adult son.appearing at the hearing in order to oppose a restraining order,appellant requested courtroom accommodation of his neuropsychiatric disabilities that interfered with his ability to communicate and remember.he gave the court a copy of a written request for accommodation that he had filed with court administrators in another proceeding.the court incorporated appellant written request into the court files.the court denied respondent ex parte application,apparently because of the length of time respondent had waited to seek a restraining order after the fight between appellant and respondent son.the court instead set a regularly noticed hearing for october on respondent motion.the court promised appellant it would rule on his request for accommodation of his disabilities before the next hearing and that he would receive the ruling in the mail.the record on appeal does not show any such ruling issued.
appellant did not appear three weeks later at the october hearing on the restraining order,which was before a judge different from the bench officer who had promised to rule on appellant request for accommodation.noting appellant request,the judge presiding at the october hearing stated 
the file indicates a request for accommodation by appellant under the americans with disability act.therefore,i waited until for a matter noticed at.appellant has not appeared.i will proceed based on respondent declaration.
the court granted respondent motion for a restraining order.it directed appellant to stay at least yards from respondent,her home and work,and her adult son.
on december,appellant filed a motion for reconsideration and modification of the restraining order.in support of his motion,appellant noted he had requested at the september hearing accommodation of his neurological disabilities caused by multiple traumatic injuries to his brain frontal lobes that hindered his ability to remember,reason,and communicate.he had asked for a neuropsychologist assistance in the courtroom,but the court did not rule on his request.he argued the lack of assistance meant he could not meaningfully participate in the proceedings to protect his interests.respondent opposed the motion for reconsideration,arguing it was untimely.
appellant was not present when the motion for reconsideration was heard.the court denied appellant motion in a hearing lasting one half of one page of the reporter transcript.after respondent counsel introduced herself,the following was the hearing entirety 
respondent counsel i received a voice mail from my client approximately that her tires have been slashed.she was unable to make it.court okay.the motion goes off motion for reconsideration goes off calendar.counsel well,your honor court well,wait.the motion for reconsideration is denied.counsel thank you,your honor.
that same month,respondent submitted a proposed judgment in the marital dissolution action.the clerk of the court rejected the judgment because it confirmed as respondent separate property a condominium that her petition for dissolution had not identified as her separate property.respondent thereafter applied ex parte for expedited entry of the judgment because she was soon moving out of state and wanted to sell the condominium before departing.at the may hearing on her application,she asserted the condominium was her separate property because appellant had given her his quitclaim deed to it the purported quitclaim deed in the record,however,is an unintelligible copy of a recorded deed of some sort,the particulars of which can not be made out.the court thereafter entered a default judgment against appellant which confirmed the condominium as respondent separate property.this appeal followed.
discussion 
reversible error not to rule on request for accommodation 
according to material in the record,appellant suffers from permanent cognitive disabilities arising from multiple traumatic injuries to his brain frontal lobes.a letter from his physician states appellant has had permanent disability since his injuries in.these injuries have resulted in neuropsychiatric impairment including short term memory,organization,executive functioning,and concentration.requesting accommodation of his disability,appellant asked the court for a facilitator who understands traumatic brain injuries a neuropsychologist.california rules of court,rule,subdivision a defines an accommodation as actions that result in court services or activities being readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities.accommodations may include furnishing,at no charge,auxiliary aids and services,equipment,devices readers,or certified interpreters for persons with hearing impairments rule,subd.a.
the purpose of rule is to allow meaningful involvement by all participants in a legal proceeding to the fullest extent practicable.subdivision b declares it is the policy of the courts of this state to ensure that persons with disabilities have equal and full access to the judicial system.subd.b.rule obligates a court to rule on every properly presented request for accommodation that the court receives,and ordinarily the ruling must be in writing.subdivision e states 
the court must inform the applicant in writing,as may be appropriate,and if applicable,in an alternative format,of the following a that the request for accommodation is granted or denied,in whole or in part,and if the request for accommodation is denied,the reason therefore or that an alternative accommodation is granted b the nature of the accommodation to be provided,if any and c the duration of the accommodation to be provided.subd.e see also subd.e the court must respond to a request for accommodation 
presumably mindful of the obligations set out in rule,the bench officer from whom appellant requested accommodation on september promised to rule on his request before the hearing on respondent request for a restraining order.the officer stated 
i certainly will rule on the request for accommodation.i need to have a clear understanding of let me see what you have there.appellant has filed a request for accommodation by persons with disabilities in another matter.do you wish me to accommodate incorporate that by reference into this case.appellant yes.court all right.then i do that.and there will be a ruling on that before you appear in department,and you get that in the mail.
nothing in the record suggests the court ruled as promised.
the general rule is that on a silent record the trial court is presumed to have been aware of and followed the applicable law when exercising its discretion.people stowell cal th.the appellate court will not presume error in this situation.ibid.we are not inclined to follow that general rule here for two reasons first,the rules of court state that the court must respond to a request for accommodation subd.e and must inform the applicant in writing subd.e.the court did not respond to the request and did not provide written notice.a tacit denial complies with neither of these mandates.second,if in this setting we were to treat the failure to rule as a denial of the request,we would undermine the policy of the rule,which is to acknowledge and address disabilities of people who come before the court,thereby ensuring equal and full access to the judicial system.subd.b.if the genesis of the rule is that the courts historically have failed to acknowledge and accommodate litigants with disabilit
