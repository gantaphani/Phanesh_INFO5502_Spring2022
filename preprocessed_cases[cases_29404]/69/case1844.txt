factual and procedural backgrounda.factual background 
sasco electric sasco,an electrical contractor,owns the el navegante,a yacht it uses to entertain guests.the yacht is captained by david mcintyre,a sasco management employee with authority to hire and fire employees.from late april to late july each year,sasco sends the yacht to mexico.sasco guests fly to mexico to meet the yacht for two to three night fishing excursions approximately to miles off the coast.sasco also uses the yacht each december to participate in the annual christmas boat parade in newport beach,california.
in late and early,the demand for sasco services declined and sasco began cutting overhead costs and laying off staff.nonetheless,in january,mcintyre hired zibute scherl to work as a deckhand on the yacht.around the same time,sasco purchased the angler,a fishing boat.
before joining the yacht crew,scherl had worked as a deckhand and later as second captain on the cortez,a sport fishing boat.she had previously worked for a water taxi service in baltimore harbor,for the ocean institute aboard historic boats,and on a variety of other boats,including a schooner,a paddle wheeler,and a tug boat.in addition,she is licensed by the coast guard as a merchant marine officer.obtaining this license required scherl to have days at sea,complete hours of classroom training,and pass a written examination.
in september,scherl became second captain in training and mcintyre offered to train her to dock the yacht.she testified the training never occurred because of scheduling problems.he believes she avoided the training because she was not ready for it.both believe she would have successfully completed the training eventually and he never indicated her job would be in jeopardy if she did not complete the training right away.
in december,scherl met jerry jordan,sasco executive director.jordan is responsible for the yacht finances and mcintyre reports to him.jordan congratulated scherl on her recent marriage and told her,whatever you do,do get pregnant.jordan denies this exchange occurred.
in january,scherl became second captain around the same time,mcintyre hired timothy best to be a deckhand on the yacht.mcintyre wife,jane mcintyre jane,also worked for sasco aboard the yacht.
in early february,scherl informed mcintyre and jane of her pregnancy.jane reacted to the news with happiness and excitement.conversely,mcintyre was admittedly disappointed by the news because he thought scherl pregnancy would impact her working on the yacht.in his experience,mothers do not want to work in the boating business.in addition,he thought her plan to work as long as possible during her pregnancy was cavalier.he also had liability concerns.consequently,he told scherl she would need to get a medical release from her doctor in order to make the upcoming trip to mexico in late april.
the morning after scherl informed mcintyre of her pregnancy,mcintyre telephoned jordan to discuss mcintyre liability concerns.jordan admits mcintyre called and informed him of scherl pregnancy,but denies discussing liability concerns with mcintyre.
the same day mcintyre also discussed scherl pregnancy with best.mcintyre expressed concern about scherl exposure to chemicals and fumes as well as the potential she could slip and miscarry.he told best he could not take scherl to mexico and was going to have to find someone else.
on february,sasco sent scherl a letter congratulating her on her pregnancy and requesting a release from her physician indicating she could perform her regular duties without restrictions or limitations and without undue risk to yourself or others.the letter requested submission of the release by march.however,on february,sasco sent scherl an requesting she submit the release as soon as possible.when scherl mentioned the release request to mcintyre,he told her to hold off on getting the release and to wait and see what happens first.
despite mcintyre direction to hold off on getting the medical release,scherl submitted the release form to her doctor.her doctor completed the form and returned it to scherl on or around march.the release indicated and scherl doctor confirmed in deposition testimony that scherl was not incapacitated by and did not have any work restrictions associated with her pregnancy in february.however,the release further indicated and scherl doctor confirmed in deposition testimony that,after may,which was approximately when scherl pregnancy became viable,scherl should not work where she could be knocked over and should not be out to sea for several days at a time.scherl never provided the release to sasco.
on february,jordan sent mcintyre an stating sasco chairman had changed his budget and would only allow him to have two employees on the payroll himself and a deckhand.while the yacht was in mexico and during the december parade season,mcintyre would also be allowed one contract laborer.consequently,the stated jane and the third person will come out of the budget at the end of the prior to learning scherl was pregnant,jordan never informed mcintyre of an anticipated reduction in yacht budget or the corresponding need to reduce the yacht staff.
on february,mcintyre provided scherl with a copy of jordan and informed her he was laying her off.when she asked mcintyre why she had been selected for lay off,mcintyre evaded the question.however,he never indicated her work was unsatisfactory.to the contrary,during her employment,he continually told her she was doing a good job,he was confident in her abilities,and he was happy to have her as part of his crew.in addition,after he terminated her employment,he sent her an unsolicited letter of recommendation describing her as the hardest working,responsible,boat savvy individual to work with me during my seventeen years on this vessel.he also told jane that scherl was the best he had ever seen.
sometime in march,scherl telephoned mcintyre and asked him again why her employment had been terminated.he told her she had not done anything wrong on the yacht and he would not have terminated her employment if she had not been pregnant.he never mentioned her inability to dock the yacht.
mcintyre stated he laid off scherl instead of best because he was concerned about her still being cavalier about working on the boat for too long when she was pregnant and best was capable of running the yacht without him mcintyre admits he told two or three people he laid off scherl because she was pregnant however,he claims he was being sarcastic at the time.
jane stated mcintyre told her he laid off scherl because he had to get rid of two people and she ca drive the boat and she pregnant.best stated both mcintyre and jane told him they felt bad about terminating scherl employment,but they had to let her go because the mexico trip was unsafe for a pregnant woman.in addition,mcintyre told best he laid off scherl instead of firing her because t hat way we ca be sued.he also told best,jane might need to stay home a few weeks.
jane actually stayed off work for about one week and then resumed working aboard the yacht as an independent contractor.according to her,she has since returned to being on sasco payroll and her paychecks are direct deposited.regardless of her payroll status,her duties and work hours did not change.
shortly after mcintyre terminated scherl employment,he suggested she might be able to work on the yacht on a cash basis,but he never contacted her further about this possibility.instead,in april,a few weeks before the yacht was to depart for mexico,mcintyre hired calvin cooper to work on the yacht as an independent contractor deckhand.unlike scherl,cooper had no prior experience.then,the day before the yacht was scheduled to depart to mexico,best resigned his employment with sasco for emergency family reasons and mcintyre put cooper on sasco payroll.he also hired trevor dodge,a friend of cooper,to be an independent contractor deckhand.again,unlike scherl,dodge had no prior experience as a crewmember.
scherl describes the termination of her employment with sasco as devastating.she was incredibly upset and cried the rest of the day.she felt pure shock,betrayal,and embarrassment.she has been obsessed with boating since she was years old and planned to have a career in boating since high school.consequently,when mcintyre terminated her employment,she felt her life had been taken away from her.
she cried every day for over a month and was unable to leave her house.she experienced nausea,insomnia,headaches,and severe depression for at least two months afterwards.she was angry and ashamed.she was afraid to approach her former employer or other potential employers because she felt they would look down at her for getting pregnant and losing her job.she felt she had been deprived of her right to decide when during her pregnancy she should stop working and when she should return to work after her baby birth.
scherl relationship with her husband also suffered because of her termination.they argued about things they would not normally argue about and she stopped trusting him because he told her everything would be okay regarding the pregnancy and it was.their physical relationship is almost and scherl has contemplated divorce because she is concerned that having another child will further harm her career.
the financial pressure associated with the loss of her income and benefits also took its toll on them.they did not have enough money to pay their monthly bills,resulting in their home phone being disconnected and their need to borrow money from his parents to cover health insurance and,at times,rent.some nights they had to scrape together change just to be able to buy food for dinner.
according to scherl husband,she was crushed,crying and angry at the loss of her job.she was severely embarrassed and did not want to face her boating colleagues.according to her,a licensed marriage and family therapist,before her job loss scherl was a happy,cheerful,woman,very playful,very fun to be around,very enjoyable.after her job loss,she was tearful,disappointed,angry,anxious and afraid.she was not enjoying life as much.
scherl has previously been diagnosed with bipolar disorder,but does not take medication for the disorder.in addition,her has never observed symptoms of the disorder in her.although scherl health insurance included some mental health coverage,she was not aware of the coverage and did not seek mental health treatment after mcintyre terminated her employment.
procedural background 
scherl filed a complaint with the department of fair employment and housing the department.the department subsequently issued an accusation alleging sasco discriminated against scherl in violation of feha by terminating her employment because of her pregnancy 
following a evidentiary hearing,an administrative law judge issued a proposed decision,finding against sasco and awarding scherl backpay and in emotional distress damages.the proposed decision also found there was clear and convincing evidence of oppression or malice by sasco and imposed an administrative fine of.the commission adopted the proposed decision.
sasco petitioned the commission for reconsideration,which the commission denied.sasco then petitioned the superior court for a writ of administrative mandamus under code of civil procedure section.the court denied the petition,finding sasco had failed to establish the commission decision was in excess of jurisdiction or that the commission abused its discretion.
sasco appeals,arguing the commission liability finding is not supported by substantial evidence because the commission never considered scherl inability to dock the yacht in determining whether sasco had a justifiable basis for laying off scherl.in addition,sasco argues the commission award of backpay for the period between may and september,is contrary to law and not supported by substantial evidence because there is undisputed medical evidence scherl was disabled by pregnancy during this period.sasco also argues the commission award of in emotional distress damages is not supported by substantial evidence because the evidence relied upon by the commission is subjective and speculative.finally,sasco argues there is not clear and convincing evidence of fraud,oppression,and malice on its part to support the commission imposition of the fine we conclude sasco arguments have no merit.
discussiona.liability 
as we previously explained,our review of the commission decision is governed by the substantial evidence test.in this case,we may presume the existence of substantial evidence to support the commission findings because sasco did not set forth all of the material facts in its opening brief.instead,sasco slanted its statement of facts by omitting material facts unfavorable to its position.foreman clark fallon cal d,huong que,luu th,d.
even without this presumption,we conclude there is substantial evidence to support the commission finding that there was a causal connection between scherl pregnancy and sasco decision to end her employment.mcintyre specifically told scherl she would not have lost her job if she had not been pregnant and he admitted he chose to lay off scherl in part because he was concerned about her still being cavalier about working on the boat too long when she was pregnant.he also told his wife jane that scherl pregnancy was one of the reasons he let her go.likewise,he and jane told best they let scherl go because the mexico trip was unsafe for a pregnant woman.
while sasco insists the reason mcintyre laid off scherl instead of best is that she could not dock the yacht and best could,there is substantial evidence in the record to support the commission finding this reason was pretextual.perhaps most telling on this point is mcintyre remark to best that he could not take sch
