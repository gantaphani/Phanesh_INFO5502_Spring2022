introduction 
the primary issue in this appeal is whether,after a voluntary dismissal of a petition for writ of mandate,the trial court erred by allowing the county of san diego the county to recover actual labor costs incurred for an attorney and paralegals to prepare an administrative record.finding no error,we affirm the order and judgment.
preliminarily,however,we dismiss the appeals of the otay ranch,otay ranch,a cancelled limited partnership,and sky communities,sky communities,a suspended corporation,for lack of capacity.we deny the motion to dismiss the appeal of the remaining appellant,sky vista,sky vista,which is an active corporation.
factual and procedural background 
the county approved a remedial action plan rap for a remediation project at the former otay skeet and trap shooting range project in chula vista,california,and adopted a final mitigated negative declaration mnd on september.the project involved investigation and remediation of surface and subsurface areas impacted from historic shooting range activities and included remediation of soil impacted by lead and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons pahs,removal of white material,as well as the removal of target debris and wood debris from the site.
the otay ranch,sky communities,and sky vista collectively,otay ranch parties are the former owners of the shooting range.they filed a petition for writ of mandate in october alleging the county did not comply with the requirements of the california environmental quality act ceqa pub.resources code,et when it approved and adopted the mnd and rap without preparing an environmental impact report and did not comply with health and safety code section in approving the rap.the otay ranch parties also sought declaratory and injunctive relief.real party in interest,flat rock land company,llc flat rock,is the current owner of the shooting range property and project applicant,which is undertaking voluntary remediation of the site before future development.
the otay ranch parties elected to prepare the record of the proceedings,subject to certification of accuracy by the county.pub.resources code,subd.b.after the court denied the otay ranch parties application for a temporary restraining order to halt the remediation work,the parties stipulated to extend the deadline for preparation and certification of the administrative record to the end of january.the court set a briefing schedule and ordered a hearing date for july.
in january,the parties stipulated again to extend the deadline for certification of the record of proceedings to february,and later agreed to a further informal extension.the parties met on february,to discuss the proposed ceqa record.according to counsel for the county,over half of the documents listed in the proposed index were documents not properly part of the ceqa record and the index omitted hundreds of documents that were part of the ceqa record.after this meeting,the otay ranch parties voluntarily dismissed the ceqa cause of action.
the otay ranch parties filed an amended petition in april alleging a cause of action for lack of compliance with the health and safety code and a request for declaratory relief.the otay ranch parties did not file the administrative record with the amended petition or indicate when the administrative record would be filed.
on april,the court denied otay ranch request for an order shortening time to hear a motion to stay the briefing and hearing in this case pending the outcome of the trial in another case involving environmental of the shooting range during the ex parte hearing,the court inquired about the status of the administrative record.since the otay ranch parties had not prepared the record,counsel for the county stated the county would undertake preparation of the administrative record and would file it with its answer,which was due within days.the otay ranch parties did not object to the county preparing the record nor did it challenge the county assertion the otay ranch parties would be obligated to pay the costs of preparing the record.
because the county department responsible for maintaining the files associated with the project did not have the manpower or resources to prepare the administrative record,it asked the outside law firm representing it in the litigation to prepare the record.counsel for the county worked with james clay,the county staff member most knowledgeable regarding the project,to gather and electronically reproduce the pertinent portions of the administrative record.although the county maintained the project files in a manner allowing the county to perform its responsibilities on the case over the previous decade,parts of the file were segregated,duplicated and disseminated to various staff,divisions and departments.
counsel for the county initially tasked preparation of the administrative record to experienced paralegals,document clerks and an electronic record vendor.however,as the work unfolded,it became necessary for the attorney to become actively involved in reviewing and organizing the record.given the technical complexity of the documents,the scope of the record and the manner in which the documents were maintained,the attorney hired by the county was the only person who understood the interplay of the various versions of the documents as well as which documents should be included in the administrative record and which should not.according to clay,the work required someone with specific knowledge and a comprehensive understanding of the project over the previous decade to reassemble various documents and technical reports with supporting documentation to prepare an adequate administrative record,but the county did not have adequate staffing to undertake this effort.
the attorney and the paralegals worked extended hours and through the weekend to prepare the record.the county filed and served the administrative record on may,consisting of documents totaling more than pages.the following day,may,the otay ranch parties dismissed the entire action.
the county submitted a memorandum of costs seeking recovery of for preparation of the administrative record.the otay ranch parties moved to tax the county cost,requesting the court disallow for attorney and paralegal time incurred to prepare the administrative record.the otay ranch parties argued,as they do on appeal,attorney fees should not be included in a cost award for preparation of the administrative record because attorney fees are not authorized in this action by contract,statute or law.the otay ranch parties did not object to in record preparation costs for time spent by law firm document clerks and county staff or to costs associated with producing the electronic record through an outside vendor.
the county opposed the motion arguing the labor costs of persons with specialized knowledge,are recoverable when they are reasonably necessary to prepare an administrative record.the county presented declarations from clay,defense counsel and a paralegal explaining the process of assembling the administrative record and why it was reasonably necessary to expend attorney and paralegal time to prepare the administrative record.the county also submitted supporting billing statements.
noting the otay ranch parties failed to prepare the administrative record in the six months since the action was filed,the trial court ruled the otay ranch parties were responsible for the costs of preparing the record.the court ruled a recoverable cost incurred in preparing the record must include the labors of the county in preparing the record.relying on this court holding in river valley preservation project metropolitan transit development bd.th,river valley that labor costs incurred for preparing an administrative record are allowable if necessarily incurred and reasonable,including labor for persons with specialized knowledge,ibid,the trial court ruled it was reasonably necessary for the county attorney and her paralegals to prepare the administrative record since the county did not have the resources or experienced personnel to prepare the record.
the court allowed the county to recover only attorney and paralegal time expended after the county decided to prepare the record on april,and disallowed requested time prior to that date.therefore,the court awarded in costs for preparation of the administrative record,which included in labor costs for the county attorney and paralegals attorney hours at per hour and paralegal hours at per hour plus in unchallenged costs.the court disregarded as untimely new evidence submitted in reply regarding an indemnity agreement between the county and flat rock.
discussion 
imotion to dismiss 
before reaching the merits of the appeal,we deal first with the county motion to dismiss,which contends otay ranch lacks capacity to bring the appeal because it is a cancelled limited partnership sky communities lacks capacity to bring the appeal because it is a suspended corporation and sky vista should be dismissed because the three businesses are so intertwined dismissal of the entire appeal is necessary to prevent otay ranch and sky communities from indirectly benefitting from the appeal.we dismiss the appeal as to otay ranch and sky communities,but decline to dismiss as to sky vista.
otay ranch 
in response to our request for supplemental briefing regarding the impact of otay ranch filing of a certificate of cancellation of its limited partnership,otay ranch argued,a corporation dissolution is best understood not as its death,but merely as its retirement from active business.penasquitos,superior court cal d.relying on a statute applicable to corporations it also argued,n o action or proceeding to which a corporation is a party abates by the dissolution of the corporation or by reason of proceedings for winding up,subd.b.
we agree a limited partnership continues after dissolution only for the purpose of winding up its activities,subd.a.in the process of winding up its activities,a dissolved limited partnership may amend its certificate of limited partnership to state that the limited partnership is dissolved,preserve the limited partnership business or property as a going concern for a reasonable time,prosecute and defend actions and proceedings,whether civil,criminal,or administrative,transfer the limited partnership property,settle disputes by mediation or arbitration,file a certificate of cancellation as provided in corporations code section,and perform other necessary acts and shall discharge the limited partnership liabilities,settle and close the limited partnership activities,and marshal and distribute the assets of the partnership,subd.b.
however,corporations code section provides,a dissolved limited partnership that has completed winding up shall deliver to and on a form prescribed by the secretary of state for filing a certificate of cancellation italics added.a certificate of cancellation gives constructive notice of the termination of the limited partnership,subd.d.that notice effectively terminates any apparent authority to bind the limited partnership.limited partnership act com,west ann.ed.foll.
here,otay ranch filed a certificate of cancellation on december,in which the general partners executed a statement of cancellation under penalty of perjury stating,the california limited partnership has completed winding up its affairs and is cancelled.some capitalization omitted,italics added.the certificate of status from the california secretary of state certifies,t he records of this office indicate otay ranch filed a certificate of cancellation on december,and the entity powers,rights and privileges have ceased.applying the plain meaning of the statutes in re cal th,and taking otay ranch general partners at their word that the limited partnership completed winding up its affairs as of the filing of the certificate of cancellation on december,we conclude otay ranch current appeal can not be deemed part of the winding up process.as a result,we dismiss the appeal of otay ranch.
sky communities 
a corporation may not prosecute or defend an action,nor appeal from an adverse judgment in an action while its corporate rights are suspended for failure to pay taxes.bourhis lord cal th,bourhis.however,a corporation whose powers have been suspended may apply with the franchise tax board for reinstatement after satisfying its obligations.if the statutory requirements are met,the franchise tax board issues a certificate of revivor.upon the issuance of the certificate of revivor by the franchise tax board the taxpayer therein named shall become reinstated.bourhis,supra,cal th at.
the california franchise tax board suspended the powers,rights and privileges of sky communities on september,after the voluntary dismissal of the petition but before the entry of the cost order at issue in this appeal.in the certificate of interested entities or persons submitted with the opening brief,counsel for appellants stated,while sky communities,is currently a suspended corporation,it may be reinstated.counsel further stated,sky communities,is taking steps to be reinstated.
in opposition to the motion to dismiss,appellants argued extensively the appeal should not be dismissed based on bourhis,supra,cal th,in which the supreme court held a suspended corporation may proceed with an appeal filed during its suspension because subsequent revival of the corporate status retroactively validates an earlier notice of appeal.id.at.they also argued a notice of appeal filed while a corporation is suspended is merely a procedural defect,not a substantive defect affecting jurisdiction and dismissals based on lack of capacity are disfavored.
bourhis is not applicable.in response to our request for an update regarding the status of the suspension,sky communities informed us the franchise tax board has not yet issued a certificate of revivor.therefore,as a currently suspended company,sky communities is disqualified from exercising any right,power or privilege and,therefore,lacks the capacity to pursue this appeal.bourhis,supra,cal th at laurel crest,vaughn d,laurel crest an appeal of a suspended corporation should be dismissed under the law where there was no reinstatement see cal western business services,corning capital group th,assignee of a judgment lacked capacity to enforce the judgment because the assignor corporate powers were suspended at the time of assignment and were not revived.accordingly,on the record before us,we dismiss the appeal of sky communities.
sky vista is an active california corporation.the county argues the three entities are so intertwined dismissal of sky vista,appeal is necessary to prevent otay ranch and sky communities from gaining indirectly any advantage of this appeal.
the county cites laurel crest,supra,d at for the proposition corporate appellants may be prevented from prosecuting an appeal where an adequate showing is made a dismissed entity would gain an improper advantage of an appeal based on the relationship between the dismissed entity and the remaining entity or entities.no such showing was made in laurel crest even though the complaint in that case alleged the entities were joint venturers.recognizing t he right of appeal is remedial,and in doubtful cases the doubt should be resolved in favor of the right whenever the substantial interests of a party are affected by a judgment,the laurel crest court allowed the entities to pursue their appeal.ibid.
similarly here,the county has not made an adequate showing to dismiss sky vista appeal.sky vista was a general partner in otay ranch and counsel for the otay ranch parties represented to the trial court in another case sky vista sole role was to serve as a partner in otay ranch.however,the operative petition for writ of mandate in this case alleges sky vista was one of three petitioners that had been or would be directly and adversely affected by the project as approved by the county and it had a direct and beneficial interest in requesting compliance with the health and safety code.the county cited no authority compelling the conclusion the business relationship between sky vista and the other entities legally requires dismissal of this appeal.therefore,we deny the motion to dismiss as to sky vista.
cost for preparing administrative record may include attorney and paralegal
