this diversity case requires us to address the contours of covenants not to compete under oklahoma law.when john sappington and william emmer defected from one metals business,southwest stainless,to another,rolled alloys,they took with them years of expertise in the metals industry and personal relationships with many area customers.some years before,southwest stainless had been involved in a merger,and sappington and emmer had signed noncompetition agreements that purported to restrict their ability to work for competitors in the area.when southwest stainless lost business to rolled alloys following sappington and emmer defections,it sued for breach of these agreements and a number of related claims.
after trial,southwest stainless succeeded on a handful of these claims and was granted an injunction ordering sappington and emmer to abide by the noncompetition agreements for a year following judgment.rolled alloys appeals,arguing that even on these claims,southwest stainless failed to connect its alleged loss of business to the defendants actions.exercising jurisdiction under,we affirm the damages and injunction arising from the noncompetition agreements and reverse damages for misappropriation of trade secrets.
southwest stainless,is a metals manufacturer formed by the merger of three metals businesses known collectively as the metals group or metals when the metals group was acquired by hd supply,in,among its owners were sappington,emmer,and ronald siegenthaler.all three men were based in tulsa,oklahoma.as a condition precedent to the acquisition agreement,each signed contracts agreeing that,in the event he left the employment of the metals group,he would not engage in any business within the states of missouri,texas,oklahoma,tennessee,louisiana,alabama,and florida which competes in any manner with any business conducted by any constituent corporation of the metals group for a period of one year the noncompetition agreements sappington and emmer also entered into agreements to remain with the company for three years following the acquisition the employment agreements 
rolled alloys,also competes in the tulsa metals market.prior to the events at issue in this case,however,it sold products to tulsa customers but did not have an office in the area.in the,the metals group and rolled alloys both competed for customers and worked together on sales in which metals served as a middleman for rolled alloys products.
for about three years after the acquisition,siegenthaler consulted for the metals group.more than a year before the events relevant to the case at hand,however,he stopped consulting for metals and took a hiatus from the metals industry.during this period,he operated a consulting company,myriad technologies.however,by,siegenthaler began to contemplate returning to the metals industry and,in particular,opening a rolled alloys office in tulsa.in october,he entered into a business relationship with rolled alloys to open a fully functional rolled alloys office in tulsa.later that same month,he leased space for the office,and by february he was making sales calls.
shortly thereafter,both sappington and emmer left metals for rolled alloys.on friday,march,emmer resigned from the metals group,and on the following monday he started working as an inside salesperson in rolled alloys tulsa office.a month later,on april,sappington submitted his letter of resignation to metals and started working at rolled alloys as an outside salesperson later that same day.in metals industry parlance,inside salespeople price quotes and fill orders,while outside salespeople work directly with and call on customers.
after emmer and sappington began working in rolled alloys tulsa office,rolled alloys won business from customers who had,in the past,placed orders with the metals group of particular relevance to this appeal are orders placed by two customers,and hughes anderson.at trial,emmer denied helping prepare quotes for or any other oklahoma customers.however,faced with documents showing some handwritten figures for a order,emmer acknowledged,i t does look like my writing,but i have no recollection of that at all.a metals employee who had worked with emmer prior to his departure also identified his handwriting on the documents.the documents reflect that placed a order with rolled alloys.historically,metals had averaged a profit margin on orders.
similarly,sappington never acknowledged at trial that he worked on hughes anderson orders after he left metals for rolled alloys.however,he did recall helping owen thornton,a salesperson at metals,price a hughes anderson order shortly before sappington moved to rolled alloys.according to thornton,sappington instructed him to lower the price on certain items,resulting in a quote of.thornton submitted the resulting quote to hughes anderson,but on april,same week sappington started work at rolled anderson placed the order with rolled alloys for.if hughes anderson had selected thornton quote,metals would have made in profit.
invoking the federal courts diversity jurisdiction,southwest stainless sued rolled alloys,siegenthaler,sappington,and emmer on june,in its amended complaint,southwest stainless alleged breach of the noncompetition agreements and employment agreements,breach of the acquisition agreement,interference with business relations,breach of fiduciary duty of loyalty,interference with contractual relations,and misappropriation of trade secrets.in an opinion and order prior to trial,the district court granted partial summary judgment on certain key questions of law oklahoma law governs the interpretation of the noncompetition agreements defendants were entitled to summary judgment as to claims arising out of the employment agreements,as these agreements expired by their own terms prior to the events in question,and defendants were entitled to summary judgment as to claims arising out of the acquisition agreement,as all its relevant conditions had been satisfied.on the remaining claims,the district court concluded that genuine issues of material fact existed for trial.the parties agreed on a pretrial order identifying twelve contested issues of law and contested issues of fact.
after a bench trial,the district court issued a page opinion and order,reaching conclusions of fact and conclusions of law.in its order entering judgment,the court found in favor of plaintiffs as to the following claims breach of the noncompetition agreements against sappington and emmer,breach of fiduciary duty of loyalty against sappington,interference with contractual relations against siegenthaler and rolled alloys,and misappropriation of trade secrets against sappington and rolled alloys.on all other claims,the court entered judgment in favor of the defendants.in ordering relief,the court found the actual damages for these claims to be duplicative,and damages of for the claims related to the order and for the claims related to the hughes anderson order.however,for the misappropriation of trade secrets claims,it found that sappington and rolled alloys had willfully and maliciously misappropriated southwest stainless hughes anderson quote and ordered an additional in exemplary damages.in addition,because it found that sappington and emmer had been in breach of the noncompetition agreements since leaving metals,it ordered injunctive relief permanently restrain ing them for a period of one year from directly or indirectly engaging in any business within tulsa,rogers,wagoner,okmulgee,creek,pawnee,osage and washington counties,oklahoma,which competes in any manner with any business conducted by plaintiffs southwest stainless,or hd supply.
sappington,emmer,siegenthaler,and rolled alloys timely appealed.
on appeal,rolled alloys raises twelve issues challenging aspects of each and every entry of judgment and the ordered relief.our standard of review is the same for the majority of the challenges in an appeal from a bench trial,we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.weyerhaeuser brantley,cir quotation omitted.a finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is without factual support in the record or if,after reviewing all the evidence,we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.id.at quotation omitted.in conducting this review,w e view the evidence in the light most favorable to the district court ruling and must uphold any district court finding that is permissible in light of the evidence.id.while we review the amount of a damage award for clear error,the methodology a district court uses in calculating a damage award,such as determining the proper elements of the award or the proper scope of recovery,is a question of law we review de novo.ftc kuykendall,cir quotation and brackets omitted.the parties do not challenge the district court decision that oklahoma law governs.
regarding the damages awarded for breach of the noncompetition agreements,rolled alloys raises two challenges on appeal that sappington and emmer breaches did not cause damage to metals,and that the district court used improper methods in calculating damages.we address each in turn.
a thread common to many of the issues rolled alloys raises on appeal is that the district court committed clear error in concluding that sappington caused metals to lose the hughes anderson order and emmer caused metals to lose the order.it makes three interrelated arguments on this front that it was contradictory for the district court to conclude that metals failed to show that it lost general profits to rolled alloys and yet find that it had lost these specific orders that unless the district court identified how sappington and emmer caused the damages,it could not conclude that they had actually caused these damages and that metals could not prove that rolled alloys caused it to lose these orders unless it proved that it would have otherwise won the orders.we are unpersuaded.
under oklahoma law,i n order for damages to be recoverable for breach of contract they must be clearly ascertainable,in both their nature and origin,and it must be made to appear they are the natural and proximate consequence of the breach and not speculative and contingent.florafax int l,gte mktg.however,a claim for lost profits need not be proven with absolute certainty in essence,what a plaintiff must show for the recovery of lost profits is sufficient certainty that reasonable minds might believe from a preponderance of the evidence that such damages were actually suffered.boatsman sw.bell yellow pages,quoting florafax int l,at brackets omitted.under this standard,the district courts findings are supported by the record.
we agree with rolled alloys that internally inconsistent findings constitute clear error.john allan craig allen,llc,cir.we do not agree that the district court made such inconsistent findings in this case.rolled alloys emphasizes that,at trial,the court stated,the plaintiffs want me to infer that all the damages from the breach are all the profits that rolled alloys made from the tulsa customers since these gentlemen joined rolled alloys.and i think i would have to make a leap of faith there.similarly,in its findings of fact,the district court concluded 
p laintiffs are not entitled to general lost profit damages from sappington and emmer.plaintiffs failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that sappington and emmer employment with rolled alloys conduct caused any of the general lost profits.the claimed lost profits are based on sales that rolled alloys made,but the record contains no evidence that metals would have made these profits had the noncompetition agreements not been breached.
rolled alloys argues that it was contradictory to thereafter conclude that sappington caused in damages related to the hughes anderson order and emmer caused in damages related to the order.
intentionally or not,the defendants ignore the distinction the district court made,both in its statement at trial and in its findings of fact,between general lost profits and profits lost on specific orders.we conclude that it was not contradictory for the district court to decide that it was speculative and contingent to infer that metals would have won all of the business of rolled alloys customers but for sappington and emmer breaching the noncompetition agreements,while simultaneously concluding that a preponderance of the evidence showed that their breaches led metals to lose the individual hughes anderson and orders.the general profits metals claimed to have lost were the sum of every order rolled alloys won from the sixteen customers also served by metals.in rejecting metals claim for general lost profits,the district court merely concluded that it had not proven it would have won all of this business.to conclude that it had shown it would have won some of this business is not contradictory.thus,this argument does not provide a basis for concluding that the district court findings were clearly erroneous.
in the absence of internal inconsistencies in the district court findings,we conclude that the record shows a sufficient certainty that reasonable minds might believe from a preponderance of the evidence that the damages awarded for the hughes anderson and orders were actually suffered.florafax int l,at.with respect to the hughes anderson order,the district court concluded that sappington must have disclosed,or directly or indirectly worked on,the hughes anderson order at rolled alloys,a direct violation of sappington noncompetition agreement.there is ample evidence in the record supporting this conclusion hughes anderson placed the order with rolled alloys mere days after sappington defected sappington acknowledged helping price metals quote before he left in the decade proceeding sappington departure,metals had lost just one hughes anderson order to rolled alloys sappington was very friendly with rich gustafson,a purchasing contact at hughes anderson and,perhaps most damningly,rolled alloys bid was just less than that of metals.
rolled alloys argues that even if the record supports the conclusion that sappington must have worked on the hughes anderson order,damages can not be awarded unless the district court can conclude what sappington purportedly did and how the in damages had purportedly resulted.neither of these arguments defeats the district court findings.a c ausal connection may be proved by circumstantial evidence,provided the evidence has sufficient probative force to constitute the basis for a legal inference,rather than mere speculation,and the circumstances proved lead to the conclusion with reasonable certainty and probability.martin stratton.the district court did not merely speculate that sappington caused metals to lose the order rather it concluded that he must have caused metals to the lose the order.the evidence cited above is plainly sufficient to support this legal inference.
similarly,metals put on evidence that it submitted a quote just more than rolled alloys quote.this is sufficient for the district court to have concluded that metals would have won the order but for sappington involvement in rolled alloys indeed,sappington himself testified,gustafson has always been very concerned about pricing.so what he was doing,i assuming,wa s placing an order with the low bidder.finally,the district court identified the factual basis for the profit margin used in its damages calculation on testimony that the actual metals quote at issue used a profit margin.thus,we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in determining that sappington breach caused in damages arising from the hughes anderson order.
the record regarding the order is thinner,but it is not without factual support in the record we are not left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made in determining that emmer breach of the noncompetition agreement led to in damages.see weyerhaeuser,at quotation omitted.although a plaintiff seeking damages must show lost profits with sufficient certainty that reasonable minds might believe from a preponderance of the evidence that such damages were actually suffered,florafax int l,at,we are guided by the general principle that what showing is sufficient can depend on the amount at stake,manouchehri heim.
emmer himself identified figures in his handwriting on the rolled alloys quote for the order,and a metals employee who had worked with emmer described those figures as deliberately undercut ting the metals pricing with which emmer was intimately familiar.although the record does not show that metals bid on this specific order,undisputed testimony established that metals bid on at least of the orders eventually placed with rolled alloys.this evidence permitted the district court to conclude that it was more likely than not that metals bid on this order.see florafax int l,at f or the recovery of lost profits a plaintiff must show by a preponderance of the evidence that such damages were actually suffered.that same witness testified that metals average profit margin on orders was.thus,the in damages assessed for the order was not clearly erroneous.
having concluded that,as a factual matter,the district court conclusion that sappington and emmer breaches damaged metals was not clearly erroneous,we turn to the question of whether it used proper methodologies in calculating the damages awarded for these breaches t he methodology a district court uses in calculating a damage award is a question of law we review de novo.kuykendall,at quotation omitted.under the applicable oklahoma law,
the measure of contract damages is the amount which will compensate the party aggrieved for all the detriment proximately caused thereby,or which,in the ordinary course of things,would be likely to result therefrom.no damages can be recovered for a breach of contract,which are not clearly ascertainable in both their nature and origin.
stat.tit,footnote omitted see also florafax int l,at applying title,to lost profits.while the amount of lost profits may not be based on mere speculation,conjecture and surmise alone,the mere uncertainty as to the exact amount of damages will not preclude the right of recovery.it is sufficient if the evidence shows the extent of damage by just and reasonable inference.florafax int l,at citations omitted.under these general principles,we discern no legal error in the methods used by the district court.
regarding the hughes anderson order,the district court assessed the in damages based on thornton testimony that metals bid of included a profit margin.given that the district court concluded that hughes anderson would have selected this metals quote but for sappington breach,this method of calculating the damage is plainly proper it simply awarded the profits that,as a factual matter,metals would have made on the order we decide that these are damages that,in the ordinary course of things,would be likely to result from this breach.stat.tit.
to calculate the profits lost on the order,the district court based its award on metals average profit margin of on orders.the track record of a business clearly i s appropriate to consider on the issue of the extent of lost profits.florafax int l,at see also boatsman,at lost profits may be extrapolate d from business done before the breach.this figure was based on the recent history of metals business with,according to the testimony of a metals employee who had worked with for ten to fifteen years the defendants argue that the district court erred because it multiplied this margin by the amount of revenue rolled alloys received from that sale,rather than what metals might have received for the order.however,because rolled alloys won this business because it underbid metals,this method simply awarded damages at the very bottom of the range likely to result from the breach.see.stat.tit.thus,we conclude that the district court used acceptable methods in calculating the damages for these claims.
rolled alloys also attacks the district court factual conclusions regarding whether sappington was liable for tortious interference with business relations or breached his fiduciary duty of loyalty to metals,whether siegenthaler and rolled alloys were liable for tortious interference with contractual relations,and whether metals is entitled to damages on these claims.it acknowledges that,as with the breach of contract claims,we review the district court conclusions on these issues for clear error.weyerhaeuser,at.contrary to rolled alloys assertions,however,we discern factual support in the record for all but one of the district court factual conclusions and are not left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.id.at.
we need not address the merits of rolled alloys argument that sappington is not liable for tortious interference with business relations.we acknowledge that in its opinion and order preceding judgment,the district court stated,the c ourt finds,therefore,that plaintiffs are entitled to recover from sappington for tortious interference the in profits they had a reasonable assurance of realizing on the hughes anderson quote.however,when it entered judgment,the district court entered judgment in favor of sappington and emmer on this claim.thus,there is no relief to be granted on appeal.
rolled alloys argument that the district court erred in concluding that sappington breached a fiduciary duty he owed to metals is not persuasive.as rolled alloys openly acknowledges,it only challenges the factual basis for this conclusion and adopts the same argument it makes in challenging the factual basis for the district court conclusions regarding sappington breach of the noncompetition agreement.for the reasons described above,see part,supra,the record supports the district court factual findings regarding sappington role in the hughes anderson order.we also discern no error in the district court conclusion that these damages were not separate and distinct from those sought by metals for breach of contract.see united phosphorus,midland fumigant,cir.thus,we affirm the district court assessment of duplicative damages on the basis of breach of fiduciary duty 
rolled alloys next challenges the district court conclusion that siegenthaler and rolled alloys are liable for tortious interference with contract.arguing that t his is precisely the same standard articulated by the district court with regard to metals claim of tortious interference with business,rolled alloys asserts that the district court could not logically find for the defendants on that claim but for the plaintiffs on this claim.the defendants argument misapprehends the district court basis for finding in favor of the plaintiffs on this claim of contract interference.
rolled alloys is correct that the standard for interference with contract or business relations is the same a plaintiff must show that it had a business or contractual right that was interfered with the interference was malicious and wrongful,and that such interference was neither justified,privileged nor excusable and damage was proximately sustained as a result of the interference.mac adjustment,prop.loss research bureau.rolled alloys argument fails,however,because it assumes that the same relationship is at issue in both claims.in metals claim against sappington and emmer for interference,it alleged that they interfered with metals business relationship with its customers.metals claim against siegenthaler and rolled alloys,on the other hand,is for their interference with its contractual relationship with sappington and emmer.thus,it is not contradictory to reach opposite conclusions with respect to these claims.
we also conclude that there is sufficient record support for the district court finding of liability against siegenthaler and rolled alloys on this claim.metals undisputedly had contractual relationships with sappington and emmer the noncompetition agreements.the defendants were aware of these agreements and nonetheless hired sappington and emmer away from metals to work in their tulsa office.further,sappington and emmer departures from metals for rolled alloys proximately caused metals to lose the hughes anderson and orders to rolled alloys.see part,supra.thus,the district court did not err in concluding that the defendants interfered with metals contractual relations with sappington and emmer.
we need not linger on rolled alloys argument that the district court erred
