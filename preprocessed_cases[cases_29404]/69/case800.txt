jimmy reiners called the police department in evansville,wisconsin,claiming that he needed mary mezera address in order to serve papers on her regarding property that they jointly owned.officer christopher jones disclosed mezera address to reiners who,as it turns out,is her abusive against whom she had a restraining order.mezera and her husband,david deicher,sued the city of evansville,wisconsin,officer jones,and the city insurer,community insurance corporation,alleging that officer jones violated the driver privacy protection act dppa when he disclosed mezera address.after a jury verdict in the plaintiffs favor,the jury awarded in damages.
the plaintiffs appeal,contending that the district court erred when it answered a question from the jury by providing the filing date of the complaint,which was not in evidence,but not the notice of claim,a properly admitted exhibit filed prior to the complaint that indicated the plaintiffs intent to file suit.we find that the district court properly took judicial notice of the complaint filing date,but because there is a reasonable possibility that this date confused the jury,the court erred by failing to provide the jury with the notice of claim.
the plaintiffs also object to the district court calculation of the attorneys fees,maintaining that the court committed error by limiting the attorneys fees to the amount won at trial however,since a new trial on damages is warranted,we need not reach this issue.therefore,we reverse the judgment and remand for a new trial on damages and a new determination of attorneys fees.
background 
mary mezera divorced her jimmy reiners after years of physical and psychological abuse.on october,mezera and her new husband,david deicher,left their home in evansville,wisconsin,and moved to a new location in beaver dam,wisconsin,which they kept secret from reiners.on february,reiners called the evansville police department looking for mezera home address,allegedly for the purpose of obtaining past due mortgage payments on property that he jointly owned with mezera.officer jones placed reiners on hold,obtained the plaintiffs new address from the state of wisconsin motor vehicle records,and provided it to reiners.he claims that he provided the address after doing a brief check of wisconsin civil litigation database,but this database also contained reiners and mezera divorce decree.
reiners then attempted to contact the plaintiffs by leaving a note in their mailbox.mezera testified that following the disclosure of her address,she received a threatening phone call from reiners that she came home on the day of reiners birthday to find a table overturned outside of her home and that she lived in constant fear that reiners would return to harm her,deicher,or their animals.the plaintiffs complained to the evansville police department,which began an investigation.the department concluded that officer jones made a serious error by disclosing the plaintiffs address and he was reprimanded.
on april,the plaintiffs served a letter on the evansville police department entitled notice of claim,which informed the department that the plaintiffs intended to file a lawsuit.the plaintiffs filed suit on june,against officer jones,the city of evansville,and its insurer for violating the dppa.that statute prohibits anyone from obtaining or disclosing information from motor vehicle records,subject to certain exceptions.see a.
at trial,the plaintiffs argued that officer jones falsified his report regarding the incident with reiners to provide a potential defense to the plaintiffs dppa claim.there is an exemption to dppa liability if the information was given to a third party for use in connection with any civil,criminal,administrative,or arbitral proceeding in any federal,state,or local court or agency or before any body,including the service of process,investigation in anticipation of litigation,and the execution or enforcement of judgments and orders,or pursuant to an order of a federal,state,or local court.b.
officer jones report,which he claimed to have prepared a few days after he disclosed the plaintiffs address,stated that the plaintiffs address was provided to reiners for service of process of documents relating to the foreclosure of a trailer that mezera and reiners owned during their marriage.the report further states that officer jones had run reiners name through a federal law enforcement database before giving out the plaintiffs address.the plaintiffs claim,however,that this information was entered into the computer system months after the incident,specifically after the department received the plaintiffs notice of claim indicating that they planned to file suit over the dppa violation.
at trial,the plaintiffs maintained that the police department initiated an extensive coverup of this incident.officer jones testified that he ran a background check on reiners through a federal law enforcement database prior to disclosing the plaintiffs address,which revealed no criminal background.there was no record in the system,however,of officer jones ever accessing state or federal records on february.in addition,the chief of the evansville police department acknowledged that he wrote a letter to the manager of the federal law enforcement database asking whether officer jones conducted the requisite background check on reiners and received a response that officer jones had never run reiners name through the federal database.although officer jones was reprimanded for disclosing the plaintiffs address,on the chief admitted that officer jones was not disciplined for stating in his official police report that he had run reiners through the federal database,nor was the report ever corrected to reflect that the federal background check had never been conducted.
officer jones also testified that he ran a background check on reiners through various wisconsin databases prior to disclosing the plaintiffs address,but this information was not in his report and the records from the database showed that reiners name was run days after he contacted officer jones.the wisconsin databases also disclosed that mezera had a restraining order against reiners,although officer jones denied under oath having seen the order.had he actually run the background check,the plaintiffs contend,officer jones would have discovered that reiners had a violent history and a restraining order against him that would have alerted officer jones not to provide reiners with the plaintiffs address.furthermore,the plaintiffs argue that reiners never mentioned anything about serving papers in his call with police,undermining the truthfulness of officer jones report.
after a trial on liability,the jury found that officer jones provided the plaintiffs address to reiners in violation of the dppa and returned a verdict in their favor.during the trial to determine damages,the jury sent a question to the court asking for the date the case was filed.that date had not been entered into evidence.both the parties objected,the defendants because they were not sure why the jury needed the date and the plaintiffs because they believed that what the jury actually wanted to know was the date when the notice of claim had been served on the defendants,not the date the complaint had been filed.the district court provided the date the case had been filed,commenting over the objection of counsel,the court is going to provide this very meaningful piece of information to the jury.and i tell them also the sun rises in the east and sets in the west sic if they want to know.
the jury awarded mezera and deicher in compensatory damages.the latter was increased upon the plaintiffs motion to the statutory minimum of.the jury also awarded the plaintiffs in punitive damages,for a total damages award of.these amounts were substantially less than the amounts that the plaintiffs asked for at trial,where they contended that they suffered severe emotional trauma after learning that reiners knew where they lived.
the plaintiffs moved for a new trial based on the district court communication to the jury of information outside the record,and they maintained that the punitive damages award was grossly inadequate.they also sought attorneys fees under the dppa,b,seeking the lodestar of incurred in litigating their case.the district court first denied of the fee request,stating that certain billed hours were duplicative,excessive unnecessary.rather than awarding the remaining after this reduction,however,the court then limited the fee award to on the rationale that the attorneys fees should not exceed the amount the jury awarded to the plaintiffs in damages.
the plaintiffs counsel then moved for an additional in fees for litigating the fee award.the district court awarded of this request,or,reasoning that since the plaintiffs had received of what had been requested in fees for the main litigation,they should receive of the amount requested for litigating the fee award.the court then denied the plaintiffs motion for a new trial on damages.
ii.analysis 
a.the district court was entitled to take judicial notice of the complaint filing date.
we review the district court denial of a motion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion.huff sheahan,cir.the plaintiffs claim that a new trial is required on the issue of damages because the district court answered a jury question with information extrinsic to the complaint filing committed error per se which,the plaintiffs maintain,by definition means that the improper communication influenced the jury verdict.specifically,they argue the district court should have provided the jury with the date of the notice of claim and not the complaint filing date which,they claim,was improper extrinsic evidence.we review the district court answer to a jury question for an abuse of discretion.united states hewlett,cir united states sababu,cir.
it is undisputed that the complaint filing date was not admitted into evidence.see united states mcclellan,cir should the jury request clarification on a matter during deliberations,it is when the court responds with a misleading,incorrect,unclear or unresponsive,not with concrete accuracy statement of law or fact,or with facts not in evidence,that we might have cause for concern.emphasis added.however,the complaint filing date,similar to other documents that are either directly related to or produced during the course of the proceedings,does not generate the same concerns that are present when evidence that is outside the scope of the proceedings is introduced.see in re hanford nuclear reservation,cir finding that evidence from the defendant first trial,although not introduced into evidence and improperly referenced during the second trial,was not extrinsic information smith duncan,cir taking judicial notice of state court documents that were not admitted into evidence but had a direct relationship to the appeal.
we could find no cases where circuit courts have resolved the issue of whether a court may take judicial notice of the complaint filing date,but several district courts have held that a court may take judicial notice of the date a complaint is filed,and once it does so,that information is no longer extrinsic to the record.see,gilman schwartz,c,wl,at,taking judicial notice of the complaint filing date because that date was essential to the adjudication of the issues in the case gulf ins.glasbrenner.
additionally,a court can take judicial notice of matters of public record.pugh tribune,cir taking judicial notice of stock prices see also lee city of los angeles,cir holding that a district court can take judicial notice of a waiver of extradition,which is a matter of public record,but erred by taking judicial notice of disputed facts.since the complaint filing date is a matter of public record and subject to judicial notice,we find that it is not extrinsic evidence.
b.the district court abused its discretion when it failed to provide the jury with the notice of claim during deliberations.
although the district court was entitled to take judicial notice of the complaint filing date,its decision to provide this information to the jury brought out a fundamental error in the proceedings its failure to allow the jury to consult the notice of claim during deliberations even though the plaintiffs had requested the jury be allowed to do so.a district court answer to a jury question must be viewed in light of the issues presented at trial.see,united states watts,cir.the answer to a jury question might implicate other evidence presented in the case,and this is the situation with the notice of claim exhibit that was excluded from the jury here.
generally,it is within the trial court discretion to determine which exhibits are provided to the jury during deliberations we review this decision only for a clear abuse of discretion.united states biggs,cir united states arroyo,cir.such discretion is usually exercised to exclude exhibits that neither party has relied on,that have no relevance to any of the issues central to the case,or that are cumulative,prejudicial,confusing,or misleading.see.allowing the judge to exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury,or by considerations of undue delay,waste of time,or needless presentation of cumulative evidence see also united states gross,cir affirming the exclusion of exhibits that contained conflicting statutes and ordinances that had no bearing on issues in the case.the clear abuse of discretion standard is deferential and recognizes that t he admission or exclusion of evidence is a matter particularly suited to the broad discretion of the trial judge.united states casoni,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in applying this standard,we give special deference to the district court handling of the exhibits,biggs,at,but we must still consider whether the district court has exercised its discretion in a reasonable manner.see cincinnati ins.flanders motor service,cir a decision constitutes an abuse of discretion when it is not just clearly incorrect,but downright unreasonable.citation omitted see also casoni,at noting that the discretion accorded to district courts is not unlimited.
the situation before us,where the appellant argues that a district court has denied a request to have the jury consult a properly admitted exhibit,seems to be rare.more commonly,a party argues that a jury has been exposed to information not admitted into evidence.in the latter case,to obtain a new trial,a party must show that it was prejudiced by the improper exposure.see united states magana,cir even if a defendant alleges that improper material was before the jury he must still show that there was some prejudice or substantial right affected by the presence.citation omitted see also bankcard america,universal bancard systems,cir when unapproved material reaches the jury,the trial court must decide whether there is a reasonable possibility the material altered the jury verdict.
we have also required a showing of prejudice for properly admitted exhibits that allegedly improperly influenced the jury.united states best,cir en banc finding that the jury was not prejudiced by exposure to evidence that had been properly admitted at trial see also united states parker,cir probative value of evidence admitted must be weighed against possible prejudice that may result if the exhibits are sent to the jury.thus,we hold that a new trial is required if there is a reasonable possibility that a party is prejudiced by the district court failure to provide certain exhibits to the jury,even if the exhibits are properly admitted.see generally bankcard america,at a new trial is granted if the verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence or if a prejudicial error occurred.even if errors occurred,no new trial is required if the errors were harmless.artis hitachi zosen clearing,cir where jury was exposed to extraneous evidence,the inquiry is whether there is a reasonable possibility that the communication altered the jury verdict internal quotation omitted haugh jones laughlin steel,cir same.where a district court has unreasonably excluded exhibits from the jury to the detriment of a party and there is a reasonable possibility tha
