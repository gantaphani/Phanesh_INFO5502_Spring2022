plaintiff weight watchers international,weight watchers appeals the denial of its motion to modify a preliminary injunction in a trademark infringement suit.
background 
a.the original packaging 
weight watchers is a leading provider of weight loss products and services.since,it has offered a diet plan known as the points or winning points plan in which foods are given a point value based on the number of calories and grams of fat and fiber they contain.weight watchers members are assigned a points range principally based on their body weight and may eat what they choose so long as the total point value of the food they eat throughout the day does not exceed their assigned ranges.
weight watchers registered the terms points and winning points pursuant to the lanham act,et.in addition to using the points and winning points marks in guides that list the point values for some common supermarket items,it has licensed the mark for use in connection with the sale of packaged,including frozen,foods.
defendant luigino luigino is a maker of frozen foods and the owner of the michelina lean gourmet brand of frozen food.in early,it began to market a line of michelina lean gourmet frozen meals that prominently displayed in a box on the lower left corner of the front panel of each package the amounts of fat grams and total calories in the product,as well as the point value.next to the word points was an asterisk.on the back of the package was another asterisk accompanied by a disclaimer that stated,inter alia,that points is a registered trademark of weight watchers,that luigino had calculated the point value of the product,and that such use of the term points was not intended to imply sponsorship or approval by weight watchers for example,the front face of its michelina lean gourmet pasta in wine and mushroom sauce with white chicken contained a box stating that the product had grams of fat,calories and points with an asterisk,apparently intended to refer consumers to the back of the package where the disclaimer appeared.
after becoming aware of the packaging,weight watchers brought claims against luigino under the lanham act,a and c,as well as new york statutory and common law,and sought a preliminary injunction.the district court held hearings on may and,at which weight watchers submitted survey evidence showing that potential consumers were likely to be confused by the packaging and believe that weight watchers either had calculated or verified the point values displayed on the package fronts of the michelina lean gourmet products.
at the may,hearing,the court below found that the term points on the front of the package was intended to refer to weight watchers trademarked points or winning points diet plan and that it was likely to confuse consumers into believing that weight watchers had assigned the points to,or otherwise endorsed,the michelina lean gourmet products.it then said that it would enjoin luigino from using the packaging.in doing so,however,the court stated that luigino is entitled to present information which would be of interest to persons buying its product.
on june,the district court issued a written order enjoining luigino from using the packaging.the second paragraph provided that 
it shall not be a violation of this order for luigino,in its packaging,to convey accurate factual information concerning the points values of products,provided that luigino states,as part of such information,that luigino or michelina has calculated such values.if this is done,it is to be according to the guidelines expressed by the court at the may,hearing.
the exact nature of the guidelines referred to is unclear.weight watchers contends that,at the very least,they include the district court suggestion during the may,hearing that there be as great an effort as possible to avoid any idea that weight watchers sponsors or approves or endorses this product.luigino,however,takes refuge in the suggestion of the district court that the confusion might be resolved by having the entire slogan printed in the same size print so that nothing is so strongly emphasized that other parts will be ignored.in any event,neither party appealed this order.
b.the new packaging 
in june,luigino came out with new packaging for its line of michelina lean gourmet frozen products.the new packaging,which is very similar to the original,contains a text box on the lower left front corner.n points as calculated by michelina is printed in one half of the box.the entire slogan is printed in the same font and type size.the numbers of calories and fat grams in the product is printed in the other half of the box.next to the reference to the point value is an asterisk.on the back of the package in small type beside another asterisk is a disclaimer similar to that on the original packaging 
the new packaging began to appear in supermarkets in june or july of.it came to the attention of weight watchers some time over the summer of.weight watchers claims that it then did informal testing on the product,which indicated that consumers might find it confusing.on september,counsel for weight watchers objected to the new packaging,and suggested that the parties engage in consumer testing to determine the effect of the disclaimer.luigino did not respond.weight watchers then commissioned a consumer survey concerning the new packaging it was completed by the end of november.
on january,weight watchers moved to modify the preliminary injunction to enjoin the use of the new packaging.in due course,the district court held a hearing.weight watchers offered its survey evidence and argued that the addition of the phrase as calculated by michelina did not overcome the likelihood of confusion posed by luigino use of the points mark on the front of its packaging.
luigino offered no evidence as to whether its new packaging was likely to confuse customers.it relied entirely on the packaging itself and an affidavit from a consumer psychologist that criticized the design,methodology and conclusions of weight watchers consumer survey.
the court below determined that weight watchers survey evidence was flawed and gave it no weight in its analysis.it then examined the new packaging,concluding that common sense dictated that the points mark on the front in combination with the statement as calculated by michelina was not likely to confuse consumers.it did,however,find that the disclaimer on the back was unreadable.
in an order dated june,the court denied so much of weight watchers motion as sought to enjoin the use of its points trademark on the front of the michelina lean gourmet products and granted it to the extent that luigino was enjoined from using the disclaimer it then had on the back of the box.the order further approved a more readable disclaimer that luigino had adopted after the hearing and prior to june.this appeal followed.
discussion 
the decision whether to modify a preliminary injunction involves an exercise of the same discretion that a court employs in an initial decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction.see sierra club united states army corps of engineers,cir.we therefore review the denial of a motion to modify a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.id.at.a court abuses its discretion where it applies an incorrect legal standard,too,gemmy indus,cir,or bases its ruling on clearly erroneous findings of fact,verio,cir matthew bender,west publ g,cir.
appellate jurisdiction 
luigino first contends that we do not have jurisdiction over the appeal.it argues that weight watchers motion to modify was,in substance,an attempt to obtain reconsideration of the second paragraph of the district court preliminary injunction of june.it maintains that the june,order merely clarified the preliminary injunction and that this is but an untimely appeal of the preliminary injunction.
section a of the judicial code,a,permits appeals of all orders granting,modifying,dissolving,refusing,or refusing to dissolve or modify an injunction.an order reconsidering or interpreting a preliminary injunction consequently is not appealable.see wilder bernstein,cir accord of cmty.orgs.for reform now acorn illinois
