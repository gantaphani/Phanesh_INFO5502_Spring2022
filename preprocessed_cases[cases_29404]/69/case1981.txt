the state of california department of corrections and rehabilitation cdc appeals an order granting inmate carlos escamilla petition for a writ of habeas corpus and awarding him for personal property cdc did not return to him.on appeal,cdc contends the order should be reversed because a writ of habeas corpus can not be used for recovery of personal property or money damages escamilla claim is barred by his failure to comply with the claims presentation requirements of the california tort claims act the act,et and there is insufficient evidence to support the trial court findings.we requested,and have received and considered,supplemental briefs submitted by the parties on the issue of whether escamilla petition for writ of habeas corpus should be treated as a petition for writ of mandamus seeking specific recovery of his personal property or its value and therefore is not a claim for money or damages pursuant to section.
factual and procedural background 
on november,escamilla was an inmate at the calipatria state prison.at,he purchased worth of items at the prison canteen that were then placed in canteen bags he left the canteen and sat outside of the exercise yard with his canteen bags,waiting for an order to return to his assigned cell.he was wearing a pair of levis jeans,a pair of reebok tennis shoes,a nike sweatshirt,and a seiko wristwatch.
shortly after,a prison riot began in the exercise yard between certain inmates and prison guards after the riot ended,escamilla was escorted from the exercise yard by a guard apparently correctional officer nava,who helped escamilla carry his canteen bags.escamilla was placed in an administrative segregated housing unit adseg or shu pending an internal investigation regarding his participation in the riot.sergeant valenzuela stopped escamilla en route to the shu and told him he was going to the hole.escamilla requested that valenzuela have his canteen items placed together with the rest of his personal property.valenzuela replied no that goes to the trash on his arrival at the shu,in view of the shu staff under valenzuela supervision,escamilla placed his levis jeans,reebok shoes,nike sweatshirt,and seiko wristwatch inside his canteen bags,together with his canteen items,to protect his property from being thrown away in the trash.
on november,escamilla signed an inmate property inventory form cdc that,on its face,appeared to itemize personal property taken from cell apparently escamilla regular cell after he had been placed in the shu 
on march,escamilla was released from the shu,but the clothing,watch,and canteen items that he possessed on his person on his november,arrival at the shu were not returned to him.apparently on that date,a notation was added to the november,inventory form that inmate claims to be missing approx.of canteen items he had just received.claims he still had canteen item s on the yard.
on or about march,escamilla filed a first level inmate appeal form,substantially setting forth the facts as described,ante,and stating whether the items were thrown in the trash as ordered by sergeant valenzuela or were lost by staff,i am hereby demanding a redress of the value of each item above mentioned.a total amount of.he requested the following action i am hereby demanding a redress of the value of the following items that were confiscated a pair of levis valued at,a pair of tennis shoes reeboks valued at,a sweat shirt nike valued at,a seiko valued at,the loss of the canteen valued at.total amount of.escamilla subsequently submitted a copy of his canteen receipt dated november,showing the items purchased and amounts he paid for those canteen items.in partially granting escamilla first level appeal,sergeant brown noted nava stated that escamilla was in boxers.i never saw any clothes.he did have some canteen items.i do know how much canteen he had.i do remember if the canteen went to or with him.brown also noted that valenzuela stated i never saw any canteen.i was in and out of that day.escamilla never said anything to me about his property that i recall.brown concluded 
you escamilla provided receipts for of canteen items purchased on november.officer nava verified that you had a bag of canteen items with you.it appears that your canteen never got put into your property and was misplaced and lost.you will be compensated for of canteen.however,you provided no proof that the clothing items you claim were lost were on your person when you went to ad seg.neither of the staff interviewed recall you having these clothing items with you on the yard.therefore,you will not be compensated for those items.
on or about august,escamilla filed a second level appeal,asserting that the first level response was inadequate in that it did not award him compensation for his missing clothing and watch.escamilla argued 
i t appears that cdc fails to realize that a prisoner is require d to be fully clothed when going to the canteen.here,the evidence shows that minutes after i had my canteen,the incident occurred and the yard went down.therefore,the preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that.when i went to my canteen items i was fully clothed,as required by the rules,and did not just have on my boxers and.that i remained fully clothed until i was escorted to.whereat i stripped and placed aforementioned items in the bag together with the canteen items i had just bought to ensure myself that the personal property together with the canteen items would be protected from being thrown in the trash.
in denying escamilla second level appeal,chief deputy warden ochoa stated 
it is reasonable to assume you were fully clothed when you went to the canteen however,you have not provided proof as to whether you were wearing personal clothing or state clothing.it is possible for an inmate to be fully dressed without wearing any personal property.additionally,all the staff mentioned by you as having knowledge of this issue were interviewed,and none of them recall seeing any personal clothing items on you when they escorted you to ad seg.
jimenez,r r sergeant,was contacted and asked to review your property file to determine if you were ever issued,via r r,any of the items you claim to be missing.after reviewing your property file,sergeant jimenez stated there is no documentation in your file that you have ever received a wristwatch or a pair of reebok shoes.sergeant jimenez said you did have three pairs of levi jeans and a gray sweatshirt,all of which were issued to you on march,with your property.sergeant jimenez also mentioned you had been brought to r r to be compensated for the lost canteen items,at which time you refused to accept compensation,stating you were not willing to accept partial compensation and you still wanted to be reimbursed for the missing personal clothing items.
on or about september,escamilla filed a third level appeal,asserting the second level response was without merit and based on prevarications.escamilla argued that ochoa did not substantiate jimenez statement with escamilla property card file record a copy of which escamilla asserted he was not authorized to obtain.he asserted it was cdc responsibility to obtain that property record in weighing the officer word against his.in denying escamilla third level appeal,cdc inmate appeals chief grannis by surges stated 
staff can not be held responsible for the loss of items that they had no control over.there is no credible evidence presented by escamilla to establish that he ever possessed the items he listed as missing or that he was wearing them at the time he was placed in asu.staff verified and escamilla produced receipts for the canteen items noted by escamilla.as a result,escamilla was compensated for worth of canteen items.absent verifiable evidence that he was in authorized possession of the other items listed as missing,there is no negligence established and no compensation is due to escamilla.
on january,escamilla filed the instant petition for writ of habeas corpus against stuart ryan apparently the acting warden of cdc calipatria state prison,substantially alleging the facts as described ante and 
t he fact that the,inmate property inventory form,is not to be found in file at r r gives evidence that staff at shu never filled it in on november,but rather followed sergeant valenzuela orders to throw escamilla p ersonal property in the trash.had staff at shu filled in the,inmate property inventory form,as they were compelled to do so by rules,regulations and law,the form would be filed in escamilla property file and there would be no question as to what p ersonal p roperty escamilla had on his person when he entered shu on november.as stated in my appeal i placed the items inside the bags of canteen i had just bought.citation.
escamilla requested that the trial court grant his petition and issue an order directing cdc or state board of control to redress him in the amount of for his lost canteen and personal property listed in his petition.
on march,the trial court issued an order to show cause osc why the relief in escamilla petition should not be granted.cdc filed a return to the osc,arguing escamilla had not exhausted his administrative remedies because he failed to fully comply with the act claims presentation requirements.it also argued that a petition for writ of habeas corpus was not the proper remedy for an inmate seeking monetary damages for a property claim.finally,it argued there was insufficient evidence to support escamilla claim.escamilla filed a traverse denying the arguments made in cdc return.
on june,the trial court issued an order granting escamilla petition,stating 
the court is unpersuaded by cdc return.this court finds good cause to grant escamilla petition for writ of habeas corpus.relief in the form of is awarded to escamilla which shall be placed in his trust account,or credited to a canteen account,as he may choose.
cdc timely filed a notice of appeal.
discussion 
iescamilla petition as a petition for writ of mandamus seeking specific recovery of his personal property or its value and application of the act 
we requested,and have received and considered,supplemental briefs on the issues of whether escamilla petition for writ of habeas corpus should be treated as a petition for writ of mandamus seeking recovery of personal property or its value and application of the act.
the act sets forth a claims presentation requirement for all claims for money or damages against the state,subd.b and generally provides that no suit for money or damages may be brought against a public entity on a cause of action for which a claim is required to be presented under the act provisions until a written claim therefor has been presented to the public entity and rejected by the victim compensation and government claims board the board formerly the board of control,subd.b.
in minsky city of los angeles cal d,minsky,the supreme court addressed the issue of whether the act claims presentation requirements apply to an action by an arrestee for the return of property taken by local police officers at the time of arrest and wrongfully withheld following the disposition of criminal charges.id.at.in that case,police officers took from michael joseph marino on his arrest and allegedly wrongfully detained and converted it by transferring it to the policeman and fireman pension fund minsky,supra,cal d at.minsky stated 
we do not think that the claims statutes were intended to cover a case in which the city takes the property of an arrested person,holds it as a bailee,and retains it for the city own use.hence plaintiff failure to comply with those statutes erects no bar to a cause of action for the return of the property so seized and retained.in reaching this conclusion,we observe that the language of section makes clear that the requirements for presentation of claims apply only to claims for money or damages and not to claims for other forms of relief,such as specific recovery of property taken by the city as a bailee.minsky,supra,cal d at.
minsky reasoned 
a claim for the specific recovery of property has never been considered a claim for money or damages as used in section and its predecessors.o nly claimants seeking money or damages,as distinguished from other types of judicial relief,are required to conform to the claims procedure.the claims statutes do not impose any requirements for nonpecuniary actions,such as those seeking injunctive,specific,or declaratory relief.citation.italics added.where a wrongdoer has converted personal property,the injured owner must elect between his right of ownership and possession with the remedy of specific recovery and his right to compensation with the remedies of damages for conversion or recovery of value on theory of waiver of tort.citation.minsky,at,fns.omitted.
in the circumstances of minsky,the court concluded t he government in effect occupies the position of a bailee when it seizes from an arrestee property that is not shown to be contraband.citation.the arrestee retains his right to eventual specific recovery,whether he seeks to regain tangible property like an automobile,ring,wallet or camera,or whether he seeks to recover a specific sum of money which,under general constructive trust principles,is traceable to property within the possession of the defendant.citations.id.at,fn.omitted.minsky then noted 
e ven if the money taken from arrestee marino is no longer traceable to any property presently in defendant possession and thus is not strictly available for specific recovery,we believe that plaintiff cause of action would not be foreclosed by the claims statutes.as discussed above,after a local governmental entity wrongfully withholds an arrestee property,the arrestee clearly can seek specific recovery of the property while it is still in the possession of the local entity without being limited to the relatively short period for filing claims set forth in the claims statutes.this initial exemption of the action from the claims statute is not lost simply because the city takes the further wrongful step of disposing of the bailed property.the city can not be permitted to invoke the claims statute,originally not available to it,by virtue of a later wrongful dissipation of the property.to so hold would be in effect to allow the local entity to profit by its own wrong,penalizing a plaintiff who,in light of the specific recovery remedy apparently available to him,justifiably did not file a claim.minsky,supra,cal d at,fn,italics added.
furthermore,minsky concluded that a complaint failure to expressly seek specific recovery of property does not preclude that theory of recovery if the facts alleged therein are sufficient to support a claim for specific recovery.id.at.minsky also noted a defendant in a criminal proceeding clearly has the right to obtain mandamus to compel the return of personal property wrongfully withheld by the custodial officers.citations.mandamus lies in the criminal proceeding even after disposition of the criminal charges.citation.no court has intimated or held that the claims statute applies to the arrestee directly seeking mandamus in a criminal proceeding to compel the return of property wrongfully in the possession of custodial officers.we perceive no reason why the plaintiff,as the arrestee assignee,should be in any different position merely because he proceeds in a civil action.id.at.minsky concluded in sum,we hold that the instant complaint,seeking the recovery of property seized and wrongfully withheld by defendants,does not involve a claim for money or damages within the meaning of section,and thus would not fall within the act claims presentation requirements id.at.
subsequently,in holt kelly cal d,holt,the supreme court held that an arrestee who seeks in good faith to specifically recover property taken from him at the time of his arrest is exempt from the claim filing provisions of the government code,even though some or all of the property may have been dissipated and respondent may be compelled to respond in damages in lieu of property.id.at,fn.omitted.in holt,the petitioner was arrested by a county sheriff deputy and taken to a county jail,along with the petitioner footlocker trunk,for overnight detention.id.at.he was not given a receipt for his trunk or its contents.ibid.the day after his arrest,the petitioner was transferred to another county jail and its booking officer completed a jail arrest record which included a property receipt section.ibid.that section described the petitioner personal property,including the handwritten notation,hand tools,ibid.the petitioner was not given that form or any other receipt for his property.ibid.no inventory was taken of the trunk contents.ibid.when the petitioner property was not returned after his release,he filed a petition for writ of mandate seeking return of items of property or the value of that property taken by the county sheriff on his arrest.id.at.a referee found that all of the property claimed by petitioner had been taken by the county sheriff,but none of it was returned to him.ibid.the value of the property was.ibid.the supreme court independently reviewed the record and concluded the referee findings were supported by and correctly interpreted the evidence.id.at.because the county sheriff had a duty to return the claimed property to the petitioner,the supreme court,citing minsky,concluded a writ of mandate was appropriate to compel the return of that property.holt,at.holt quoted language from minsky,including footnote,and concluded 
for the foregoing reasons we hold that an arrestee who seeks in good faith to specifically recover property taken from him at the time of his arrest is exempt from the act claim filing provisions,even though some or all of the property may have been dissipated and respondent may be compelled to respond in damages in lieu of property respondent may not convert his wrongful dissipation of the property into an advantage by using it to support an essentially dilatory defense based on failure to comply with the claims statutes.holt,at,fn.omitted.
rejecting the respondent argument that the petitioner claim was for damages,holt stated 
respondent contends that since some or all of the property is now unavailable he is responsible only by means of a proper claim for money damages and not in mandamus.this position is without merit,especially in light of the fact that any property now missing is the result of respondent own misconduct.we have heretofore held that mandamus may be brought to start the chain of action designed to compel a ministerial duty by a public officer,even if the ultimate goal may be recovery of a sum of money.citations.it is also clear that mandamus will lie where the recovery of money is merely ancillary to an underlying proceeding which seeks performance of a ministerial duty.citations.holt,at,fn.
accordingly,the supreme court in holt disposed of the appeal as follows let a writ of mandate issue directing respondent to return to petitioner the property found by the referee to have been withheld from him,and if respondent is unable to do so,to deliver to petitioner the value thereof,the sum of.holt,at.
in long city of los angeles th,d,the court applied the supreme court holdings in minsky and holt in reversing a summary judgment against a plaintiff in his action for specific recovery of personal property.long,at,d.in long,the city of los angeles seized birds,along with their cages and related items,which the plaintiff had kept at his home.id.at,d.the plaintiff filed an action seeking return of his birds and other personal property,alleging the original seizure was unlawful and some of the birds had died or been injured while wrongfully detained by the city.ibid.the city moved for summary judgment,asserting the plaintiff had not complied with the act claims presentation requirements.id.at,d.the trial court granted the motion and entered summary judgment for the city.ibid.on appeal,long stated significantly,the supreme court in holt held that where confiscated property is lost and can not be returned due to the government own negligence,the government may not benefit from its own wrongdoing by contending the resulting action,necessarily limited to monetary damages,is subject to the act.id.at,d,italics added.long concluded 
this case is governed by holt and minsky.although plaintiff sought relief via injunction rather than writ of mandate,the procedural distinction is meaningless for our purposes.as in holt,plaintiff swiftly and in good faith pursued the return of his personal property,thus fulfilling t he policy of providing prompt notice of claims to governmental entities which underlies the claims statute citation holt kelly,supra,cal d at.having allegedly wrongfully destroyed plaintiff property,the city may not cite the claims filing statute as a defense to what has become,by virtue of the city purported misconduct,a damages action.we conclude,as a matter of law,the city is not entitled to summary judgment based upon plaintiff failure to comply with the claims filing statutes.long,at,d,italics added.
accordingly,the court reversed the summary judgment in the city favor.id.at,d.
because the circumstances in this case are substantially apposite to those in minsky,holt,and long,we conclude escamilla petition for writ of habeas corpus should be treated as a petition for writ of mandamus seeking specific recovery of his personal property or its value and therefore is not a claim for money or damages pursuant to section.although escamilla asserts a writ of habeas corpus is an appropriate writ to remedy the loss of his personal property,we need not decide that question because he alternatively argues his petition could be treated as a petition for a writ of mandate.under minsky and holt,the most appropriate writ to direct the government to return personal property or its value in a bailment or situation is a writ of mandamus.minsky,supra,cal d at,holt,supra,cal d at,fn.as quoted ante,minsky stated a defendant in a criminal proceeding clearly has the right to obtain mandamus to compel the return of personal property wrongfully withheld by the custodial officers.citations.mandamus lies in the criminal proceeding even after disposition of the criminal charges.citation.no court has intimated or held that the claims statute applies to the arrestee directly seeking mandamus in a criminal proceeding to compel the return of property wrongfully in the possession of custodial officers.minsky,at.likewise,citing minsky as authority,holt stated 
petitioner seeks to recover either the property or its value by means of a writ of mandate.the availability of the mandamus remedy is governed by section of the code of civil procedure,which provides in relevant part that the writ may issue to compel the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins,as a duty resulting from an office,trust,or station.since respondent is under a duty to return the claimed property to petitioner citation,a writ of mandate is appropriate to compel its return.citation.holt,at.
holt further stated we have heretofore held that mandamus may be brought to start the chain of action designed to compel a ministerial duty by a public officer,even if the ultimate goal may be recovery of a sum of money.citations.id.at,fn.in the circumstances of this case,escamilla,like the plaintiff in minsky and the petitioner in holt,alleged that a custodial officer took personal property from him and wrongfully did not return it to him.because that custodial officer,the prison warden on behalf of cdc effectively acted as a bailee of escamilla personal property,a petition for writ of mandamus is the most appropriate writ for escamilla to recover that property or its value from that custodial officer 
although cdc summarily argues escamilla waived his assertion that his petition should,alternatively,be considered as a petition for writ of mandamus because he did not raise that assertion in the trial court,cdc does not cite any case or other authority showing we are precluded from deciding the question of whether escamilla petition can be treated as a petition for writ of mandamus.on the contrary,because the question of whether escamilla petition can or should be considered to be a petition for writ of mandamus is an issue of law not turning on disputed facts and involves an important question of public policy,we exercise our discretion to consider and decide that question even though escamilla did not raise it below.medical center superior court cal th,d.furthermore,because escamilla petition sufficiently alleged facts that would support its consideration as a petition for writ of mandamus,we,like the court in minsky,are not precluded on appeal from considering that pleading to be a petition for writ of mandamus.minsky,supra,cal d at.the label given a petition,action or other pleading is not determinative rather,the true nature of a petition or cause of action is based on the facts alleged and remedy sought in that pleading.code civ,subd.a branciforte heights,llc city of santa cruz th,d loehr ventura county community college dist.d.slater blackwood cal d.furthermore,a complaint failure to expressly seek specific recovery of property does not preclude that theory of recovery if the facts alleged therein are sufficient to support a claim for specific recovery.minsky,at,macisaac pozzo cal d,masero bessolo,von schrader milton.
in this case,escamilla petition alleged that he had personal property on him when he was taken to the shu on november.it further alleged that valenzuela stated his canteen items would be placed in the trash.after his arrival at the shu,his personal property was either lost or thrown away per valenzuela orders.on escamilla release on march,none of that personal property was returned to him.therefore,escamilla petition alleged sufficient facts to support a petition for writ of mandamus against the prison warden and cdc for return of his personal property or the value thereof.minsky,supra,cal d at,holt,supra,cal d at,fn.
cdc apparently asserts the fact that escamilla personal property was thrown away,destroyed,or otherwise disposed of by its staff converts escamilla claim for specific recovery of his personal property or its value into a claim for money or damages that requires compliance with the act claims presentation requirements.however,
even if the property taken from an arrestee is no longer traceable to any property presently in defendant possession and thus is not strictly available for specific recovery,we believe that plaintiff cause of action would not be foreclosed by the claims statutes.minsky,supra,cal d at,fn,italics added.
furthermore,holt stated that an arrestee who seeks in good faith to specifically recover property taken from him at the time of his arrest is exempt from the claim filing provisions of the government code,even though some or all of the property may have been dissipated and respondent may be compelled to respond in damages in lieu of property.holt,supra,cal d,fn.omitted.it further stated that respondent may not convert his wrongful dissipation of the property into an advantage by using it to support an essentially dilatory defense based on failure to comply with the claims statutes.ibid.holt rejected an argument similar to the one made by cdc in this case,concluding that because any property now missing is the result of respondent own misconduct,the respondent may not convert his wrongful dissipation of the property into a defense of noncompliance with the act claims presentation requirements because now the claim purportedly is one only for money or damages.id.at,fn,see also long city of los angeles,supra,th at,d.cdc wrongful dissipation of escamilla personal property does not convert his claim for specific recovery of his personal property or the value thereof into a claim for money or damages that requires compliance with the act claims presentation requirements.
finally,although we have concluded escamilla was not required to comply with the act claims presentation requirements before filing the instant petition,we nevertheless note that the purposes of the act claims presentation requirements were essentially satisfied in the circumstances of this case.as minsky noted 
the policy underlying the act claims presentation requirements is to afford prompt notice of claims to governmental entities.citations.the courts and commentators have considered prompt notice important for several reasons to allow early investigation of the facts,informed fiscal planning in light of prospective liabilities,settlement of claims before the initiation of costly civil litigation,and avoidance of similarly caused future injuries or liabilities.citations.none of these reasons apply to the governmental entity owing an affirmative statutory duty to hold private property for eventual return to the lawful owner.minsky,supra,cal d at.
escamilla filed three appeals,first level,second level,and third level appeals in accordance with cdc internal appeal requirements in an attempt to obtain the return of his personal property or the value thereof.cdc does not assert that any of those appeals were untimely.accordingly,cdc was given prompt notice of escamilla claim prior to his filing of the instant petition,which gave it an opportunity to conduct an early investigation of his claim and attempt to settle that claim and avoid similarly caused future injuries or liabilities.we are not persuaded that the public policy purposes of the act claims presentation requirements were,in the circumstances of this case,substantially contravened or undermined by escamilla filing of the instant petition without first filing a claim under section.minsky,at.
substantial evidence to support the trial court findings 
cdc contends the evidence is insufficient to support the trial court findings.however,in so doing,cdc misconstrues or misapplies the applicable substantial evidence standard of review.
a judgment of a trial court is presumed to be correct on appeal,and all intendments and presumptions are indulged in favor of its correctness.citations.in re marriage of arceneaux cal d.this is particularly true when the appellant did not request a statement of decision or findings of fact.under these circumstances,all intendments favor the ruling below citation,and we must assume that the trial court made whatever findings are necessary to sustain the judgment.citation.michael jamie cal d,superseded by statute on another ground as noted in in re zacharia cal th,d.furthermore,t he burden of demonstrating error rests on the appellant.citation.winograd american broadcasting th,d.
when the trial court has resolved a disputed factual issue,the appellate courts review the ruling according to the substantial evidence rule.if the trial court resolution of the factual issue is supported by substantial evidence,it must be affirmed.winograd american broadcasting,supra,th at,d.in applying the substantial evidence standard of review,the power of an appellate court begins and ends with a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,to support the findings below.citation.we must therefore review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,giving it the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolving all conflicts in its favor in accordance with the standard of review so long adhered to by this court.jessup farms baldwin cal d.the substantial evidence standard applies to both express and implied findings of fact made by the superior court in its statement of decision rendered after a nonjury trial.citation.sfpp burlington northern santa fe ry.th,d.substantial evidence is evidence of ponderable legal significance,evidence that is reasonable,credible and of solid value.citations.substantial evidence is not synonymous with any evidence.citations.the focus is on the quality,rather than the quantity,of the evidence.roddenberry roddenberry th,d.it is not our task to weigh conflicts and disputes in the evidence that is the province of the trier of fact.howard owens corning th,d.alternatively stated,we do not evaluate the credibility of the witnesses or otherwise reweigh the evidence.id.at,d.rather,we defer to the trier of fact on issues of credibility.citation.lenk,th,d.
