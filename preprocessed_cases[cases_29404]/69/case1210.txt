factual and procedural background 
steven cheung,an economics professor and consultant,formed the company on july,as a washington state corporation.originally,the company issued shares of stock,all of which were owned by cheung.on july,cheung transferred of his shares to linda su,ronald cheung,and cecile cheung as joint tenants with the right of survivorship.on august,cheung transferred another shares to the same parties.
on february,pursuant to a the internal revenue service irs issued a jeopardy assessment against cheung for income tax liability for the year.the assessment identified cheung tax liability as,plus a penalty in the amount of and statutory interest in the amount of,totaling.the same day,the irs,believing the company was a nominee of cheung,issued and served a notice of jeopardy levy on the company pursuant to a pursuant to the levy,the irs collected from a corporate checking account.on february,a second notice of jeopardy levy was served on the company,under which the irs collected from a corporate investment account.on may,the company,in lieu of a forced liquidation of its real property assets,issued a check in the amount of,satisfying cheung remaining tax liability.in total,the irs levy efforts resulted in the collection of from the company.
on october,the company filed an administrative claim for the return of funds improperly levied pursuant to b the claim was denied.thereafter,on september,the company filed a complaint for recovery of wrongful levy pursuant to a a bench trial then commenced.at the conclusion of the government case,the company moved for a judgment on partial findings pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c.the court granted the motion,finding that the company property had been wrongfully levied.the court then entered judgment in favor of the company and ordered that the government pay the company,plus interest as provided by law.a hearing was set to determine the appropriate amount of interest owed to the company.
section g provides for the recovery of interest on a judgment of wrongful levy at the overpayment rate established under section.in the case of a corporation,a provides that the overpayment rate is the sum of the federal rate plus percentage points.internal parenthesis omitted.the flush language of a provides,however,for a one and a half point reduction in the overpayment rate t o the extent that an overpayment of tax by a corporation for any taxable period exceeds.
at the hearing,the parties disputed the applicability of the rate reduction described in the flush language.the company argued that the plain meaning of the statute did not support a reduction in the overpayment rate because a wrongful levy is not an overpayment of tax as the term is understood under the internal revenue code the code.the government disagreed,arguing that by applying the overpayment rate from to interest recoverable on a wrongful levy judgment,congress treated a wrongful levy as overpayment of tax for purposes of calculating the overpayment rate.
on january,the district court ruled in favor of the company,holding that a wrongful levy is not an overpayment of tax within the meaning of a and therefore that the overpayment rate on a wrongful levy judgment is calculated without reference to a flush language.the court then awarded the company in interest through october,the date of entry of judgment.the court further ordered that the government pay additional interest at a per diem rate of from october,onward,subject to change based upon the federal rate.on january,the district court awarded the company attorney fees and costs pursuant to but it denied the company request for statutory damages made available by h following entry of final judgment,the government timely appealed the district court interpretation of a

iii.analysis 
whether the flush language of a applies in the case of a wrongful levy judgment is a question of first impression.because resolution of the issue turns on the interpretation of the statute,we begin with the language of the statute itself.ordlock,cir the starting point in every case involving the construction of a statute is the language itself.quoting greyhound hood stages,d.in ascertaining the plain meaning of a statute,the court must look to the particular statutory language at issue,as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.id.quoting mccarthy bronson,d.where the statutory language is clear and consistent with the statutory scheme at issue,the plain language of the statute is conclusive and the judicial inquiry is at an end.molski cable,cir quoting botosan paul mcnally realty,cir.where,on the other hand,the words of a statute are not conclusive as to congressional intent,they should be placed in their proper context by resort to legislative history.ordlock,at.
section g provides for the recovery of interest on a wrongful levy judgment at the overpayment rate established under section.section states in pertinent part 
determination of rate of interest 
a general rule.
overpayment overpayment rate established under this section shall be the sum of 
a the federal rate determined under subsection b,plus 
b percentage points percentage points in the case of a corporation 
to the extent that an overpayment of tax by a corporation for any taxable period as defined in subsection c,applied by substituting overpayment for underpayment exceeds,subparagraph b shall be applied by substituting percentage point for percentage points.
substituting overpayment for underpayment in c a,that provision reads,the term large corporate overpayment means any overpayment of a tax by a c corporation for any taxable period if the amount of such overpayment for such period exceeds.
according to the company,the flush language of a does not apply to wrongful levy judgments because a wrongful levy is not an overpayment of tax.thus,the company states in its brief that it did not pay,let alone overpay,any tax when the irs wrongfully and negligently seized its property.the government asserts,however,that whether an overpayment of tax occurred is irrelevant.it is the government position that congress,in applying the overpayment rate from to wrongful levy judgments,expressed its intent to treat such judgments as if they were overpayments of tax for purposes of calculating the overpayment rate regardless of their true nature.we are persuaded by the government position 
the principal question before us is not whether a wrongful levy is an overpayment of tax.rather,the issue is whether,in calculating the overpayment rate in connection with a wrongful levy judgement,a rate reduction applies to the extent that the wrongful levy exceeds.to be sure,a levy can be understood as the imposition of a tax.see a if any person liable to pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay the same within days after notice and demand,it shall be lawful fo
