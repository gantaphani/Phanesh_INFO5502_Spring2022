plaintiff,a car buyer,filed this class action against a car dealer,alleging violations of the consumers legal remedies act clra,the automobile sales finance act asfa,the unfair competition law ucl bus,the song beverly consumer warranty act song beverly act,and the california tire recycling act tire recycling act pub.resources code,
the car dealer filed a motion to compel arbitration pursuant to a provision in the sales contract,which also contained a class action waiver.the trial court determined that the class action waiver was unenforceable on the ground that a consumer is statutorily entitled to maintain a clra suit as a class action.see.the arbitration provision in the sales contract stated that if the class action waiver was declared unenforceable,the entire arbitration provision was not to be enforced.pursuant to this poison pill clause,the trial court denied the petition to compel arbitration.the car dealer appealed.
we affirm but for a different reason.we conclude that the arbitration provision is unconscionable the provision is adhesive involving oppression and surprise and contains harsh terms that favor the car dealer to the detriment of the buyer.because the provision contains multiple invalid clauses,it is permeated by unconscionability and unenforceable.we can not sever all of the offending language.thus,regardless of the validity of the class action waiver,the trial court properly declined to compel arbitration.
background 
the allegations and facts in this appeal are taken from the pleadings and the exhibits submitted in connection with the petition to compel arbitration.
plaintiff,gil sanchez,filed this class action in march.two months later,sanchez filed a first amended complaint complaint.it alleged as follows.
on august,sanchez went to a car dealer,mercedes benz of valencia a fictitious business name for defendant valencia holding company,llc valencia and expressed an interest in buying a certified mercedes.a salesman showed him a mercedes benz with an advertised price of around.sanchez said he wanted to trade in his cadillac deville because he was upside down on it he owed more than the car was worth.the salesman told sanchez they could probably make the deal work,depending on how much sanchez could afford as a down payment.
after a test drive,the salesman told sanchez that valencia would give him for his cadillac,on which sanchez still owed approximately,creating a negative equity of.sanchez made a down payment of.the salesman said sanchez might be required to make a higher down payment,but it could be paid over time.
valencia informed sanchez that he had to pay to have the mercedes benz certified to qualify for an interest rate of percent.that statement was false.the payment was actually for an extended limited warranty,which was optional and unrelated to the interest rate.sanchez agreed to the additional payment,believing it was a certification fee required to obtain the offered rate.
sanchez met with valencia finance manager,who completed all of the financial information on the sales documents,including a preprinted retail installment sale contract sale contract the total sales price was.the amount financed was,with a monthly payment of.the sale contract listed a charge of for license fees and for registration,transfer,and titling fees.it included a optional dmv electronic filing fee,but valencia never discussed the fee with sanchez or asked if he wanted to opt out of it.the sale contract also charged sanchez new tire fees of a new tire fee of for each new tire,including the spare.but not all of the tires were new.last,the contract showed a down payment of instead of the sanchez had just paid.
valencia represented that the vehicle was certified,meaning it had been through a rigorous inspection and certification process in which any deficiencies were repaired,replaced,or reconditioned.a certified vehicle comes with a month limited warranty.as alleged,the certified classification and the certification program were intentionally fraudulent.nothing was done to improve the condition or operation of a certified vehicle.a carfax vehicle history report which would have disclosed prior accidents and damage is supposed to accompany every certified vehicle,but sanchez did not receive one.
sanchez executed the sale contract and took possession of the vehicle on august.a few days later,valencia called him and said he owed more toward the down payment.on august,sanchez went to the dealership and wrote a check for.sometime thereafter,sanchez received another call,telling him he owed still more on the down payment.he went to the dealership and wrote a check for,bringing the total down payment to.
sanchez soon experienced problems with the vehicle,including malfunctions with various electrical systems,water leaks inside the passenger cabin and the trunk,engine failures,and errors with the warning and indicator lights.sanchez took the vehicle to authorized repair facilities on several occasions,including valencia,but they were unable to repair the vehicle.eventually,valencia accused sanchez of having tampered with or wrecked the vehicle,told him it would cost to make the repairs,and said the warranties would not apply.the accusation against sanchez was false.sanchez then had the vehicle inspected elsewhere and learned it had been in an accident or had been inadequately repaired before he bought it.
sanchez alleges that valencia violated several california laws by failing to separately itemize the amount of the down payment that is deferred to a date after the execution of the sale contract failing to distinguish registration,transfer,and titling fees,on the one hand,from license fees,on the other hand charging buyers the optional dmv electronic filing fee without discussing it or asking the buyer if he or she wanted to pay it charging new tire fees for used tires and telling sanchez to pay to have the vehicle certified so he could qualify for the percent interest rate when that payment was actually for an optional extended warranty unrelated to the rate.
the complaint alleged that a class action was appropriate based on the numerosity of putative class members,the predominance of common questions of law and fact,the typicality of the claims,and the superiority and benefits of class litigation.four distinct classes were proposed based on the particular violations committed by valencia.
fifteen causes of action were alleged.the first one,for violation of the clra,was premised on valencia false representations and sought injunctive relief and damages,including punitive damages.of the remaining causes of action alleging violations of the clra,asfa,ucl,song beverly act,or tire recycling act sought injunctive relief,rescission of the sale contract,restitution,or some combination thereof,but no damages.the other two,alleging violations of the tire recycling act and the song beverly act,sought civil penalties or damages.under the tire recycling act,sanchez sought a civil penalty not exceeding for new tire fees charged for used tires.see pub.resources code,subds.b.e.as provided in the song beverly act,he sought general and consequential damages plus a civil penalty up to two times actual damages.see.the complaint also prayed for an award of attorney fees.
motion to compel arbitration 
on june,valencia filed a motion to compel arbitration pursuant to an arbitration provision in the sale contract.the provision stated.either you or we may choose to have any dispute between us decided by arbitration and not in court or by jury trial.
if a dispute is arbitrated,you will give up your right to participate as a class representative or class member on any class claim you may have against us including any right to class arbitration or any consolidation of individual arbitrations.
discovery and rights to appeal in arbitration are generally more limited than in a lawsuit,and other rights that you and we would have in court may not be available in arbitration.
any claim or dispute,whether in contract,tort,statute or otherwise including the interpretation and scope of this arbitration clause,and the arbitrability of the claim or dispute,between you and us or our employees,agents,successors or assigns,which arises out of or relates to your credit application,purchase or condition of this vehicle,this contract or any resulting transaction or relationship shall,at your or our election,be resolved by neutral,binding arbitration and not by a court action any claim or dispute is to be arbitrated by a single arbitrator on an individual basis and not as a class action.you expressly waive any right you may have to arbitrate a class action.you may choose one of the following arbitration organizations and its applicable rules the national arbitration forum,the american arbitration association,or any other organization that you may choose subject to our approval 
arbitrators shall be attorneys or retired judges and shall be selected pursuant to the applicable rules.the arbitrator shall apply governing substantive law in making an award.the arbitration hearing shall be conducted in the federal district in which you reside we will advance your filing,administration,service or case management fee and your arbitrator or hearing fee all up to a maximum of,which may be reimbursed by decision of the arbitrator at the arbitrator discretion.each party shall be responsible for its own attorney,expert and other fees,unless awarded by the arbitrator under applicable law.if the chosen arbitration organization rules conflict with this arbitration clause,then the provisions of this arbitration clause shall control.the arbitrator award shall be final and binding on all parties,except that in the event the arbitrator award for a party is or against a party is in excess of,or includes an award of injunctive relief against a party,that party may request a new arbitration under the rules of the arbitration organization by a panel.the appealing party requesting new arbitration shall be responsible for the filing fee and other arbitration costs subject to a final determination by the arbitrators of a fair apportionment of costs.any arbitration under this arbitration clause shall be governed by the federal arbitration act et and not by any state law concerning arbitration.
you and we retain any rights to remedies,such as repossession.you and we retain the right to seek remedies in small claims court for disputes or claims within that court jurisdiction,unless such action is transferred,removed or appealed to a different court.neither you nor we waive the right to arbitrate by using remedies or filing suit.any court having jurisdiction may enter judgment on the arbitrator award.this arbitration clause shall survive any termination,payoff or transfer of this contract.if any part of this arbitration clause,other than waivers of class action rights,is deemed or found to be unenforceable for any reason,the remainder shall remain enforceable.if a waiver of class action rights is deemed or found to be unenforceable for any reason in a case in which class action allegations have been made,the remainder of this arbitration clause shall be unenforceable.italics added,some capitalization omitted.
in anticipation of sanchez contentions,valencia asserted in its moving papers that the arbitration provision was not procedurally or substantively unconscionable under the principles set forth in armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th at page armendariz and the class action waiver was not invalid under discover bank superior court cal th,which was later overruled in at t mobility llc concepcion.concepcion.this second point was of special importance because the arbitration provision contained a poison pill clause if the class action waiver was found to be unenforceable,the entire arbitration provision was unenforceable,and the case would be adjudicated in a court of law.
the sale contract is a preprinted document consisting of one page,inches wide and inches long.there are provisions on both sides that occupy the entire document,leaving little in the way of margins.sanchez signed or initialed the front in eight places,each related to a different provision.no signatures,initials,or other handwriting appears on the back.the arbitration provision,entitled arbitration clause,is on the back at the bottom of the page,outlined by a black box.it is the last provision of the sale contract concerning the purchase transaction a provision related to the assignment of the contract appears below it.the buyer final signature appears near the bottom on the front side.
in his opposition papers,sanchez disagreed with valencia legal points.he also submitted a declaration,stating when i signed the documents related to my purchase of the subject vehicle,i was presented with a stack of documents,and was simply told by the dealership employee where to sign initial each one.all of the documents including the purchase contracts were form documents.when i signed the documents,i was not given an opportunity to read any of the documents,nor was i given an opportunity to negotiate any of the terms.the documents were presented to me on a basis,to either sign them or not buy the car there was no question of choice on my part or of my being able to negotiate anything.and i had no reason to suspect that hidden on the back of the contracts was a section that prohibited me from being able to sue the dealership in court if i had a problem.
when i signed the purchase contract and related documents,the dealership did not ask me if i was willing to arbitrate any disputes with it,did not tell me that there was an arbitration clause on the back side of the purchase contract,and i did not see any such clause before i signed the documents.the dealership did not explain to me what an arbitration clause was.i was not given any opportunity at any time during my transaction with the dealership to negotiate whether or not i would agree to arbitrate any potential disputes.i was not given an option whether to sign a contract with an arbitration clause or one without.
prior to the filing of valencia motion to compel arbitration,i had never heard of the national arbitration forum or american arbitration association.nor was i aware that there was a clause in my contract with the dealership supposedly requiring me to go to arbitration if i had a dispute with the dealership and that i had to read the rules of those organizations before signing my purchase contracts.no one at the dealership turned my purchase contract over and showed me the writing on the back or asked me to sign any sections on the back of the contract where i have now learned the arbitration clause is located.
at no point during my transaction with the dealership was i presented with a separate arbitration agreement to review and sign.
on both occasions when i was at the dealership and signed purchase contracts,i did not have,nor was i given,an opportunity to use a computer to download any information about arbitration organizations,including their procedures or rules,nor was i aware that i could or should have done this.
the motion to compel was heard on august and september.at the september hearing,the trial court stated it was denying the motion and would issue a written order within a week.on september,the trial court issued an order denying the motion.the court explained that the clra expressly provides for class actions and declares the right to a class action to be unwaivable.see.as a consequence,the class action waiver in the arbitration provision was unenforceable.further,in accordance with the poison pill clause,the unenforceability of the class action waiver made the entire arbitration provision unenforceable.the trial court therefore denied the motion.valencia appealed.
discussion 
whether an arbitration provision is unconscionable is ultimately a question of law.on appeal,when the extrinsic evidence is undisputed,as it is here,we review the contract de novo to determine unconscionability.suh superior court th,citations omitted accord,mercuro superior court th.because this appeal presents a question of law,we may resolve it in the first instance,without remand to the trial court.we are not bound by the trial court stated reasons,if any,supporting its ruling we review the ruling,not its rationale.walgreen city and county of san francisco th.
the parties disagree as to whether the class action waiver is unenforceable under the clra,thereby making the entire arbitration provision unenforceable under the poison pill clause.they also dispute whether the arbitration provision is procedurally and substantively unconscionable and whether the provision is permeated by unconscionability,rendering it unenforceable.
we do not address whether the class action waiver is unenforceable.rather,we conclude the arbitration provision as a whole is unconscionable the provision is procedurally unconscionable because it is adhesive and satisfies the elements of oppression and surprise it is substantively unconscionable because it contains harsh terms that are in favor of the car dealer to the detriment of the buyer.because the provision contains multiple invalid terms,it is permeated by unconscionability and unenforceable.severance of the offending language is not appropriate.it follows that the case should be heard in a court of law.
general principles of unconscionability 
as explained in armendariz,supra,cal th in,the legislature enacted civil code section,which codified the principle that a court can refuse to enforce an unconscionable provision in a contract as section,subdivision a states if the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract,or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause,or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.because unconscionability is a reason for refusing to enforce contracts generally,it is also a valid reason for refusing to enforce an arbitration agreement under code of civil procedure section,which provides that arbitration agreements are valid,enforceable and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.the united states supreme court,in interpreting the same language found in section of the faa,recognized that generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements 
u nconscionability has both a procedural and a substantive element,the former focusing on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power,the latter on overly harsh or results the prevailing view is that procedural and substantive unconscionability must both be present in order for a court to exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract or clause under the doctrine of unconscionability.but they need not be present in the same degree t he more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.armendariz,supra,cal th at,citations omitted accord,bruni didion th.
before applying armendariz to the present case,we note that concepcion,supra,does not preclude the application of the unconscionability doctrine to determine whether an arbitration provision is unenforceable.concepcion disapproved the discover bank rule,stating in discover bank,the california supreme court applied the doctrine of unconscionability to waivers in arbitration agreements and held as follows w hen the class action waiver is found in a consumer contract of adhesion in a setting in which disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages,and when it is alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money,then the waiver becomes in practice the exemption of the party from responsibility for its own fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another.under these circumstances,such waivers are unconscionable under california law and should not be enforced.concepcion,at,italics added.the court in concepcion ultimately concluded that r equiring the availability of classwide arbitration interferes with fundamental attributes of arbitration and thus creates a scheme inconsistent with the faa.id.at,italics added.
with the exception of the discover bank rule,the court acknowledged in concepcion that the doctrine of unconscionability remains a basis for invalidating arbitration provisions the final phrase of title,united states codes,section permits arbitration agreements to be declared unenforceable upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.this saving clause permits agreements to arbitrate to be invalidated by generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,but not by defenses that apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue.concepcion,supra.at,italics added accord,kanbar myers dist.lexis,pp,wl,pp,see in re checking account overdraft litigation dist.lexis,wl,concepcion did not completely do away with unconscionability as a defense to the enforcement of arbitration agreements under the faa.significantly,in rent a center,west,jackson,an employment case decided less than a year before concepcion,the question before the court was whether an arbitrator or a court should decide whether the doctrine of unconscionability where the arbitration agreement was allegedly too and overly favorable to the employer precluded arbitration.id.at.given the clear and unmistakable language authorizing the arbitrator to decide the enforceability of the arbitration agreement,the court held that the arbitrator should decide whether the agreement was unconscionable and therefore unenforceable.
thus,concepcion is inapplicable where,as here,we are not addressing the enforceability of a class action waiver or a judicially imposed procedure that is inconsistent with the arbitration provision and the purposes of the federal arbitration act faa.see concepcion,supra.at.concepcion concerns the preemption of unconscionability determinations for class action waivers in consumer cases,specifically with the rule enunciated in discover bank.brown ralphs grocery th,italics added.the unconscionability principles on which we rely govern all contracts,are not unique to arbitration agreements,and do not disfavor arbitration.see mission viejo emergency medical associates beta healthcare group th,fn.see also concepcion,at unconscionability is a doctrine normally thought to be generally applicable to all contracts but can not be invoked to disfavor arbitration or applied based on uniqueness of arbitration id.at faa preserves generally applicable contract defenses to arbitration.
our conclusion today does not undermine the purpose of the faa to ensure the enforcement of arbitration agreements according to their terms so as to facilitate streamlined proceedings concepcion,supra.at,italics added or,as otherwise phrased,the enforcement of private agreements and encouragement of efficient and speedy dispute resolution id.at,italics added.on the contrary,as we discuss below see pt,post,the arbitration provision itself sacrifices efficient and speedy resolution through the adoption of harsh,terms in an effort to ensure that the car dealer will be the prevailing party.
procedural unconscionability 
the procedural element of unconscionability focuses on two factors oppression and surprise oppression arises from an inequality of bargaining power which results in no real negotiation and an absence of meaningful choice.surprise involves the extent to which the supposedly terms of the bargain are hidden in a prolix printed form drafted by the party seeking to enforce the disputed terms.bruni didion,supra,th at.
in gutierrez autowest,th gutierrez,the plaintiff leased a vehicle pursuant to a contract virtually identical to the one here and signed it under similar circumstances.the court of appeal had no difficulty concluding the arbitration provision was procedurally unconscionable,saying the trial court implicit conclusion that the arbitration clause in the automobile lease is adhesive is supported by substantial evidence.the lease was presented to plaintiffs for signature on a take it or leave it basis.plaintiffs were given no opportunity to negotiate any of the preprinted terms in the lease.the arbitration clause was particularly inconspicuous,printed in typeface on the opposite side of the signature page of the lease.the plaintiff was never informed that the lease contained an arbitration clause,much less offered an opportunity to negotiate its inclusion within the lease or to agree upon its specific terms.he was not required to initial the arbitration clause he either had to accept the arbitration clause and the other preprinted terms,or reject the lease entirely.under these circumstances,the arbitration clause was procedurally unconscionable.id.at,citation omitted accord,fittante palm springs motors,th.
as a federal court explained in finding the arbitration provision in a sale contract to be procedurally unconscionable the buyer asserts the contract was presented to him on a basis,and he did not have an opportunity for meaningful negotiation.the lender disputes this assertion the buyer has submitted a declaration describing the circumstances under which he signed the contract.according to him,he was not provided an opportunity to read the contract prior to signing it instead,the finance person simply held the contract flat on the desk with one hand and with the other pointed to the various places on the front of the contract for the buyer to sign that were marked in yellow.the buyer was not allowed to read the back of the contract where the arbitration clause is located,or asked to sign anywhere on the back of the contract.the finance person did not turn the contract over at all during the signing.no one pointed out the arbitration clause or discussed it with the buyer at any time these circumstances are sufficient to support a finding of oppression.
oppression,however,is only one factor in the procedural unconscionability analysis.the other factor is surprise,and on this factor,the buyer asserts the arbitration clause was hidden in the lengthy form contract.the lender disputes this assertion,and points out that the arbitration clause is located within a box entitled arbitration clause,under which reads please review important affects your legal rights.however,the border and heading typeface do not change the location of the arbitration clause,which is found at the end of the contract.the lender does not dispute the buyer assertion that he did not know there was any arbitration clause until his attorney told him that the lender is trying to force arbitration.based on this evidence,the court finds that the buyer has demonstrated surprise.combined with the finding of oppression,the buyer has shown the arbitration clause is procedurally unconscionable.smith americredit financial services,dist.lexis,pp,wl,pp.
even the california attorney general has commented that the lengthy sale contract is problematic,describing it as an unwieldy size for a business document,and incompatible with standard office printing and reproduction machines.this incompatibility leads to significant trouble and expense for automobile dealers,as well as for those consumers who need to make or transmit copies of their sales contracts.the attorney general has advised that a sale contract need not be a single page but may consist of multiple pages fastened together and sequentially numbered.id.at.as the attorney general explained,the use of multiple pages,as opposed to a single page,will facilitat e the consumer review of all of the parties agreements before the consumer signs the sale or lease contract,so that the consumer has complete and accurate information.the rule also helps to avert later disputes about the terms of the parties final agreement.id.at.
for its part,valencia argues procedural unconscionability is lacking because sanchez could have gone elsewhere to buy a mercedes benz from a dealer who did not require arbitration.but absent unusual circumstances,use of a contract of adhesion establishes a minimal degree of procedural unconscionability notwithstanding the availability of market alternatives c ourts are not obligated to enforce highly unfair provisions that undermine important public policies simply because there is some degree of consumer choice in the market.gatton t mobile usa,th,fn.omitted see id.at discussing cases.the california court of appeal has rejected the notion that the availability in the marketplace of substitute employment,goods,or services alone can defeat a claim of procedural unconscionability.nagrampa.mailcoups,cir,en banc.and here,there is no evidence sanchez could have purchased a mercedes benz from a dealer who did not mandate arbitration.far from it,in arguing the arbitration provision involved no surprise,valencia relies on case authority for the proposition arbitration per se may be within the reasonable expectation of most consumers.patterson itt consumer financial th,accord,gutierrez,supra,th at.if that is true,a potential buyer would reasonably believe that all mercedes benz dealers insist on arbitration and that there are no market alternatives.but a buyer would not expect to be bound by a provision as harsh and as the one here.
valencia also contends that,on the front page of the sale contract,sanchez signed off on a provision stating you agree to the terms of this contract.you confirm that before you signed this contract,we gave it to you,and you were free to take it and review it.you acknowledge that you have read both sides of this contract,including the arbitration clause on the reverse side,before signing below.you confirm that you received a completely copy when you signed it.capitalization omitted.this provision is located inches from the top of the front page and flush to the right margin in a space measuring about inches wide and inches high.to the immediate left of the provision is boxed text discussing the lack of a period it is approximately inches wide and inches high.a signature line for the buyer appears flush to the left margin directly below the boxed text about cooling off that is the last signature line for the buyer in the contract.the only signature directly below the provision that mentions the arbitration clause is that of the car dealer manager the last signature on the front page and in the contract.
spacing aside,sanchez stated in his declaration he was not given an opportunity to read the contract.rather,the finance manager simply told him where to sign or initial and did not turn the contract over,which would have revealed a full page of additional provisions.sanchez did not know the contract contained an arbitration provision by way of either the reference on the front side or the full arbitration provision on the reverse side.as one court has explained in similar circumstances p laintiffs are claiming that they never knowingly agreed to the arbitration provision.as in most,if not all,adhesion contract cases,they deny ever reading it.the general rule that one who signs an instrument may not avoid the impact of its terms on the ground that he failed to read the instrument before signing it applies only in the absence of overreaching or imposition thus,it does not apply to an adhesion contract indeed,failure to read the contract helps establish actual surprise bruni didion,supra,th at,citations omitted.and even if sanchez had read the pertinent provision on the front and seen the words arbitration clause buried therein,he still would have been surprised almost two years later,when he first learned that the arbitration provision,located on the back,was overly harsh and in favor of the car dealer.
in short,the arbitration provision satisfies the two elements of procedural unconscionability oppression and surprise.its location at the bottom on the back of the sale contract made it unnoticeable to a buyer who was not given time to read the contract.
substantive unconscionability 
of course,simply because a provision within a contract of adhesion is not read or understood by the nondrafting party does not justify a refusal to enforce it.the term may only be denied enforcement if it is also substantively unreasonable substantive unconscionability focuses on whether the provision is overly harsh or and is shown if the disputed provision of the contract falls outside the reasonable expectations of the nondrafting party or is unduly oppressive.where a party with superior bargaining power has imposed contractual terms on another,courts must carefully assess claims that one or more of these provisions are and unreasonable.gutierrez,supra,th at,citations omitted.
we conclude that four clauses in the arbitration provision are unconscionable.first,a party who loses before the single arbitrator may appeal to a panel of three arbitrators if the award exceeds.second,an appeal is permitted if the award includes injunctive relief.third,the appealing party must pay,in advance,the filing fee and other arbitration costs subject to a final determination by the arbitrators of a fair apportionment of costs.fourth,the provision exempts repossession from arbitration while requiring that a request for injunctive relief be submitted to arbitration.although these provisions may appear neutral on their face,they have the effect of placing an unduly oppressive burden on the buyer.in assessing unconscionability,we focus on the practical effect of a provision,not a facial interpretation.saika gold th,saika.
award exceeding 
either party may appeal an initial decision exceeding.as courts have recognized,this type of provision,though seemingly neutral,has the effect of benefiting the party with superior bargaining power,here,the car dealer.
in little auto stiegler,cal th little,an employment case,the arbitration provision allowed either party to appeal an initial award to a second arbitrator if it exceeded.the supreme court found the provision unconscionable,stating the employer and its amici curiae claim that the arbitration appeal provision applied evenhandedly to both parties and that there is at least the possibility that an employer may be the plaintiff,for example in cases of misappropriation of trade secrets but if that is the case,they fail to explain adequately the reasons for the award threshold.from a plaintiff perspective,the decision to resort to arbitral appeal would be made not according to the amount of the arbitration award but the potential value of the arbitration claim compared to the costs of the appeal.if the plaintiff and his or her attorney estimate that the potential value of the claim is substantial,and the arbitrator rules that the plaintiff takes nothing because of its erroneous understanding of a point of law,then it is rational for the plaintiff to appeal.thus,the threshold inordinately benefits defendants.given the fact that the employer was the party imposing the arbitration agreement and the threshold,it is reasonable to conclude it imposed the threshold with the knowledge or belief that it would generally be the defendant.
although parties may justify an asymmetrical arbitration agreement when there is a legitimate commercial need,that need must be other than the employer desire to maximize its advantage in the arbitration process there is no such justification for the threshold.little auto stiegler,supra,cal th at,citations omitted accord,gibson nye frontier ford,alaska,fn.
little relied in part on saika,supra,th.in saika,a patient signed a patient physician arbitration agreement before undergoing a chemical skin peel of her face.the agreement provided that if an award exceeded,either party could request a trial de novo in superior court,and the arbitration award would be null and void.id.at.after the medical procedure,the patient filed a civil suit against the physician,alleging medical malpractice based on severe burns.the physician successfully moved to compel arbitration.the arbitrators awarded.the patient sought to strike the trial de novo clause and confirm the award the physician countered with a request for a trial de novo.the trial court ruled in favor of the physician.
the court of appeal reversed,stating a trial de novo clause within the arbitration agreement purportedly allows either party to disregard the results of the arbitration and litigate in the courts when the arbitration award exceeds,but the practical effect of the clause is to tilt the playing field in favor of the doctor.by making arbitration virtually illusory as far as one side is concerned,the clause contravenes the strong public policy favoring arbitration.saika,supra,th at.
the court realized that an arbitration award in favor of a patient in a malpractice case typically exceeds by such a substantial amount that only the physician would invoke the trial de novo clause.in contrast,a claim by a physician against a patient,most likely a billing matter,would rarely result in an award exceeding,especially if the patient had private health insurance or was covered by some type of governmental assistance program.as the court explained true,there is a theoretical class of cases where the trial de novo clause could arguably benefit a patient namely,situations where the initial arbitration award exceeds but is still so low that it represents an injustice for example,the case before us appears to involve facial disfigurement.the arbitrators handed down what appears,at least insofar as the record discloses,an appropriately large award.had they only given the patient,the trial de novo clause would have been of some benefit to her.
but a s a practical matter,the benefit which the trial de novo clause confers on patients is nothing more than a chimera.the odds that an award will both a clear the threshold but b still be so low that the patient would want to have a trial de novo are so small as to be negligible t he cases where the trial de novo clause could possibly benefit the patient are going to be rare indeed.
w hile the trial de novo clause in the present case purports to apply to both parties,it is the same heads i win,tails you lose proposition that the court condemned in prior case law.
p ublic confidence in arbitration in large part depends on the idea that arbitration provides a fair alternative to the courts.that confidence is manifestly undermined when provisions in arbitration clauses provide that when one side wins the game does count alternative dispute resolution must be a genuine alternative to litigation in the courts,not a sham process by which one party to an agreement can increase the total costs of making a claim against it.saika,supra,th at,citation omitted.
the same analysis applies here.the buyer will rarely benefit from the clause permitting an appeal of an award exceeding because the buyer,not the dealer,is more likely to recover an award of that size and be satisfied with it the car dealer would appeal it.under the sale contract,sanchez is obligated to make monthly payments totaling less than.in comparison,valencia obligations under the sale contract and california law are to sell a vehicle in working condition,to avoid making misleading or false representations,and to comply with various consumer laws,the violation of which could result in substantial damages,including punitive damages.if sanchez succeeds in obtaining rescission,he is almost half way to a award.and given the allegations concerning valencia violations of the consumer laws and the way in which valencia responded to the reported defects in the vehicle,an award in sanchez favor could easily exceed in short,there is no justification for the threshold,other than to relieve the car dealer of liability it deems excessive.
valencia emphasizes that an appeal of the initial award is permitted if either party brings a claim and recovers nothing.by providing an appeal where the arbitrator awards nothing,one party is not favored over the other.we can not say that one of the parties is more likely to lose regardless of which party is the claimant or the respondent in the arbitration.nevertheless,under the appeal clauses,if the buyer prevails but believes the award is too low,the arbitration is at an end unless the buyer recovers nothing if the buyer prevails and recovers a substantial sum,the car dealer can start anew before a panel if the award exceeds what the dealer considers too high.a truly bilateral clause would allow a buyer to appeal an award below.
appeal of award that includes injunctive relief 
the arbitration provision allows an appeal by either party if an award against it contains injunctive relief.this type of appeal unduly burdens the buyer because the buyer,not the car dealer,would be the party obtaining an injunction.
i mmediate injunctive relief is often essential to protect consumers against further illegal acts of the defendant.people pacific land research cal d.in litigation by consumers,the importance of providing an effective injunctive remedy becomes manifest.barquis merchants collection cal d.
preliminary injunctive relief is appropriate only if two interrelated factors are present the plaintiff is likely to prevail on the merits at trial and the interim harm the plaintiff is likely to sustain in the absence of an injunction is greater than the harm the defendant will probably suffer if an injunction is issued.vo city of garden grove th.a consideration of interim harm includes the inadequacy of other remedies,including damages,and the degree of irreparable injury the denial of the injunction would cause.id.at intel hamidi cal th,witkin,cal.procedure ed.provisional remedies.
preliminary injunctions are of particular importance in protecting the interests of consumers.see,regents of university of california abc cir,sanderson farms,tyson foods,d,polk infousa,d,staples,see also vo city of garden grove,supra,th at one factor weighing against issuance of preliminary injunction is any adverse effect it would have on public interest.
not surprisingly,it is the buyer,not the car dealer,who would be seeking preliminary or permanent injunctive relief,primarily to enforce consumer laws like the clra.if an interim award preliminary injunction or final award permanent injunction is issued against the car dealer,the arbitrator has favorably reviewed the merits of the buyer claims and determined that the interests of consumers will be irreparably injured without injunctive relief.
nevertheless,here,the arbitration provision appeal clauses allow the car dealer to delay the effect of an injunction by way of appellate review before a arbitration panel.by subjecting injunctive relief to an appeal process,only the car dealer is benefited,making the clause and undermining the purpose of the clra to protect consumer rights.
in addition,the arbitration provision is silent as to the procedure for taking an appeal.presumably,if the arbitrator issues a preliminary injunction in the form of an interim award,the car dealer may appeal at that time,putting the entire case,including the injunction,on hold pending a decision by the appellate panel.this delay is inconsistent with the enforcement of consumer rights laws and the expediency of the arbitration process.
thus,when it serves the car dealer interests if an award against it is less than the buyer can not appeal,and the car dealer touts the benefits of mandatory arbitration efficient,streamlined procedures,the informality of arbitral proceedings,reducing the cost and increasing the speed of dispute resolution.concepcion,supra.at.but when those factors do not benefit the car dealer if injunctive relief is issued against it then delay,complexity,and higher costs take precedence,and the buyer is subjected to another level of arbitral review by three arbitrators this time denying the weaker party of the benefits of arbitration.
advance payment of fees and costs on appeal 
as provided in the arbitration provision,if either party recovers nothing,it may request a new arbitration under the rules of the arbitration organization by a panel.the appealing party requesting new arbitration shall be responsible for the filing fee and other arbitration costs subject to a final determination by the arbitrators of a fair apportionment of costs.italics added.
yet the aaa rules do not mention arbitration costs where a consumer appeals an initial award to a panel.nor do they permit any kind of appeal,to a panel or otherwise.see aaa,consumer procedures as of,consumer related disputes supplementary procedures as of,see also aaa,commercial arbitration rules and mediation procedures eff.june,as of.and the appeal clauses in the sale contract require the appealing party to advance the fees and costs for both parties.
the clra confers unwaivable statutory rights on consumers and accords them some of the rights set forth in armendariz,supra,cal th at pages.see gutierrez,supra,th at fn.harvard westlake school th,discussing gutierrez.one of those rights limits the payment of arbitral expenses by the consumer.
under the clra,a consumer does not have to pay arbitration costs or arbitrator fees arbitral expenses that he or she can not afford or that are prohibitively high.see gutierrez,supra,th at,applying armendariz,supra,cal th at,and green tree financial.randolph.yet the appeal clauses mandate that the appealing party bear the arbitral expenses for both parties in advance,subject to reallocation between the parties at the end of the proceeding.but reapportionment at the conclusion of the arbitration is inadequate.gutierrez,at.that possibility provides little comfort to consumers who can not afford to initiate the appeal process in the first place.ibid.items covered by an advance payment on appeal include,as stated in the sale contract,the filing fee and other arbitration costs.arbitrator fees in los angeles average around per hour.see adr services,southern california mediation arbitration panel as of.hearing room rental costs and the arbitrator travel expenses may also be included.see harvard westlake school,supra,th at,fn.
because the arbitration provision leaves the buyer in the dark as to the amount to be paid in advance,creating the possibility that the buyer may have to advance unaffordable expenses,the provision discourages buyers from pursuing an appeal and enforcing their rights under the clra.although the aaa consumer rules ensure that a consumer does not have to advance an exorbitant sum at the beginning of the process,the rules,as noted,do not address or permit an appeal.see aaa,consumer arbitration costs as of,aaa,administrative fee waivers and pro bono arbitrators as of.the requirement that the appealing party pay the filing fee and arbitration costs of both parties in advance puts an unduly harsh burden on a consumer.
that is not to say a consumer must be allowed to pursue an appeal without paying anything up front.but the arbitration provision in this case provides no procedure or criteria for determining how much the consumer can afford.as the court explained in gutierrez unconscionability is determined as of the time the contract is made the flaw in this arbitration agreement is readily apparent.despite the potential for the imposition of a substantial advance of appellate costs,there is no effective procedure for a consumer to obtain a cost waiver or reduction.a comparison with the judicial system is striking t he judicial system provides parties with the opportunity to obtain a judicial waiver of some or all required court fees.
the government code prescribes a tripartite means test for litigants seeking such a waiver the first two tests automatically exempt a party who receives certain designated governmental benefits or who falls below a designated poverty limit under the third test,courts have discretion to exempt litigants unable to proceed without using money which is necessary for the use of the litigant or the litigant family to provide for the common necessaries of life.the judicial council,at the legislature direction,has provided a set of forms and rules that supplement the government code statute these rules detail the application form,the procedure for determining the application,and when a hearing is required denial of the application,in whole or in part,shall include a statement of reasons.
in contrast,the arbitration provision here does not indicate how this process is begun,or who makes the determination,or what criteria are utilized to decide if costs should be reduced or deferred
