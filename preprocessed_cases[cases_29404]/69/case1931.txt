a corporate subcontractor sued a general contractor to recover for work performed under a construction services agreement.at trial,the general contractor and its surety moved for nonsuit arguing the subcontractor was barred by the construction services licensing law,business and professions code section et the csll,from maintaining any action for recovery because the subcontractor was not properly licensed at all times during its performance of the contract.the trial court disagreed.it concluded the corporation president held a valid individual contractor license at all times and that,in any event,licensure was not required for tasks the corporation performed prior to obtaining its license.the court found there was substantial compliance with the licensing statute during the contract and work was performed in good faith,and denied the motions for nonsuit a jury found in favor of the subcontractor and awarded over in damages,statutory penalties and interest.
we conclude the trial court erred in denying nonsuit.with one exception,the csll forbids a contractor from law or at an otherwise valid claim for performance of any service for which a license is required if the contractor was unlicensed at any time during performance of the work.in this case,the subcontractor was unlicensed during a period in which it performed services that could only be performed by a licensed contractor.we further hold the subcontractor is unable to meet the threshold requirement to invoke the statutory exception of substantial compliance with the csll,because it was never licensed as a state contractor prior to beginning performance.accordingly,we will reverse and remand the matter for entry of judgment in favor of the general contractor and its surety.

discussion 
great west insists the trial court erred in denying nonsuit because there can be no question wss,the corporate entity,was not licensed,as required by section of the csll,at all times during its performance of the construction services agreement it seeks to enforce.and,because wss was not duly licensed and can not satisfy the strict requirements of the statutory substantial compliance exception,great west contends wss is barred from maintaining this action,regardless of its merits,and from any recovery at law or in equity.we conclude great west is correct.we summarize first the controlling legal principles,then apply them to the facts of this case.
the licensure requirements embody a legislative scheme aimed at protecting the public against unscrupulous and incompetent contractors.
since its adoption in,the csll has declared that,except as expressly otherwise provided,a contractor may not sue to collect compensation for performance of any act or contract requiring a license without alleging that he or she was duly licensed at all times during the performance of that act or contract.mw erectors,niederhauser ornamental metal works,cal th,d,mw erectors,citing,subd.a,and stats,ch.t he bar extends to actions in law or equity and applies regardless of the merits of the cause of action.citation.ibid.
the csll embodies a comprehensive legislative scheme governing the construction business in california.it reflects a strong public policy which favors protecting the public from unscrupulous and incompetent contractors.according to our supreme court,the purpose of the licensing law is to protect the public from incompetence and dishonesty in those who provide building and construction services.citation.the licensing requirements provide minimal assurance that all persons offering such services in california have the requisite skill and character,understand applicable local laws and codes,and know the rudiments of administering a contracting business.citation.hydrotech systems,oasis waterpark cal d,hydrotech see also construction financial perlite plastering th,d construction financial.section,subdivision a,applies r egardless of the equities.hydrotech,supra,at.for the past years,it has been held that courts may not resort to equitable considerations in defiance of section.lewis queen ball sons cal d,lewis queen.that is because the statute represents a legislative determination that the importance of deterring unlicensed persons from engaging in the contracting business outweighs any harshness between the parties citations omitted.mw erectors,supra,cal th at,d.
section,subdivision a requires all persons engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor to be licensed.a contractor is defined as any person who undertakes to or offers to undertake to,or purports to have the capacity to undertake to,or submits a bid to,or does himself or herself or by or through others,construct,alter,repair,add to,subtract from,or improve any building or other structure,project,development or improvement,or to do any part thereof,whether or not the performance of work involves the addition to,or fabrication into,any project of any material or article of merchandise.contractor includes subcontractor or specialty contractor.persons engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor is broadly defined to include an individual,a firm,copartnership,corporation,association or other organization,or any combination of any thereof.a corporation applying for a contractor license must qualify through either a responsible managing officer rmo or responsible managing employee rme,who is him or herself,eligible for the same license qualification,subd.b.the qualifier rmo or rme must be a bona fide officer or employee of the corporation and actively engaged in work encompassed by the license,subd.d.
section,subdivision a is the primary enforcement mechanism for the csll.it provides except as provided in subdivision e,no person engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor,may bring or maintain an action,or recover in law or equity in any action,in any court of this state for the collection of compensation for the performance of any act or contract where a license is required by this chapter without alleging that he or she was a duly licensed contractor at all times during the performance of that act or contract,regardless of the merits of the cause of action brought by the person if licensure is controverted,the plaintiff must prove,by producing a verified certificate of licensure from the contractors state license board the board,that it held all necessary licenses during performance of the work,subd.d.
section,subdivision e,provides the sole exception to the contractor licensure requirements.it permits a court to find there has been substantial compliance with the licensure requirements if it is shown at an evidentiary hearing that the person who engaged in the business or acted in the capacity of a contractor had been duly licensed as a contractor in this state prior to the performance of the act or contract,acted reasonably and in good faith to maintain proper licensure,and did not know or reasonably should not have known that he or she was not duly licensed.the statute was amended in those changes,not relevant here,were nonsubstantive and declarative of existing law.see stats,ch.
the trend in changes to section over many years has been to severely limit the doctrine of substantial compliance it only applies if all three requirements of subdivision e are met.construction financial,supra,th at,d reviewing legislative history of section see also pacific custom pools,turner construction th,d trend of legislative changes has been to narrow available exceptions to section bar on actions by unlicensed contractors.the statutory policy embodied in the csll is intended to discourage persons who have failed to comply with the licensing law from offering or providing their unlicensed services for pay.hydrotech,supra,cal d at.because of the strength and clarity of this policy,the supreme court has observed section applies despite injustice to the unlicensed contractor.section represents a legislative determination that the importance of deterring unlicensed persons from engaging in the contracting business outweighs any harshness between the parties,and that such deterrence can best be realized by denying violators the right to maintain any action for compensation in the courts of this state.citation.citations.ibid.thus,the issue is not whether wss performed services under the contract for which it should be paid.rather,the dispositive issues are whether wss was required to be licensed during its performance of the subcontract or,if so,whether it may invoke the doctrine of substantial compliance.
application of legal principles to this bars wss recovery because the corporation was not properly licensed during performance of the contract.
wss performed work before it was licensed.
in this action,wss the corporation,entered into a subcontract with great west.wss was thus the person engaging in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor.accordingly,once licensure was controverted,it was wss obligation to prove the corporation was properly licensed at all times during performance of the act or contract at issue,subd.d.it failed to do so.
wss was incorporated in april.the corporation applied for a contractor license on august,and submitted its bid proposal to great west on august,on december,wss executed the subcontract,which incorporated its bid proposal.wss agreed to obtain necessary licenses prior to starting work,and to comply with all laws,rules,ordinances,and regulations of all governing bodies having jurisdiction over the work.wss did not obtain its contractor license until december.wss license expressly states it did not exist before that date.wss inserted its contractor license number and returned the subcontract to great west in early january.great west signed the document on january.
meanwhile,on october,wss notified the state the owner of the project it intended to begin work on the project within days.that notice was required so the corporation could be paid for its work.on october,wss sent great west an invoice for for initial preparation of shop drawings.ramirez testified the invoice was for work to be completed by the corporation by october.wss submitted a second invoice for on december,for work completed to date,which included for shop drawings and for specialized anchor bolts wss ordered and had delivered to the project.ramirez testified that ordering as anchor included in wss subcontract.he also testified he knew licensure was required for preparation of shop drawings,and that he knew wss did not have its contractor license when it submitted its first two invoices.wss sent great west a third invoice on december.that invoice sought payment for about worth of materials,including percent each of the and tube steel,percent of the and percent of the rolling tube steel.each of these items was included in wss bid proposal.the december invoice included work wss expected to complete and have inspected by december,
wss was not duly licensed at all relevant times.wss was unlicensed when it submitted its first two invoices for work performed to date,and remained so until december.because wss was unlicensed during some period in which it performed work under the contract,it is barred from maintaining this action if any of the work it did required licensure,or unless it can bring itself within the statutory exception for substantial compliance,an issue to which we shall return.
first,we address wss contentions that licensure was not required for any of the work it did before december.wss is mistaken.
i wss may not segregate acts performed in furtherance of the contract.
first,wss insists it is entitled to recovery because the discrete tasks of ordering anchor bolts and preparing shop drawings do not constitute performance and can be segregated from the subcontract.
a strikingly similar attempt by an unlicensed contractor to segregate certain tasks from an integrated contract to avoid the bar of section was rejected in banis restaurant design,serrano th,d banis.in banis,an unlicensed entity sought to recover for design services for a restaurant and market construction project that included preparing electrical and plumbing drawings and specifications,coordination with architects and engineers,and procurement of equipment and materials.id.at,d.in an attempt to avoid section,the plaintiff argued it had not acted as a contractor in providing design services or,alternatively,that the contract could be segregated into discrete tasks.banis,supra,th at,d.the court rejected plaintiff attempt to parse the contract and concluded the services and materials plaintiff provided were fixtures intended to be and actually physically incorporated into the project.id.at,d.in language equally applicable here,the court stated the design plans reflected coordination of the architect and engineers.through its own efforts and those of others,plaintiff thereby undertook to construct,alter,add to,subtract from,improve defendant project.see.in short plaintiff was a contractor,and section bars plaintiff suit for compensation.banis,supra,th at,d.the court rejected plaintiff attempt to parse the contract into discrete tasks,only some of which required licensure.the contract was not severable because each aspect of plaintiff work was integral to the restaurant project,and was not minor or incidental,but part of an integral whole.id.at,d.the same reasoning applies here.as ramirez himself acknowledged at trial,the shop drawings he prepared while wss remained unlicensed were tasks for which the corporation bid and which were performed in furtherance of the scope of the work included in the subcontract.those tasks can not be severed from the parties integrated agreement to avoid section bar to recovery.
we also find no merit in wss assertion that the ordering of bolts and preparation of shop drawings for which it had bid could not have been tasks done in performance of the subcontract because the subcontract did not exist until it was executed by great west in january,by which time wss was licensed.section app
