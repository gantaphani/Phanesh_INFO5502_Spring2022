introduction 
anna rahm and her parents,lynnette and james rahm,filed a complaint against kaiser foundation health plan and two kaiser health care providers.the complaint alleged that the defendants had devised an insurance compensation scheme that induced kaiser physicians to deny costly medical services to plan members.plaintiffs asserted that,as a result of the scheme,kaiser health care providers had improperly delayed an mri for anna,resulting in significant injuries.the complaint included four causes of action against each defendant and sought punitive damages for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
defendants filed a motion to strike the punitive damages allegations arguing that plaintiffs had failed to comply with the requirements of code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.the trial court ruled that statute did not apply to plaintiffs punitive damages claims and denied the motion.
defendants filed a petition for writ of mandate seeking an order directing the superior court to grant the motion to strike.we summarily denied the petition and defendants filed a petition for review in the california supreme court.while defendants petition for review was pending,plaintiffs dismissed their punitive damages claims against the kaiser health care providers.the supreme court granted review and directed this court to issue an order to show cause this court issued that order on august.
we now conclude that plaintiffs were not required to comply with section because the statute does not apply to plaintiffs claims against kaiser foundation health plan,and plaintiffs have dismissed their punitive damages claims against the health care provider defendants.
factual and procedural background 
summary of facts preceding plaintiffs lawsuit 
anna rahm is a member of the kaiser permanente traditional plan the plan,which provides its members medically necessary health care in exchange for monthly premiums.in august of,anna began experiencing back pain.anna parents,lynnette and james rahm,took anna to a chiropractor.after the treatments failed to alleviate anna pain,the chiropractor recommended that anna consult with a medical doctor because she was in need of an mri.
in march of,anna met with charlene huang,a primary care physician at kaiser.lynnette accompanied anna to the appointment and requested that her daughter receive an mri.although huang acknowledged that anna chiropractor had determined that her back pain was severe,huang refused to order an mri.huang referred anna to the physical medicine department at kaiser and also prescribed pain medications and steroids,a much less expensive treatment than an mri anna took the prescribed medications but her pain persisted.
two weeks later,on march,anna met with ngan vuong,a physical medicine doctor at kaiser.lynnette accompanied anna to the appointment and again requested that anna receive an mri.vuong,however,recommended that anna receive an epidural and suggested that her pain could be remedied through changes to her nutrition and exercise habits.lynnette told vuong she did not want her daughter to receive an epidural and renewed her request for an mri.voung refused to authorize an mri.
in april of,anna sought acupuncture treatment for her pain.the treatments were unsuccessful and the acupuncturist recommended that anna request an mri from her doctor.lynnette called vuong and informed her that anna acupuncturist had recommended an mri.vuong again declined an mri and referred anna to kaiser physical therapy department.
in may and june of,anna continued her acupuncture treatments.two different acupuncturists concluded that anna was in need of an mri.anna also attended several physical therapy sessions at kaiser,but was forced to discontinue the treatments because they were too painful.kaiser physical therapy department recommended that anna receive an mri.
lynette called vuong again and explained that a chiropractor,two acupuncturists and kaiser physical therapy department had all recommended an mri.vuong rejected these recommendations because they were not made by medical doctors,but invited the rahms to seek a second opinion.
lynnette elected to schedule a meeting with another doctor.prior to the appointment,lynnette contacted huang,anna primary care physician,as a last ditch effort to get an mri.lynnette summarized the treatments anna had undergone since her initial visit with huang.huang finally agreed to authorize an mri,which was performed on july.
anna mri indicated that she had an aggressive mass in her pelvis.a biopsy revealed that anna was suffering from a high grade osteosarcoma,which is one of the fastest growing types of osteosarcoma,meaning that kaiser three month delay in ordering anna mri allowed the cancer to spread and ultimately substantially contributed to anna poor prognosis.anna underwent chemotherapy and had numerous surgeries that resulted in the loss of her right leg and portions of her pelvis and spine.
plaintiffs complaint 
on july,anna and her parents filed a complaint against kaiser foundation health plan kaiser health plan or health plan,which administered anna health care plan.the complaint also named kaiser foundation hospitals kaiser hospitals and southern california permanente medical group scpmg,which contract with kaiser health plan to provide hospital and medical services to the plan insureds.the complaint asserted four causes of action against each defendant breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing breach of contract negligent infliction of emotional distress and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
plaintiffs alleged that the defendants,who were collectively referred to as kaiser,had devised a system of withholding benefits from insureds which necessarily results in kaiser unreasonably depriving its insureds the benefits of their contacts with kaiser.this system is one where kaiser has bestowed upon its contracted physicians the responsibility of determining whether or not to give insureds benefits under their contracts.underlying this system is a cost saving component each determination a kaiser physician makes must be based,in part,upon the cost to kaiser of the treatment or care requested.t his system,with a heavy emphasis on cost saving to kaiser,results in pressures on kaiser physicians that removes sic the physicians abilities to give medical care which is in the patient best interests.this system also results in little or no investigation by kaiser as to whether a patient is in need of certain medical care treatment.this system is concealed from kaiser insureds and ultimately causes them harm.
the complaint further alleged that kaiser physicians are rewarded for adhering to the cost saving system that kaiser has put into place.specifically,that the physicians receive bonuses which are dependent upon the cost savings realized by kaiser due to the physicians withholding of treatment and or care of the insureds.
in describing their individual causes of action,plaintiffs alleged that defendants had breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by unreasonably denying and delaying care and treatment to anna that was covered under the plan unreasonably avoiding incurring expenses for diagnostic testing for its own financial gain by ignoring the seriousness of anna medical condition and needs placing its own financial interests ahead of anna health care and unreasonably engaging in a pattern and practice of failing to conduct a thorough,fair and balanced investigation in evaluating requests for benefits services for its members under the plan.
plaintiffs claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress alleged that the defendants refus ed to grant anna requests for diagnostic testing,even though defendants knew,or should have known,that the medically necessary diagnostic testing was covered under the plan.defendants knew,or should have known,that their refusal to approve diagnostic testing for anna caused anna,lynnette and james to be fearful and extremely worried about anna condition.the complaint further asserted that defendants intentionally and unfairly refused to provide anna with the requested,medically necessary care,thereby causing lynnette,james and anna to suffer fear,depression,humiliation,and severe mental anguish and emotional and physical distress.
plaintiffs claims for breach of the implied covenant and intentional infliction of emotional distress each included an allegation asserting that the defendants misconduct constitute d malice,oppression or fraud under california civil code section,thereby entitling plaintiffs to punitive damages in an amount appropriate to punish or set an example of defendants.
defendants motion to strike 
on january,defendants filed a motion to strike the punitive damages allegations.defendants argued that plaintiffs had failed to comply with code of civil procedure section.subdivision,a which states in any action for damages arising out of the professional negligence of a health care provider,no claim for punitive damages shall be included in a complaint or other pleading unless the court enters an order allowing an amended pleading that includes a claim for punitive damages to be filed.the section further provides that the trial court may allow an amended pleading claiming punitive damages only if the plaintiff submits evidence establishing that there is a substantial probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim pursuant to section of the civil code.
defendants argued that plaintiffs were required to comply with section because they were seeking punitive damages for an injury that is directly related to the professional services provided by a health care provider acting in its capacity as such plaintiffs,however,argued that their claims did not arise out of defendants professional medical services,but rather from defendants insurance decisions and practices.plaintiffs contended that,in essence,their tort claims alleged that defendants had improperly withheld insurance policy benefits by denying necessary medical treatments and creat ing a system whereby their financial interests were put ahead of anna life.
on april,the trial court heard oral argument on the motion to strike and ruled that section was inapplicable to plaintiffs claims,explaining this is an insurance bad faith case against an insurance company it a different animal from medical malpractice.in a subsequent minute order,the trial court stated that section did not apply because plaintiffs suit was not merely an action for professional negligence.
petition for writ of mandate 
on june,defendants filed a petition for writ of mandate seeking an order from this court directing the superior court to vacate its order denying p etitioners motion to strike plaintiffs punitive damages claims and to enter a new order granting the m otion to strike the punitive damages claims.on june,we summarily denied defendants petition.defendants then filed a petition for review in the california supreme court.
while defendants petition for review was pending in the supreme court,plaintiffs dismissed their punitive damages claims against kaiser hospitals and scpmg without prejudice.in their opposition to defendants petition for review,plaintiffs argued that,in light of the dismissals,the court need not reach the merits of the denial of the motion to strike with respect to kaiser hospitals and scpmg.plaintiffs further argued that section did not apply to their claims against kaiser health plan because it was not a health care provider.
on august,the supreme court granted defendants petition for review and entered an order directing this court to vacate our order denying mandate and to issue an order directing respondent superior court to show cause why the relief sought in the petition should not be granted.in compliance with that order,we vacated our order dated june,and issued an order to show cause.
discussion 
standard of review 
the standard of review for an order on a motion to strike punitive damages allegations is de novo.citation.in passing on the correctness of a ruling on a motion to strike,judges read allegations of a pleading subject to a motion to strike as a whole,all parts in their context,and assume their truth.citation.turman,supra,th at.
summary of cases interpreting the scope of section 
section a establishes a procedure for claiming punitive damages in certain cases.it provides,in any action for damages arising out of the professional negligence of a health care provider,no claim for punitive damages shall be included in a complaint or other pleading unless the court enters an order allowing an amended pleading that includes a claim for punitive damages to be filed.the court may allow the filing of an amended pleading claiming punitive damages on a motion by the party seeking the amended pleading and on the basis of the supporting and opposing affidavits presented that the plaintiff has established that there is a substantial probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim pursuant to section of the civil code central pathology service medical clinic,superior court cal th,central pathology italics omitted.
in central pathology,supra,cal th,the california supreme court considered the scope of claims subject to section.the plaintiffs,constance and michael hull,filed a complaint against a pathology clinic and a physician for negligence and loss of consortium.two months before trial,plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint to add causes of action for fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress.the new causes of action alleged that the physician performed a pap smear on constance,which was sent to the pathology clinic for analysis.it was further alleged that despite the presence of abnormal cells,defendants failed to notify constance that she was developing cancer and that the physician denied using the pathology clinic in an effort to cover up her medical negligence.the cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress alleged that defendants acted in an outrageous manner with the intent to cause severe emotional distress.plaintiffs sought punitive damages under the new causes of action.id.at.
the pathology clinic filed a motion arguing that the trial court was required to strike plaintiffs punitive damages allegations because they had failed to comply with section.plaintiffs,however,contended that section was limited to claims arising out of professional negligence and therefore did not apply to their intentional tort claims.the trial court agreed with plaintiffs and denied the motion.the appellate court denied the defendants petition for writ of mandate.the california supreme court granted review.
the supreme court began its analysis by considering the language of section.concluding that it was unclear whether the phrase action for damages arising out of the professional negligence of a health care provider was intended to encompass claims for intentional torts allegedly committed by health care providers central pathology,supra,cal th at,the court reviewed the legislative history for further guidance.
in summarizing the legislative history,the court noted that a comment from the assembly subcommittee on the administration of justice indicated that section was intended to provide protection to health practitioners in their capacity as practitioners.central pathology,supra,cal th at.the comment emphasized that lawsuits unrelated to a practitioner conduct in providing health care related services were intended to be excluded from the ambit of section.id.at.the court concluded that these comments demonstrated that the statute was not meant to apply solely to medical malpractice claims asserted against health care providers.rather,according to the court,the legislature intended section to apply whenever an injured party seeks punitive damages for an injury that is directly related to the professional services provided by a health care provider acting in its capacity as such central pathology,supra,cal th at.the court clarified that,in making this determination,t he allegations that identify the nature and cause of a plaintiff injury must be examined to determine whether each is directly related to the manner in which professional services were provided.id.at.
the court then applied its interpretation of section to plaintiffs tort claims and found that the statute applied plaintiffs cause of action for fraud in this case is directly related to the manner in which defendants provided professional services.the claim emanates from the manner in which defendants performed and communicated the results of medical tests,a matter that is an ordinary and usual part of medical professional services.it is therefore governed by section a.plaintiffs cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress is predicated on the same alleged acts as the fraud claim.therefore,it too is directly related to defendants performance of professional services and is governed by section a.id.at.
the holding in central pathology has been applied to numerous other types of tort claims brought against medical care providers.for example,in davis superior court th davis,the plaintiff sued his employer workers compensation carrier and a physician who treated injuries the plaintiff sustained during the course of his employment.plaintiff alleged that the carrier and the doctors it contracted with entered into a conspiracy whereby the doctors agreed to provide medical advice and treatment to patients below the standard of care.in exchange,the carrier agreed to continue sending patients to the doctors.plaintiff further alleged that his treating physician had participated in this scheme by providing substandard care at the direction of the carrier.plaintiff asserted that the physician acts were designed to curtail expensive treatment needed by p laintiff,thereby ensur ing that the physician would continue to get business from the carrier.id.at.the complaint included claims for fraud and conspiracy,and sought punitive damages against each defendant on both claims.
the physician filed a motion arguing that the trial court should strike the punitive damages allegations asserted against him because the plaintiff had failed to comply with section,subdivision a.in opposition,plaintiff argued that his claims were not subject to the statute because he sought damages based on criminal conduct conduct which can not be considered to have arisen out of professional negligence.davis,supra,th at.the trial court agreed with the plaintiff and denied the motion.
the appellate court reversed,holding that the circumstances of the case were indistinguishable from central pathology.the court explained that the physician defendant is accused of misrepresenting that he would properly treat the plaintiff,and that he was qualified to perform certain medical procedures.it is also alleged he lied about plaintiff medical condition and falsified his findings.even if,as plaintiff alleges,the carrier directed the physician to conduct himself in this manner,the fact remains that plaintiff is seeking damages for an injury that is directly related to the professional services rendered by the physician acting in his capacity as a health care provider.the conduct of which the physician is accused,if true,is unethical,illegal and immoral.it is,however,no more outrageous than the conduct of the central pathology defendant physician.plaintiff was,therefore,required to comply with the requirements of section a.davis,supra,th at.
similarly,in palmer superior court th palmer,the court concluded that section applied to claims arising from a health care provider recommendation that certain health care services were not medically necessary.the plaintiff,william palmer,filed a complaint against his medical insurer,pacificare,and his primary health care provider,sharp rees stealy medical group srs.srs performed various medical services for pacificare insureds,which included making decisions as to whether requested medical services equipment and supplies for pacificare members we re medically necessary.id.at.
palmer,who had lost his right leg to a bacterial infection,alleged that his prosthetist recommended that srs provide palmer with a new type of prosthetic leg that was engineered from components.srs informed palmer that its utilization review department had determined that the prosthetic leg was not medically necessary and referred him to the pacificare appeals process.palmer alleged that an srs employee later informed him that the costs of the prosthetic leg greatly exceeded the fixed amount that srs received from pacificare to provide palmer with care.palmer pursued authorization for the prosthetic through pacificare appeals process,but pacificare continued to deny the request.
palmer complaint alleged that pacificare had breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the subscriber agreement through its denial of the requested medical services and equipment.palmer,supra,th at.the complaint also alleged intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress against srs due to the manner in which plaintiff request for the medical services and equipment was processed.palmer claim ed that srs intentionally and willfully found that the prostheses were not medically necessary when they were,in fact,medically necessary ibid.srs moved to strike the punitive damages allegations appearing in the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim,arguing that the plaintiff had failed to comply with section.the trial court granted the motion.
on appeal,palmer argued that section was inapplicable to his claim against srs claim because the services srs was performing on behalf of pacificare,conducting utilization review services by evaluating palmer request for medical services to determine their medical necessity,did not qualify as health care services.id.at.rather,according palmer,his injuries relate d to actions taken by srs and pacificare in administering the hmo subscriber agreement,and those actions operated to prevent him from receiving the requested health care services.id.at.
the appellate court rejected the argument,explaining the allegedly injurious utilization review conducted by srs amounted to a medical clinical judgment such as would arguably arise out of professional negligence.we disagree with palmer that this was a purely administrative or economic role played by srs.rather,the utilization review s are conducted by medical professionals who carry out these functions by exercising medical judgment and applying clinical standards.citations.recall,palmer chief complaint is with the substance and conduct of the pacificare appeals process,and he is pursuing that claim through his cause of action against pacificare for the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the subscriber agreement.that is the proper forum for those claims.however,to the extent palmer seeks to plead intentional infliction of emotional distress against srs for its part in those decisions,he was required to comply with the pleadings procedure of section palmer,supra,th at.
section does not apply to any claims remaining in this suit 
as originally filed,plaintiffs complaint included punitive damages allegations against two different types of entities.first,the complaint sought punitive damages from kaiser foundation health plan,which is a licensed health care service plan under california knox keene health care service plan act of health,et the knox keene act defines a health care service plan as a ny person who undertakes to arrange for the provision of health care services to subscribers or enrollees,or to pay for or to reimburse any part of the cost for those services,in return for a prepaid or periodic charge paid by or on behalf of the subscribers or enrollees.health,subd.f.in its role as a health care service plan,kaiser health plan does not directly provide medical care to its subscribers.instead,the health plan contracts with other kaiser entities to deliver medical care to subscribers who enroll in its plans.
the complaint also sought punitive damages from kaiser hospitals and scpmg,which are health care providers that contract with kaiser health plan to provide medical services to plan members.the phrase health care providers generally applies to licensed medical practitioners and medical groups comprised of such practitioners who provide direct medical services to patients.palmer,supra,th at.
defendants contend that section applies to claims against both health care services plans and health care providers and,as a result,the trial court should have struck all of the punitive damages allegations in plaintiffs complaint.we independently consider whether section applies to claims against health care service plans,and health care providers.
section does not apply to claims against health care service plans 
plaintiffs argue that section does not apply to their claims against kaiser health plan because the statute is limited to claims against health care providers.defendants,however,argue that section applies to any claim against a health care service plan that seeks compensation for injuries that are directly related to the quality and nature of medical services rendered by a medical care provider.defendants further contend that plaintiffs claims against kaiser health plan are predicated on injuries caused by kaiser health care providers refusal to administer proper care,thereby triggering section requirements.
a superficial reading of section suggests that it could be reasonably interpreted in the manner proposed by defendants.the text of the statute does not state that it is limited to claims against medical care providers.rather,the statute says it applies to any action for damages arising out of the professional negligence of a health care provider based on this language,section could be interpreted to apply to claims against any type of defendant including health care service plans if those claims arise out of the professional negligence of a medical care provider.
the california supreme court has repeatedly stated,however,that the intended scope of section can not be determined based solely on the language of the statute.college hospital superior court cal th,college hospital the language of section a is uncertain.for example,in central pathology,the court ruled that the words of the statute did not clarif y whether intentional tort causes of action can arise out of professional negligence.central pathology,supra,cal th at.similarly,in covenant care superior court cal th covenant care,the court concluded that the language of section was inconclusive as to whether an elder abuse claim is one arising out of the professional negligence of a health care provider id.at.in both cases,the court consulted the legislative history to aid in determining whether the precise type of claim at issue was subject to the statute.
consistent with those decisions,we conclude that the text of the statute is unclear as to whether section is intended to apply only to claims against health care providers,or whether it was intended to apply to claims against any type of defendant including claims against health care service plans that seek punitive damages for injuries that are directly related to professional services rendered by a health care provider.we therefore turn to the legislative history for guidance.
as originally drafted,section left no ambiguity as to whether it was intended to extend to claims asserted against defendants other than medical care providers.the original version of the statute provided,no claim for punitive damages against a health care provider shall be included in a complaint or other pleading unless the court enters an order allowing an amended pleading that includes a claim for punitive damages to be filed.citation.central pathology,supra,cal th at at emphasis added.however,the statute was later amended by incorporating former section into new subdivision a of that section and by altering the first sentence to read,in any action for damages arising out of the professional negligence of a health care provider,no claim for punitive damages shall be included citation.id.at.according to the legislature,this amendment was intended to be declaratory of existing law.citation.id.at.
the purpose of the legislature amendment was to address concerns that the original version of section was overbroad.central pathology,supra,cal th at at.an assembly subcommittee comment regarding the amendment explained that as originally written,section sic could apply to any lawsuit against any health care provider arguably,this could include lawsuits unrelated to the practitioner practice,such as defamation,fraud,and intentional torts.the author of the original version of section asserts that the intention was to provide protection to health practitioners in their capacity as practitioners.specifically,relief was sought from unsubstantiated claims of punitive damages in actions alleging professional negligence.there was no intent to protect practitioners in any other capacity.the amendment limits the application of section a to lawsuits involving allegations of a health practitioner professional negligence.citation.ibid.emphasis omitted.
this legislative history clearly implies that,as originally drafted and as amended,section was only intended to apply to medical care providers.the original version of section specifically limited the statute to claims against medical care providers.although this language was subsequently amended in a manner suggesting that the section might apply to a broader category of defendants,the legislature comments regarding that amendment demonstrate that was not its intent.
first,the legislative comments noted that the amendment was declaratory of existing law,thereby indicating that the amendment was not meant to broaden the scope of the statute beyond claims against medical care providers.lone star security video,bureau of security and investigatory services th,declaration by the legislature that a statutory amendment is declaratory of existing law is a factor entitled to due consideration.second,the legislative history demonstrates that the purpose of the amendment was to preserve the original intent of the statute,which was to provide protection to health practitioners in their capacity as practitioners.central pathology,supra,cal th at at italics omitted.more specifically,the amendment was intended to clarify that the statute did not apply to claims unrelated to the practitioner practice,such as defamation.ibid.italics omitted.nothing in the history of the amendment suggests that the legislature meant to broaden section applicability to claims against any type of defendant that arose from the professional negligence of a health care provider.rather,the clear intent was to protect health care providers in their professional capacity as such.
our conclusion that the legislature intended section to apply to claims against medical care providers,as opposed to other classes of defendants,finds substantial support in the case law.for example,in central pathology,the supreme court concluded that that the legislative history of section demonstrated that the statute was passed because the legislature was concerned that unsubstantiated claims for punitive damages were being included in complaints against health care providers.central pathology,supra,cal th at at emphasis added.the court emphasized that the essential purpose of the amendment to section was to restrict the application of section to lawsuits brought against health practitioners in their capacity as practitioners.id.at emphasis added see also id.at the clear intent of the legislature is that any claim for punitive damages in an action against a health care provider be subject to the statute if the injury that is the basis for the claim was caused by conduct that was directly related to the rendition of professional services emphasis added.
in subsequent decisions,the supreme court has reiterated that the central purpose of the statute is to protect medical care providers.for example,in college hospital,supra,cal th,the court stated although the language of section a is uncertain,its prophylactic purpose is clear to protect health care providers from the onerous burden of defending against meritless punitive damage claims.id.at.college hospital also emphasized that the primary purpose of section a was to establish a pretrial mechanism that bars unsubstantiated puni
