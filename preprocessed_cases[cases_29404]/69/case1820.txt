introduction 
defendant plant insulation company appeals from the judgment against it in this asbestos case,claiming the trial court erred in excluding the united states navy from the list of entities as to which the jury could apportion fault pursuant to proposition.we agree,and reverse and remand for a retrial on apportionment.
ii.factual and procedural background 
we set forth only those facts pertinent to the appeal.plaintiffs and respondents cloristeen collins and patricia collins plaintiffs are,respectively,the wife and daughter of ulysses collins collins.collins died on may,of mesothelioma contracted as a result of workplace exposure to asbestos.collins worked as a welder at the hunters point naval shipyard from to,and as a boilermaker welder at the standard oil refinery in richmond from through.his last job was at the mare island naval shipyard,where he worked as a structural welder and pipe welder from through.throughout his career,collins worked extensively with asbestos and products,including those manufactured by defendant plant insulation company plant.
at the close of evidence,plaintiffs moved for a directed verdict regarding the navy,arguing fault could not be allocated to the service pursuant to proposition,et citing munoz city of union city th d munoz,they claimed federal sovereign immunity precluded the navy from being a tortfeasor for purposes of proposition.they further asserted there was no evidence of an exception to that immunity and thus no evidence the navy breached any duty of care owed to collins.plant opposed the motion,arguing allocation was proper under taylor john crane,th d taylor,and there was sufficient evidence to include the navy among the entities to which the jury could allocate fault.the trial court ruled munoz was controlling,and granted the plaintiffs motion.
the special verdict form listed entities,including plant,among which the jury could allocate responsibility for collins injuries.during deliberations,the jury sent a note to the court asking why the navy was omitted from the list of responsibility allocation.the court responded a s a matter of law you may not apportion to the navy.do not speculate as to why.the jury found plant was negligent and liable under strict products liability,and allocated fault as follows percent to plant,percent to fibreboard,percent to oil,percent to,and percent to macarthur.
on november,the court issued judgment against plant for in economic damages,for pain and suffering,for loss of consortium,and in wrongful death damages to his wife and to his daughter.the judgment stated it shall be amended nunc pro tunc to the date of its filing,today,november,sic when the court makes its determinations as to costs and the amount by which the economic damages award shall be reduced to reflect plaintiffs preverdict settlements with other defendants.italics omitted.on november,the court ordered the judgment filed on november,modified so that the economic damages awarded against plant insulation company shall be reduced by of or,for a net reduction of.this timely appeal by plant followed.
iii.discussion 
plant challenges the trial court ruling that excluded the navy from the list of entities to which fault could be allocated pursuant to proposition.there is no dispute the navy is immune from liability for plaintiffs asbestos claims.whether the navy immunity precludes an allocation of fault under proposition turns on the nature and character of the immunity,and is a question of law we review de novo.see people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,d.
proposition and fault allocation to immune entities 
we first examine the purpose and scope of proposition,and its application to individuals and entities immune from suit.
by,when proposition was placed on the ballot,the courts had eliminated certain inequities of the former tort recovery system,but deep pocket defendants whose fault was slight could still be saddled with large damage awards mainly attributable to the greater fault of others who were able to escape their full proportionate contribution.citation.proposition sought to modify this system of recovery.dafonte,cal th,d,dafonte.
proposition first codified its purpose by adding section to the civil code.this statute decries the unfairness and cost of the deep pocket rule to both governmental and private defendants citation and cites the exploitation of relatively blameless defendants who are perceived to have substantial financial resources or insurance coverage citation.dafonte,supra,cal th at.to remedy these inequities,the statute declares defendants in tort actions shall be held financially liable in closer proportion to their degree of fault.to treat them differently is unfair and inequitable,subd.c.the statute further declares reforms in the liability laws in tort actions are necessary and proper to avoid catastrophic economic consequences for state and local governmental bodies as well as private individuals and businesses.ibid.
to carry this intent into effect,proposition amended section and added section.amended section establishes a presumption that a n obligation imposed upon several persons is presumed to be joint,and not several,except as provided in section italics added.new section declares that in actions for wrongful death,personal injury,or property damage based on comparative fault,the liability of each defendant for damages shall be several only and shall not be joint.the statute further specifies that e ach defendant shall be liable only for the amount of damages allocated to that defendant in direct proportion to that defendant percentage of fault,and a separate judgment shall be rendered against that defendant for that amount.dafonte,supra,cal th at,quoting,subd.a.
proposition thus retains the joint liability of all tortfeasors,regardless of their respective shares of fault,with respect to all objectively provable expenses and monetary losses.on the other hand,the more intangible and subjective categories of damage were limited by proposition to a rule of strict proportionate liability.with respect to these noneconomic damages,the plaintiff alone now assumes the risk that a proportionate contribution can not be obtained from each person responsible for the injury.dafonte,supra,cal th at.
proposition thus contemplates a defendant fault will be compared to all other fault responsible for the injury.richards,cal th,d,richards.this follows from the express purpose of proposition to eliminate the perceived unfairness of imposing all the damage on defendants who were found to share only a fraction of the fault,subd.b.in this context,the only reasonable construction of section is that a defendant liability for noneconomic damages can not exceed his or her proportionate share of fault as compared with all fault responsible for the plaintiff injuries,not merely that of defendant s present in the lawsuit.dafonte,supra,cal th at.proposition quite clearly is simply intended to limit the potential liability of an individual defendant for noneconomic damages to a proportion commensurate with that defendant fault.dafonte,at.the finder of fact must therefore consider all others whose conduct contributed to the plaintiff injury,whether or not they are named as defendants and regardless of their economic circumstances.id.at.
the statute neither states nor implies an exception for damages attributable to the fault of persons who are immune from liability dafonte,supra,cal th at.as dafonte and richards illustrate,whether apportionment is proper with respect to an individual or entity immune from suit depends on the nature and character of the immunity.
in dafonte,the plaintiff was injured at work when his hand was crushed in a mechanical grape harvester.he received benefits from his employer workers compensation insurer and sued the manufacturer of the harvester for negligence and product defect.dafonte,supra,cal th at.his tort action was consolidated with the insurer subrogation action against the manufacturer,and he subsequently prevailed at trial.ibid.the jury allocated percent of the fault to his employer,and the trial court commensurately reduced the noneconomic damages award against the manufacturer.id.at.the plaintiff appealed,arguing fault should not have been allocated to his employer because it was immune from tort liability under the workers compensation law.id.at.
after analyzing the intent and purpose of proposition,the supreme court rejected the plaintiff argument.dafonte,supra,cal th at.under workers compensation law,an employer is liable for statutory compensation without regard to negligence,but is immune from any other liability,subd.a.the court explained that an employer immunity suit does not mean it owes no duty of care to its employees and can not be characterized as being at fault for injuries suffered in the workplace for purposes of proposition.dafonte,at,fn.no substantial reason is asserted,let alone a compelling one,why proposition manifest policy should not apply to third party suits by injured workers.id.at.
in richards,the plaintiff sued for injuries.richards,supra,cal th at.the plaintiff was a smoker,and owens asked that tobacco companies be included in the list of entities as to which fault could be allocated pursuant to proposition,regardless of the companies statutory immunity at the time under section.richards,at.the trial court did not allow apportionment.id.at.the court of appeal reversed,relying on dafonte.richards,at.
the supreme court reversed the appellate court,explaining the tobacco companies immunity was fundamentally different than the employer immunity at issue in dafonte.richards,supra,cal th at.the tobacco companies immunity was the result of a legislative decree that the companies conduct simply was not wrongful,that the companies did not owe,and therefore could not breach,any duty of care in connection with the sale of cigarettes.id.at.the language of the statute and legislative history demonstrated section represented a legislative judgment that to the extent of the immunity afforded,such companies have no fault or responsibility,in the legal sense,for harm caused by their products.to the same extent,such companies are thus not tortfeasors to whom comparative fault can be assigned for purposes of proposition.richards,at.t he legislature has determined,the mere manufacture and sale of such products create no tortious responsibility to individuals who voluntarily consumed them with the community knowledge that they were unsafe.id.at.in short,when the immunity statute was in effect,supplying pure and unadulterated tobacco products to knowing and voluntary consumers of those products was not subject to tort liability because it breached no legal duty and thus constituted no tort.myers,supra,cal th at,italics omitted.
thus,under dafonte and richards,whether fault can be allocated to an immune individual or entity under proposition depends on whether the immunity is essentially an immunity from suit,or whether it is based on a predicate determination the conduct in question is not wrongful under the law.subsequent cases illustrate this distinction.
in ford polaris industries,th d,for example,the plaintiff fell from a personal watercraft and was severely injured.she sued the operator of the watercraft for negligence and the manufacturer for product liability.id.at.the operator successfully moved for summary judgment on the ground use of personal watercraft is an active sport to which primary assumption of risk principles apply.ibid.the manufacturer nevertheless sought to include the operator among those persons or entities to which the jury could allocate fault.id.at.the trial court denied the request,and the court of appeal affirmed.no fault could be apportioned to the operator,explained the court,because under primary assumption of risk principles,she owed no duty of care to the plaintiff and therefore committed no tort.id.at.thus,richards,not dafonte,controls.ibid.
in ovando county of los angeles th d,the plaintiff,who had been convicted of assaulting a police officer based on the perjured testimony of the officers who arrested him,sued his criminal defense lawyer and her employer,los angeles county,for legal malpractice and sued the officers and their employer for violating his civil rights.id.at.the jury not only found the public defender negligent,but apportioned percent of the fault to the lawyer.id.at.the trial court granted a new trial on the ground the jury failure to apportion any fault to the police officers was against the weight of the evidence.the court rejected the plaintiff argument the officers statutory immunity precluded apportionment,stating the immunity was irrelevant to the apportionment of fault under proposition.id.at.the court of appeal affirmed.proposition requires the apportionment of fault to all alleged tortfeasors responsible for ovando injuries,including the police officers,notwithstanding any immunity under government code section.id.at.the court explained,n either the statutory language,nor the purpose of the statute,nor any other material that has been cited to us suggests that the immunity is based on a legislative determination that a public employee in those circumstances breaches no legal duty and bears no fault for any injury caused.id.at.
b.the navy immunity 
with these legal principles in mind,we now examine the nature and character of the navy immunity.
the united states,as sovereign,is immune from suit save as it consents to be sued.united states sherwood.accord,library of congress shaw,d,superseded by statute on another ground as stated in langford usi film products,d.the united states has waived its immunity for a wide range of suits,including those brought under the federal tort claims act ftca et.department of the army blue fox,d.
the ftca provides that,subject to certain exceptions,t he united states shall be liable,respecting the provisions of this title relating to tort claims,in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.department of the army blue fox,supra,at,fn,quoting.one such exception is for lawsuits based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the government,whether or not the discretion involved be abused.a.to determine whether a lawsuit falls within this discretionary function exception,the courts employ a twofold test.first,a court must consider whether the challenged conduct involved elements of judgment or choice.berkovitz united states u,d.t he discretionary function exception will not apply when a federal statute,regulation,or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow.ibid.secondly,a court must determine whether that judgment is of the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield.id.at.o nly governmental actions and decisions based on considerations of public policy fall within the exception.ibid.
it is undisputed the navy is immune from liability in this case by virtue of the discretionary function exception to the ftca.this exception has been held to bar actions based on the federal government alleged negligence in using asbestos on ships,failing to warn of its dangers,and promulgating an inadequate policy or having no policy for asbestos safety in shipyards.service,united states cir,gordon lykes,cir,shuman united states cir.
plant argues the navy immunity is essentially one from suit and does not mean the service owes no duty of care as to its enlisted personnel and civilian employees and thus can not be characterized as a tortfeasor for purposes of proposition.plaintiffs contend sovereign immunity is based on the historical adage the king can do no wrong and therefore the navy actions can not be wrongful and thus no fault can be allocated to the service.we agree with plant and conclude the navy is properly included among those entities to which fault may be apportioned in an asbestos case.
the discretionary function exception to the federal government waiver of its sovereign immunity in the ftca represents a policy decision by congress that certain actions of the united states,even if wrongful,are immune from suit.the federal statute states the provisions of this chapter shall
