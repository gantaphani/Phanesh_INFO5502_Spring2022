since,the texas property code has required that sellers by executory contract or contract for deed of certain residential property in texas must record and transfer a deed within thirty days of final payment in this case,a seller subject to the statute delivered title almost four years too late.
from to,the property code provided that failure to comply was subject to a penalty of up to a day by amendment in,the code now provides that such a seller is liable to the purchaser for liquidated damages in the same amount the amendment clearly provides a private cause of action for purchasers the question presented is whether the original statute which alone governs this case did as well.
the trial court held it did not,and granted a summary judgment.the court of appeals reversed for the reasons stated below,we agree with the trial court that a private cause of action was not created until,and accordingly reverse the court of appeals judgment.
on december,columbus brown agreed to sell unimproved real property described as lot,block,roseville subdivision,el paso county,texas to arturo de la cruz for.the executory contract provided for immediate possession by de la cruz,but brown was to retain title until de la cruz paid the purchase price plus interest totaling.de la cruz wife whom he had remarried during the contract period personally made the final payment on june,and requested that her name be added to the deed.because de la cruz was not present and only he was listed as buyer on the contract for deed,brown employees directed her to an attorney to accomplish her request.de la cruz did not hire an attorney due to the expense,and brown did not deliver a warranty deed within thirty days,as required both by the parties contract and the enactment of texas property code section in 
almost four years later,still having received no deed,de la cruz filed the present lawsuit against brown on january.he alleged no lost sales or other actual damages of any kind instead,he sought in section statutory fifty times the original sales price.on march,brown recorded what he denominated a replacement warranty deed delivering title to de la cruz.
the parties filed for summary judgment,de la cruz contending he was entitled to the statutory penalties,and brown contending section did not grant de la cruz a private cause of action,and alternatively that recovery was barred by laches and the constitutional limit on excessive fines the trial court granted brown motion for summary judgment without specifying reasons.
the court of appeals reversed,finding nothing in section authorizing the attorney general to collect the statutory penalty,and no one else to enforce the statute if de la cruz could not the court remanded for consideration of brown other defenses we granted brown petition to review this issue of statutory construction 
when a private cause of action is alleged to derive from a constitutional or statutory provision,our duty is to ascertain the drafters intent for example,in city of beaumont bouillion,we held that the texas constitution created a private action for damages only if the language of the specific provisions involved clearly implied one thus,we noted that the takings section implied a private action for damages by prohibiting takings without adequate compensation,while the free speech and assembly sections implied only a private equitable action not damages by declaring that violations shall be void.federal law is to the same effect 
accordingly,the answer in this case must be found in the language of section.when enacted in,that section provided in pertinent part 
a the seller shall transfer recorded,legal title of the property covered by the executory contract to the purchaser not later than the day after the date the seller receives the purchaser final payment due under the contract.
b a seller who violates subsection a is subject to a penalty of 
a day for each day the seller fails to transfer the title to the purchaser during the period that begins the day and ends the day after the date the seller receives the purchaser final payment due under the contract and 
a day for each day the seller fails to transfer title to the purchaser after the day after the date the seller receives the purchaser final payment due under the contract 
the statute expressly provides for a penalty,but is silent about who may collect it.
sixty years ago,we construed a statute containing precisely the same language to exclude a private action for damages.in agey american liberty pipe line,an oil producer brought suit under a statute providing that violations of certain rules governing pipelines shall be subject to a penalty of up to per day the statute in that case gave more direction than section,in that it directed half of the penalty was recoverable in the name of the state and the other half in the name of and for the use of the party or parties aggrieved.nevertheless,we concluded that a statute which imposes a penalty must be strictly construed,and that a person who seeks to recover a penalty thereunder must bring himself clearly within the terms of the statute.because the individual in that suit had not joined the attorney general and nothing in the statute authorized him to bring suit on the state behalf,we held the statute did not authorize him to bring the action on his own 
we believe this is still the correct interpretation.generally,a statutory penalty or fine is not payable to a private litigant for example,the texas whistleblower act authorizes a private action for damages to private litigants but a civil penalty of up to collectible only by public prosecutors virtually all other statutes that imposed a daily penalty in when section was enacted authorized collection only by the attorney general or some other governmental entity or representative without some indication in section that this penalty belongs to de la cruz,we do not believe he has brought himself so clearly within the statute terms as to justify implying a private cause of action.
this construction of section is supported by the subsequent amendments to it when the section was amended and renumbered as property code section in,paragraph a was left intact,but paragraph b was amended to read 
b a seller who violates subsection a is liable to the purchaser for 
liquidated damages in the amount of 
a a day for each day the seller fails to transfer the title to the purchaser during the period that begins the day and ends the day after the date the seller receives the purchaser final payment due under the contract and 
b a day for each day the seller fails to transfer title to the purchaser after the day after the date the seller receives the purchaser final payment due under the contract and 
reasonable attorney fees 
de la cruz asserts this amendment made explicit what the legislature had intended in.for three reasons,we disagree.
first,if the legislature intended merely to clarify who could recover the penalty,the substitution of liable to the purchaser would have been sufficient.instead,by changing penalty to liquidated damages and adding a provision for attorney fees,the legislature changed not just the recipient but the nature of the amounts assessed.
second,the legislature made its amendment of paragraph b applicable only to violations occurring after september,a violation that occurs before september,is covered by the law in effect when the violation occurred,and the former law is continued in effect for that purpose.by contrast,paragraph a,which was left intact,was made applicable to all contracts for deed,whether signed before or after the amendment effective date.if the legislature intended neither to be a substantive change,it is hard to see why one was made prospective only.
third,the bill analysis to the amendment indicates the amendment was a change rather than a clarification 
redesignates existing section as section.title transfer.provides that a seller who violates subsection a is liable to the purchaser for,rather than subject to a penalty of,liquidated damages in certain amounts,and reasonable attorney fees
