introduction 
california workers compensation law was extensively amended in by urgency statute that took immediate effect and was intended to address a crisis in the availability and affordability of workers compensation insurance.stats,ch.this case involves the application of certain parts of the new law that require apportionment where a claimant permanent disability is due,in part,to a prior injury.the issue discussed here has been addressed in two published decisions of the court of appeal,e j gallo winery workers comp.appeals bd.th,d dykes review den,and nabors workers comp.appeals bd.th,d review den.while we agree with the apportionment formula applied in those cases,we apply it in a slightly different way.
in this case,contra costa county firefighter stan brodie petitions for review of an order of the workers compensation appeals board board denying reconsideration of the permanent disability award of a workers compensation judge wcj.he seeks the use of a different apportionment formula from that applied by the wcj and the board.we will annul the decision of the board and remand the matter with directions to recompute brodie permanent disability award according to the formula described in our decision.
facts and procedural history 
brodie sustained an industrial injury to his back,spine and right knee on december,and injury to his back and spine cumulative to september,that resulted in percent permanent disability.over the previous years of his career as a firefighter,brodie had sustained several industrial injuries to the same body parts for which he was awarded compensation based on a percent permanent disability rating.so,in calculating the award in this case,the wcj was required to apportion brodie disability between his prior injuries and the injuries that underlie his current claim,and in so doing applied new labor code sections and stats,ch,see post,
in her decision,the wcj declared herself bound to follow the board en banc decision in nabors piedmont lumber mill company,nabors,which was then pending in division two of this court on a petition for review.in nabors,a majority of the board concluded that when apportioning permanent disability benefits,the amount of indemnity is calculated by determining the overall percentage of permanent disability and subtracting therefrom the percentage of disability caused by factors other than the current industrial injury.this formula formula a was determined to be an appropriate method of apportionment under former section in fuentes workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,fuentes.the wcj thus subtracted from and awarded brodie benefits totaling based on a percent permanent disability rating.but she did so reluctantly,and considered the dissenting view in repealing section and enacting section,the legislature contemplated a new apportionment be a more compelling argument.see nabors,supra,at,dis.opn.of comr.caplane.
in her report and recommendation on brodie petition for reconsideration,the wcj again expressed her disagreement with the nabors majority,and her belief that under section,an employer is liable for that portion of a worker overall disability that exceeds his prior level of disability.but she was bound by nabors,and urged the board to grant reconsideration and revisit its nabors analysis.by this time,division two of this court had granted review in nabors.the board denied reconsideration,and adopted and incorporated that part of the wcj report that acknowledged her duty to follow the board en banc decisions,tit,which also binds the board until such decisions are stayed or overruled by an appellate court diggle sierra sands unified school district,significant board panel decision.
this timely writ petition followed.
discussion 
the issue here is when making an award for permanent disability under the amendments to the workers compensation law,how does a prior permanent disability affect the measure of indemnity due to a claimant two sections of the new law address the apportionment of employer responsibility for such injuries.section,subdivision a provides that a pportionment of permanent disability shall be based on causation.section,subdivision a provides,the employer shall only be liable for the percentage of permanent disability directly caused by the injury arising out of and occurring in the course of employment.so,any award of permanent disability must take causation into account,and an employer is responsible for the percentage of disability caused by a injury.
but fulfilling the legislative mandate to apportion employer responsibility on the basis of causation is not so easy,because i n adopting sen ate bill,the legislature did not outline any particular method for apportioning either a permanent disability award or a life pension.dykes,supra,th at,d.in choosing the appropriate formula,we will follow the statutory mandate that an employer shall only be liable for the percentage of permanent disability directly cased by the injury,subd.a with several precepts of statutory construction in mind the workers compensation laws are to be liberally construed to extend benefits to people injured while working.to the extent the words of the statute can lead us to the result,we will follow them,giving words their ordinary and proper meaning.people mel mack d.but we are also aware of the historical background that led to the passage of senate bill,and to the extent the statutory language does not suffice,we will consider this historical context.ibid.
in dykes and nabors,two different districts of the court of appeal considered the issue presented here.we acknowledge we are not bound by an opinion of another district court of appeal,however persuasive it might be.citation.we respect stare decisis,however,which serves the important goals of stability in the law and predictability of decision.thus,we ordinarily follow the decisions of other districts without good reason to disagree.citation.greyhound lines,county of santa clara d.so we largely follow the decisions in dykes and nabors.
the dykes and nabors courts discussed and applied an apportionment formula first articulated but rejected by our supreme court in fuentes,supra,cal d.there,the court announced the appropriate method to determine an employer liability for a permanent disability in cases where the overall disability is due in part to a preexisting injury.id.at.the issue arose because amendments changed the schedule of permanent disability benefits from a linear one that awarded four weeks of compensation for each one percent of permanent disability,to one in which the number of weekly benefits increases exponentially in proportion to increasing percentages of disability.fuentes,supra,at.thus,for example,the benefits for percent permanent disability plus the benefits for percent permanent disability add up to appreciably less than the benefits for percent permanent disability.
the fuentes court analysis was informed by and turned upon the interplay between section and former section see ante,fn,which was repealed by the amendments to the workers compensation law.fuentes,supra,cal d at,stats,ch.the court considered three possible formulas that could be used to apportion liability.under formula a the percentage of disability is subtracted from the claimant overall disability to determine the compensable percentage.under formula b the number of weeks of compensation allowable for a claimant total disability is multiplied by the percentage of the injury that was industrially related to arrive at the compensable portion of disability.under formula c the percentage of overall current disability is converted to its monetary equivalent,from which is subtracted the dollar value of the percentage of prior disability.fuentes,supra,at.
the fuentes court applied formula a because it was the method of apportionment that best gave effect to former section fuentes,supra,cal d at,but the dykes court concluded the fuentes decision is no longer controlling in light of the repeal of section dykes,supra,th at,d.we agree.amendment of a statute that has received judicial construction is an indication of legislative intent to change the law.dudenhoeffer
