in this case we determine whether the confederated tribes of the colville indian reservation colville is foreclosed by res judicata from asserting the claim of its wenatchi constituent tribe wenatchi to fishing rights at the wenatshapam fishery on icicle creek,a tributary to the columbia river.the yakama nation sought and obtained an injunction preventing the members of the wenatchi tribe from fishing at that location in granting the injunction,the district court found that colville earlier failed effort to intervene in litigation over fishing rights in the area served to bar colville from asserting the alleged rights as a defense to the injunction.see united states oregon.we hold that the requisite identity of claims between the earlier intervention attempt and the present injunction hearing does not exist and,consequently,res judicata does not apply.we therefore reverse and remand to the district court for a hearing on the merits.
background 
in,the united states entered into two treaties with a group of indian tribes,the yakama treaty of june,and the nez perce treaty of june.in this action between the yakama nation and the confederated tribes of the colville indian reservation on behalf of the wenatchi tribe,only the yakama treaty is involved.
the wenatchi tribe was one of the fourteen tribes represented at the negotiation of the yakama treaty.the treaty specified that tribes for the purposes of this treaty,are to be considered as one nation,under the name of yakama.treaty with the yakamas,june,stat.under the treaty,the tribes gave up most of their lands in return for a specific reservation with set boundaries and also certain other benefits such as schools,a hospital,various services and a payment of payable over twenty years.this reservation for the yakama nation was to be set apart,surveyed and marked out for the exclusive use of the fourteen confederated tribes of the yakama nation.these tribes were to settle on this reservation within one year.the treaty provided nor shall any white man,excepting those in the employment of the indian department,be permitted to reside upon the said reservation without permission of the tribe and the superintendent and agent.id.at art.ii,stat.at.the land was later surveyed and set apart as provided in the treaty.
the treaty also provided 
the exclusive right of taking fish in all the streams,where running through or bordering said reservation,is further secured to said confederated tribes and bands of indians,as also the right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places,in common with citizens of the territory,and of erecting temporary buildings for curing them together with the privilege of hunting,gathering roots and berries,and pasturing their horses and cattle upon open and unclaimed land.
id.at art.iii,stat.at.
the treaty also set aside an additional reservation for the use of the confederated tribes of the yakama nation.article x of the treaty provided 
that there is also reserved and set apart from the lands ceded by this treaty,for the use and benefit of the aforesaid confederated tribes and bands,a tract of land not exceeding in quantity one township of six miles square,situated at the forks of the pisquouse or wenatshapam river,and known as the 
wenatshapam fishery,which said reservation shall be surveyed and marked out whenever the president may direct,and be subject to the same provisions and restrictions as other indian reservations.
id.at art.x,stat.at.
despite the promise made in article x,no attempt was made by the united states to survey the reservation for almost forty years.the wenatchi remained at this wenatshapam fishery reservation and fished there during this time,firmly believing that a survey would be made and they would be secure in this reservation.
along with four other signatory tribes,the entiat,chelan,columbia,and paloose tribes,the wenatchi did not move onto the surveyed yakama nation reservation.the wenatchi remained and fished on their aboriginal lands at the wenatshapam fishery until they were moved by the federal government in and to the colville reservation.events transpiring during this period are set forth in some detail in united states oregon,and in our opinion on appeal of that case,at cir 
the united states finally authorized a survey to be conducted of the wenatshapam fishery reservation in.the surveyor,deputy united states surveyor oliver iverson,had established monuments and marks on trees to set out this area.however,before the survey was completed,the newly appointed yakima indian agent,lewis erwin,ordered iverson to stop the surveying and destroy all the monuments and trees that had markings.instead,he directed the surveyor to survey an area some distance away in the mountains next to a lake,but not near the river.when former yakima indian agent jay lynch learned that the survey had placed the reservation in the mountains at lake wenatchee,he wrote to complain about the whole affair i do not think i can give you a clearer idea of the situation than to quote the remarks of an old indian does our great father at washington think a salmon is an eagle that lives on top of a mountain,or does he think a salmon is a deer that lives in the woods and hills hart history at.
in the meantime,quite a number of white settlers had settled on the proposed wenatshapam fishery reservation and a railroad had been built through the area.apparently as a result of these developments,the united states commenced negotiations with the tribes of the yakama nation to purchase the area that had been described in article x of the treaty.the government had not accepted agent erwin survey of the mountainous area because it was incorrect.an agreement was executed on january.it is important to note that this was not an amendment to the treaty.the agreement provided for the sale for of the fishery area that had been described in article x of the treaty.article i of the agreement provided 
the said indians hereby cede and relinquish to the united states all their right,title,interest,claim,and demand of whatsoever name or nature of in,and to all their right of fishery,as set forth in article of said treaty aforesaid,and also all their right,title,interest,claim,or demand of,in,and to said land above described,or any corrected description thereof and known as the wenatshapam fishery.
agreement with the yakima nation of indians agreement,art.i,stat.
the wenatchi contend that the yakama nation was unwilling to sell the property without a provision guaranteeing the land and fishing rights for the wenatchi tribe that had continued to live on its aboriginal territory and fishery.in support of this argument,colville cites to negotiations at the time of entering into the agreement.indian agent erwin stated to chief john harmelt,the leader of the wenatchi tribe 
there is one thing i want to impress on these indians from the wenatchee,and that is that they are not to be robbed of an acre of land,but,on the contrary,the government proposes to give them land where they now are.the selling of this fishery does not interfere with their rights at all.the proposition is to buy this little piece of land and to allot to the indians where they now live.
exec.doc,at.
as a result of these negotiations,the agreement contained the following key provision,in article ii 
after the ratification of this agreement by congress and the further consideration that the indians known as the wenatshapam indians,residing on the wenatchee river,state of washington,shall have land allotted to them in severalty in the vicinity of where they now reside,or elsewhere,as they may select,in accordance with article of the general allotment law 
agreement,art.ii,stat.at.the agreement to provide allotments to the members of the wenatchi tribe that were still living at the fishery would have amounted to approximately acres.however,the government again failed to fulfill its promise,as it never made the allotments available to the wenatchi.hart history at.
the wenatshapam fishery is now occupied primarily by the leavenworth national fish hatchery.the management of the hatchery has welcomed fishing by members of both the wenatchi and yakama tribes.the fish taken are those designated by the hatchery as surplus to its needs.until the current dispute,the members of the wenatchi and yakama tribes have fished there peacefully.the hatchery has permitted the wenatchi tribe to hold its tribal ceremonies on the grounds.
the yakama nation has now brought this action for an injunction to exclude the wenatchi from fishing at the wenatshapam fishery,their aboriginal fishery.colville,on behalf of its constituent tribe,the wenatchi,defends on the ground of rights granted to the wenatchi by the agreement with the united states that was ratified by congress.under the district court res judicata ruling,however,the wenatchi tribe did not obtain a ruling on the merits of their claim.through unfulfilled promises and procedural rulings,they would,under that ruling,lose both the land they were guaranteed adjacent to the fishery and their fishing rights.
ii.procedural background 
in,the united states supreme court ruled on the extent state regulation could impinge on tribal treaty rights.puyallup tribe of game,d.in light of that case,two suits,later consolidated,were filed in in the district court for the district of oregon to determine the extent of the permissible regulation of indian treaty fishing rights by the state of oregon.the progress of that case is summarized in united states oregon.
the pending case is the outgrowth of the consolidation of two cases filed in.the first case was designated sohappy smith,while the second was designated by the heading in this case.each suit was brought against the state of oregon to define the indians treaty right to take fish at all usual and accustomed places on the columbia river and its tributaries.
an initial opinion was entered on july,wherein the honorable robert belloni construed the indians treaty fishing right and considered the manner and extent to which the state of oregon could regulate initial fishing.sohappy.at.he retained jurisdiction to grant further or amended relief.id.
id.at emphasis added.the state of washington was allowed to intervene,and judge belloni urged the parties to adopt a comprehensive plan for allocation and management of the columbia river anadromous fish.a plan was initially adopted,followed by several plans.in,a plan was adopted.
in,colville sought to intervene in the united states oregon litigation on behalf of five constituent wenatchi,entiat,chelan,columbia,and palous were parties to the yakama treaty of june,and on behalf of the chief joseph band of nez perce,which was a party to the nez perce treaty of june.both treaties had reserved fishing rights on the columbia river and its tributaries.colville was allowed to intervene temporarily on the condition that those constituent tribes could prove that they had treaty rights.judge marsh stated in his opinion that 
colville seeks intervention in a proceeding that has been under the continuing jurisdiction and supervision of this court since.on august,i granted colville motion to intervene,on the condition that it first establish that it has federally secured treaty fishing rights either by initial grant or by succession in interest.
united states oregon.at emphasis added.after a bench trial on this issue,judge marsh concluded 
i find that the colville confederated tribes has failed to establish that it is the successor indian government and the present day holder of treaty rights reserved to the wenatchi,entiat,chelan,columbia,palus tribes or chief joseph band of nez perce in the treaties of with the yakima nation or with the nez perce.accordingly,the colville complaint in intervention is dismissed.
id.at emphasis added.
colville appealed the denial of intervention to our court.although there was some confusion as to whether colville was asserting a claim as to all of its constituent tribes,this was cleared up at oral argument in that appeal when colville clarified that it was asserting only the rights of the six constituent treaty tribes.on appeal,we first stated,i t is not disputed that colville is the only entity that can legally act on behalf of members of the confederated tribes,and we agree with colville that if the constituent tribes retained treaty fishing rights,colville may properly assert these rights.united states oregon,cir,amended by cir.
we went on,however,to affirm judge marsh decision that neither colville nor the wenatchi had fishing rights flowing from the treaty.id.at.in doing so,we also noted that the parties agreed that the wenatchi,entiat,chelan,columbia and palous tribes were all signatories to the treaty,but that t he yakima treaty of envisioned the creation of a successor tribe,a yakima nation composed of all of the people represented by the signatories to the treaty.id.at.the five tribes never moved to the reservation created for the yakama nation,which was the entity in which the treaty rights vested.id.
we further observed that the present yakama nation was recomposed in and has exercised treaty rights as a successor to the entities that signed the original treaty.we concluded that,by deliberately separating from the yakima nation,these tribes failed to maintain political cohesion with the tribal entity in which the treaty fishing rights are vested.id.at emphasis added.
in the present action,the district court determined that the intervention proceeding had a res judicata effect because colville had the opportunity to raise the claim it is raising now,premised on the agreement,in the earlier proceeding,but chose not to colville appeals the res judicata ruling,arguing that it was precluded from raising the claim by the district judge required conditions for intervention,and that the intervention proceeding did not bar consideration of the merits of its claim under the agreement.
iii.discussion 
intervention 
in order to intervene in the action concerning the treaty rights of the five tribes that had been parties to the yakama treaty,judge marsh made it clear that colville had to establish,as a condition to intervention,treaty rights under the treaties.colville did not become a party to the litigation,in which it could litigate any other issues concerning fishing rights of any of its constituent tribes,until it satisfied that condition for intervention.judge marsh held that colville failed to do so and denied intervention.the condition that judge marsh imposed follows logically from the constraints of federal rule of civil procedure a,which provides for intervention when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action.the subject of the action from on was,as judge marsh stated,to define the indians treaty rights to take fish at all usual and accustomed places.at.a claim to fishing rights resulting from the agreement was not a claim of an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action as specified in rule a.the subject of the action was the treaty fishing rights of the tribes,not fishing rights in general.colville did seek intervention on the basis that the history of the matter did somehow involve treaty rights of the five indian tribes.judge marsh properly ruled that it did not and denied intervention.colville did not meet the condition judge marsh had set forth to permit intervention and did not meet the requirements of rule a,as it was not the subject of the action.
the scope of colville complaint in intervention can not,therefore,fairly be characterized as solely a function of trial strategy the limitations on the intervention proceeding clearly precluded colville from asserting the right now claimed by the wenatchi.the wenatchi contend that all rights reserved under article x of the treaty were ceded to the united states by the yakama nation in,but only after yakama nation representatives were satisfied that the wenatchi would still be able to remain on their land and fish at wenatshapam.the wenatchi thus characterize their fishing rights under the agreement as new rights,granted by the united states as part of its independent agreement to buy back the reservation that should have been,but never was,set aside in article x of the t
