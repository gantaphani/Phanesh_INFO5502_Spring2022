appellants public employees union local one local one and the public employment relations board perb collectively referred to as appellants appeal an order of the trial court that concluded the perb does not have exclusive initial jurisdiction over whether certain essential employees may be prevented from participating in a strike.local one also contends that the court erred in failing to comply with the evidentiary hearing procedures found within labor code section et,before issuing its temporary restraining order.we affirm.
factual background and procedural history 
the essential facts underlying this case are not in dispute.on june,respondent the county of contra costa county filed a complaint against several public employee unions,seeking to enjoin certain essential employees from participating in a strike the unions represented approximately employees.the county sought the order on the basis that the participation of approximately employees in the strike would create a substantial and imminent threat to public health and safety.the county also sought to enjoin all the members of a nurses union from engaging in a sympathy strike 
that same day,the trial court issued a temporary restraining order tro enjoining approximately employees from striking,including airport operations specialists,animal services workers at the county animal shelters,probation counselors,and various county hospital workers.the court also issued a tro forbidding the nurses from engaging in a sympathy strike,finding that they were also essential public employees.the court did not hold an evidentiary hearing before issuing the tro.
the perb is the state agency charged with resolving disputes and enforcing statutes that pertain to several categories of public employees,such as the educational employment relations act eera see,the state relations act see,subd.g,and,as of,the act mmba,which applies to local government agencies and their employees see.
on june,the perb intervened in the trial court,arguing that it has exclusive jurisdiction over the issue before the court,since the unions proposed strike is arguably protected or prohibited by the mmba.over local one objections,the court found that labor code section et,did not apply to the proceedings.
on june,the court held a hearing and determined that the mmba did not apply to the county complaint,ruling that the perb did not have exclusive jurisdiction.these consolidated appeals followed.
discussion 
appellants do not challenge the merits of the orders insofar as they hold that the identified employees are essential to maintaining public health and safety.they do,however,challenge the trial court finding that the perb did not have exclusive initial jurisdiction over this matter.local one also challenges the proceedings leading to the issuance of the tro,arguing that the orders are invalid because the court failed to comply with labor code section et 
standard of review 
where the propriety of an order granting a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction depends upon a question of law the standard of review is not abuse of discretion but whether the superior court correctly interpreted and applied the law,which we review de novo.citation.vo city of garden grove th,d.the issues here concern whether the court correctly interpreted relevant statutes in light of applicable case law.we will therefore review the court order independently 
ii.historic background and statutory framework 
we begin by reviewing the history of the perb that is concisely set forth in coachella valley mosquito vector control dist.california public employment relations bd.cal th,d,coachella valley.the history of the perb begins in,when the legislature adopted the educational employment relations act,which governs relations for public schools kindergarten through high school and community colleges.citation.as part of this new statutory scheme,the legislature created the educational employment relations board eerb,an expert,administrative agency modeled after the national labor relations board,to enforce the act.citation.the legislature vested the eerb with authority to adjudicate unfair labor practice charges under the eera.id.at,d.
two years later,in,the legislature enacted the state relations act citation to govern relations between the state government and certain of its employees.citation.it was later renamed,and its official name is now the ralph dills act hereafter the dills act.citation.despite the declaration of purpose two years earlier in the eera,the legislature did not incorporate the dills act into the eera,instead enacting it as a separate chapter in the government code preceding the eera.the legislature did,however,expand the jurisdiction of the eerb to include adjudication of unfair practice charges under the dills act,and as a result the eerb was renamed the perb.citations.
since,the perb jurisdiction has continued to expand as the legislature has enacted new employment relations laws covering additional categories of public agencies and their employees.in,the legislature enacted the higher education relations act citation to govern labor relations within the university of california,the california state university,and hastings college of the law.citation.in,the legislature not only brought the mmba within the perb jurisdiction citation,it also enacted the trial court employment protection and governance act citation to govern labor relations and other employment matters within the state trial courts.citation.in,the legislature enacted the trial court interpreter employment and labor relations act citation to govern labor relations and employment matters for trial court interpreters.citation.in,the legislature enacted the los angeles county metropolitan transit authority transit relations act citation to govern labor relations for a public transit district.coachella valley,supra,cal th,d.
b.the mmba 
the county and the employee organizations involved here are subject to the mmba.the mmba imposes on local public entities a duty to meet and confer in good faith with representatives of recognized employee organizations,in order to reach binding agreements governing wages,hours,and working conditions of the agencies employees.citation.the duty to bargain requires the public agency to refrain from making unilateral changes in employees wages and working conditions until the employer and employee association have bargained to impasse citation.coachella valley,supra,cal th,d.
the mmba governs collective bargaining and relations for most california local public entities,including cities,counties,and special districts.before july,an employee association claiming a violation of the mmba could bring an action in superior court.citation.effective july,however,the legislature vested the california public employment relations board perb with exclusive jurisdiction over alleged violations of the mmba.coachella valley,supra,cal th,d.
government code section,subdivision b provides a complaint alleging any violation of this chapter shall be processed as an unfair practice charge by the board.the initial determination as to whether the charge of unfair practice is justified and,if so,the appropriate remedy necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter,shall be a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the board.the board shall apply and interpret unfair labor practices consistent with existing judicial interpretations of this chapter.italics added.the perb also has the authority to petition the trial courts for appropriate temporary relief or restraining order after issuance of a complaint charging that any person has engaged in or is engaging in an unfair practice,subd.j see also,subd.a.
according to the perb regulations,employee organizations commit an unfair practice under the mmba if they do any of the following cause or attempt to cause a public agency to engage in conduct prohibited by the mmba,interfere with,intimidate,restrain,coerce or discriminate against public employees because of their exercise of the right to join or abstain from joining labor organizations,refuse or fail to meet and confer in good faith,fail to exercise good faith while participating in any impasse procedure,or in any other way violate the mmba,tit.
iii.did the trial court have jurisdiction to issue the injunction 
local one and the perb argue that the perb has exclusive initial jurisdiction over whether a public employee strike is unlawful.the county claims,and the trial court agreed,that the perb did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter of its complaint because the county did not allege any unfair practice under the mmba.on appeal,the county maintains it is not required to go to the perb before resorting to the courts to obtain orders protecting the public from imminent threats to health and safety.
county sanitation district los angeles county employees cal d 
we begin our analysis with the seminal case on the public health and safety exception to the right to strike.in county sanitation,the supreme court held for the first time that public employees have the right to strike w e conclude that the common law prohibition against public sector strikes should not be recognized in this state.consequently,strikes by public sector employees in this state as such are neither illegal nor tortious under california common law.county sanitation district los angeles county employees cal d,county sanitation.
concurrently,the court gave public entities the right to go to court to request an injunction based on a showing that the strike would have a detrimental impact on public health and safety after consideration of the various alternatives before us,we believe the following standard may properly guide courts in the resolution of future disputes in this area strikes by public employees are not unlawful at common law unless or until it is clearly demonstrated that such a strike creates a substantial and imminent threat to the health or safety of the public.this standard allows exceptions in certain essential areas of public employment,the prohibition against firefighters and law enforcement personnel and also requires the courts to determine on a basis whether the public interest overrides the basic right to strike.county sanitation,supra,cal d,italics added.
thus,county sanitation stands for the proposition that public employee strikes are not unlawful at common law to the extent that they can be conducted without causing a substantial threat to public health or safety.it also authorizes public agencies to turn to the courts to prevent such threats.and,contrary to the perb position on appeal,while the parties in county sanitation were covered by the mmba,the court decision did not turn on that act.instead,the court based its ruling on common law,noting that the legislature had intentionally avoided the inclusion of any provision in the mmba which could be construed as either a blanket grant or prohibition of a right to strike,thus leaving the issue shrouded in ambiguity.county sanitation,supra,cal d.
local one acknowledges that courts historically have had jurisdiction over all matters pertaining to the mmba,but observes that this changed in,when the perb obtained jurisdiction over the mmba under section,subdivision a.it contends that county sanitation no longer applies because it predates this legislative change.the perb also argues that county sanitation does not control because,at the time it was decided,the perb did not have jurisdiction over the mmba.
local one also claims that the trial court erred in relying on the fact that the county did not allege any unfair labor practice or other violation of the mmba.it claims that courts discussing the eera have uniformly held that strike activity is both arguably prohibited and arguably protected by the eera.amicus california state council of service employees argues that whether or not the county contends the strike violates the common law,rather than the mmba,is immaterial.
cases construing the perb authority under the eera 
local one claims that the california supreme court and the courts of appeal have consistently held that the perb has exclusive jurisdiction with respect to the eera over all injunction actions and other legal disputes involving strikes.it relies on four cases decided under the eera for the proposition that the perb now also has exclusive initial jurisdiction under the mmba over all strike issues,including whether a threatened strike poses a danger to public health and safety.we are not convinced that the perb jurisdiction extends to matters falling outside the statutes it administers.
in san diego teachers superior court cal d,san diego teachers,a trial court had issued contempt orders against a teachers union and some of its members after they failed to abide by an injunction forbidding an allegedly unlawful strike.id.at.significantly,when the injunction was issued,both the teachers association and the district had already filed unfair practice charges against each other with the perb.id.at.
the supreme court annulled the contempt orders,holding that the perb had exclusive initial jurisdiction to determine whether the strike was an unfair practice and what,if any,remedies should be pursued.san diego teachers,supra,cal d.in articulating its reasoning,the court observed that the perb was uniquely situated to evaluate the circumstances of the strike,concluding that a court enjoining a strike on the basis of a rule that public employee strikes are illegal,and harm resulting from the withholding of teachers services can not with expertise tailor its remedy to implement the broader objectives entrusted to perb.id.at.the court also disagreed with the school district assertion that the perb would be unable to fully address the public interests when fashioning its own remedy for the alleged violations.id.at.
while the court reasoning is broadly worded,we believe san diego teachers must be read in context.in particular,we note the court found it significant that the teachers association may have committed at least two unfair practices by undertaking the strike failure to negotiate in good faith,subd.c,and refusal to participate in the impasse procedure,subd.d.san diego teachers,supra,cal d.the court also explicitly limited its holding to injunctions against strikes by public school employee organizations recognized or certified as exclusive representatives id.at.we believe these factors distinguish san diego teachers from the present case 
appellants also rely on el rancho unified school dist.national education cal d,el rancho.in el rancho,the supreme court held that the eera had divested the superior court of jurisdiction over a school district tort suit for damages arising out of a teachers strike led by noncertified unions.el rancho,supra,at.applying principles of federal preemption,the court held that the perb has initial exclusive jurisdiction over all conduct that is arguably protected or prohibited by the eera.el rancho,supra,at.as in san diego teachers,the school district in el rancho had filed unfair practice charges with the perb prior to filing its lawsuit.el rancho,supra,at.
significantly for our purposes,the court stated that strikes are an unfair practice under the eera only if they involve a violation of the act provisions.el rancho,supra,cal d,italics added.the court also noted that the perb has exclusive initial jurisdiction to determine whether such a strike is an unfair practice and what,if any,remedies should be pursued.id.at,italics added.while the court did conclude that the perb would take the harm caused to the general public by a teachers strike into account,this conclusion was in the context of the perb already having assumed jurisdiction over the underlying alleged unfair labor practice.thus,we believe el rancho should not be read so broadly as to apply to any issue that does not clearly implicate an unfair labor practice.
the perb notes that the eera,like the mmba,is silent on the issue of strikes,yet the supreme court interpreted the perb jurisdiction over the eera to include strike conduct in both san diego teachers and el rancho.the perb also emphasizes that strikes are a part of the bargaining relationship that is described in section of the mmba.the perb concludes that a strike by essential employees is conduct that is arguably protected by the mmba as an exercise of employee rights or is arguably prohibited by the mmba as an unlawful coercive pressure tactic.
the facts underlying the strikes in the two supreme court cases,however,clearly implicated unlawful labor practices.while appellants appear to argue that conduct is always either arguably prohibited or protected by the mmba,if appellants were correct there would have been no need for the court in el rancho to limit its holding to strikes that are also unfair practices.moreover,in the present case,the court did not enjoin the strike it enjoined a relatively small number of employees who provide essential public services,the disruption of which would cause a substantial and imminent danger to the public health or safety from participating in the strike 
we recognize that our colleagues in the sixth district arrived at the opposite conclusion in the recent city of san jose case.the facts of that case concerned a threatened job action by a union representing sanitation workers.city of san jose,supra,th,d.the city filed a complaint with the superior court,seeking to enjoin certain specified employees from participating in a work stoppage.as in the present case,the city argued that the employees provided services essential to the public health and safety of its citizens.a few days before the city filed the complaint,the union had filed an unfair practice charge against the city with the perb,alleging that the city had interfered with the employees right to strike by threatening to apply for injunctive relief.ibid.
after discussing san diego teachers,el rancho,and county sanitation,the court in city of san jose concluded that the union conduct was arguably prohibited by the mmba despite its label as a common law claim,the underlying allegedly illegal run afoul of the mmba.city of san jose,supra,th,d.the court also found that the union conduct was arguably protected by the mmba because public employees covered by the mmba enjoy a general right to strike under county sanitation.city of san jose,supra,at,d.we believe the court reasoning is overly broad,as it is difficult to envision how any conduct would not be either arguably prohibited or protected under this analysis,regardless of whether the conduct actually implicates the mmba.
we also agree with the county that it is significant that both san diego and el rancho were decided prior to county sanitation.thus,appellants position that the two earlier cases stand for the proposition that the courts are now divested of jurisdiction to decide matters brought under county sanitation rests on somewhat shaky ground.in the absence of explicit language to the contrary,we also are not persuaded that the legislature intended such a result when it gave the perb jurisdiction over the mmba.
moreover,san diego teachers and its progeny concern teachers.the trial court in the present case was concerned with employees such as nurses,probation officers,and airport operations specialists.as important as teachers are,the public services involved in this case are on a different order of magnitude.a strike by teachers is unlikely to create a substantial and imminent threat to the health or safety of the public,county sanitation,supra,cal d,whereas a strike by nurses could have implications.
appellants also draw our attention to decisions by the courts of appeal.in fresno unified school dist.national education d.fresno,a school district had filed a complaint alleging three causes of action in the aftermath of a teachers strike.the first theory asserted the strike was illegal and therefore the district was entitled to damages.the second theory was grounded in the tort of interference with contract.the third theory was based in contract,not tort.id.at.
concluding the first two theories arguably involved allegations of unfair labor practices,the court held these causes of action were properly dismissed because government code section gives the perb exclusive jurisdiction fresno,supra,d.the court further held that,as to the contract cause of action,the trial court had concurrent jurisdiction,pursuant to labor code section,which provides for judicial enforcement of collective bargaining agreements.the court concluded that,as a matter of accommodation,a stay was proper to protect the status quo of the contract issues pending resolution by the board of the unfair practice issues.id.at.we do not find fresno to be dispositive since the case before us does not involve an unfair labor practice.
in public employment relations bd.modesto city schools dist.d,a school district had filed an unfair practice charge against a teachers union,accusing the union of violating provisions of the eera by striking.the district also asked the perb to seek injunctive relief against the union work stoppage.id.at.the court held that public policy would best be served if perb retained initial exclusive jurisdiction over any action which is arguably prohibited or protected by eera.id.at.the court concluded there was reasonable cause for perb to believe the district violated the duty to bargain in good faith id.at.and that it would not serve public policy to have numerous superior courts throughout the state interpreting and implementing statewide labor policy inevitably with conflicting results noting one of the basic purposes for the doctrine of preemption is to bring expertise and uniformity to the task of stabilizing labor relations.id.at.
we do not see a need to defer to the perb expertise in cases such as this.trial courts are quite capable of resolving these issues.we note the supreme court observed the following in county sanitation although we recognize that this balancing process in determining whether the public interest overrides the basic right to strike may impose an additional burden on the judiciary,it is neither a novel nor unmanageable task.county sanitation,supra,cal d,emphasis added.
nor do we agree with local one that the present case exemplifies an area of law in need of consistent rulings.local one claims that without clear and consistent enforcement from an agency making initial determinations as to which employees it should seek to enjoin from striking,the parties will invariably be left to guess at the outcome that might be reached by a superior court judge acting at the last minute,having just heard of the case and considered the law and the issues for the first time that same day.assuming this is a problem,we fail to see how the perb review would solve it.
the decision regarding which employees should be covered by county sanitation public health and safety exception is very fact specific.every local agency has different sets of employees who serve different functions.for example,the county in this case was concerned with a possible sympathy strike by nurses.however,many local agencies do not employ nurses.because of the diversity of job classifications and functions carried out by local agencies,the need for consistent rulings is not compelling.nor are we troubled by the fact that the parties will have to rely on the judgment of the trial courts,as trial courts have been called upon to address the issues raised by county sanitation for over two decades.
fundamentally,whether or not an employee is deemed essential under county sanitation is not a labor law issue rather,it is a public safety issue.the inquiry does not implicate statewide labor policies,but rather turns on considerations of specific factors such as what tasks are performed by the employees,where the agency is located,and the size of the population served by the agency.these are factual determinations that must be made on a basis.for example,sanitation workers may be essential to public health and safety in areas with dense urban populations,but may not be so essential in sparsely populated rural areas.thus,the perb emphasis on the need for uniform statewide policy is not very compelling because the trial court decision will depend on the circumstances of each individual case.
in sum,we do not believe that san diego teachers and its progeny render county sanitation a nullity.none of the cases cited to by appellants address the precise issue addressed under county sanitation,namely,whether an otherwise lawful strike may be enjoined on the grounds that it presents a substantial and imminent threat to public health and safety.we acknowledge that strikes by essential public employees can potentially involve unfair labor practices,as,for example,where such strikes constitute a failure to negotiate in good faith.however,we see no evidence of allegations or conduct on the record before us suggesting that any party to this case had committed,or had threatened to commit,an unlawful labor practice.
c.the perb exclusive jurisdiction and the mmba 
there is no dispute that county sanitation was decided in,many years before the legislature gave the perb jurisdiction over the mmba.the perb argues that it is now solely responsible for determining whether a particular strike is protected or prohibited by the mmba.it relies heavily on coachella valley in arguing that the legislature has removed from the courts their initial jurisdiction over all issues arising under the mmba.
in coachella valley,the supreme court held that the statute of limitations period under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a did not apply to cases brought under the mmba because,in vesting the perb with exclusive jurisdiction,the legislature sought uniformity in the system of law for the regulation of public employment relations.coachella valley,supra,cal th,d.the court concluded that the period found in the eera and other public employment relations laws should be read to apply to the mmba,explaining that the legislature must have intended a coherent and harmonious system of public employment relations laws in which all unfair practice charges filed with the perb are subject to the same limitations period.coachella valley,supra,at,d.
taking coachella valley a step further,the perb claims that since san diego teachers,strikes involving the eera have consistently been held to be within the perb initial exclusive jurisdiction and,consistent with the supreme court desire for uniformity,public agency employers must now seek injunctive relief under county sanitation by going to the perb in the first instance.we believe appellants reading of coachella valley is overbroad.
the supreme court in el rancho noted that the perb has exclusive jurisdiction over strikes under the eera where those strikes can be characterized as unfair labor practices.under the rationale of coachella valley,it is reasonable to conclude that the perb now has jurisdiction over strikes under the mmba insofar as the strikes constitute unfair labor practices.the supreme court has never held,however,that all strikes implicate unfair labor practices.
moreover,we agree with the county that it,not the perb,has primary responsibility for issues affecting the health and safety of its citizens.a county may use its police powers to do whatever will promote the peace,comfort,convenience,and prosperity of its citizens,and these powers should not be lightly limited.citation.san diego county veterinary medical county of san diego th,d.counties are also required by statute to provide a suitable place for the detention of juvenile court wards welf,properly care for impounded animals,and provide support for indigent persons welf.
in sum,we believe the perb does not have initial exclusive jurisdiction over whether a strike by essential employees poses an imminent threat to public health and safety.neither the perb nor local one has articulated any unfair practice that is arguably implicated by the county complaint with respect to the employees the county sought to enjoin.in the absence of any indication that the employees the county was seeking to prevent from striking were committing an unfair practice,or that the county was committing an unfair practice by seeking the injunction,the mmba was not implicated and the perb had no jurisdiction over the complaint.
local one argues that the legislative history of senate bill giving the perb jurisdiction over the mmba shows that the legislature considered and rejected giving county sanitation special status.as evidence,it notes at one point during the drafting process,the legislation recognized county sanitation but that the reference was later deleted it argues that this deletion means that the perb is now empowered to apply existing judicial interpretations of the mmba,including but not limited to county sanitation.see,subd.a.
we are not persuaded that the legislature at any time intended to take away the authority of the courts to hear matters falling under county sanitation.appellants have not pointed us to any explanation as to why the county sanitation language was added initially,nor why it was later removed.in the absence of such an explanation,we decline to find that the legislature intended the result advocated by appellants.while appellants interpret this history to mean that the legislature abrogated county sanitation by implication,a reasonable argument can be made that the legislature intended the opposite result.in the absence of a clear legislative directive,we decline to conclude that county sanitation no longer has validity.
amicus california state council of service employees also argues that the perb,not the courts,has the authority to implement county sanitation because section,subdivision a,states that the mmba shall be interpreted and applied by the board in a manner consistent with and in accordance with judicial interpretations we question whether county sanitation is a judicial interpretation of the mmba,as it was decided under the common law.and even if county sanitation falls within section,subdivision a,it does not follow that by requiring the perb to follow judicial interpretations of the mmba the legislature simultaneously divested courts of the authority to follow their own judicial precedent.
the perb argues that section,subdivision a,gives it the exclusive authority to seek judicial intervention to prevent a strike that the perb determines to be unlawful under the mmba.however,as we have indicated,strikes by essential employees are not inherently unlawful under the mmba.rather,such strikes may be unlawful pursuant to the holding of county sanitation.absent an injunction,essential employees are free to strike in a manner consistent with the mmba.
the perb also claims that its regulation,section,tit,vests the final decision regarding injunctive relief with the board.that regulation provides upon receipt of the general counsel report,the board itself shall determine whether to seek injunctive relief.ibid.we interpret this regulation to apply to unfair labor practice charges brought under the mmba only.
as we do not believe that the mmba gives the perb initial exclusive jurisdiction over complaints brought pursuant to county sanitation,it is unnecessary for us to address appellants argument that the county was not excused under the exceptions to the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies from seeking redress through the perb.nor need we address the county argument that the perb injunction relief procedures are inadequate 
iv.did the trial court err in failing to follow labor code sections and 
local one claims that the trial court erred by issuing a labor injunction without complying with labor code section section.the county counters that section does not apply to injunctions sought under county sanitation.
labor code section et,took effect on january.labor code section,subdivision a,provides no court of this state shall have authority to issue a temporary or permanent injunction in any case involving or growing out of a labor dispute,except after hearing the testimony of witnesses in open court,with opportunity for,in support of the allegations of a complaint made under oath,and testimony in opposition thereto,if offered,and except after findings of fact by the court,of all of the following that unlawful acts have been threatened and will be committed unless restrained or have been committed and will be continued unless restrained,but no injunction or temporary restraining order shall be issued on account of any
