this case concerns the tremendous property damage caused by the terrorist attacks of september.just months before the attacks,in april,world trade center properties llc and affiliated companies wtcp obtained year leases for,and world trade center the main site buildings from the port authority of new york and new jersey port authority.a separate corporation,world trade company,held a lease for world trade center,which stood adjacent to the main site buildings.the terrorist attacks destroyed all five of the buildings collectively,the leased buildings,leaving wtcp and.plaintiffs saddled with significant losses.in march,plaintiffs brought suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york hellerstein,against a group of airlines and security contractors defendants seeking to recover for these losses.they alleged that,because the defendants were negligent in overseeing airport security systems,the terrorists were able to hijack american airlines flight and united airlines flight and to fly those planes into the twin towers.
after a series of summary judgment decisions and a limited bench trial,judge hellerstein,who has presided over these matters with exemplary care and thoughtfulness,entered judgment for defendants.the court decided that,if plaintiffs could prove liability,they would be entitled to compensation for the amount of value that their leasehold interests lost due to the attacks,but not for reconstruction costs or other claimed consequential damages related to the cost of retenanting the leased buildings,replacing tenant property,hiring attorneys,and paying mortgage carrying costs.the court then found that the value of wtcp leasehold interests declined by,at most,billion,while the value of interests fell by million.both plaintiffs,however,received insurance payments for their property damage that exceeded those figures and compensated plaintiffs for the same economic loss as the potential tort award.because new york civil practice law and rules cplr requires courts to reduce damage awards to reflect corresponding insurance payments,the district court concluded that,even if plaintiffs could prove liability,they could not receive a damages award,and that judgment for defendants was therefore appropriate.separately,the district court dismissed.claims against united airlines,and its parent company,united continental holdings,collectively,united,on the grounds that the airline had no connection to american airlines flight,which destroyed world trade center.
on appeal,we agree with the district court conclusion that plaintiffs are entitled to compensation only for the amount of value that their leasehold interests lost due to the terrorist attacks,that they can not recover their claimed consequential damages,and that,pursuant to cplr,their insurance recoveries correspond to,and offset,their potential tort award.we also agree that united had no duty to supervise the security checkpoints or detect the hijackers who boarded american airlines flight.
however,the district court erred in two respects.first,the court used an incorrect methodology when calculating the value by which plaintiffs leasehold interests declined.second,it wrongly decided that prejudgment interest accrues at the federal funds rate on the diminution in value of plaintiffs leasehold estates.instead,the court should have calculated prejudgment interest using new york statutory prejudgment interest rate,and assessed that interest based on the final damages award.we therefore vacate in part the district court entry of judgment for defendants insofar as it miscalculated the diminution in the value of plaintiffs leasehold interest and improperly assessed the prejudgment interest by using the federal funds rate and remand with instructions as to further proceedings.on remand,the district court should reexamine the diminution in value of plaintiffs leasehold interests in accordance with the guidance provided in this opinion and,if appropriate,calculate interest based on any resulting award after accounting for the offset of plaintiffs insurance recoveries using new york statutory prejudgment interest rate.
background 
factual.the world trade center leases 
in,new york and new jersey enacted legislation authorizing the port to construct an interurban railway between the two states and a facility of commerce to accommodate the exchange and buying,selling and transportation of commodities and other property in world trade and commerce.unconsol.law see stat.from that legislative command sprung the world trade center complex,which upon completion in consisted of a acre public site with a street level plaza,a street level and underground shopping mall,a transportation terminal for the new york new jersey path trains,a subway hub offering direct access to several new york city subway lines,and six office buildings,including the twin towers and the first hotel to open in downtown manhattan since.five of those buildings,and world trade center provided approximately million square feet of office space.in all,the complex reshaped the city skyline and the economy of lower manhattan.
after construction,the port authority acted as a landlord for the office space in,and world trade center,the main site buildings.during that time,it studied the possibility of transferring its role as landlord to a private entity and investigated comparisons of the world trade center with similar private sector operations.on january,the port authority went further,hiring morgan,cushman wakefield,and douglas elliman realty investors to test the market reaction to three specific options for maximizing the value of the world trade center to the port authority and to the people of the region selling the property,leasing the property,or relinquishing operational control of the property through an asset management agreement.those tests convinced the port authority to lease portions of the main site buildings to private operators.
the port authority began the leasing process by sending a worldwide request for interest and then asking of the responding companies for preliminary proposals.the requests generated eight submissions,which the port authority narrowed to a of four finalists boston properties,brookfield financial properties silverstein properties,later,wtcp and westfield america,and vornado realty trust.these entities were allowed to perform due diligence before submitting bids.
on february,the port authority entered into an exclusive negotiating period with vornado realty trust for a year lease on all of the main site buildings.the value to the port authority of vornado realty trust proposed net lease transaction,on a present value basis,was estimated by the port authority to be approximately billion.when the negotiations fell apart,the port authority turned to the bidder,wtcp.the parties signed an agreement to enter lease on april,and,on july,wtcp signed year leases for the main site buildings.
under the terms of those leases,wtcp obtained the right to manage and sublease approximately ten million square feet of office space,much of which was already occupied by tenants in exchange,it agreed to make an upfront payment of million and to pay three forms of rent basic rent,which increases gradually over the year lease term additional,fixed rent for the first years of the lease and a percentage of wtcp gross revenue from operating the premises.it also undertook obligations,the most significant of which was the promise that,in the event that the main site buildings were destroyed or damaged,wtcp would rebuild,restore,repair and replace them to the extent feasible,prudent and commercially reasonable.in addition,it promised to pay for maintenance,operational costs,and tax equivalents,and to purchase sizable insurance policies.wtcp announced the acquisition in a brochure to investors,identifying the present value of the overall purchase price to be billion.
unlike the main site buildings,world trade center was privately managed and operated even before its construction.in,the port authority hired.to design,erect,and equip an office building adjacent to the main site of the world trade center complex.completed the project,which came to be known as world trade center,in,at which point it signed a year lease with the port authority to manage the property.like wtcp.agreed to pay rent,tax equivalents,and operational expenses,to purchase insurance,and to rebuild,restore,repair and replace the building at its sole cost and expense in the event of its destruction.
the destruction of the leased buildings 
on the morning of september,mohamed atta,t he operational leader of the conspiracy,and an accomplice passed through airport security in portland,maine,and took flight to boston logan international airport.upon arriving at logan,they joined three and passed through a security checkpoint run by american airlines before boarding american airlines flight.five other terrorists began their attack in boston,entering the boarding area through a united airlines security checkpoint at logan airport and then boarding united airlines flight.the first group hijacked flight and crashed the plane into world trade center.soon after,the second group used flight to destroy world trade center.by the late afternoon,falling debris and fires had destroyed the other main site buildings and world trade center,and had damaged large portions of lower manhattan.
the september attacks were a financial catastrophe for plaintiffs.according to wtcp and,their leases required them to continue paying rent to the port authority notwithstanding the lack of income from tenants,and to reconstruct the leased buildings.plaintiffs also claim that the attacks forced them to bear additional expenses,including the cost of pursuing insurance claims,replacing tenant improvements,retenanting the buildings,and paying mortgage carrying costs.
to guard against these types of losses,wtcp and.had obtained extensive insurance policies on their leasehold interests,which insured them for damage caused by terrorist attacks.wtcp policy involved over two dozen insurers and insured the company for business interruption lost rental payments and the replacement costs of the buildings if damaged or destroyed,up to billion per covered occurrence.obtained a similar,but smaller,policy from industrial risk insurers iri,which covered business interruption losses and rebuilding costs up to million per covered occurrence.the replacement cost coverage was designed to protect plaintiffs against physical damage to their property and did not require that they actually repair or rebuild the leased buildings in order to receive insurance payments while the business interruption coverage was intended to indemnify plaintiffs for any loss of income that occurred while the leased buildings were damaged or destroyed.
both plaintiffs filed insurance claims shortly after the september attacks.wtcp submitted proofs of loss seeking billion from its insurers.these proofs of loss allocated roughly billion to replacement costs for the main site buildings and billion to business interruption losses.wtcp also identified damages other than destruction of real property and business interruption,but never quantified those claims.while three insurers paid their portion of the claims promptly,the rest argued that the september attacks were one occurrence under their policies,so wtcp recovery could not exceed billion wtcp sued the recalcitrant insurers in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,see sr int l bus.ins.world trade ctr,llc,cir,and the parties ultimately settled,with the insurers agreeing to pay wtcp approximately billion.the settlement involved a general release of all of wtcp claims against the insurers and did not allocate the settlement proceeds among wtcp claimed losses.
separately.submitted proofs of loss seeking billion from iri,with roughly billion allocated to replacement costs,million for business interruption,and million for personal property.like wtcp claims.submission exceeded its million policy limit,and iri initially balked at paying the entire claim.filed suit,and iri eventually agreed to pay approximately million in exchange for a general release of all claims.once again,the settlement did not allocate the proceeds of the payment between.claimed losses.
procedural history 
in,plaintiffs sued a group of airlines and airport security contractors in the district court,claiming that their negligent maintenance of airport security checkpoints in boston and portland allowed the terrorists to board and hijack the planes that destroyed the leased buildings.plaintiffs claims arise under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act of atsssa,stat.codified as amended at,which creates an exclusive federal cause of action for damages arising out of the hijacking and subsequent crashes of american airlines flights and,and united airlines flights and,on september.atsssa b.under the act,t he substantive law for decision in any such suit shall be derived from the law,including choice of law principles,of the state in which the crash occurred unless such law is inconsistent with or preempted by federal law.id.b.the parties agree that,in this case,the substantive law is derived from the law of new york.appellants br.at appellees br.at.
after extensive discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment on wtcp claims.they focused on damages,rather than the merits of the negligence claim,arguing that wtcp is entitled to compensation for the amount of value that their leasehold interests lost due to the attacks,and not for replacement costs or other consequential damages the diminution in the fair market value of the main site leases was billion the present value of the rent that wtcp agreed to pay for those leases and that,pursuant to cplr,any tort award wtcp could receive must be reduced by the amount of its insurance recovery.
wtcp countered that using the lost market value of its leasehold interests to calculate damages results in insufficient compensation,that the decline in the value of its leaseholds exceeded billion,and that cplr does not require an offset for its insurance recoveries.in support,it offered declarations from expert witnesses.sheldon gottlieb,an expert in real estate appraisal,testified that the market value of wtcp leaseholds does not reflect the immense public benefits that the world trade center complex provided.he added that,in any event,billion is simply the amount of rent that wtcp agreed to pay,which is not equivalent to the decline in the value of the wtcp leasehold interests because it ignores the profits wtcp expected to earn,the value of obligations that wtcp assumed,and the costs that wtcp was forced to bear,which resulted in the leases having a negative value after september.professor kerry vandell,an expert in real estate finance,echoed gottlieb opinion that billion is the amount of rent that wtcp agreed to pay,not the amount by which the value of its leasehold interest declined.vandell explained that ascertaining the correct change in value requires comparing the value of wtcp leasehold interests before and after the attacks.
on december,the district court granted defendants motion in part and denied it in part.the court noted that new york follows the lesser of two rule,under which a plaintiff whose property has been injured may recover the lesser of the diminution of the property market value or its replacement cost.it then concluded that the diminution in market value is the appropriate measure of compensation,rejecting the arguments that,because of the public purpose of the main site buildings and wtcp contractual obligation to rebuild,replacement costs are the proper measure of damages.the court,however,refused to conclude that the value of wtcp leasehold interest declined by billion.although wtcp agreed to pay that sum to obtain the leases in april,market values can fluctuate rapidly and the value of property privately owned and managed by an experienced real estate developer may enjoy a different market value than property owned and managed by a governmental bureaucracy.as a result,the court temporarily denied summary judgment to provide wtcp an opportunity to show that the value of the main site leases changed between april and september.the court also concluded that there was insufficient evidence to decide the cplr issue,and therefore denied summary judgment without prejudice.
in response to the summary judgment decision,wtcp submitted an additional declaration from professor vandell.in this declaration,vandell reiterated that the diminution in the value of wtcp leasehold should be calculated by measuring the difference between the fair market value of its interests immediately before and immediately after september.fair market value is the amount an investor or third party would be willing to pay for an assignment of the main site leases,and can be calculated by comparing the present value of the expected revenues and expenses associated with owning those leases.id.because expected costs can equal or exceed expected revenues,the value of a leasehold interest can be zero or negative.vandell then evaluated the diminution in market value of wtcp leasehold interest,concluding that the leasehold had a market value of billion immediately before the attacks and negative billion immediately afterwards.his calculations included wtcp expected profits from operating the main site buildings and the costs associated with reconstruction.in all,the diminution in market value added up to billion.
the district court considered these arguments and,on april,rejected them.the court characterized wtcp submission as an attempt to correct perceived errors in the original summary judgment decision and viewed the argument that the main site leases had negative value after the attacks as a new attempt to recover reconstruction costs.it therefore decided that any recovery by wtcp against defendants for the main site leases shall not exceed billion.several months later,on september,the district court also granted defendants summary judgment on wtcp claims for the cost of retenanting the main site buildings,replacing tenant improvements,and paying attorneys fees during the insurance litigation,thereby capping wtcp possible damages at billion.
the.litigation followed a similar path.first,united moved for summary judgment on the grounds that it was not responsible for the security checkpoints that the terrorists used before hijacking american airlines flight,which destroyed.the remaining defendants then filed a separate summary judgment motion,arguing that.can recover only the diminution in value of its leasehold interest and that,pursuant to cplr,its damages award must be reduced by the amount of its insurance recovery.
on november,the district court granted summary judgment to united,concluding that there was no evidence that it had a connection to flight or its hijackers,and therefore that it did not owe.a duty of care.the court resolved the second summary judgment motion in an order issued on december.as in wtcp case,the district court concluded that.is entitled to compensation for the amount of value that their leasehold interests lost due to the attacks,but not for reconstruction costs or other claimed consequential damages.for,that diminution in value was,at most,million,a figure that the district court drew from vandell assessment of the value of.leasehold interest also as in wtcp case,the district court rejected.claims to recover for the cost of retenanting the building,lost tenant improvements,attorneys fees incurred during litigation with iri,and mortgage carrying costs finally,the district court denied summary judgment to the defendants on the argument that.potential tort award must be reduced by its insurance recovery.
after establishing wtcp and.maximum recoverable damages,the district court chose to conduct a bench trial to determine whether,under cplr,any tort award plaintiffs receive would need to be reduced by the value of their insurance recoveries.over the course of a trial held in july,the district court heard testimony about the proper way to allocate the insurance recoveries between the different types of insurance claims plaintiffs submitted,and heard the opinions of two economists professor steven shavell for the plaintiffs and professor daniel fischel for the defendants about whether a potential tort award would compensate plaintiffs for the same type of losses that their insurance recoveries remedied.
in an order issued from the bench and then supplemented by a written opinion,the district court ruled for the defendants.it concluded that,after accounting for fees and insurance premiums,wtcp recovered billion from its insurers and.recovered million.these payments compensated plaintiffs for the cost of replacing the leased buildings and for business interruption,the cost of rental payments that failed to pay as a result of the buildings destruction.the court then determined that these categories of insurance recovery correspond completely to plaintiffs potential tort recoveries related to the lost value of their leaseholds,and that the insurance recoveries should be set off against such potential tort recoveries,reducing them to zero.accordingly,the district court entered judgment for defendants.
discussion 
on appeal,plaintiffs contend that the district court erred at each step in the series of orders that culminated in its decision to dismiss their claims.we review the district court grants of summary judgment and its legal conclusions de novo,construing all facts in favor of the nonmoving party.shakhnes berlin,cir.as for the bench trial,we review the district court findings of facts for clear error,and its conclusions of law de novo.carco group,maconachy,cir per curiam.
our analysis begins with the calculation of plaintiffs maximum recoverable damages.after a series of summary judgment decisions,the district court determined that,if wtcp and.could prove that defendants are liable for the destruction of the world trade center complex,the companies could recover,at most,billion and million,respectively.in arriving at this decision,the district court concluded that plaintiffs are entitled only to the amount of value that their leasehold interests lost due to the attacks,not reconstruction costs,and that plaintiffs can not recover for the costs associated with retenanting the leased buildings,lost tenant improvements,paying mortgage carrying costs,or hiring attorneys for the litigation against the insurers.we agree with these conclusions,and therefore affirm in substantial part the orders in which the district court announced them the district court,however,relied on an incorrect method of measuring the market value of leasehold estates.accordingly,we vacate the portions of the august,and december,orders establishing the diminution in value of plaintiffs leasehold interests,and remand to the district court to reassess these calculations in light of the guidance in this opinion.
reconstruction costs 
under new york law,which provides the substantive law governing plaintiffs atsssa claims,an award of damages to a person injured by the negligence of another is designed to restore the injured party,to the extent possible,to the position that would have been occupied had the wrong not occurred.mcdougald garber,n.when negligence results in the permanent destruction of real property,damages can place the wronged victim in the same position as it was prior to the wrongdoing,jur d damages,in one of two ways.one possibility is to award the plaintiff the difference between the value of the land before the injury and its value after the injury sometimes called the rule.jur d damages see also fisher qualico contracting.the other is to award the cost of restoration,scribner summers,cir per curiam,plus the reasonable worth of the property use while the plaintiff is deprived of the property,jur d damages.
while these two measures of damages the decline in market value and the cost of restoration compensate a plaintiff for the same injury,they can produce awards of different sizes.as a result,the new york court of appeals has instructed that,in general,the proper measure of damages for permanent injury to real property is the lesser of the decline in market value and the cost of restoration.jenkins etlinger,see also hartshorn chaddock.this lesser of two principle reflects the judgment that,in most cases,both measures of damages are capable of affording full compensation for lost property as the court of appeals put it,they are two sides of the same coin.fisher,at.quite simply,when property is damaged,the value of owning that property falls.the value can be returned to the owner by paying an amount of money equivalent to the loss in value or by providing funds to restore the property to its original state.see also dobbs,law of remedies at ed.the reason for using diminished value as a ceiling on repair costs is clear diminished value represents the full amount of economic loss of a landowner.allowing the plaintiff to recover the higher measure of damages,then,would force the defendant to bear a greater cost than is necessary to rectify the harm it caused.
in its december,and december,orders,the district court concluded that this lesser of two principle limits plaintiffs recoverable damages to the diminution in market value of their leasehold interests and prevents them from recovering reconstruction costs.we agree 
new york courts have applied the lesser of two principle across a broad spectrum of possessory interests,including fee simple interests in both residential and commercial property.see,fisher,at residential property hartshorn,at farm prashant enters.new york,dep t motel see also scribner,at family business and rental property.the compensatory principles that animate these decisions apply no differently in the context of leasehold interests like those of the plaintiffs in the leased buildings.a commercial lease entitles the lessee to use all or part of a property for a specified period of time,in exchange for rent and other consideration.this interest is distinct from the original fee simple interest and the lessor leased fee estate,and has its own market value namely,the amount that a buyer would be willing to pay for the right to assume the lessee rights and obligations.see great atl.pac.tea new york,appraisal,the appraisal of real estate ed.if a portion of the property covered by the leasehold interest is destroyed or damaged,the value of the leasehold interest falls because the bundle of rights to which the owner of that interest is entitled becomes less valuable.see,james maccrate,the valuation of leasehold interests,real estate appraisal and valuation issues june,https jeffrey fisher robert martin,income property appraisal.an award can therefore place the lessee in the same position as it was prior to the wrongdoing,jur d damages,either by providing the monetary equivalent of the lost value or by presenting the plaintiff with sufficient funds to repair the damages and weather the reconstruction period,thereby restoring the original value of the rights under the lease.great atl.pac.tea,at the damages to which a lessee is entitled are generally the value of the leasehold.
of course,leasehold interests involve a different set of rights and obligations than fee simple ownership.but these are differences of degree,not of kind.for instance,a lessee,unlike a fee simple owner,often has an obligation to pay rent that continues even after the property covered by the lease is destroyed.in fact,both wtcp and.leases contain such a covenant.this continuing obligation,however,means only that the value of the leasehold interest after the destructive event must take into account the lessee obligation to make future rental payments.professor vandell,plaintiffs expert on damages,agrees,and attributes a negative market value to plaintiffs leases after the attacks to account for the obligation to pay rent.this method of calculating diminution in market value differs from the calculation that a court would perform in the context of fee simple ownership,but that does not alter the principle that diminution in value,properly ascertained,can adequately compensate a commercial lessee.
wtcp and.counter that their leases also differ from fee simple ownership because they are obligated to reconstruct the leased buildings that obligation does not,however,entitle them to the reconstruction cost measure of damages.although property owners are often not legally obligated to reconstruct damaged property,economic circumstances often force them to do so w hen a home is condemned,for example,its owner must find another place to live.united states acres of land.nonetheless,new york courts have not considered a plaintiff decision to repair property,standing alone,to be a sufficient justification for awarding replacement costs that exceed diminution in market value.see,fisher,at limiting plaintiffs recovery to diminution in market value notwithstanding fact that plaintiff had already rebuilt property application of city of,dep t noting that,in the takings context,replacing condemned property is not sufficient to justify compensation in excess of market value.compensatory damages,after all,serve to make good,so far as it is possible to do so in dollars and cents,the harm done by a wrongdoer,which is,at most,what the plaintiff lost,not what the plaintiff later purchased,even if they were required to do so.lopez adams,dep t see dobbs,supra at.replacing a property may cost more than the value,but the new property itself will be more valuable and last longer.acres of land,at quoting united states acres of land,white,concurring.
plaintiffs covenants to rebuild the leased buildings,then,may require them to devote funds to reconstruction,but do not alter the measure of their potential tort recoveries.just as a landowner may have a strong economic interest in rebuilding property,a lessor and lessee may wish to ensure that the leased property is rebuilt in the event of destruction.covenants to repair accomplish that goal by allocating the risk of loss between the two parties.they do not,however,magnify the value of the damage from the property destruction or put the party who has assumed the obligation to rebuild in any worse position than a landowner who,for economic reasons,is forced to rebuild in the absence of a contract.as a result,wtcp and,and similarly situated lessees,should not receive a higher measure of damages than the landowner could have recovered without the contract simply because dividing the interest in land required agreeing,in advance,on how to handle possible damage to the property.acres of land,at concluding that,in the context of just compensation,a plaintiff legal obligation to replace a condemned facility does not justify a different measure of damages than a party without such an obligation would receive.to hold otherwise would be inconsistent with new york courts reluctance to consider landowners decisions to rebuild when selecting the measure of damages,see fisher,at,and the general principle that,when property is destroyed or condemned,a lessee is entitled to no more for that loss than the unencumbered value of the fee interest,see great atl.pac.tea,at.
as an alternative,wtcp and.argue that,in this particular case,diminution of value is an inadequate measure of damages because it does not account for the property unique public benefit namely,the promotion of economic development in lower manhattan and northern new jersey or its iconic status.appellants br.at.in support,they rely on the testimony of their expert witnesses,and contend that a jury should have considered their entitlement to replacement costs.jenkins,at requiring defendant to prove that the lesser measure of damages will sufficiently compensate for the loss.
we find these arguments unpersuasive.we recognize that,in the context of just compensation for takings,new york courts have noted that,although ordinarily the fair equivalent of the actual loss sustained by a property owner is the property market value,some property is of a kind seldom traded,such that it lacks a market price and therefore must be compensated for according to its replacement cost.matter of rochester urban renewal agency.but this class of specialty property is narrow reproduction cost should be utilized only in those limited instances in which no other method of valuation will yield a legally and economically realistic value for the property.great atl.pac.tea kiernan.accordingly,new york courts have awarded replacement costs only when the property at issue is specially built for a specific purpose and a special use,there is no market for the type of property and no sales of property for such use,and the property use is economically feasible and reasonably expected to be replaced.application of city of,at quoting matter of cnty.of nassau,dep t see matter of saratoga harness racing williams.churches,hospitals,clubhouses and like structures commonly fall within this category because the building may be regarded by the organization that owns and utilizes it as worth everything it cost to construct and more,yet it may not be marketable because no similar group would have sufficient need for the property to be willing to purchase it.rochester urban renewal agency,at.
in light of this standard,there is no genuine dispute of material fact about whether diminution in market value is an adequate measure of damages.at the start.has presented no evidence that world trade center is sufficiently unique,or served such a significant public purpose,to warrant a recovery in excess of lost market value.in fact,professor kerry vandell,the only expert to submit a report about the property,calculated the change in market value to.leasehold interest by comparing the expected income streams before and after the september attacks.
as for wtcp,defendants submissions conclusively establish that the company interest in the main site buildings was not specialty property for which reproduction cost is the only appropriate measure of damages.wtcp property interest consists of year leases to five commercial office buildings,with the reversionary interest held by the port authority.far from there being no market for this type of property,saratoga harness racing,at,wtcp procured its leasehold interests through what charles gargano from the port authority called a worldwide competitive bidding process.michael levy,from wtcp,agreed that the bidding was extensive and competitive because the buildings were trophy properties.j.after obtaining the leases,moreover,wtcp operated its leased buildings as a landlord,subleasing portions of the property to commercial tenants.this was not a special use.application of city of,at see also heidorf town of northumberland,distinguishing between a building historic status and the uniqueness of the use to which it is put.quite to the contrary,wtcp leases required the company to operate and maintain the properties as office building s in a manner generally consistent with other office buildings located within the borough of manhattan,and included a list of comparable buildings in the area.
nor is wtcp claim for replacement costs supported by the world trade center complex public purpose.wtcp experts attest to the public purpose that the world trade center complex serves,noting that it reinvigorated the economic life of lower manhattan and northern new jersey.but wtcp did not lease the entire world trade center complex its leasehold interest encompassed only the office space in the main site buildings.as sheldon gottlieb,wtcp appraisal expert,explained t he port authority never leased the,public purpose,and public benefit part of the properties or their operation to wtcp.more fundamentally,in evaluating just compensation,the supreme court has refused to compensate private plaintiffs for the community value of their properties.see acres of land,at.the court rationale readily applies in the context of tort damages.the community benefit a property confers might provide an indication of the public loss,but compensatory damages seek to ensure that the owner of the property is made whole.id.wtcp did not hold its leasehold interests as the public trustee and thus is not entitled to be indemnified for the public loss.see unconsol.law entrusting the port authority with undertaking t he effectuation of the world trade center 
critically,our conclusion that wtcp and.are not entitled to replacement costs by no means minimizes the importance of the world trade center complex to new york and new jersey or the country interest in seeing the site rebuilt.compensatory damages are not designed,and courts adjudicating civil claims are not well suited,to heal a region and a nation wounds.rather,we simply conclude,agreeing with the district court,that plaintiffs leases for the office space at,and world trade center can be valued according to market metrics,and that plaintiffs can therefore be compensated by the diminution in the market value of those leasehold interests.plaintiffs assuming liability is established are entitled to compensation for the amount of value that their leasehold interests lost due to the attacks,but not to reconstruction costs.
consequential damages 
in addition to reconstruction costs,wtcp and.also seek consequential damages.specifically,plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to recover for the cost of retenanting the leased buildings,hiring attorneys during litigation with their insurers,paying mortgage carrying costs,and losing tenant improvements.the district court denied these claims for consequential damages in orders issued on september,and december.we agree,and address each decision in turn.
the decision to deny damages for retenanting costs and lost tenant improvements flows naturally from the conclusion that diminution in market value,rather than replacement cost,is the correct measure of damages.before the terrorist attacks,the leased buildings were fully tenanted.the difference in value of plaintiffs leasehold interest before and after september,then,includes the loss of those tenants and any improvements they made to the premises.put differently,the measure of damages already compensates plaintiffs for the fact that they lost tenanted buildings complete with tenant improvements.viewed in this light,plaintiffs claims for the cost of retenanting the leased buildings and replacing tenant improvements are nothing more than attempts to recover the cost of restoring the leased buildings to the state in which they existed before the attack the reconstruction cost measure of damages for these elements of the leasehold interests.awarding these costs would therefore compensate plaintiffs a second time for the same loss.see fisher,at noting that replacement cost and diminution in market value are simply two sides of the same coin.such a double recovery would be wholly inappropriate under compensatory damages principles.dobbs,supra,at it would not be appropriate to award both replacement costs and diminished value of the land,since each of these measures of damage is an attempt to compensate for the same loss.
the other consequential damages claims for mortgage carrying costs and attorneys fees fail on causation grounds.regarding the former,wtcp and.undertook the obligation to pay mortgage carrying costs before the september attacks defendants alleged negligence neither caused plaintiffs to bear those expenses,nor increased the price.see jur d torts.as to the latter,new york courts allow plaintiffs to recover the reasonable value of attorneys fees and other expenses when,through the wrongful act of his present adversary,the plaintiff was involved in earlier litigation with a third person in bringing or defending an action to protect his interests.coopers lybrand levitt,dep t.such expenses,however,must be the natural and necessary consequences of the defendant acts,such as when an attorney malpractice exposes the client to liability,see cent.trust goldman,dep t.defendants alleged negligence lacks this requisite connection.even assuming,arguendo,that defendants could have reasonably foreseen that their failure to adequately monitor airport security checkpoints could lead to a hijacking and that the hijackers would use the planes to destroy buildings,plaintiffs attorneys fees would still not have been the natural and necessary consequence of defendants negligence.that causal chain requires three further steps first,plaintiffs filing insurance claims second,the insurers refusing to pay and third,plaintiffs filing suit.this series of events is too attenuated to support a claim for attorneys fees.see martinez lazaroff,concluding,as a matter of law,that defendant was not a proximate or legal cause of the injuries suffered because the causal connection was attenuated see also apollo steel melco cranes,dep t.the district court was therefore correct to deny plaintiffs claims for consequential damages and to limit their recovery to the diminution in value of their leasehold interests.
calculation of diminution in market value 
having concluded that plaintiffs compensable damages are limited to the diminution in the market value of their leasehold interests,we turn now to the issue of calculating that change in value.in summary judgment decisions issued on august,and december,the district court decided that the diminution in the value of wtcp and.leasehold interests was,at most,billion and million,respectively.the first figure derives from the present value of the rental payments that wtcp promised to make over the year lifetime of its leases,and the second is culled from professor vandell evaluation of the value of.leasehold interest.we conclude that this process for calculating damages misapprehends valuation in the context of leasehold interests.accordingly,we remand so that the district court can reassess plaintiffs maximum possible recoveries.
as the district court recognized,an asset market value is the price at which it would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller,neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts.united states cartwright,see also appraisal of real estate,supra,at.the diminution of an asset value,then,is calculated by comparing the market value of the asset before and after a particular event.but critically,although the terrorist attacks destroyed the leased buildings,the relevant assets being valued in this case are plaintiffs leasehold interests.in short,when the port authority issued leases to wtcp and,it split the interests in the leased buildings into a leased fee estate,which the port authority retained,and leasehold estate s held by plaintiffs.see william brueggeman jeffrey fisher,real estate finance and investments ed.each estate is a distinct asset with its own market value,and it is the diminution in the value of that estate that is the measure of the owner loss.see see also great atl.pac.tea,at.
the market value of a leasehold estate is the price at which the lease rather than the physical property in the estate would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller in a competitive market.put differently,a leasehold interest is worth what a buyer in a competitive market would be willing to pay in order to assume both the rights and the obligations associated with the lease.this value can be measured in at least two ways through a sales comparison approach,which involves comparing properties similar to the subject property,appraisal of real estate,supra,at,or an income capitalization approach,which requires analyzing expected costs and revenues from the property to generate an assessment of future income,and capitaliz ing the income into an indication of present value,id.at see also id.at realty bd.of assessors,dep t discussing both methods of valuation in the context of property.notably,because a leasehold interest entails expenditures such as the obligation to pay rent,it can have either a positive or a negative market value.
an example using,for simplicity sake,the sales comparison approach illustrates the point suppose a lessee rents a building for,and the market rate for renting a comparable property is.in such a scenario,the lessee interest has a positive market value because a buyer should be willing to pay up to to assume the lease.see james maccrate,the valuation of leasehold interests,real estate appraisal and valuation issues june.a positive leasehold is created when the market rent is greater than the contract rent.now suppose the market rental rate for comparable spaces was or,more relevantly for this case,that the lessee property suffered damage that made it comparable to spaces renting for.under those circumstances,no buyer would be willing to pay to assume the lease when she could rent a comparable property for.instead,the lessee would need to pay buyers to entice them to assume the lease obligations,thus leading to a negative market value for the leasehold interest.see appraisal of real estate,supra,at.
as plaintiffs experts explained,the district court evaluation of the leasehold interests did not follow traditional principles of valuation and incorrectly assumed that a leasehold interest can not have negative value.determining the diminution in value of plaintiffs leasehold estates requires calculating the difference between the pre and market values of those interests.for wtcp,the district court concluded that the value of the leasehold interest was billion and that the value was.neither figure is correct.opposing summary judgment,wtcp expert sheldon gottlieb explained that billion reflects only the net present value of rental payments that wtcp committed to make to the port authority,and not the value of the leasehold interest.we agree.wtcp rental payments created the leasehold interest,but do not necessarily reflect the amount that a buyer in the open market would have paid to assume wtcp rights and obligations under the leases the relevant inquiry when assessing the market value of a leasehold estate.similarly,is an incorrect valuation.although wtcp could expect to receive in rent from the destroyed buildings,that figure fails to account for the company obligation to,at a minimum,continue paying rent.thus,as gottlieb explained in opposition to summary judgment and vandell reiterated,wtcp leasehold interests had a negative value after the attacks,and the calculation must incorporate that negative market value.see gottlieb noting that the leasehold interest had a negative value after the attacks vandell discussing negative fair market value.
the district court took a different approach when evaluating damages for.plaintiffs expert,professor vandell,assessed the value of.leasehold interest using the income capitalization approach and determined that,immediately before september,it was worth million.the district court adopted this figure as the market value.but rather than assessing the value under a similar approach,the court again declared the leasehold value to be,leading to total losses of million.again,reflects the rent that.could expect to receive for its destroyed building,but misstates the value of the leasehold interest because,at a minimum,it fails to account for the continued obligation to pay rent.
thus,for both wtcp and,the district court calculated the decline in value of their leasehold interests in a manner that is inconsistent with the established practice for valuing leasehold estates.because this error potentially led to incorrect calculations,we remand for the district court to reassess plaintiffs maximum recoverable damages.
nonetheless,our conclusion that the district court incorrectly assessed the diminution in value of plaintiffs leasehold interests should not be confused with an endorsement of plaintiffs damages claims nor taken to mean that plaintiffs are necessarily entitled to a trial on damages or to a damages recovery.as to the flaws in plaintiffs appraisal of damages,the district court was correct to observe that both wtcp and.ignored its denial of reconstruction costs in their calculations.in his reports on damages,professor vandell calculated the pre and values of plaintiffs leasehold interests by estimating the expected income and expenses associated with those interests in other words,by using the income capitalization approach.as plaintiffs acknowledge in their brief on appeal,professor vandell assessments include,as part of the valuations,reconstruction costs,tenant improvement allowances,leasing commissions,and projected capital expenditures all of which are costs associated with replacing the leased buildings.see appellants br.at.to be consistent with the denial of reconstruction costs,the leasehold value should reflect only those continuing obligations that are unrelated to reconstruction,such as rental payments.in other words,the valuation should operate under the hypothetical that the leased buildings were not rebuilt 
it is also significant that wtcp signed its lease agreements shortly before the terrorist attacks.the district court was correct to observe that market value often reflects expected profits.indeed,both this court and new york courts agree that m arket value damages are based on future profits as estimated by potential buyers who form the market,and reflect the buyer discount for the fact that the profits would be postponed and uncertain.schonfeld hilliard,cir quoting dobbs,supra,see sandoro harlem genesee mkt.nursery,dep t.when there is a recent sale price for the subject asset,negotiated by parties at arm length,that price may be the best evidence of the asset market value,taking into account expected profits.schonfeld,at internal quotation marks omitted see grant srogi.
as a result,wtcp is incorrect to state that it was entitled to a reasonable rate of return above the rent it agreed to pay.appellants br.at.purchasing a commercial leasehold interest,like any other business venture,entails risk.the fact that wtcp agreed to pay billion in rent just months before the attack may be evidence that the value of its leasehold interest was.that is,if wtcp was the highest bidder in a competitive market for the leased buildings,no other buyer would have been willing to pay wtcp to assume the leasehold interest.see schonfeld,at f air market value represents the amount an investor would be willing to pay for an assignment of the net leases.on the other hand,wtcp contends that the value of its leasehold interest was billion,relying in part on increases in market rents and net operating income levels that were reasonably expected when management of the space was transferred to an experienced manager such as wtcp.the district court recognized that the market value of the leaseholds may have changed between april,when wtcp acquired the main site leases,and september,immediately prior to the destruction of the properties,and it provided wtcp an opportunity to raise a material issue of fact as to whether this had occurred.we leave it to the district court to decide,in the first instance,whether there is a genuine dispute of material fact about whether wtcp leasehold interests had positive value,using the principles outlined here.but it is emphatically not the case that plaintiffs are entitled to damages that reflect a guaranteed profit on their leases.
in sum,our decision is a narrow one.we agree with the district court decision that plaintiffs can recover only for the diminution in the value of their leasehold interests,and are not entitled to reconstruction costs or the claimed consequential damages.nonetheless,we conclude that,as plaintiffs experts opined in their reports,the district court evaluation of wtcp and.losses departed from established methods of valuing leasehold estates.accordingly,we remand as to the august,and december,orders establishing the diminution in value of plaintiffs leasehold interests.on remand,the district court should reassess the diminution in value of those leasehold estates by considering their pre and market values,with the values measured as if the leased buildings were not reconstructed.the district court is free to decide,in the first instance,whether additional discovery is needed before another set of summary judgment motions or a trial on the issue of damages 
collateral offset 
because we agree with the district court that wtcp and.can recover only for the diminution in value of their leasehold interests,we must address the second pillar of the decision below the conclusion that plaintiffs insurance recoveries should reduce the amount of their potential tort award.in most jurisdictions,the damages recoverable for a wrong are not diminished by the fact that the party injured has been wholly or partly indemnified for his loss by insurance.healy rennert.but new york has chosen to override this collateral source rule by statute.see oden chemung cnty.indus.dev.agency.pursuant to cplr,if a court finds that any cost or expense from an injury to property will be,or has been,replaced or indemnified from any collateral source,such as insurance,the court shall reduce the amount of the award for that injury by an amount equal to the collateral reimbursement.id.c.this provision is designed to assure that plaintiffs do not receive duplicative recoveries for the same type of loss.fisher,at.as a result,a defendant must show,by clear and convincing evidence,that the collateral source payment represents reimbursement for a particular category of loss that corresponds to a category of loss for which damages were awarded.oden,at see also johnson transit,dep t.
here,the district court conducted a bench trial to identify the specific losses for which plaintiffs insurance proceeds reimbursed them,and to determine whether those reimbursements correspond to the same category of loss as their potential tort recovery.after five days of testimony,on august,the court found that nearly all of wtcp and.insurance proceeds reimbursed them for the costs of reconstructing the leased buildings and for business interruption,lost revenue while the buildings were being rebuilt.it then concluded that both these insurance proceeds and the potential tort awards for lost leasehold value provide reimbursement for the same category of loss,and therefore reduced the potential tort awards by the value of the insurance recoveries we conclude that the district court did not err,much less clearly err,in allocating plaintiffs insurance recoveries to replacement costs and business interruption losses,and agree with its conclusion that these reimbursements correspond to the same loss as the potential tort award.
we begin,however,on a procedural note.no doubt due to the large size of the insurance recoveries,the district court opted to conduct a bench trial on the collateral offset issue before a trial on liability and damages.decisions to bifurcate trials,like this one,are authorized by federal rule of civil procedure b and are typically well within the discretion of district courts.see amato city of saratoga springs,cir.but plaintiffs contend that the timing of the collateral offset trial was inappropriate in this case because cplr makes clear that a correspondence hearing should not occur until after the jury has reached a verdict on liability and damages.appellants br.at.
plaintiffs argument misapprehends the role of new york law under the atsssa.the atsssa creates a federal cause of action for damages arising out of the september,attacks,and incorporates state law as the substantive law for decision in any such suit.atsssa emphasis added.federal law controls procedure,and the order in which issues are decided is quintessentially procedural it governs only the manner and the means by which the litigants rights are enforced,not the rules of decision by which the court will adjudicate those rights.shady grove orthopedic assocs.allstate ins,internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.of course,there may be situations in which deciding the collateral offset issue before a damages trial is impossible,particularly if there are multiple types of loss for which the jury could compensate the plaintiff.see shue red creek cent.sch,dep t reversing a collateral offset decision because the jury had not allocated damages to the different losses.but this is not such a case.here,the district court could predict,with complete certainty,the element of loss for which a jury would award damage because wtcp and.can recover only for the diminution in the market value of their leasehold interests.see oden,at the problem of matching up a collateral source to an item of loss is simply a matter of proof and factual analysis.the district court therefore had a firm legal basis for trying the collateral offset issue first,and did not abuse its discretion in doing so.
turning to the substance of the district court decision,plaintiffs raise two primary challenges.first,they argue that it was error to allocate their insurance recoveries to replacement costs and business interruption losses.second,they contend that,even if it was possible to allocate their collateral recoveries to replacement costs and business interruption losses,those reimbursements do not correspond to the potential tort recovery for the lost market value of their leasehold interests.neither argument is persuasive.
the district court did not err by allocating the insurance recoveries to replacement costs and business interruption.the court found,and plaintiffs experts agreed,that wtcp and.obtained two categories of insurance coverage replacement cost coverage,which covers damages to the buildings,tenant improvements,personal property,and equipment,and business interruption coverage,which reimburses for loss of revenues or rental values from the date of the loss until the buildings are restored.see.the district court also found that,when wtcp and.submitted proofs of loss after the terrorist attacks,those submissions attached a dollar value only to the costs of replacing the leased buildings and to business interruption losses.plaintiffs concede this point as well,admitting that these losses,by themselves,exceeded the value of the insurance policies.appellants br.at.
nonetheless,plaintiffs contend that,because they received their insurance reimbursements in the form of global settlement s reached after litigation with the insurers,appellants br.at,the district court should not have allocated their insurance proceeds to replacement costs and business interruption losses.in particular,they note that the settlements released all claims against insurers,which they contend could include the value of extracontractual claims for bad faith that they raised during the litigation.appellants br.at.the district court rejected this argument,and the record supports that decision.defendants insurance expert,michael beach,explained that settlements are common in the insurance industry even when disputes do not go to litigation,and that settlements typically contain a general release to ensure that there will be no further claims paid in relation to the insurance event.to determine what the settlement paid the insured for,one needs to rely upon the underlying documents submitted,which did not,in his opinion,suggest that the insurers paid on anything other than the replacement cost and business interruption claims.id.indeed,plaintiffs own insurance expert also did not allocate any money to claims when evaluating wtcp and.insurance recoveries,and the district court found that t he recovery against nearly every insurer was at,or near,the policy limits.on these facts,it was not error to allocate plaintiffs insurance proceeds to the only two categories of coverage they obtained replacement cost coverage and business interruption coverage 
plaintiffs second argument that replacement costs and business interruption losses do not correspond to the same category of loss as the diminution in the market value of plaintiffs leasehold interests fares no better.our analysis begins,and in large part ends,with the new york court of appeals decision in fisher qualico contracting,at.in that case,the defendant negligently destroyed the plaintiffs residence in a construction accident.the plaintiffs received insurance payments to cover the actual necessary cost of replacing the home and,after a lawsuit,won damages equivalent to the market value diminution of their property.id.at.before entering judgment,however,the trial court offset the insurance recoveries against the tort award.the court of appeals affirmed.characterizing the harm that the plaintiffs suffered as real property losses,the court noted that such losses may be measured by the lesser of the cost of restoring the land to its former condition or the diminution in the market value of the whole property.id.at.it then rejected the argument that cost of restoration and diminution in market value represent two different categories of loss,explaining that these are simply two sides of the same coin e ach is a proper way to measure lost property value,the lower of the two figures affording full compensation to the owner.id.at.thus,because both measures of damages correspond to the property loss,they can and should be offset against one another.id.
the district court concluded that the logic of fisher applies in this case,and that plaintiffs insurance proceeds and potential tort recovery both compensate for the same loss.we agree.at trial,defendants expert,professor daniel fischel,explained that,as in fisher,the relevant category of loss in this case is the loss relating to destruction of property.both diminution in market value the potential tort recovery and the combination of replacement costs and business interruption compensation the insurance recovery reimburse plaintiffs for this same type of injury.
the market value of properties like wtcp and.leasehold interests,according to fischel,is the present value of the profits that a buyer expects to get from those asset s.when the property is damaged or destroyed,the property owner loses all,or some,of those expected profits.and because the property market value simply reflects the present value of expected profits,the property value falls accordingly.thus,an award measured by the diminution in the property market value compensates for the damage to the property by replacing the present value of the lost profit stream.
the combination of replacement cost and business interruption compensation accomplish this same goal of replacing the property owner lost profits.replacement costs allow plaintiffs to repair the leased buildings,thereby restoring the revenue stream from those properties.business interruption compensation then fills the gap in time between the date of the destruction of the property and the time that the property is rebuilt,by substituting for the rental income lost during the rebuilding period.see scribner,at noting that replacement costs include the reduction of the rental or usable value of the property during the pendency of the injury internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,replacement costs restore plaintiffs income stream as a result of the building s being completed,and business interruption coverage compensates for their loss of revenues from the date of the loss until those buildings were restored,combining to produce a recovery that has precisely the same effect as an award based on the diminution in the leasehold value.thus,although replacement cost and business interruption cost may be distinct categories when it comes to insurance coverage,they nonetheless rectify the same category of loss when it comes to tort recovery namely,loss from the destruction of property see fisher,at.
to summarize,we agree with the district court decision to allocate plaintiffs insurance recoveries to replacement costs and business interruption losses,and with its conclusion that those insurance reimbursements correspond to the same category of loss as plaintiffs potential tort recoveries.it was therefore necessary,under cplr,to reduce plaintiffs tort damages by the amount of their insurance recoveries.nonetheless,because we set aside the district court orders calculating wtcp and.maximum recoverable damages,we must also vacate the portion of the august,order that reduces those damages to zero and enters judgment for defendants.the district court should return to the offset issue after reassessing the extent to which the value of plaintiffs leasehold interests declined due to the attacks 
prejudgment interest 
plaintiffs last argument regarding damages focuses on the award of prejudgment interest.in actions for property damage,new york law provides that prejudgment i nterest shall be recovered upon the sum awarded,cplr 
at a rate of per annum,id.these provisions impose an affirmative mandate on trial courts,and leave no discretion not to award prejudgment interest under new york law.gussack realty xerox,cir per curiam.pursuant to federal law,by contrast,congress has enacted a statute governing the award of postjudgment interest,but there is no comparable legislation regarding prejudgment interest.city of milwaukee cement,gypsum.the issue of prejudgment interest is therefore governed by traditional principles and is typically left to the discretion of district courts.see also sec contorinis,cir.on appeal,wtcp and.contend that the district court erred by crafting an interest award under federal principles rather than applying new york statutory rate.
we conclude that,under the atsssa,new york law determines the rate at which prejudgment interest accrues.as discussed earlier,the atsssa creates a federal cause of action for damages and directs that t he substantive law for decision in any such suit shall be derived from the law of the state in which the injury occurred in this case,new york.atsssa b.this command to look to new york law includes the state law of damages,see virgilio city of new york,cir,and we have long held that t he awarding of prejudgment interest is considered part of new york substantive law,schwimmer allstate ins,cir.accordingly,it is the new york statutes,and not federal principles,that determine prejudgment interest awards under the atsssa.
defendants respond that state substantive law does not apply under the atsssa when such law is inconsistent with or preempted by federal law.atsssa b.but new york prejudgment interest statutes create no such inconsistency.federal prejudgment interest law is a matter of judicial discretion and,like other federal common law doctrines,must give way when a congressional statute dictates a particular measure of damages.see motors devex,concluding that reference to interest in statute overrode longstanding common law doctrine of prejudgment interest.defendants,too,rely on this principle otherwise they could not argue that cplr replaces the federal common law rule against reducing damages by the amount of collateral recoveries.see appellants br.at see also blake hudson ry,cir.moreover,when congress has adopted state substantive law in other federal statutes and did not wish to make state prejudgment interest available,it has explicitly said so.see united states kwai fun wong,noting that,under the federal tort claims act,congress explicitly prevented recovery of prejudgment interest.the atsssa contains no such limitation.
nor does state prejudgment interest conflict with the purpose of the atsssa.as we explained in in re september property damage litigation,cir,congress enacted the atsssa in part to preserve the continued viability of the united states air transportation system from potentially ruinous tort liability.id.at.it accomplished this goal by capping the extent of the airlines liability,not by limiting plaintiffs tort recoveries.id.at concluding that the atsssa did not create a limited fund for recovery or restrict the manner in which plaintiffs could settle claims.we therefore agree with wtcp and.that new york prejudgment interest statutes,and not federal common law,governs the rate of their prejudgment interest award.
this decision does not,however,end our analysis of prejudgment interest.as defendants observe,awarding interest also requires determining the base amount from which that interest is calculated.on that issue,we conclude that the district court should calculate interest on the final tort award,and not the diminution in the value of plaintiffs leasehold interests in other words,the district court should perform the insurance setoff before calculating the prejudgment interest.cplr requires that interest be recovered upon a sum awarded.see mfr.traders trust reliance ins.as the court of appeals has explained,this recovery is intended to indemnify successful plaintiffs for the nonpayment of what is due to them,and is not meant to punish defendants for delaying the final resolution of the litigation.love state,emphasis added internal citation and quotation marks omitted.cplr plays an important role in determining what amount a plaintiff is due by requiring courts to reduce the amount of the award to reflect collateral setoffs.plaintiffs do not receive,nor were they ever entitled,to the amount before the setoff.see cplr requiring setoff even when the collateral reimbursement has not yet been made.it therefore makes little sense to have defendants indemnify plaintiffs by way of prejudgment interest payments for an amount that defendants never owed.
accordingly,the district court erred at the september,hearing in setting the prejudgment interest rate and in its august,order calculating interest based on the diminution in value of plaintiffs leasehold interests.on remand,we direct the district court to calculate prejudgment interest on the amount of the final award using the new york statutory rate.in other words,the district court should reassess the lost value of plaintiffs leasehold estates,reduce that amount by the collateral setoff,and only then calculate prejudgment interest based on the resulting award if any at the new york rate,running from the date of the attacks.
united duty as to flight 
finally,the district court dismissed.claims against united continental holdings,and united airlines,collectively,united,after concluding that united had no connection to flight or its hijackers,and therefore did not owe a duty of care.we agree with the district court decision on this score,and therefore affirm its dismissal of.claims against united.
on the morning of september,two terrorists entered portland international jetport pwm in portland,maine,with plans to take flight to boston.they received tickets at the airways counter and then passed through pwm security checkpoint before boarding the plane.because pwm had only one such checkpoint,the airlines flying out of the terminal including united had signed a shared responsibility agreement,under which delta air lines assumed responsibility for the overall operation of the passenger security screening checkpoint,including the training of employees and conducting of employee background checks.this agreement was united only connection to flight.
after arriving at boston logan airport,the hijackers obtained boarding passes for american airlines flight at the american airlines desk in terminal a.they then entered a second security screening checkpoint this one operated by globe aviation services under a contract with american airlines before boarding flight.three other hijackers arrived at logan airport by car and followed the same route to the plane.united gates and security checkpoints were located in a different terminal than those of american airlines,and united had no responsibility for ticketing or security along the terrorists route to flight.once on board the flight,the terrorists hijacked the plane and crashed it into world trade center.as world trade center collapsed,it spewed debris,some of which pierced the façade of world trade center,causing fires and,eventually,the building collapse.s.
on these facts,the district court correctly concluded that united had no connection to flight or its hijackers and therefore owed no duty to.under new york law,the scope of a tortfeasor duty is,in the first instance,a legal issue for the court to resolve.waters hous.this analysis is fundamentally about apportioning risks and allocating the burden of loss,and it is the responsibility of courts to limit the legal consequences of wrongs to a controllable degree and to protect against crushing exposure to liability,strauss belle realty,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.to that end,new york courts have been cautious in extending liability to defendants for their failure to control the conduct of others by limiting such liability to situations in which the defendant relationship with either the tortfeasor or the plaintiff places the defendant in the best position to protect against the risk of harm.hamilton beretta.this cautious approach is necessary to guard against the specter of limitless liability and to constrain the class of possible plaintiffs.id.at.
we applied these principles in the context of airline security in stanford kuwait airways,cir.in that case,four terrorists purchased interline tickets that allowed them to board middle east airlines mea flight in beirut and then transfer,without a new ticket or second baggage check,to a kuwait airways flight in dubai.id.at.mea employees sold the tickets,checked the terrorists visas and passports,took their bags,and were generally the first line of defense in beirut airport notoriously lax security system.id.the terrorists then boarded flight,and transferred directly to their kuwait airways flight in dubai,which they hijacked.id.at.after the hijacking,they tortured three american passengers,who later brought suit against,inter alia,mea.in what we deemed a close call,this court concluded that mea owed a duty of care to the plaintiffs.id.at.to reach that result,the panel relied on the fact that,because the terrorists checked in at mea ticketing desk and the airline knew about the poor security at beirut airport,it was well situated to implement additional screening measures.id.at.moreover,mea duty extended to the kuwait airways flight because mea knew that,under the interline ticketing program,passengers would not need to pass through a second round of screening before boarding the next flight.id.
here,by contrast,united was never in a position to serve as the first line of defense for flight.in portland,airways controlled ticketing for flight and delta airlines had responsibility for the airport security checkpoint.united was a party to the shared responsibility agreement regarding the checkpoint,but that title is a misnomer the agreement transferred operational control over the checkpoint from united and other airlines to delta alone.moreover,unlike in stanford,there was no interline ticketing program to connect security in portland to security in boston.instead,the september hijackers had to go through an entirely separate set of controls at logan before boarding flight.united had no connection to those controls and,indeed,was not even located in the same terminal.thus,unlike in stanford,both logic and public policy weigh heavily against a duty to.under these circumstances.waters,at.united had no control over either the acts of the primary wrongdoer or the conditions of the ticketing and security checkpoints the terrorists used.id.nor would the goal of increasing safety materially be advanced by expanding liability to defendants in united situation each airline already has ample incentive,both because of tort liability and federal regulations,to police the ticketing desks and security checkpoints that they actually operate.id.accordingly,we affirm the district court decision to dismiss.claims against united.
conclusion 
to summarize 
under the lesser of two principle and assuming that defendants liability can be established,plaintiffs are entitled to recover an amount equal to the diminution in value of their leasehold interests,but not the cost of rebuilding the leased buildings.
the district court properly concluded that plaintiffs may not recover for retenanting the leased buildings,hiring attorneys during litigation with their insurers,paying mortgage carrying costs,and losing tenant improvements.it was also correct to reduce the amount of plaintiffs insurance recoveries by the cost of preparing insurance claims,rather than treating those expenses as a separate category of damages.
the district court applied an incorrect valuation methodology when determining that the value of wtcp and.leasehold interests fell by,at most,billion and million,respectively.we therefore remand for reconsideration of this valuation.
because the atsssa creates a federal cause of action and incorporates only state substantive law,the district court did not err by conducting a collateral offset hearing pursuant to cplr before a trial on liability or damages.moreover,the district court finding that plaintiffs insurance recoveries reimbursed them for the costs of reconstructing the leased buildings and for business interruption was not clearly erroneous,and we agree with its decision that those reimbursements correspond to the same category of loss as the diminution in value of their leasehold interests.
prejudgment interest should be calculated using new york statutory rate and based on the amount of the award after the collateral offset,rather than the diminution in value of plaintiffs leasehold interests.
the district court correctly dismissed.claims against united after concluding that united owed no duty of care regarding flight.
on remand,the district court may,consistent with the guidance in this opinion,determine the diminution in value of plaintiffs leasehold interests on the evidence already submitted,after allowing additional,or through a trial on damages.it should then offset plaintiffs insurance proceeds against those hypothetical tort recoveries,and calculate prejudgment interest,if necessary,based on the remainder.
accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing.claims against united.as described above,we also affirm the district court judgment insofar as it properly applied the lesser of two principle to limit plaintiffs damages,properly denied plaintiffs claims for consequential damages,and properly applied cplr.finally,we vacate the judgment in part and remand with instructions to assess the lost market value of plaintiffs leasehold interests and,if necessary,to recalculate the award of prejudgment interest in a manner consistent with this opinion.
i concur with the majority in some respects specifically,in its i denial of the plaintiffs claims for consequential damages ii affirmance of the district court findings of correspondence under iii determination of the proper prejudgment interest to be applied and iv affirmance of the dismissal of certain claims against united airlines regarding flight.
but for the reasons that follow,i respectfully dissent from the majority decision limiting plaintiffs potential tort recovery as a matter of law.that determination raises complex,important,and novel questions of new york law that are best addressed by certification for decision by the new york court of appeals.
in this case,stated basically,plaintiffs leased public property buildings in the world trade center in return for rental payments and various other obligations,including,they contend,an assurance to the property government owner to repair any damage to the property during the leases term.after the property was tragically destroyed,plaintiffs suffered catastrophic economic losses they assert that not only must they continue to make rental payments on their leases,but they must also pay for the world trade center rebuilding.plaintiffs sued the defendants for compensation for these losses,alleging that defendants negligence led to the world trade center destruction.
the majority permits plaintiffs some recovery mostly for the reduction in rental value of their leases but it categorically prohibits plaintiffs from obtaining compensation from defendants for the substantial costs of rebuilding the world trade center in so doing,the majority decides two novel questions of new york law that,in my view,should instead be addressed in the first instance by the new york court of appeals.
each of the two questions,if decided in plaintiffs favor,could allow some recovery for rebuilding costs.the first novel question of new york law is whether plaintiffs can recover for the diminution in value of their leases caused by the leases obligation to rebuild.the majority excludes consideration of this loss as a matter of law,but new york highest court might reasonably instead consider it a jury question of proximate cause.the second novel question of new york law is whether plaintiffs can alternatively recover for their rebuilding costs based on the world trade center public value.again,the majority rejects this basis for recovery as a matter of law,but where plaintiffs were obligated to repair damage to state property and have claimed that doing so is merited by the property public value,new york highest court could justifiably find that equity warrants compensation from the tortfeasor that caused the property damage.
new york courts have not addressed these questions or anything close to them,and i do not believe that we can confidently predict how the new york court of appeals would resolve them.at the least,and as i explain below,i have considerable doubt that new york highest court would follow the majority reasoning.
issue one the obligation to rebuild 
as the majority explains,damage to property can be remedied either by paying for the property lost value or by paying for the property restoration.op.at.because either can place the victim in the same position as before the wrong occurred,see,new york courts generally award the lesser of the two.this lesser of two principle affords full compensation while encouraging mitigation of loss.see hartshorn chaddock,n,see also fisher qualico contracting,stating that the principle provides a plaintiff with no more than is reasonably necessary to remedy fully the injury while avoiding uneconomical efforts internal quotation marks omitted.
applying the lesser of two rule to this case,the majority reasons that plaintiffs are entitled to the lesser of the diminution in value of their leases caused by the property damage and the amount necessary to repair the property.op.at.the leases purported obligation to rebuild,however,complicates this analysis.it causes the diminution in value of plaintiffs leases the first measure of compensation to be significantly impacted by the cost of restoration the second measure.
a proper calculation of a lease value must take into account all of its provisions,irv ceil realty state,dep t.as the majority itself states,a lease value is the amount that a buyer would be willing to pay for the right to assume the lessee rights and obligations.op.at emphasis added.the obligation to rebuild would have obviously discouraged any potential purchaser of plaintiffs leases after september.yet the majority instructs the district court to ignore it when calculating the leases diminution in value in the majority own words,to award compensatory damages based on a hypothetical rather than reality.see id.at.the majority does not challenge plaintiffs assertion that they were actually damaged by the obligation to rebuild.instead,the majority reasons that plaintiffs should not receive a higher measure of damages simply because they contractually agreed in advance to repair the property in the event of damage.id.at.
new york highest court might easily disagree with the majority conclusion.the majority reasoning runs contrary to the basic principle expressed in the lesser of two rule that tort damages aim to restore the injured plaintiff to the position that would have been occupied had the harm not occurred.see mcdougald garber.although the lesser of two rule is one of mitigation,see hartshorn,at,and thus the majority emphasizes that a plaintiff choice to repair property,on its own,does not justify awarding replacement costs in excess of market value,see op.at,that is not this case.plaintiffs could not have mitigated the reduction in value of their leases caused by the contractual obligation to rebuild.new york has a long history of permitting tort damages based on contractual losses,steitz gifford,holding defendant responsible for reduced revenue on crop sold by plaintiff farmer after defendant negligent driving incapacitated plaintiff,causing a delay in crop sale.and in at least one case,a new york court has allowed a tort victim to seek damages greater than the value of destroyed property based on the terms of a lease agreement.see plouffe rogers,dep t permitting damage claim for early termination charges on an automobile lease after negligently caused crash.hence,there is considerable reason to think that the new york court of appeals would,rather than preclude consideration of plaintiffs obligation to rebuild as a matter of law,instead permit a jury to consider whether the obligation fits within the scope of proximate cause.
ii.issue two the world trade center public value 
even if plaintiffs purported obligation to rebuild were ignored in calculating the diminution in value of their leases as the majority holds plaintiffs might alternatively merit compensation for rebuilding based on the world trade center public value.plaintiffs,supported by a trio of experts and an amicus brief on behalf of the state of new york,assert that the world trade center is worth more to the public and thus to its government owner than both what it cost to build and what it would be worth to a potential private purchaser in other words,that the world trade center public value is greater than both its replacement cost and its market value.accepting this uncontroverted claim as true as we must in assessing defendants motion for summary judgment plaintiffs rebuilding obligation serves the public interest and is economically beneficial.the majority nonetheless determines that the new york court of appeals would preclude consideration of the world trade center public value in determining plaintiffs compensation.i can not reach the same conclusion with any degree of confidence.
the world trade center was built for the public benefit,see unconsol.law,courtesy sandwich shop,port of,appeal dismissed,and the port authority retains ownership of the world trade center pursuant to the site authorizing legislation,see unconsol.law.the decision to lease portions of the world trade center to plaintiffs was intended to maximiz e the value of the world trade center to the port authority and to the people of the region,joint app x at mins.of the port auth.bd.of comm rs,and new york courts have recognized the public purpose of projects involving leases of public property to private parties,murphy erie county.
although the new york court of appeals has not addressed the valuation of tortiously damaged public property,it would be consistent with new york basic principles of tort law to consider the world trade center public value in determining the damages a tortfeasor owes for its destruction.as noted above,the purpose of tort recovery under new york law is to have the wrongdoer make the victim whole.ross louise wise.even though an owner of damaged property can typically be made whole by compensation for the property diminution in market value,market value may provide inadequate compensation for damage to property built and owned by the government such property might have a utility to the public particularly a utility that exceeds the property commercial worth.
hence,whereas the lesser of two rule compares a property market value to its replacement cost for determining full compensation to an owner of private property,full compensation to a government owner of public property might require consideration of the property public value essentially,the lesser of two of public value and replacement cost.for example,a tree in a public park might cost to plant,have a value to the public in its location of,and yet increase the park market value by only.if the tree were negligently cut down,replanting would not constitute waste,and the government would be made whole by compensation of,not this is the calculus that plaintiffs experts assert applies to the world trade center that its market value is less than its replacement cost,which,in turn,is less than its value to the public.
these considerations could lead the new york court of appeals to conclude that the tortious destruction of property built and owned by the government merits a compensatory award of replacement costs where the property value to the public exceeds its costs of restoration,regardless of its market value.indeed,in different contexts,new york courts permit compensation based on replacement cost in excess of lost market value where market value provides an inadequate measure of loss,lake dye,household goods matter of rochester urban renewal agency patchen post,compensation for government taking of specialty property,which might be worth to its owner everything it cost to construct and more yet lacks a buyer willing to purchase it even at its reproduction value.
under the majority reasoning,however,defendants are responsible for much less simply the reduction in value of plaintiffs leases without consideration of the substantial costs of rebuilding.defendants might conceivably be liable to the world trade center government owner for rebuilding costs,except that the port authority can receive assistance with rebuilding from plaintiffs pursuant to their rebuilding obligation,which served to protect the extensive public investment in the world trade center.brief for amicus curiae state of new york amicus br.at.the port authority is not presently seeking damages from defendants so long as plaintiffs continue to comply with their contractual obligations.joint app x at decl.of keith harris,chief of the commercial litig.div.of the port authority.the result is a windfall for defendants,as they must pay for much less than the full scope of damage caused by their alleged tort,while plaintiffs may be compelled to fund the world trade center rebuilding.
i am not convinced that the new york court of appeals would accept this result.it has,for many years,applied equitable principles to permit recovery against a wrongdoer by a party that was compelled to pay the damages which the wrongdoer should have paid.dunn uvalde asphalt paving.the equitable doctrine of subrogation,for instance,in the context of insurance,entitles an insurer to stand in the shoes of its insured to seek indemnification from third parties whose wrongdoing has caused a loss for which the insurer is bound to reimburse.star reinsurance cont l ins,n.the new york court of appeals has explained,in reasoning that could easily apply here,that subrogation allocates responsibility for the loss to the person who in equity and good conscience ought to pay it,in the interest of avoiding absolution of a wrongdoer from liability simply because the insured had the foresight to procure insurance coverage.see also teichman by teichman cmty.hosp.of suffolk,stating that the right of subrogation was formulated to prevent unjust enrichment and is based upon principles of equity and natural justice internal quotation marks omitted pittsburgh westmoreland coal kerr,the doctrine of subrogation is a device to promote justice.the new york court of appeals has repeatedly emphasized that the equitable principles of subrogation should be applied broadly where warranted,grand city of new york,subrogation is a highly favored remedy and courts are inclined to extend rather than restrict its application ocean accident guarantee hooker electrochemical,asserting that the principle of subrogation ought to be liberally applied for the protection of those who are its natural beneficiaries.
the majority asserts that plaintiffs can not recover for the public loss because they did not serve as the public trustee,op.at,but the majority does not address the possibility that plaintiffs may nonetheless warrant compensation based on a rebuilding obligation that served to protect the public investment.amicus br.at.instead,the majority cites united states acres of land,to note that the supreme court has,in determining just compensation for purposes of the takings clause,refused to compensate private plaintiffs for the community value of their properties.see op.at.yet acres of land is hardly instructive in predicting how new york highest court would resolve the issues presented here.it addressed the power of eminent domain and thus discussed the constitutional limits of just compensation,not what a tortfeasor ought to pay,it has not once been cited by a published decision of new york courts,and,unlike here,it involved a private entity that was under no legal or factual obligation to replace the taken property or compensate the public for its reconstruction,at.contrary to the majority point,moreover,the new york court of appeals has explicitly considered public value in determining just compensation for a government taking of private property.see matter of port auth.trans hudson hudson rapid tubes,holding that private owner of rail lines and tunnels taken by port authority was entitled to more than property market value,which was scrap,because property formed an essential part of an essential public facility,cert.denied.
new york courts have not addressed the issues discussed above,and i do not believe that we can confidently predict how the new york court of appeals would resolve them.the issues are complex,their resolution requires significant public policy choices,and their import to new york state is evident significant enough,in fact,to warrant the submission of an unsolicited amicus brief on its behalf in this case.leases frequently include an obligation to rebuild,and new york amicus brief explains that m any public projects are implemented through leases to private parties.amicus br.at.the state emphasizes its strong interest in avoiding misclassification of public property as merely private in nature,and in preventing the mistaken construction of new york law to provide an incentive for private parties to abandon their contractual rebuilding and restoration obligations to public entities.id.at.
certification can delay resolution of a specific case,but as the supreme court has noted,i t does,of course,in the long run save time,energy,and resources and helps build a cooperative judicial federalism.lehman schein.deciding an undetermined question of state law rather than certifying the question to the state highest court impedes the development of state law and exposes litigants to the risk that our conjectures on state law are wrong,solomon guggenheim found.lubell,rejecting our holding on an open question of new york law after we declined to certify.the new york court of appeals has underscored the great value in new york certification procedure and affirmed that certification facilitat es the orderly development and fair application of the law and prevent s the need for speculation.tunick safir.the new york court of appeals might decline to answer our certified questions,although it does so rarely.see id.at.but by declining to certify at all,we deny it the opportunity to resolve,in the first instance,novel questions of state law rife with public policy implications.
the state of new york amicus brief in this case explicitly requests,in the alternative,that we certify this case to the new york court of appeals.amicus br.at.i would grant that request,as i find that the issues of new york law raised here are best addressed by certification.see regs.tit,a cir.local see also in re santiago monteverde,cir stating general requirements for certification.
