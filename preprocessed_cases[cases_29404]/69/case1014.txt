former section of the missouri revised statutes,enacted in,provided that no physician may perform an abortion unless the woman patient has signed an informed consent form stating that her attending physician advised her whether she is pregnant,the risks associated with the abortion procedure to be used,and the alternatives to abortion.the district court enjoined enforcement of this statute in reproductive health servs.webster,in,missouri enacted a new,replacing the former statute with substantially revised informed consent provisions.as relevant to this appeal,the new provides 
except in the case of medical emergency,no person shall perform or induce an abortion unless at least hours prior thereto a treating physician has conferred with the patient and discussed with her the indicators and contraindicators,and risk factors including any physical,psychological,or situational factors for the proposed procedure and the use of medications in light of her medical history and medical condition

the director of the department of health and senior services shall disseminate a model form that physicians may use as the written statement required by this section,but any lack or unavailability of such a model form shall not affect the duties of the physician under this section.

the plaintiffs collectively,planned parenthood filed this official capacity action against attorney general jeremiah nixon and two local prosecutors,claiming that the new statute is unconstitutionally vague on its face.after the district court granted a temporary restraining order prohibiting enforcement,planned parenthood moved for a preliminary injunction,and both parties moved for summary judgment.the court abstained under the pullman doctrine concluding that state court interpretation of the scienter provisions in and could materially affect the federal constitutional questions.that ruling was not appealed.after this court vacated the temporary restraining order,the district court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining defendants,their employees,agents,and successors,and all others acting in concert or participating with them from in any way enforcing the act.attorney general nixon appeals,arguing that the court erred in granting the preliminary injunction and that he is immune from suit under the eleventh amendment as construed in ex parte young,and its progeny.we modify the preliminary injunction.
in deciding whether to grant a preliminary injunction,the district court applied the traditional test reviewed in dataphase,c l,cir en banc the threat of irreparable harm to the movant the balance between this harm and the injury an injunction would inflict on other parties the movant probability of success on the merits and the public interest.we review the grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.bear kautzky,cir.
beginning with a contention not grounded in the dataphase factors,attorney general nixon argues that the district court abused its discretion because planned parenthood asked the court to abstain.nixon acknowledges,as he must,that the supreme court has recognized that an abstaining federal court may grant a preliminary injunction while state courts construe the challenged statute.see babbitt united farm workers union,d harrison naacp,d.but nixon argues that the injunction was inappropriate in this case because planned parenthood now has no incentive to pursue state court litigation to establish the meaning of the ambiguous scienter provisions.
though this argument has some force,it overlooks relevant procedural was nixon who first urged pullman abstention in his motion to dismiss planned parenthood only suggested abstention when nixon relied on the scienter provisions in his subsequent motion for summary judgment.in these circumstances,we conclude that the grant of a preliminary injunction was within the district court discretion if planned parenthood satisfied the dataphase factors.any by planned parenthood in the state courts may be remedied by exercise of the federal court discretion to modify or vacate the preliminary injunction.see catrone.state racing comm n,cir.
turning to the dataphase factors,to warrant preliminary injunctive relief,a plaintiff must show the threat of irreparable injury.apartment search,cir.in planned parenthood casey,at,the supreme court upheld a pennsylvania informed consent requirement,concluding that a state may constitutionally require physicians,before performing abortions,to provide truthful and not misleading information mandated by the state,so long as the requirement does not place an undue burden on the constitutional right of women patients to make the ultimate decision.although the informed consent provisions of are more extensive than those at issue in casey,planned parenthood made no concrete showing of undue burden on the rights of women patients.rather,planned parenthood argued in the district court i that is unconstitutionally vague because it commands physicians to discuss with their patients matters that have no recognized or accepted medical meaning,such as indicators,contraindicators,and situational factors,and ii that the continuing risk of prosecution or license revocation for failing to comply with this uncertain mandate provides the requisite threat of irreparable injury.
the district court agreed,concluding that planned parenthood physicians face the threat of irreparable injury because they are being forced to choose between performing abortions without any certainty that they are in compliance with the act,thereby risking imprisonment,fines,and professional censure,or ceasing the performance of abortions.on appeal,attorney general nixon argues that this alleged injury is remote and speculative because no health care professional can be penalized unless he or she knowingly fails to comply,and because no civil,criminal,or administrative enforcement of the new statute has occurred or been threatened.planned parenthood responds that when a case involves an alleged deprivation of constitutional rights,no further showing of irreparable injury is necessary.when a state statute is challenged on its face as unconstitutionally vague,and no first amendment interests are imperiled,that assertion is far too broad.
a statute can be impermissibly vague if it fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits,but the concern is lessened if the statute contains a scienter requirement.hill colorado,d.as the supreme court discussion in hill makes clear,facial attacks on statutes that do not threaten first amendment rights are not favored.therefore,a concrete showing of irreparable injury is needed to justify preliminary injunctive relief barring enforcement of the challenged statute.in planned parenthood citizens for comm.action,cir,for example,plaintiff faced immediate financial harm unless the challenged ordinance was preliminarily enjoined.here,on the other hand,the alleged injury is more speculative.while there is force to the contention that physicians will have difficulty determining precisely what mandates before the scienter requirement is clarified and the department of health and senior services disseminates the form prescribed in subsection,the core mandate to obtain informed consent is both clear and constitutional,and no enforcement action has been threatened.thus,although the district court did not abuse its discretion in
