ii.factual and procedural background 
a.the injunction 
planned parenthood association of san mateo county obtained the injunction in a state court action it filed in september.planned parenthood operation rescue th,d planned parenthood orc.the injunction was sought and granted to remedy problems caused by the planned parenthood orc defendants demonstration activities at planned parenthood clinic in san mateo the san mateo clinic which commenced in and continued even after planned parenthood obtained temporary federal injunctive relief 
the injunction was entered against two named defendants,operation rescue of california orc and robert cochran cochran.according to its terms,the injunction applies to defendants and their agents,employees,representatives and all persons acting in concert or participation with them,or either of them,and all persons with actual notice of this judgment.
the injunction restricts demonstration activities at the san mateo clinic and also imposes restrictions on demonstration activities directed at,a physician who treated patients at the san mateo clinic the provisions pertaining to the san mateo clinic restrain and enjoin individuals subject to the injunction from directly or indirectly entering or blocking or obstructing the free and direct passage of any other person into or out of the clinic demonstrating,picketing,distributing literature,or counseling on clinic property or within fifteen feet of such private property entering or blocking or obstructing the ingress or egress of any vehicle to or from any parking area in front of or behind the clinic obstructing or impeding the movement of any person who is moving between a vehicle and the clinic or using a walkway leading to the clinic shouting,screaming or otherwise producing loud noises which can be heard in the clinic physically touching threatening to physically touch,or shouting at people entering or exiting the clinic.
b.the action 
on july,foti filed a complaint for damages and injunctive relief against ppgg and several individuals alleging defamation,abuse of process,infliction of emotional distress and battery the action.foti alleged that ppgg and escorts employed by ppgg unlawfully interfered with him in order to prevent him from exercising his constitutional right to engage in picketing,leafleting and counseling outside the san mateo clinic and outside planned parenthood clinics in menlo park and redwood city.see planned parenthood golden gate superior court th,d.
ppgg filed a in the action against foti,the garibaldis and others,alleging interference,harassment,emotional distress,abuse of process,false arrest,defamation and conspiracy.planned parenthood golden gate superior court,supra,th at,d.ppgg alleged that the habitually harassed and intimidated planned parenthood employees,volunteers,patients and their companions while protesting at planned parenthood clinics.ibid.
while the parties were attempting to negotiate a settlement of the action,a dispute arose as to whether the injunction applies to foti and the garibaldis.this dispute became a major sticking point in the negotiations.to resolve this dispute,the parties agreed that proceedings in the action would be stayed and ppgg would file a new complaint to determine whether the injunction applied to foti and the garibaldis.
on december,the parties presented their stipulation to the honorable john runde.pursuant to that stipulation,the superior court stayed the trial in the action,which had been set for january,pending the filing and disposition of the new lawsuit.
c.the present action 
on february,ppgg filed a complaint for declaratory relief against foti and the garibaldis.ppgg alleged that defendants were served with the injunction but continue to demonstrate,picket and distribute literature on and within fifteen feet of the san mateo clinic property and also enter and obstruct the free and direct passage of people into and out of the clinic.ppgg also alleged,on information and belief,that defendants act in concert and participation with orc when conducting their demonstration activities.ppgg sought a declaration that defendants are bound by the injunction and must therefore comply with its terms or face contempt.
on may,the garibaldis filed motions to strike ppgg complaint pursuant to the statute,code of civil procedure section.the garibaldis argued the complaint should be stricken because it lacks merit and was brought solely for the purpose of interfering with the valid exercise of the garibaldis constitutional rights to freedom of speech.a hearing on the motions to strike was held on may,before the honorable george miram.in an order filed june,the june order,the court denied the garibaldis motions to strike.
on january,ppgg filed a motion for summary judgment.it argued that foti and the garibaldis are subject to the injunction as a matter of law because undisputed facts show that they act in concert with each other and in concert or participation with orc and cochran in conducting their demonstration activities at the san mateo clinic.ppgg also argued that the injunction applies to all persons with actual notice of it and that undisputed facts establish that foti and the garibaldis have notice of the injunction.on march,a hearing on the summary judgment motion was held before the honorable joseph bergeron.on march,the court filed an order granting ppgg motion for summary judgment.judgment was entered on march.
iii.discussion 
summary.standard of review and issues presented 
a motion for summary judgment must be granted if all of the papers submitted show there is no triable issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.scheiding dinwiddie construction th,d scheiding.a motion for summary judgment must be denied if the moving papers show there is a triable issue of fact.citation.in ruling on the motion,a court must consider both the evidence and all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence code civ,subd.c.the moving party evidence must leave no room for conflicting inferences as to material facts.s ummary judgment shall not be granted based on inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence,if contradicted by other inferences or evidence,which raise a triable issue as to any material fact.code civ,subd.c,superior court th,d.
the trial court summary judgment rulings are subject to de novo review.citation.scheiding,supra,th at,d.we view the evidence in a light favorable to appellants,we liberally construe appellants evidentiary submission while strictly scrutinizing respondent evidence,and we resolve any evidentiary doubts or ambiguities in appellants favor.saelzler advanced group cal th,d.
in the present case,the trial court granted ppgg summary judgment because it found that foti and the garibaldis are bound by the injunction as a matter of law.by its terms,the injunction applies to orc and cochran,the named defendants in planned parenthood orc,supra,th,d,and to two additional categories of individuals orc cochran agents,employees representatives and all persons acting in concert or participation with them or either of them the in concert provision and all persons with actual notice of this judgment the actual notice provision.ppgg maintains that both of these provisions apply to foti and the garibaldis as a matter of law.appellants maintain that the actual notice provision of the injunction is unconstitutional and invalid,and that there are disputed issues of material fact as to whether the in concert provision of the injunction applies to them.to resolve these issues,we first consider the validity of the provision governing the reach of the injunction.we then address the factual evidence regarding these particular appellants.
the injunction actual notice provision is invalid 
an injunction is obviously a personal decree.it operates on the person of the defendant by commanding him to do or desist from certain action.citation.people ex rel.gwinn kothari th,d kothari.indeed it may deprive the enjoined parties of rights others enjoy precisely because the enjoined parties have abused those rights in the past.people conrad th,d conrad.thus,it is well established that injunctions are not effective against the world at large.citations.kothari,supra,th at,d see also conrad,supra,th at,d.on the other hand,the law recognizes that enjoined parties may not nullify an injunctive decree by carrying out prohibited acts with or through nonparties to the original proceeding.citations.conrad supra,th at,d.thus,an injunction can properly run to classes of persons with or through whom the enjoined party may act.ross superior court cal d,conrad,supra,th at,d.however,a theory of disobedience of the injunction can not be predicated on the act of a person not in any way included in its terms or acting in concert with the enjoined party and in support of his claims.berger superior court cal,see also in re berry cal d,fns.
these legal principles establish that the actual notice provision in the injunction is not enforceable.p ersonal jurisdiction and notice are not enough to subject a person to the restraint of an injunction.the order must be directed against that person,either by naming that person as an individual or by designating a class of persons to which that person belongs.citations if the person charged with violation was neither named in the injunction individually or as a member of a class,nor as aiding or abetting a person so included,he can not be brought within the prohibition merely by being served with a copy of the writ.citation.witkin,cal.procedure ed.provisional remedies.
ppgg argues that the injunction,including the actual notice provision,was previously affirmed by this court.this court has never previously reviewed the injunction.division three of this district decided the appeal filed by orc and cochran in planned parenthood orc,supra,th,d.in that case,cochran argued,among other things,that the actual notice provision rendered the injunction constitutionally overbroad.the court rejected this argument on the ground that cochran was a party who was specifically named in the injunction and therefore lacked standing to object to the actual notice provision.id.at,d.thus,the planned parenthood orc court did not offer any opinion as to the validity of the actual notice provision of the injunction.
ppgg contends the actual notice provision is an indispensable tool to effectuate the court power to grant equitable relief among all parties affected by the intense emotions surrounding the abortion debate.in fact,the actual notice provision is inconsistent with the very nature and purpose of injunctive relief because it purports to extend a remedy beyond the context of the specific dispute which justifies that remedy.an injunction,by its very nature,applies only to a particular group or individuals and regulates the activities,and perhaps the speech,of that group.it does so,however,because of the group past actions in the context of a specific dispute between real parties.the parties seeking the injunction assert a violation of their rights the court hearing the action is charged with fashioning a remedy for a specific deprivation,not with the drafting of a statute addressed to the general public.madsen women health center,d madsen.
the intensity of the abortion debate does not somehow entitle ppgg to broader relief than parties seeking equitable relief in other contexts.if anything,the opposite is true.as a general matter,protestors enjoy full constitutional protection for the expression and communication of their views concerning the public issue of abortion.citation.this is particularly true when these protected activities occur on the public streets and sidewalks,traditionally viewed as the quintessential public forum.citation.an injunction curtailing protected expression will be upheld only if the challenged provisions of the injunction burden no more speech than necessary to serve a significant government interest.citation.planned parenthood orc,supra,th at,d.the actual notice provision can not satisfy this requirement because it purports to enjoin all demonstrators in addition to the enjoined parties,the restriction is overbroad on its face.see,in re berry,supra,cal d at,provision extending scope of injunction to persons wholly unaffiliated with named parties is unconstitutionally vague and.
ppgg argues that,without the actual notice provision,one protestor can simply be replaced with another and avoid the reach of the injunction.but protestors are not fungible.a mutuality of purpose is not enough to bind to an injunction restricting demonstration activity at an abortion clinic it must be their actual relationship to an enjoined party,and not their convictions about abortion,that make them contemners.conrad,supra,th at,d.put another way,if we permit ppgg to utilize an actual notice provision to obtain injunctive relief against all protestors,the injunction would be and virtually impossible to justify under current first amendment jurisprudence.see madsen,supra,at.planned parenthood,williams cal th,d,williams.
ppgg legitimate concern that an enjoined party might attempt to undermine the effect of an injunction by enlisting the aid of a nonparty can be adequately addressed by a provision extending the reach of the injunction to agents,employees and those who act in concert with an enjoined party.the injunction contains such a provision.that in concert provision ensures that a nonparty to an injunction is subject to the contempt power of the court when,with knowledge of the injunction,the nonparty violates its terms with or for those who are restrained.conrad,supra,th at,d.
ppgg argues the actual notice provision should be approved as a device.according to ppgg,requiring it to litigate with appellants in order to obtain injunctive relief against them would be a waste of time because the restrictions imposed by the injunction were expressly approved in planned parenthood the behavior of each,individual protestor is not determinative of the ultimate remedy to which ppgg is entitled and a separate trial will not produce different injunctive relief.virtually every prong of this argument is erroneous.
first,the planned parenthood orc court affirmed in part and reversed in part the judgment imposing the injunction against orc and cochran.th,d.the court upheld a restriction which precluded appellants from demonstrating within feet of the san mateo clinic the foot exclusion zone provision.id.at,d.however it found that other provisions of the injunction were overbroad and unconstitutional because they burdened more of the defendants speech than was justified by the evidence.id.at,d.
second,although the planned parenthood orc court upheld the exclusion zone provision,it did not,as ppgg intimates,approve that provision against all protestors who demonstrate at the san mateo clinic.in reaching its decision,the court expressly acknowledged this restriction affected the constitutionally protected speech rights of appellants in that case its practical effect was that those appellants had to stay off the public sidewalk at the front of the clinic and to move either to the sides or across the street.planned parenthood orc,supra,th at,d.nevertheless,the court found the restrict
