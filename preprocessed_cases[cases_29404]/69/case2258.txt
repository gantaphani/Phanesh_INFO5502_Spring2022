honeywell international and gem microelectronic materials,collectively honeywell,the,appeal from a judgment of the court of chancery awarding lost profits damages to honeywell in this breach of contract action against the,air products chemicals,inc air products.the court of chancery concluded that air products had breached the parties strategic alliance agreement alliance agreement or agreement but found honeywell entitled only to of the in lost profits that honeywell had claimed.honeywell argues that it is entitled to additional lost profits damages as a matter of law,because the court of chancery based its damages award upon two erroneous rulings.air products has,claiming that the court of chancery erred by awarding any damages,because the alliance agreement was not a legally valid and enforceable contract and the court erred in holding otherwise.
we affirm the court of chancery determination that the alliance agreement was valid and enforceable.we also affirm that court determination that the calculation of honeywell lost profits damages is properly based upon air products historic business,rather than upon the expanded business that resulted from air products acquisition of a third party firm.we reverse,however,the court ruling that air products was obligated to pay damages only for a period because that determination rests upon air products right to terminate the alliance agreement on two years right,we conclude,that was not triggered in this case.accordingly,we remand the case to the court of chancery for a calculation of honeywell lost profits through,the end of the agreement original term.
formation and performance of the strategic alliance agreement 
in october,honeywell and air products entered into the strategic alliance agreement that forms the subject of this lawsuit in that agreement,the parties formed an alliance under which air products would market and sell certain wet process chemicals that honeywell manufactured,and the contracting parties would share all profits derived from those alliance sales.
the parties established the scope of their alliance agreement by defining two critical terms products and customers that were to be sold and serviced by the alliance.thus,the agreement recites that the purpose of the strategic alliance is to sell globally the high purity wet process chemicals identified in exhibit a the products to the customers identified in exhibit b the customers.the parties then agreed that 
air products would purchase from honeywell its total requirements of the products to be sold by air products to customers under any air products label.air products i will use reasonable efforts to promote the sale of the products to the customers,and ii will not actively promote the sale to the customers of products manufactured by air products or purchased from other suppliers 
thus,air products committed to purchase its requirements of products from honeywell.in exchange,honeywell committed to not actively promote the sale of products under its own labels to the customers.the agreement released honeywell from that commitment,however,if air products failed to meet certain sales targets that were specified in the agreement thus,in section c,the parties agreed that if during any two consecutive calendar years beginning on or after january,alliance sales are less than of the sales targets set forth in exhibit c,honeywell was no longer bound by its commitment not to actively promote products under its own labels to customers 
the initial term of the agreement was for ten years,and would expire on september.the agreement empowered both parties to terminate the agreement earlier,however,but only on certain conditions.under section b,honeywell power to terminate was triggered 
if during any two consecutive years beginning on or after january,alliance sales fall below of the sales targets set forth in exhibit c honeywell shall have the right to give notice of termination of this agreement to air products at any time during the next calendar year,such termination to be effective no sooner than two years after the date such notice is given 
under section c,air products power to terminate the agreement was triggered 
if during any two consecutive calendar years beginning on or after january,honeywell sales to the customers excluding customers to which honeywell has sold products prior to this agreement of products under honeywell own labels represents more than of the total alliance sales,air products shall have the right to give notice of termination of the agreement to honeywell at any time during the next calendar year,such termination to be effective no sooner than two years after the date such notice is given 
because the parties rights and obligations under the agreement would depend critically upon the products and customers that were listed on exhibits a and b,respectively,the parties agreed that those lists could be modified from time to time by the mutual agreement of the parties.specifically,section a,provided that the parties would review and modify exhibits a and b in good faith at least once a year to reflect the parties current assessment of the focus of the alliance.
in fact,however,from the very inception of the alliance the parties never strictly observed the modification procedures called for by the alliance agreement.after the agreement became effective,air products frequently took orders from firms that were not identified as customers in exhibit b,yet were treated by air products as alliance customers.moreover,until,air products filled all of its wet process chemical purchase orders through honeywell,even if the chemicals or the purchasers were not listed as products or customers in exhibit a or exhibit b to the agreement.
in and,the alliance sales fell below of the sales targets mandated by the agreement.as a result,honeywell regained the right to actively promote products under its own labels to customers,and it began exercising that right in.
air product purchase of the ashland chemicals ecd division 
in june,air products notified honeywell that it air products had agreed to acquire ashland chemical electronic chemicals division ashland ecd,which was then the largest producer of wet process chemicals in the industry.air products acquired four of ashland business lines,including its wet process chemical business.on july,air products notified honeywell of its intent to terminate the alliance agreement on two years notice.air products took the position that the termination clause of the agreement had been triggered,because honeywell direct sales of wet process chemicals exceeded the limit established by section c of the agreement.
in response,honeywell filed in the court of chancery an action for breach of contract,in which it sought to enjoin air products acquisition of the ashland ecd.the court of chancery denied honeywell motion for a preliminary injunction,concluding that although honeywell had shown that it was likely to succeed on the merits of its breach of contract claim,honeywell was not entitled to injunctive relief because it had an adequate remedy at law,monetary damages.thereafter,in september,honeywell filed an amended complaint for money damages,again claiming that air products termination of the alliance agreement constituted a breach of contract.
the court of chancery opinion 
air products defended the lawsuit on the ground inter alia that the alliance agreement was invalid and unenforceable,because the contract provision that permitted the parties to modify the lists of customers and products rendered the agreement fatally illusory and indefinite.alternatively,air products contended that even if the agreement was found to be valid,honeywell was entitled to recover lost profit damages limited to a period,because air products right to terminate under section c required two years notice.
in response,honeywell argued that the parties course of performance had modified the terms of the contract,with the result that air products termination right under section c had not been triggered.honeywell also claimed that it was entitled to damages for all profits that it lost,and will continue to lose,as a result of air products refusal to fill its wet process chemical purchase orders through honeywell.specifically,honeywell contended that its damages include profits derived from all sales of wet process chemicals that air products had made and will make to its the customers air products obtained as a result of its ashland ecd acquisition.
rejecting air products contract invalidity defense,the court of chancery concluded that the agreement was valid and enforceable and that air products had breached the agreement by refusing to fill its wet process chemicals requirements through honeywell during the two year period following air products termination of the agreement.the court limited honeywell damages in two respects,however.
first,the court rejected honeywell claim that it was entitled to calculate lost profits damages based on sales to the customers air products had acquired through the ashland ecd business ashland sales.the court found that honeywell was not entitled to profits derived from the ashland sales,because honeywell had not shown that when the agreement was executed the parties contemplated that the alliance would cover sales resulting from one party acquisition of a third party firm.
second,the court of chancery limited honeywell damage award to a two year period beginning from the date air products terminated the agreement.the court accepted air products claim that honeywell direct sales to its customers exceeded the limitation found in section c of the agreement.as a result,the court concluded,air products became entitled to terminate the agreement upon two years notice,and therefore,honeywell damages would be limited to the profits honeywell lost through august,rather than through the end of the original contract term.
on appeal honeywell challenges both of those limitations upon its damages award.honeywell claims that under the agreement it is entitled to recover its lost profits calculated from a base that includes the ashland sales,and the period during which it may recover lost profits extends to,not,because air products had no contractual right to terminate the alliance agreement.in its air products reasserts its defense that the alliance agreement is unenforceable 
the parties contentions raise three separate issues on this appeal,which are whether the alliance agreement is enforceable under new york law,if the agreement is enforceable,whether honeywell is entitled to recover lost profits derived from the ashland sales,and whether air products was contractually entitled to terminate the agreement upon two years notice.to the extent those issues involve the interpretation of contract language,they are questions of law that this court reviews de novo for legal error to the extent the trial court interpretation of the contract rests upon findings extrinsic to the contract,or upon inferences drawn from those findings,our review requires us to defer to the trial court findings,unless the findings are not supported by the record or unless the inferences drawn from those findings are not the product of an orderly or logical deductive reasoning process 
we first address air product argument on that the alliance agreement is unenforceable.thereafter,we consider honeywell claims relating to the scope of the damages to which it is lawfully entitled.
enforceability of the strategic alliance agreement 
air products argues that the strategic alliance agreement is unenforceable because two material terms,the products and the customers listed in exhibits a and b,were subject to modification at any time.for that reason,air products urges,the agreement is too illusory to be enforceable,as no court could readily determine an appropriate remedy for a breach.rejecting that argument,the court of chancery concluded that the alliance agreement did not fail for indefiniteness under new york law,because the parties intended to be bound by the agreement and because its terms and the parties actual course of performance provided a reasonably certain basis to fashion a remedy.we agree.
a contract does not necessarily become indefinite because it leaves open a term for future agreement new york courts will apply the doctrine of indefiniteness to defeat a contract only as a last resort.under new york law,a court will not invalidate a contract as indefinite unless it is satisfied that the contract can not be rendered reasonably certain by reference to an extrinsic standard that makes its meaning clear 
such an extrinsic standard exists here.because the alliance agreement is a requirements contract for the sale of goods,the provisions of the new york uniform commercial code ucc control it the ucc expressly recognizes,consistent with new york common law,that a contract may be valid and enforceable even if some of its terms are left to future negotiation under the ucc,a contract does not fail for indefiniteness if the parties intended to make a contract and if a reasonably certain basis exists for crafting an appropriate remedy 
the court of chancery correctly found that the alliance agreement satisfies that test.air products can not realistically argue that it did not intend to be bound by the alliance agreement.the parties intent to be bound by the agreement is independently established by the undisputed fact that for five years they performed under the terms of the agreement,without objection by either side.moreover,this is not a case where the contract is only an agreement to agree to a material term and where the parties intended for the agreement to be binding only if the parties later arrived at a mutually agreeable term.in such a case,no enforceable contract arises unless the parties in fact agree to that term here,in contrast,the parties agreed what specific products and customers would be covered by the agreement,and nothing in that agreement provides that a failure to agree to future modifications of the terms products and customers would cause the termination.
the terms of the agreement and the parties course of performance also provide a reasonably certain basis for the court to craft a remedy.in section a the parties agreed to review exhibits a and b in good faith to reflect the parties current assessment as to the focus of the efforts of the alliance.the requirement of a good faith modification to reflect the parties current assessment of the alliance,affords a reviewing court sufficient guidance to determine how the parties would have modified the agreement had they done so formally.the court of chancery also properly looked to the parties historical course of performance to interpret the agreement and to devise a remedy.section of the new york ucc expressly states that any course of performance accepted or acquiesced in without objection shall be relevant to determine the meaning of the agreement.
the only authority air products cites to support its unenforceability argument,joseph martin.delicatessen,schumacher is distinguishable on its facts.there,a lease agreement permitted the tenant to renew the lease for an additional period at annual rents to be agreed upon.the new york court of appeals found that the renewal clause was unenforceable,because it was a mere agreement to agree that contained no objective standard or formula to enable a court to establish an appropriate rent.in joseph martin,the tenant sought specific performance,not damages,and the court noted that it is particularly important to have definite contract terms where the extraordinary remedy of specific performance is sought moreover,the court noted that the lease was not covered by the ucc because it did not involve a sale of goods.the court acknowledged that open terms in sale of goods contracts were more readily acceptable than open terms in real estate contracts in this case,the contract is one for the sale of goods,not real estate,and the remedy being sought is damages,not specific performance.
under new york law,those distinctions are important.in may metropolitan may oil burner the new york court of appeals found enforceable a contract term that was similar to the term litigated in joseph martin,but where the contract involved the sale of goods.in may,the parties agreed that the plaintiff could renew its franchise of the defendant oil burner equipment on a yearly basis,as long as the parties agreed upon an acceptable quota each year.the court enforced that renewal provision,finding that the parties course of dealing provided an extrinsic standard upon which the court could give meaning to that term.
when interpreting sale of goods contracts,the new york courts continue to follow may which is consistent with the standards established by the ucc.the court of chancery correctly applied those standards to the alliance agreement.here,the parties intended to be bound by the alliance agreement,and the terms of that agreement and the parties performance thereunder provide a sufficient basis for the court to fashion a remedy.therefore,the court of chancery correctly found the agreement valid and enforceable under new york law.it follows that because air products breached that agreement by not filling its wet process chemical requirements through honeywell,the court of chancery correctly determined that honeywell was entitled to recover money damages for that breach.
honeywell entitlement to profits from the ashland ecd business 
the court of chancery awarded honeywell lost profits damages resulting from air products breach of the alliance agreement.honeywell claims,however,that the damages award was legally insufficient,because the damage calculation did not include sales that air products made and will continue to make to the customers it acquired through its purchase of the ashland ecd division,the ashland sales.honeywell contends that the alliance agreement obligated air products to fill its requirements of products through honeywell,and that those requirements necessarily included all air products sales.therefore,honeywell argues,the court of chancery erred in excluding the sales made to the customers resulting from the ashland acquisition.
the court of chancery concluded that honeywell was not entitled to lost profits attributable to the ashland sales,because honeywell had not shown that sales resulting from acquisitions of a third party firm were within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time they entered into the alliance agreement.we agree with that conclusion.
new york law permits a plaintiff to recover damages for a breach of contract in the form of lost profits if the damages were caused by the breach,the claimed loss can be proved with reasonable certainty,and the particular damages were within the contemplation of the parties to the contract at the time it was made it is the plaintiff here,honeywell burden to establish all three requirements the court of chancery concluded that honeywell had not proved that at the time the parties formed the contract they reasonably contemplated that the agreement would cover customers acquired by either party through the purchase of a third party firm.
the requirement that damages be within the reasonable contemplation of the parties is one of foreseeability under that rule,the breaching party is legally responsible for the risks it foresaw or reasonably should have foreseen at the time the contract was made.the plaintiff need not show,however,that the breaching party foresaw either the specific breach that actually occurred or the specific manner in which the loss came about where the contract does not expressly define the scope or extent of lost profit damages recoverable in the event of a breach,a court may consider what the parties would have concluded had they specifically addressed the issue upon entering into the agreement 
honeywell argues that the court of chancery misapplied the foreseeability test because it required honeywell to prove that air products actually foresaw the breach that occurred in this case.that argument misstates the court reasoning.nothing in the court opinion suggests that it required honeywell to prove that the parties actually foresaw that air products would acquire ashland,or any other particular wet process chemical manufacturer.what the court of chancery did find was that when the parties entered into the agreement,they did not contemplate that customers obtained through a contracting party future acquisition of a third party firm would automatically become customers under the alliance agreement.
that conclusion is supported by the record and is also in accord with new york law.in kenford,inc county of erie the new york court of appeals rejected the plaintiff argument that it was entitled to recover twenty years of lost profits as a result of the county of erie failure to construct the stadium that it promised to build.in their contract the parties agreed that the county would build a domed stadium and that the parties would enter into a lease to operate that facility.the contract also provided that if the parties could not agree upon a lease,they would execute a separate management contract when the county failed to build the stadium,the plaintiffs sued for the lost profits they expected to receive during its anticipated management of the stadium.the court declined to rule that the contracting parties envisaged that the county would incur such significant responsibility at the time they entered into the contract.nowhere did the contract suggest liability of that magnitude,nor did the plaintiffs show through extrinsic evidence that the parties contemplated that a breaching party would incur liability for lost profits over the life of the contract absent clear proof that both parties contemplated damages of that magnitude at the time they entered into the contract the court was unwilling to allow recovery of those damages.
here,as in kenford,honeywell has not shown that the parties contemplated that customers of companies acquired would automatically become customers subject to the alliance agreement.indeed,the uncontroverted evidence shows otherwise.in february,honeywell and texas ultra pure formed a joint venture,gem microelectronic materials,gem.honeywell assigned its interest in the agreement to gem.air products accepted that assignment,and the parties exchanged letters in which they agreed that as for texas ultra pure preexisting customers,gem was not bound by the provision in section c that would have restricted honeywell gem from actively promoting honeywell products to those customers.that history suggests that the parties intended that if air products or honeywell acquired another company,the parties would negotiate the resulting new customers would come within the scope of the alliance.what it does not show is that the parties intended that the new customers would automatically become customers subject to the alliance agreement.
the new york ucc is consistent with the court of chancery conclusion.section instructs that a party historical business is a proper measure to interpret the scope of a requirements contract.under that provision,no quantity unreasonably disproportionate to any normal or otherwise comparable prior requirements may be tendered or demanded.comment specifies that a sudden expansion of the plant by which requirements are to be measured would not be included within the scope of the contract as made,but a normal expansion undertaken in good faith would be within the scope of this section.thus,under section and comment,the sudden customer base expansion that occurred when air products purchased the ashland ecd division would not automatically fall within the scope of the alliance agreement.
because honeywell offered no persuasive evidence that the profits attributable to the ashland acquisition were within the contemplation of the parties,the automatic inclusion of those profits in honeywell damages award would be contrary to new york law.we agree that the court of chancery correctly denied honeywell lost profits damages attributable to the ashland sales.
air products right to early termination of the alliance agreement 
honeywell also challenges the court of chancery determination that air products was entitled to terminate the agreement on two years notice,and that as a consequence,honeywell damages recovery would cover only that two year period.that claim raises an iss
