backgrounda.hud requirements 
by insuring federal housing administration fha mortgages,hud assists homebuyers who can not otherwise afford to purchase homes.fha mortgage insurance insures the mortgage for the lenders,and if the buyer can not make payments,hud pays off the loan and takes the property.by law,the buyer must meet three conditions before hud will insure the loan sufficient income to make the monthly payments satisfactory credit rating and the ability to make a minimum cash investment in the property see.
under hud regulations and policies,the buyer is not required to have the down payment come out of his or her own or she may receive the down payment as a gift from friends,relatives,or housing assistance organizations.however,the sellers of the property are not permitted to make direct gifts to the buyers.
despite this restriction on sellers,the seller was permitted indirectly to subsidize the down payment by providing money to a organization under the permissible indirect subsidy scheme,after the approved a buyer,the agreed to gift the down payment at closing.the gift was paid out of the own funds,and only after closing did the seller pay the a service fee equal to the gift from the proceeds of the sale.if the closing did not go through,the seller was not required to pay the service fee.the fee was used by the to provide gifts to future home purchasers.
buyers who received the down payment money from an outside source,such as a family member,friend,or nonprofit,were required to submit a gift letter to hud.the gift letter confirmed the source of the gift,the relationship of the donor to the donee,and the nature of the buyer down payment.a copy of the cashier check delivering the gifted funds to escrow was attached also to the gift letter.the gift letter was put into a binder compiling details on the loan.
at the petersons trial,the government expert,travis pham,chief of the insuring and underwriting division of hud,testified that the government relied on the information in the binder,including the gift letter,to determine whether it would insure a loan and for auditing purposes.pham was offered as an expert on hud regulations and policies related to underwriting without objection by the petersons.he said that hud would not insure a loan if the binder contained a false gift letter the down payment could come from the buyer friends,relatives,or a,but money ca go directly from the seller to the buyer.pham further testified that requiring buyers to put down gave the buyer some interest in the property,making it less likely that he or she would default.he explained that the limitations on who may give the buyer money existed also to prevent the seller from increasing the price.
b.the petersons scheme 
at the time of the trial,paul and william peterson ran a home building business called peterson land and development pld.their father started pld,and he later brought paul into the business.paul became a fha and hud builder in the late.sometime in or,william took over from their father as the sales manager for pld.
at trial,paul testified that in the early,he met many potential buyers who wanted to buy homes,had the employment,income,and credit to do so,but just did have the cash to get into the property.paul testified that u nder the fha program,he knew that he could not give the buyer his down payment.he further testified that he spoke to a hud construction analyst,bob hudgins,who told him that although the seller could not directly give the money to the buyer,he could give it to a relative because fha did not care where the donor gets the money.called as a rebuttal witness by the government,hudgins testified that he did not recall the conversation with paul,but even if it had occurred,he could not have advised paul regarding gift letters or mortgage requirements because he had no knowledge of those areas of hud.
paul testified that after he spoke to hudgins,he concluded that he could lawfully assist potential buyers by taking money from pld profits and subsidizing the down payments.to facilitate this plan,the petersons purchased a cashier check in the name of a third party designated by the buyer.the third party never had possession or control of the gifted funds.the petersons then deposited the cashier check into escrow and submitted a gift letter to hud stating that the third party was the donor of the gifted down payment.paul testified that the buyer took the gift letter and had it filled out and signed by the bogus donor.as the sales manager,william was responsible for retrieving the gift letters and explaining that the donor on the gift letter would not actually have to provide any money.
testimony of one of the buyers mm and the parties listed on his gift letter fisher gift letter contradicted paul testimony about how the gift letters were obtained.mm testified that he did not have his parents the purported donors sign the gift letter.mm parents testified that the signatures of their names on the gift letter were forgeries,and that they did not provide mm with any financial assistance for the purchase.
defendants put up the down payment money for numerous transactions between and.several buyers for whom defendants directly funded the down payment later defaulted on their mortgage payments,leading to foreclosure.hud assumed repayment of the loans.
procedural history 
count one of the second superceding indictment charged defendants with conspiracy to violate in violation of.count two charged defendants with violating a and aiding and abetting the commission of a federal crime under.
section a establishes criminal penalties for anyone who,in a matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency,makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false,fictitious,or fraudulent statement or entry.a.
on january,the petersons jury trial commenced.on january,defendants moved for judgment of acquittal under federal rule of criminal procedure,arguing that the source of the money was immaterial to hud.the judge denied the motion.
at the government request,the district court gave ninth circuit model criminal jury instruction on materiality a statement is material if it could have influenced the agency decisions or activities.paul objected to the instruction,arguing that the model jury instruction was too broad because there could be a situation where there is an immaterial or irrational application or statement that the bureaucracy of the government requires,that the person could have submitted a statement to them that was totally immaterial and unrelated to the program,purposes or concerns.paul proposed an alternative jury instruction a statement is material if it important or significant to the government program to which it was submitted.the court rejected the proposed instruction.
the jury found both defendants guilty on both counts of the indictment.the report recommended restitution in the amount of.the recommendation was based on a report by chris hyun,a forensic auditor with hud.hyun calculated a restitution amount for each property equal to the difference between the appraised value of the property at the time of conveyance to hud and hud expenses in making good on the lender mortgage insurance claim.the report did not attribute to the petersons additional losses resulting from discounts or rebates hud provided to the purchasers of foreclosed properties.defendants objected to the requested amount of restitution,arguing that the contribution of the down payments did not proximately cause the homeowners to fail to make their mortgage payments.the district court disagreed with defendants and determined that they were the proximate cause of the loss.it ordered restitution in the full amount requested by the government for the loss incurred by hud.
discussion 
the petersons present three arguments for our consideration the jury instruction was erroneous because it misstated the element of materiality the evidence was insufficient to support a determination that the false gift letters were material to hud and the restitution order was erroneous because the government failed to present evidence that defendants false statements were the direct and proximate cause of the loss.we address each in turn.
jury instruction 
standard of review 
we typically review de novo whether a jury instruction misstates an element of a crime,and we review for abuse of discretion a district court formulation of an instruction.united states dearing,cir.however,i n the absence of a timely objection to the jury instructions,we review for plain error.united states moran,cir per curiam.see also united states nash,cir errors not asserted at trial should be reviewed for plain error pursuant to.b.
a party who objects to any portion of the instructions or to a failure to give a requested instruction must inform the court of the specific objection and the grounds for the objection before the jury retires to deliberate.fed.crim.d.rule requires that a defendant object with adequate objection must state distinctly the matter to which the party objects as well as the grounds of the objection.a defendant mere proposal of an alternate instruction does not satisfy rule standard of specificity.united states elias,cir quoting united states klinger,cir.
an examination of the record reveals that defendants objected to the jury instruction on different grounds below than they do on appeal.at trial,paul offered the following objection 
the objection is basically as to line and,and the government instruction says,a statement is material if it could have influenced the agency or activities.the opposite instruction that offered by defendants is a statement is material if it important or significant to the government program to which it was submitted the ninth circuit instruction,it sort of could have a situation where there is an immaterial or irrational application or statement that the bureaucracy of the government requires,that the person could have submitted a statement to them that was totally immaterial and unrelated to the program,purposes or concerns 
in other words,defendants believed that the fha insistence that down payment funds not come directly from the seller was irrational in terms of the insurance program purposes because fha allowed equally pernicious indirect seller subsidies through,and consequently that the identity of the funds source was immaterial.
in contrast,on appeal,defendants argue that the proper materiality instruction is the statement must have a natural tendency to influence,or be capable of influencing,the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed.see gaudin,at.internal quotation marks omitted.the requested instruction on appeal does not focus on the rationality of the agency decisionmaking process,as did the requested instruction below.rather it focuses on whether the statement is capable of influencing the agency decision.consequently,we review for plain error.
discussion 
we hold that although it would be preferable for district courts to use the definition of materiality approved by the supreme court in gaudin,in this case,the use of the ninth circuit model jury instruction was not plain error.
plain error review requires us to find an error that is plain and affects substantial rights.even if these conditions were met,we may only exercise our discretion to correct the error if it seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.nash,at quoting johnson united states,d.a jury instruction is not plainly erroneous if it is substantially similar to another permissible instruction.united states johnson,cir.
the supreme court has explained that the customary common law test for materiality in false statement statutes such as is whether the statement has a natural tendency to influence,or was capable of influencing,the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed.kungys united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.subsequently,in gaudin,the supreme court reaffirmed the definition of materiality that it applied in kungys.see gaudin,at.see also united states tarallo,cir.
defendants argue that the district court instruction was erroneous,and that the gaudin instruction should have been given for two reasons.first,they argue that the could have portion of the jury instruction was erroneous because it broadened the scope of materiality.under the facts in this case,this argument fails.
the difference between could have influenced and capable of influencing,is sufficiently nebulous that our sister circuits have sometimes used the could have language in opinions furthermore,capable of influencing is an objective test,which looks at the intrinsic capabilities of the false statement itself,rather than the possibility of the actual attainment of its end.united states facchini,cir see also kungys,at.equating predictably capable of affecting with ha ving a natural tendency to affect.could have influenced likewise looks at a statement intrinsic capacity to influence,not its probability of causing influence.as the supreme court has said in a different context,the use of the word could focuses the inquiry on the power of the trier of fact,not on likely behavior or probabilistic matters.see schlup delo,d distinguishing could have convicted from would have convicted.
thus,because could have influenced is substantially similar to the capable of influencing language in the gaudin instruction,we conclude there is not plain error here.see tarallo,at.
defendants second argument regarding the given jury instruction turns on the inclusion of the word activities.here,they argue that a statement could be deemed material even if it was completely incapable of influencing a decision the agency was trying to make.this argument fails because the plain language of the given instruction does not permit a finding of materiality based solely on the utterance of a false statement.rather,under the given instruction,the jury was required to find that the false statement could have actually resulted in a change in position by the agency.again,this is substantially similar to the gaudin instruction.consequently we conclude that the given jury instruction was not plain error under the specific facts of this case.see tarallo,at.
sufficiency of the evidence 
defendants argue that their convictions must be vacated because there is insufficient evidence as a matter of law to support a conclusion that the source of the down payment was material to hud decision to insure the loan.we disagree.
standard of review 
there is sufficient evidence to support a conviction if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d.
discussion 
count two,violations of and 
a conviction under requires the government to prove a statement,falsity,materiality,knowledge,and jurisdiction.united states atalig,cir.the jury is the finder of fact and is entitled to believe or disbelieve the testimony of the department officials.united states gaudin,cir en banc,aff,d.
defendants contest only the materiality of the false gift letters and the source of the down payment.we hold that pham testimony could have led a rational trier of fact to conclude that the false gift letters and the source of the down payment were material to hud.
pham testified that hud would not insure a loan if the case binder contained a false gift letter.pham further testified that we need to know who the donor is and the relationship between the donor and the buyer,and how much the gift was for,and how the money was transferred and where it was from.a reasonable juror could have concluded that the false statements in the fisher gift letter were material because,had hud known that the petersons directly funded the down payment,hud would not have insured the loan.see united states mayberry,cir concluding that the testimony of a hud administrator that the information at issue was highly significant in reviewing mortgage insurance applications was sufficient to establish materiality.
defendants make much of the fact that a could fund the down payment,and the seller could donate money to the,arguing that what mattered to hud was not the source of the down payment,but whether or not it was made.however,this argument ignores pham testimony that hud policies did not permit the seller to gift the money directly to the buyer.
the distinction pham articulated between direct and indirect gifts did not stem from the idiosyncratic predilections of any one approving officer.rather,the requirements were established rules and regulations of clear indication that the statements in the gift letters as to the source of the down payment were predictably capable of influencing hud decisions 
furthermore,it is undisputed that hud has always prohibited direct gifts from sellers.see standards for mortgagor investment in mortgaged property.may,sources of homeowner downpayment,hud mortgagee letter.in fact,paul himself recognized that under the fha program he could not give the buyer his down payment.
as a result,we hold that there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable juror to conclude that the gift letters and the source of the down payment were material to hud.
count one,conspiracy to violate 
defendants were convicted also of violating,which provides 
if two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the united states,or to defraud the united states,or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose,and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy,each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years,or both.
in support of their argument that the evidence was insufficient for their conspiracy convictions,defendants merely reiterate that the statements made with respect to count two were not material.because sufficient evidence supports the convictions for count two and because defendants raise no other argument with respect to the conspiracy convictions,we hold that sufficient evidence supports the conspiracy convictions.
restitution 
defendants raise two arguments challenging the district court order of restitution in the amount of the government presented no evidence that defendants crimes directly or proximately caused the losses and the district court did not make any factual findings to support the restitution order.
standard of review 
we review de novo the legality of a restitution order and,if the order is within the statutory bounds,we review the amount of restitution for abuse of discretion.united states phillips,cir as amended.we review for clear error factual findings supporting an order of restitution.united states berger,cir.
restitution in this case is governed by the mandatory victims restitution act mvra.the mvra requires a defendant to pay restitution to a victim who is directly and proximately harmed as a result of the fraud.id.at quoting a.a victim is a person who has suffered a loss caused by the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense of conviction.united states gamma tech indus,cir quotation marks omitted.the government has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the victim damages were caused by the conduct of which the defendant was convicted.united states rice,cir see also e 
restitution may compensate victims only for actual losses caused by the defendant criminal conduct.gamma tech,at.
defendant conduct need not be the sole cause of the loss,but any subsequent action that contributes to the loss,such as an intervening cause,must be directly related to the defendant conduct.the causal chain may not extend so far,in terms of the facts or the time span,as to become unreasonable.
id.at citations omitted.the main inquiry for causation in restitution cases is whether there was an intervening cause and,if so,whether this intervening cause was directly related to the offense conduct.gordon,at quoting united states meksian,cir.
we recently addressed the issue of proximate cause in the context of restitution for misreporting of financial information.berger.in berger,the defendant falsified borrowing certificates by overstating assets and accounts receivable.id.at.as a result of the falsified statements,several banks loaned millions of dollars to the defendant business based on either nonexistent or substantially overstated collateral.id.at.after a jury convicted the defendant,the district court imposed a sentence of six months in prison and ordered the defendant to pay the lending banks million in restitution.id.at.
on appeal,the defendant challenged the restitution order,arguing that the lending banks losses were not traceable to the fraudulent borrowing certificates,but rather to unrelated financial difficulties.id.at.we disagreed,first observing that t he information in the borrowing certificates was vital because the defendant fraudulent overstatement would,and did,cause the lending banks to advance more money than they otherwise would have.id.at.we continued 
the defendant is probably correct to note that his business financial troubles and a downturn in the electronics market ultimately led to the loan default.he has not demonstrated,however,that external factors were completely to blame for the lending banks losses.even if the default were inevitable,the high amount of the lending banks losses was not.had the defendant not fraudulently stated his business assets on the borrowing certificates,the amount of outstanding debt would have been smaller.that fact was taken into account by the district court,which did not attribute the lending banks entire loss to the fraud.instead,the district court properly focused only on the amount of loss attributable to the falsified borrowing certificates.
id.here,if the petersons had not falsely stated that they were directly the source of the down payments,then the fha would not have insured the defaulted mortgages and would have suffered no losses whatsoever.
similarly,we have upheld restitution orders even where there are multiple links in the causal chain.united states hackett,cir.in hackett,we held that a defendant who pled guilty to aiding and abetting methamphetamine manufacture could be ordered to pay restitution to an insurance company for property damage caused when a started a fire by placing a jar of chemicals used to manufacture methamphetamine on a hot plate.id.at.the defendant obtained supplies that his later used to manufacture methamphetamine,and he had knowledge and understanding of the scope and structure of the enterprise and of the activities of his.id.at.we recognized that there were multiple links in the causal chain,but still held that the defendant conduct was directly related to the resulting loss.id.
under a different statutory scheme,one of our sister circuits addressed the proximate cause issue under similar factual circumstances to the scheme used by the petersons.see united states spicer.in spicer,the defendant was convicted of fraud for submitting documents that intentionally over
