psychotherapist patient privilege 
defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion in excluding under the privilege,testimony by doe therapist,covington,regarding the content of her discussions with doe during therapy.
pursuant to section,subdivision f,doe requested recovery of the cost of psychotherapy provided by covington.section,subdivision f provides that when a crime victim has suffered economic loss as a result of the defendant conduct,the court shall require that the defendant make restitution to the victim or victims in an amount established by court order,based on the amount of loss claimed by the victim or victims or any other showing to the court the court shall order full restitution unless it finds compelling and extraordinary reasons for not doing so,and states them on the record to the extent possible,the restitution order shall be of a dollar amount that is sufficient to fully reimburse the victim or victims for every determined economic loss incurred as the result of the defendant criminal conduct,including,but not limited to,all of the following c mental health counseling expenses,subd.f.subdivision g of section further states that the court shall order full restitution unless it finds compelling and extraordinary reasons for not doing so,and states those reasons on the record.
the word loss,within the meaning of section,must be construed broadly and liberally to uphold the voters intent.citation.because the statute uses the language including,but not limited to these enumerated losses,a trial court may compensate a victim for any economic loss which is proved to be the direct result of the defendant criminal behavior,even if not specifically enumerated in the statute.citation.citation.the only limitation the legislature placed on victim restitution is that the loss must be an economic loss incurred as the result of the defendant criminal conduct.citations.citation.people moore th,d moore.
the standard of review of a restitution order is abuse of discretion.a victim restitution right is to be broadly and liberally construed.citation.when there is a factual and rational basis for the amount of restitution ordered by the trial court,no abuse of discretion will be found by the reviewing court.citations.citation.moore,supra,th at,d.
giving section the requisite broad and liberal construction,we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering defendant to pay restitution for the cost of doe therapy.
background facts 
on november,the trial court granted defendant felony probation pursuant to the terms of defendant guilty plea and ordered defendant to pay doe in restitution for covington therapy charges.the restitution amount was substantiated by a probation memo,which included covington billing summary.the restitution order was entered without prejudice since defense counsel had not seen the probation memo and sought to contest the amount of the restitution.
prior to the contested restitution hearing on may,defendant served a subpoena duces tecum on covington,requesting covington to produce records of doe therapy.the prosecutor moved to quash the subpoena duces tecum.the people motion was heard the day before the restitution hearing.defense counsel claimed covington told him she had not discussed rape with doe during therapy but had discussed a sex tape doe made with her boyfriend.the court deferred ruling on the motion to quash until the restitution hearing the next day.
at the restitution hearing on may,the trial court vacated its previous restitution order and heard the matter anew for the purpose of determining whether therapy charges were causally related to the charged crimes.the prosecutor provided the court with an updated billing summary of covington therapy charges,which totaled.the prosecutor noted that had been paid by doe insurance carrier,pacificare and was paid by doe.defense counsel objected to the billing summary on the ground doe was not entitled to recover the entire amount requested in the billing summary.
at the restitution hearing,doe testified the billing summary reflected covington therapy charges,and all of the charges were based on therapy relating to the charged crimes.on,the trial court sustained the prosecutor objection,based on the privilege,to defense counsel questions regarding what doe discussed with covington during therapy.when asked if doe spoke with covington about being raped,doe said she had.the trial court told defense counsel not to inquire further regarding the topic.doe testified she first met with covington after the charged crimes and had not seen any other psychologist or psychiatrist prior to meeting with covington.the court sustained the prosecutor objection,based on the privilege,to defense counsel asking doe if everything doe spoke about with covington pertained to the rape.
covington testified at the restitution hearing that she did not recall telling defense counsel that doe never told her she had been raped.the trial court asked covington whether she had ever seen doe prior to may,the date of the charged crimes.covington first saw doe on may.the court asked covington if,w ithout revealing any of the substance of what was discussed in any way,was the therapy provided to doe causally related to those allegations covington said,yes.

as to waiver of the privilege,evidence code section states there is no privilege under this article as to a communication relevant to an issue concerning the mental or emotional condition of the patient if such issue has been tendered by a the patient 
evidence code section further states regarding waiver a except as otherwise provided in this section,the right of any person to claim a privilege provided by evidence code section privilege is waived with respect to a communication protected by the privilege if any holder of the privilege,without coercion,has disclosed a significant part of the communication or has consented to disclosure made by anyone.consent to disclosure is manifested by any statement or other conduct of the holder of the privilege indicating consent to the disclosure,including failure to claim the privilege in any proceeding in which the holder has the legal standing and opportunity to claim the privilege.
discussion 
defendant argues doe waived the privilege by requesting restitution for the cost of her therapy.we disagree.there was no waiver of the privilege.
defendant cites in re lifschutz cal d,lifschutz,for the proposition that the trial court erred in relying on the privilege,in excluding covington testimony regarding the contents of doe therapy sessions.in lifschutz,a psychiatrist was held in contempt for refusing to answer deposition questions and produce records relating to treatment of a former patient who was claiming mental and emotional distress damages in a civil lawsuit against a third party defendant.id.at.lifschutz asserted the privilege applied.ibid.the california supreme court concluded lifschutz patient waived the privilege by instituting the civil lawsuit.id.at.
the court in lifschutz acknowledged that an environment of confidentiality of treatment is vitally important to the successful operation of psychotherapy.california has embraced this view through the enactment of a broad,protective privilege.lifschutz,supra,cal d at.the lifschutz court nevertheless concluded the exception to the privilege,at issue in this case,does not unconstitutionally infringe the constitutional rights of privacy of either psychotherapists or psychotherapeutic patients.as we point out,however,because of the potential of invasion of patients constitutional interests,trial courts should properly and carefully control compelled disclosures in this area in the light of accepted principles.id.at.
in lifschutz,supra,cal d,the court noted that the exception to the privilege involves only that special instance in which a patient has chosen to forego the confidentiality of the privilege,id.at.the lifschutz court concluded the exception applied since the patient,who was the holder of the privilege,placed his mental condition at issue by suing for mental and emotional distress and by disclosing at a deposition that he had consulted lifschutz for psychiatric treatment.he thus waived whatever privilege he might have had to keep such information confidential.id.at.the lifschutz court stated it was mindful of the justifiable expectations of confidentiality that most individuals seeking psychotherapeutic treatment harbor id.at,and noted that waiver of the privilege thus did not require unlimited disclosure t he exception allows only a limited inquiry into the confidences of the relationship,compelling disclosure of only those matters directly relevant to the nature of the specific emotional or mental condition which the patient has voluntarily disclosed and tendered in his pleadings or in answer to discovery inquiries.furthermore,even when confidential information falls within this exception,trial courts,because of the intimate and potentially embarrassing nature of such communications,may utilize the protective measures at their disposal to avoid unwarranted intrusions into the confidences of the relationship.ibid.
in the instant case,doe did not put her emotional or mental condition at issue by seeking in a civil action damages for mental or emotional distress.rather,in a criminal proceeding,she informed the court of her monetary losses caused by defendant crimes.this was for the purpose of facilitating the court statutory mandate to order defendant to pay full restitution for his crimes.unlike in lifschutz,supra,cal d,doe own action did not initiate the exposure.doe merely was a crime victim and the trial court was required to order defendant to pay her for all of her losses arising from defendant crimes.
requiring a victim of a sexual assault or rape,such as doe,to disclose the details of her communications with her therapist when requesting restitution for therapy costs would tend to deter victim from requesting restitution for the cost of therapy it would be too much to expect them to do so if they knew that all they say and all that the psychiatrist learns from what they say may be revealed to the whole world from a witness stand.lifschutz,supra,cal d at.as the lifschutz court noted,when questioning the psychotherapist or patient as to confidential communications at trial,the danger of publicity and embarrassment increases.id.at.the crime victim no doubt has already suffered the humiliation and trauma of being victimized by the defendant.
furthermore,disclosure of doe communications with covington during therapy was not necessary.unless the information sought is directly relevant and necessary to determining the issue before the court,the communication is privileged and disclosure can not be compelled.lifschutz,supra,cal d at.the state interest of facilitating the ascertainment of truth in connection with legal proceedings relating to restitution required inquiry only into whether doe therapy related to or arose from being victimized by defendant.id.at.this determination was accomplished by means of doe and covington testimony stating the therapy began shortly after the charged crimes and related to doe being victimized by defendant.covington further provided a billing summary establishing the cost and dates of the therapy.prying into the specifics of confidential communications was not necessary for purposes of ordering restitution.
in carrying out the trial court statutory mandate to order restitution to the victim,the trial court appropriately exercised its discretion in balancing the defendant need to discern the actual loss sustained by the victim and the victim interest in avoiding being compelled unnecessarily to disclose personal,confidential matters disclosed during therapy.the trial court reasonably concluded that,for purposes of determining the amount of restitution defendant was obligated to pay,further inquiry into the content of covington and doe communications during therapy was unnecessarily invasive.
even assuming doe waived the privilege,such waiver must be construed not as a complete waiver of the privilege but only as a limited waiver concomitant with the purposes of the exception.lifschutz,supra,cal d at.under evidence code section,disclosure was required only as to necessary information directly related to doe restitution claim.ibid.we conclude the trial court appropriately allowed only a limited inquiry into the confidences of the relationship,compelling disclosure of only those matters directly relevant to the issue of restitution for doe therapy costs.id.at.
enforcement of defendant subpoena duces tecum of doe therapy records 
defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion in failing to compel enforcement of defendant subpoena duces tecum of doe therapy records.
prior to the contested restitution hearing on may,defendant served a subpoena duces tecum on covington,requesting records of doe therapy.the prosecutor moved to quash the subpoena duces tecum.the prosecutor motion was heard the day before the restitution hearing.
