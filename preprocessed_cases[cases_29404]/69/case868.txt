the appeal in this diversity breach of contract suit governed mainly by illinois law presents issues involving the enforceability of a liquidated damages clause found by the district judge to be a penalty,contract interpretation,patent law,and sanctions for making frivolous claims.
the plaintiff,xco,owned and foreign mainly european patents on cables.in it assigned the patents to the defendant,pacsci,which wanted to use them in making products for fire control and related uses.pacsci agreed to pay xco down,plus or percent of pacsci sales of products utilizing the patented amount was from through after that it would pay percent of annual sales until the patents expired.as part of the deal,pacsci licensed the patents that it had just bought back to xco for use in making cables for lining refractory process vessels used for processing petroleum products,which was the core of xco business,its principal market being in europe.as the consideration for this license xco agreed to pay pacsci plus royalties on sales of the cables for the licensed use.the parties further agreed that pacsci would be responsible for all expenses of any kind relating to the patent rights that it was buying,including the fees charged by european patent authorities to maintain patents in effect.the patent and trademark office charges fees for patents,but payment of those fees is not in issue.
the agreement was to continue until the last of the patents expired in.beginning in,however,just two years after the agreement had been signed,pacsci stopped paying maintenance fees on those patents that it was using.it took the position that notwithstanding the responsibility clause of the contract,it could pick and choose which patents to keep alive.as a result,by a number of the patents had lapsed.xco declared a breach that year and terminated the contract,as it was entitled to do without liability if in fact pacsci had committed a breach.a provision in a section of the contract captioned breach and liquidated damages states that in the event of such a termination all money owed xco by pacsci,including such amounts which constitute overdue,delinquent or otherwise unpaid amounts plus one hundred thousand dollars per year from and including the year of such termination to and including the year of the last to expire of the patent rights,shall then constitute liquidated damages under this agreement.another provision,also in the breach and liquidated damages section,states that if xco breaks the contract,pacsci will have no further obligations except to pay xco any amounts that came due before the breach in other words,from the date of a breach by xco forward,pacsci would have a license.so damages were specified for a breach by either party.
because xco terminated the contract in and the last patent expired in,and because the in liquidated damages was due in both the year in which the contract was terminated and the year in which the last patent expired,as well as in all the intermediate years,the clause,if valid,entitles xco to in damages.the district judge held that it is a penalty clause,hence invalid.he ruled so on summary judgment,while rejecting pacsci interpretation of the responsibility clause.he found,in other words,that pacsci had broken the contract but since xco did not attempt to prove its actual damages,instead seeking only liquidated damages,xco got no relief for the breach.
there is also a counterclaim.beginning in xco had begun manufacturing a somewhat different kind of cable,for which it has applied for a patent.pacsci counterclaimed for royalties on xco sales of the new cable,citing a clause in the contract which states that pacsci is purchasing not only the patents listed in the contract but also all purchasing,manufacturing,marketing,sales and installation information and materials including,drawings,sketches,plans,designs,specifications,data,methods,processes,techniques,inventions or discoveries whether patentable or not which relate in any way to the products covered by the patent rights emphasis added.another clause,however,provides that if any such additional proprietary subject matter is first conceived reduced to practice by or on behalf of xco during the term of this agreement,then title thereto shall vest in and remain xco exclusive property.the district judge rejected the counterclaim,and pacsci has appealed that ruling.but the judge also rejected xco request for sanctions for the filing of the counterclaim xco had argued that the counterclaim was frivolous and in addition that pacsci was trying to inject into the case an issue of patent whether xco new patent if issued would infringe patents that it had assigned to complying with the standards laid down by the federal circuit for proving infringement.xco claims to have incurred nearly in legal fees and other expenses to defend against the counterclaim.
xco appeal challenges the district judge denial of its motion for sanctions as well as his refusal to enforce the liquidated damages clause.in defending the latter ruling pacsci not only embraces the judge determination but also argues that letting the patents lapse was not a breach of contract after all.
when damages for breach of contract would be difficult for a court to determine after the breach occurs,it makes sense for the parties to specify in the contract itself what the damages for a breach shall be this reduces uncertainty and litigation costs and economizes on judicial resources as well.indeed,even if damages would be difficult to determine after the fact,it is hard to see why the parties should be allowed to substitute their own ex ante determination for the ex post determination of a court.damages would be just another contract provision that parties would be permitted to negotiate under the general rubric of freedom of contract.one could even think of a liquidated damages clause as a partial settlement,as in cases in which damages are stipulated and trial confined to liability issues.and of course settlements are favored.
yet it is a rule of the common law of contracts,in illinois as elsewhere,that unless the parties ex ante estimate of damages is reasonable,their liquidated damages provision is unenforceable,as constituting a penalty intended to force performance.bauer sawyer,checkers eight.partnership hawkins,cir illinois law lake river carborundum,cir same med plus neck back pain center,noffsinger,d,see also truck,puritan farms.the reason for the rule is mysterious it is one of the abiding mysteries of the common law.at least in a case such as this,where both parties are substantial commercial enterprises ironically,it is the larger firm,pacsci,that is crying penalty clause,and where damages are liquidated for breach by either party,making an inference of fraud or duress implausible,it is difficult to see why the law should take an interest in whether the estimate of harm underlying the liquidation of damages is reasonable.courts do review the other provisions of contracts for reasonableness why this one 
it is true that if there is a very stiff penalty for breach,parties will be discouraged from committing efficient breaches,that is,breaches that confer a greater benefit on the contract breaker than on the victim of the breach,in which event breach plus compensation for the victim produces a net gain with no losers and should be encouraged.this is a reason why injunctions are not routinely granted in contract,in other words,the party who breaks his contract is usually allowed to walk away from it,provided only that he compensates the other party for the cost of the breach to that party.but against this consideration must be set the worthwhile effect of a penalty as a signal that the party subject to it is likely to perform his contract promise.this makes him a more attractive contract partner,since if he does perform he will be punished severely.his willingness to assume that risk signals his confidence that he will be able to perform and thus avoid the penalty.it makes him a credible person to do business with,and thus promotes commerce.
granted,the case for a contractual specification of damages is stronger the more difficult it is to estimate damages and so the greater the expense to the parties and the judiciary,and hence to society,of determining the plaintiff damages by the clumsy and costly methods of litigation.that presumably is why the enforceability of liquidated damages clauses depends on the difficulty of estimating,when the contract is signed,what the damages will be if the contract is broken.yet in such cases the plaintiff will often be able to obtain injunctive relief instead of damages,on the ground that his damages remedy is inadequate,that being the standard criterion for injunctive relief and an injunction often has a punitive effect because the cost to the defendant of complying with it will often exceed the harm to the plaintiff from the enjoined conduct.the fact that injunctions are sometimes granted in contract cases shows,therefore,that punishment is not wholly alien to contractual remedies.at a minimum one might suppose penalty clauses tolerable to the extent that the penalty portion approximated the costs in attorneys fees and other expenses of proving damages for breach of contract.
the explanation for the rule against penalty clauses may be purely it is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of henry iv.holmes,the path of the law,harv.the slow pace at which the common law changes makes it inevitable that some common law rules will be vestigial,even fossilized.when a person comes into court seeking relief,the court naturally is inclined to ask why it should get involved in the matter.the court is busy,its resources limited.it wants to see some potential benefit from judicial intervention before it will lift a finger.the rules of contract law have remote origins,predating the era of freedom of contract and the ideology of free markets.thus,when parties to contracts first sought damages for breach in cases in which the contract when broken had still been executory,courts declined to oblige they could see what harm had been done when the victim of the breach had yet paid anything or begun to perform.flureau thornhill,eng.basiliko pargo,allan farnsworth,farnsworth on contracts,ed morton horwitz,the historical foundations of modern contract law,harv.they were not moved by the fact that the parties,presumably rational,had thought it in their mutual interest to be able to enter into an enforceable executory contract.
here the historical record is murkier because there was an early period in which penal bonds were enforced,farnsworth,supra,horwitz,supra,harv.at william loyd,penalties and forfeitures,harv.courts have had difficulty seeing what benefit would be conferred by awarding in effect punitive damages for breach of contract.because liability for breach is strict though the strictness is somewhat ameliorated by such defenses as impossibility and frustration,contract breakers often are innocent in a moral sense.breach of contract is not a tort,so should not be so the reasoning goes.
the rule against penalty clauses,though it lingers,has come to seem rather an anachronism,especially in cases in which commercial enterprises are on both sides of the contract.as we noted in operating engineers local health benefit fund gustafson construction,cir,it is easy to assign nonexploitive reasons for contractual penalties and hard to give convincing reasons why in the absence of fraud or unconscionability consenting adults that are,moreover,substantial organizations rather than mere consumers should be prohibited from agreeing to such provisions.see also lawyers title ins.dearborn title,cir lake river carborundum,supra,at.the rule hangs on,but is chastened by an emerging presumption against interpreting liquidated damages clauses as penalty clauses.metlife capital financial washington associates,circle b enterprises,steinke,wallace real estate investment,groves,rohlin construction city of hinton,iowa pierce b c electric,d,richard lord,williston on contracts,ed penske truck leasing chemetco,d,vasso,d,but checkers eight.partnership hawkins,supra,at illinois law.
whatever the strength and contours of the rule in illinois today,pacsci is wholly in error in arguing that a liquidated damages clause is invalid unless it recites,or extrinsic evidence shows,that the parties determined that,yes,it really would be difficult to determine damages for breach after the breach occurred.no case in illinois or anywhere else so holds or implies,and the rejection of the argument is implicit in the numerous cases that hold such clauses valid which do not contain such recitals,even when there is no extrinsic evidence to fill the gap.see,first national bank atlantic,cir penske truck leasing chemetco,supra,at in re graham square,cir.pacsci has tried to reverse the burden of proof,which,as in the case of other affirmative defenses,rests on the party resisting enforcement of a liquidated damages clause to show that the damages are clearly disproportionate to a reasonable estimate of the actual damages likely to be caused by a breach,weiss united states fidelity guaranty,pace communications,moonlight design,cir first national bank atlantic,supra,at vasso,supra,at honey dew associates,m k food,cir joseph sanson investment.
the burden of proving the invalidity of the liquidated damages clause in the contract with xco thus remained on pacsci and it is apparent from the nature of the breach of to pay fees,as a predictable result of which the patents pacsci failed to carry it.and breach it was pacsci argument that because it was made responsible for the fees it could decide not to pay interpretation that deprives the responsibility clause of all force,as well as wreaking semantic havoc responsibility signifies duty,not right does not merit discussion.
the premature lapse of xco european patents exposed xco to competition that the patents,had they remained valid,might well have might not have.that would be a costly and uncertain issue for a court to resolve.about all the court could say would be that given the scale of xco operations,a year from the breach to the termination of the last patent was not an outlandish estimate of the damages that xco might sustain as a result of pacsci allowing the patents to lapse.this case thus illustrates how a liquidated damages clause can spare the parties and the court the anxiety and expense of protracted and uncertain remedy proceedings.first national bank atlantic,supra,at jkc holding.llc washington sports ventures,cir farmers export georgis prois,cir.
the element common to most liquidated damages clauses that get struck down as penalty clauses is that they specify the same damages regardless of the severity of the breach.checkers eight.partnership hawkins,supra,at lake river carborundum,supra,at investments,marsala,d,kalenka taylor,alaska.one can see the problem if a contract provides that breaches of different gravity shall be sanctioned with equal severity,it is highly likely that the sanction specified for the mildest breach is a penalty that,or the sanctions for all the other possible breaches must be inadequate.that would have been the case here if instead of fixing the damages at per year,the damages clause had recited for example that in the event of breach pacsci must pay xco,period.then if pacsci failed to pay only the maintenance fee due six months before the last patent expired,it would owe the same damages that it would owe had it never paid any of the maintenance fees and as a result all of xco patents had lapsed within a year after the contract was signed.that is how the clause works.instead,by proportioning damages to the remaining life of the patents,it sanctions pacsci more heavily the longer the life that remained to them when pacsci allowed them to lapse.american national bank trust regional transportation authority,cir penske truck leasing chemetco,supra,at builder concrete fred faubel sons,d,information systems networks city of kansas city,cir.
yet the proportionality of the damages specification highlights by way of contrast the only halfway decent argument that pacsci has against the validity of the liquidated damages clause.this is that the clause fails to differentiat
