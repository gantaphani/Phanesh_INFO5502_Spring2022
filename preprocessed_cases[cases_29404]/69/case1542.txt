background 
effective may,the army awarded sdc a contract for the production of circuit card assemblies for hawk missile systems.shortly thereafter,a dispute arose between sdc and the army regarding alleged defects in the specifications for the circuit card assemblies.the parties attempted to resolve the dispute without success.
on november,sdc requested that the contract be terminated for convenience thereafter,on april,despite the fact that the contract had not yet been terminated,sdc submitted a termination settlement proposal form seeking a net payment of.the proposal did not include a claim for equitable adjustment.because the claim letter did not provide sufficient information regarding why sdc feels there has been a constructive termination for convenience of these contracts,the co advised sdc on june,that he could not issue a final decision.
on february,the co terminated the contract for convenience and,on april,sdc submitted a new termination settlement proposal for.this proposal included for other costs and for expenses,which consisted of the hours of labor required to settle the termination.again,the proposal did not include any equitable adjustment claims.by letter dated november,sdc offered to reduce its termination settlement proposal to,which included other costs of and settlement expenses in the amount of.the termination contracting officer tco issued a final decision awarding sdc to settle the contract termination on march.with respect to the claimed other costs and settlement expenses,the tco determined that certain of sdc proposed costs actually constituted direct expenses for employees whose full salaries remained charged to the overall g a expense pool and that there was inadequate support for the remainder.accordingly,the tco denied these proposed costs and expenses to avoid double payment.
at this point,sdc had the option of appealing the tco final decision to either the board or the court of federal claims.under the contract disputes act cda,a contractor may appeal a decision to an agency board of contract appeals within ninety days of the contractor receipt of the decision.therefore,sdc had until june,to pursue that route.alternatively,the cda provides that an action may be filed in the court of federal claims within twelve months of the contractor receipt of the decision.id.sdc took no action within timeframe.instead,sdc filed an action in the court of federal claims on march,just shy of one year after the issuance of the tco final decision.
at the court of federal claims,sdc sought,among other things,in costs and expenses.in addition,sdc case at the court of federal claims went beyond appealing issues resolved in the tco final decision.for the first time,sdc also sought equitable adjustments of almost million consisting of for defective specifications for the army alleged breach of covenants of fair dealing and cooperation and for the army alleged bad faith.the government moved to dismiss,arguing that the court of federal claims did not have jurisdiction to entertain the equitable adjustment claims because the claims had never been submitted to a co,a prerequisite to suit in the court of federal claims or review by the board.see arctic slope native ass sebelius.on january,while the government motion was pending,the parties filed a joint stipulation of dismissal pursuant to rule a ii of the rules of the court of federal claims rcfc.after the stipulated dismissal was filed,sdc took no further appeal from the tco march,final decision.
on february,sdc submitted new claims to the army.sdc again sought in termination costs and expenses arising out of the termination for convenience a cost category that had been disallowed previously by the tco.in addition,sdc now sought over million in equitable adjustments to the contract for defective specifications,the army alleged breach of the duty of fair dealing and cooperation,and the army alleged bad faith.on september,the co issued a final decision denying termination settlement costs on the grounds that the claim had already been addressed in the tco march,final decision and was not reversed on appeal.noting that sdc faces serious problems with regard to its ability to prove its entitlement to and the amount of its alleged damages,the co denied the equitable adjustment claims on the merits.
sdc timely appealed the co september,decision to the board.the board separately analyzed the termination settlement costs and equitable adjustment claims and dismissed the appeal on october,on the basis that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain either type of claim.the board dismissal of the termination settlement claim was based on sdc failure to appeal the tco march,final decision on those costs to the board within the limitation in the cda.with regard to the equitable adjustment claims,the board noted that the cda requires a contractor to submit its claims against the government within six years of accrual of the claim.a.the board found that sdc knew of the basis for its equitable adjustment claims no later than november.accordingly,the board dismissed the equitable adjustment claims because sdc did not assert them before the cda limitations ran.
this appeal followed.we have jurisdiction to review the board october,final decision under a.

as noted,the board dismissed sdc appeal in its entirety for lack of jurisdiction.because the termination settlement costs claim and equitable adjustment claims implicate separate jurisdictional issues,we address each in turn.
the board dismissed sdc claim for termination settlement costs as untimely.it noted that sdc had previously requested termination settlement costs as part of its termination settlement proposal and that the tco march,settlement determination denied those exact costs.sdc never appealed that determination to the board.the board concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to review costs resolved in a termination settlement decision made more than five years earlier.
the cda,as discussed above,permits a contractor,following issuance of a final decision,ninety days to appeal to the board,or twelve months to appeal to the court of federal claims.in order to timely appeal the tco decision regarding termination settlement costs to the board,sdc needed to file its appeal no later than june.sdc elected,however,to wait until nearly a year later to appeal to the court of federal claims.it then voluntarily dismissed that appeal.by that time,the period for appealing the march,decision to the board had.sdc took no further action to contest the tco resolution of its claim for termin
