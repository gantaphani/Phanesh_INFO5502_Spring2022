in march,gary zwicker suffered an injury that resulted in the loss of his left testicle.in february,after three tests showed he was infertile,gary married plaintiff valri ann zwicker.two weeks later,gary and valri sued various defendants who they claimed had failed to diagnose gary condition in time to prevent the loss of his testicle and his infertility.the trial court granted summary judgment against valri on her cause of action for loss of consortium on the ground she was not married to gary at the time her claim arose.
on appeal,valri claims her cause of action for loss of consortium did not accrue until she knew or should have known that gary infertility was permanent,which did not occur until after they were married.we conclude valri knowledge of gary infertility is irrelevant as to whether she has a valid cause of action for loss of consortium.because she was not married to gary at the time of the alleged misdiagnosis,valri never had a valid cause of action for loss of consortium,and her alleged postmarital discovery of gary permanent infertility could not create a cause of action where one did not exist in the first place.accordingly,we will affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural history 
for purposes of this appeal,the following facts are undisputed on march,gary zwicker went to the emergency room at sutter tracy community hospital complaining of pain in his left scrotum.emergency room physician adin levine,examined him and ordered an ultrasound,which was reviewed by radiologist james wu,wu determined there was no evidence of testicular torsion,and gary was discharged with antibiotics and told to follow up with his own physician.
the next day,gary felt increased pain in his scrotum and went to the emergency room at a hospital in santa rosa.a urologist there diagnosed acute left scrotum with probable torsion of spermatic cord and performed emergency surgery.the urologist found that the left spermatic cord was torsed and that gary left testicle was necrotic so he removed the testicle.
over the next months,gary underwent three semen analyses,each of which indicated he was infertile.shortly after the third semen analysis in february,gary and valri were married.two weeks later,gary and valri filed an action for damages against defendants altamont emergency room physicians medical group,levine,wu,and sutter tracy community hospital collectively defendants the complaint alleged that defendants had negligently failed to diagnose and treat gary condition,resulting in sterility,among other things.the sole claim alleged by valri was a claim for loss of consortium.valri complained that as a result of defendants negligence,gary was incapable of impregnating her.
defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing that valri could not claim loss of consortium because she and gary were not married when defendants allegedly failed to diagnose and treat gary condition properly.in opposition to the motions,valri argued she had a valid claim for loss of consortium because gary current infertility is an injury manifesting at the present time and during the time frame of a valid marriage between gary and valri zwicker.the trial court granted the motions on the ground that valri was not married to gary at the time her claim for loss of consortium arose.valri appeals 
discussion 
relying on cases involving the statute of limitations on medical malpractice claims,valri contends she has a valid cause of action for loss of consortium based on defendants negligent failure to diagnose gary condition because her cause of action did not accrue until she knew or should have known that gary infertility was permanent,which did not occur until after they were married.defendants,on the other hand,contend valri has no valid loss of consortium claim because she knew about gary fertility problems before their marriage,even if she did not know those problems were permanent.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude the timing and extent of valri knowledge of gary infertility is irrelevant to the proper resolution of this case.i n california each spouse has a cause of action for loss of consortium caused by a negligent or intentional injury to the other spouse by a third party.rodriguez bethlehem steel cal d,rodriguez.by definition,however,a loss of consortium is the loss of certain rights and privileges inhering in the marital relationship,including companionship,emotional support,love,and sexual relations.see id.at.in california,the right to recover for loss of consortium is founded on the relationship of marriage,and absent such a relationship the right does not exist.elden sheldon cal d,elden.
here,valri and gary were not married when defendants allegedly failed to diagnose gary testicular torsion,resulting in gary loss of fertility.because valri had no right to gary consortium at the time of the misdiagnosis,she suffered no actionable loss as a result of defendants alleged negligence.that valri may have discovered some time after the marriage that gary was permanently infertile makes no difference.a premarital injury does not give rise to a cause of action for loss of consortium at the time it occurs,and the postmarital discovery of the premarital injury can not create a cause of action for loss of consortium where one did not exist in the first place.accordingly,the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on valri claim.
