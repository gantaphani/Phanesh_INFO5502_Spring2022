robert bosch llc bosch appeals from the order of the united states district court for the district of delaware,denying bosch motion for entry of a permanent injunction.because the district court abused its discretion when it denied a permanent injunction on this record,we reverse and remand with instructions to enter an appropriate injunction.
background 
this is a patent infringement case involving windshield wiper technology,specifically wiper blades beam blades.beam blades are a relatively new technology that offers several advantages over conventional,or bracketed,wiper blades,including more evenly distributed pressure across the length of the blade and better performance in inclement weather.part of bosch business involves developing wiper blades,and bosch owns patents covering various aspects of beam blade technology.in addition to its research and development efforts,bosch sells blades to both original equipment manufacturers and aftermarket retailers.pylon manufacturing,llc pylon also sells beam blades and has competed with bosch for business from retailers such as wal mart.
in august,bosch sued pylon in the district of delaware,alleging infringement of patent the patent,the patent,the patent,and the patent on june,during a hearing regarding bosch alleged failure to produce certain financial data,the court informed the parties of its preference for bifurcating the issue of damages and suggested that this procedural mechanism may address the parties discovery dispute.in response,pylon moved to bifurcate the issues of damages and willfulness,a request that bosch opposed.the district court granted pylon motion,noting its determin ation that bifurcation is appropriate,if not necessary,in all but exceptional patent cases.memorandum order,robert bosch llc pylon,cv,ecf.
the parties subsequently moved for summary judgment with respect to the validity and infringement of various claims.on march,the district court granted pylon motion for summary judgment of noninfringement of the patent,but denied its motion for summary judgment of invalidity of the and patents.the court also granted bosch motions for summary judgment of infringement of claims and of the patent and no inequitable conduct and no invalidity for derivation as to the and patents.the remaining issues were tried to a jury,which found claim of both the and patents valid and infringed claims and of the patent infringed,but invalid for obviousness and claims and of the patent invalid based on obviousness and derivation.
in light of the jury determination that pylon infringed valid claims of the and patents,bosch moved for entry of a permanent injunction.in a memorandum opinion dated november,the court denied the motion on grounds that bosch failed to show that it would suffer irreparable harm.at the outset of its analysis,the district court noted an apparent difficulty faced by courts struggling to balance the absence of a presumption of irreparable harm with a patentee right to exclude,and observed that other courts had frequently focused upon the nature of the competition between plaintiff and defendant in the relevant market in the context of evaluating irreparable harm and the adequacy of money damages.robert bosch llc pylon,d.the court also discerned a tendency among district courts to award permanent injunctions under circumstances in which the plaintiff practices its invention and is a direct market competitor and where the plaintiff patented technology is at the core of its business id.at.
with these factors in mind,the court proceeded to assess the nature of the competition between bosch and pylon.in doing so,the court identified deficiencies it perceived in bosch presentation of the competitive landscape,including a failure to provide a clear,overview of the relevant market and a breakdown illuminating the parties relative market percentages.id.at.the court also focused on the fact that t his is not a clear case of a market wherein a sale to pylon necessarily represents the loss of a sale to bosch and wiper blades alone are not at the core of bosch business.id.at.based on its conclusion that bosch fail ed to define a relevant market the existence of additional competitors and the nature of bosch wiper blade business in relation to its business as a whole,the court concluded that bosch failed to show it would suffer irreparable harm.id.finding the absence of irreparable harm fatal to bosch motion,the court denied the request for an injunction without addressing the remaining equitable factors of the permanent injunction inquiry.
bosch timely appealed the district court interlocutory order,asserting jurisdiction under and.

bosch counters that the additional hurdles cited by pylon apply only in cases involving orders that do not expressly deny an injunction,but have the effect of denying injunctive relief.because its appeal is from an order explicitly denying a request for an injunction,bosch contends that it need not make any additional showing for jurisdiction to attach under a.we agree.
this court has made clear that a party appealing an order that expressly grants or denies a permanent injunction need not also demonstrate that the order will have a serious,perhaps irreparable consequence and that the order can be effectively challenged only by immediate appeal.see cross med,at.when confronted with this issue in cross medical,we explained that these carson requirements apply only where there is no order specifically granting or denying injunctive relief,but the appellant argues that the appealed order has the effect of granting or denying such relief.id.we also observed that the supreme court had confirmed our reading of carson as applying only to orders that have the practical effect of granting or denying injunctions.id.at quoting gulfstream aerospace mayacamas,section a will,of course,continue to provide appellate jurisdiction over orders that grant or deny injunctions and orders that have the practical effect of granting or denying injunctions and have serious,perhaps irreparable,consequence.internal quotation marks omitted.it is,thus,that,if the district court order expressly grants or denies an injunction,the order is appealable under a,without regard to whether the appellant is able to demonstrate serious or irreparable consequences.id.quoting james moore et,moore federal practice a,at ed.

discussion 
consistent with traditional equitable principles,a patentee seeking a permanent injunction must make a showing 
that it has suffered an irreparable injury that remedies available at law,such as monetary damages,are inadequate to compensate for that injury that,considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and the defendant,a remedy in equity is warranted and that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.
ebay mercexchange.prior to the supreme court decision in ebay,this court followed the general rule that a permanent injunction will issue once infringement and validity have been adjudged,absent a sound reason to deny such relief.see,richardson suzuki motor,citing gore,garlock.in addition,at least in the context of preliminary injunctive relief,we applied an express presumption of irreparable harm upon finding that a plaintiff was likely to succeed on the merits of a patent infringement claim.see smith int l,hughes tool,we hold that where validity and continuing infringement have been clearly established,as in this case,immediate irreparable harm is presumed.footnotes omitted.based on our case law,district courts also have applied a presumption of irreparable harm following judgment of infringement and validity to support the issuance of permanent injunctions.see,fisher price,safety,d,entering a permanent injunction after noting that irreparable harm is presumed in patent cases boehringer ingelheim vetmedica,scheringplough,d,same 
in ebay,the supreme court made clear that broad classifications and categorical rule s have no place in this inquiry.at.instead,courts are to exercise their discretion in accordance with traditional principles of equity.id.at.the supreme court,however,did not expressly address the presumption of irreparable harm,and our subsequent cases have not definitively clarified whether that presumption remains intact.see broadcom qualcomm,it remains an open question whether there remains a rebuttable presumption of irreparable harm following ebay.internal quotation marks and citation omitted our statements on this topic have led one district court judge to conclude that the presumption of irreparable harm is at best on life support.red bend google,wl,at,citations omitted.we take this opportunity to put the question to rest and confirm that ebay jettisoned the presumption of irreparable harm as it applies to determining the appropriateness of injunctive relief.in so holding,we join at least two of our sister circuits that have reached the same conclusion as it relates to a similar presumption in copyright infringement matters.see perfect,google,wl,at cir,w e conclude that our longstanding rule that a showing of a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits in a copyright infringement claim raises a presumption of irreparable harm is clearly irreconcilable with the reasoning of the court decision in ebay and has therefore been effectively overruled.internal quotation marks and citations omitted salinger colting,cir finding that ebay abrogated the presumption of irreparable harm in copyright cases.
although ebay abolishes our general rule that an injunction normally will issue when a patent is found to have been valid and infringed,it does not swing the pendulum in the opposite direction.in other words,even though a successful patent infringement plaintiff can no longer rely on presumptions or other to support a request for a permanent injunction,it does not follow that courts should entirely ignore the fundamental nature of patents as property rights granting the owner the right to exclude.indeed,this right has its roots in the constitution,as the intellectual property clause of the constitution itself refers to inventors exclusive right to their respective discoveries.const.art.i,cl.emphasis added.although the supreme court disapproved of this court absolute reliance on the patentee right to exclude as a basis for our prior rule favoring injunctions,that does not mean that the nature of patent rights has no place in the appropriate equitable analysis.see ebay,u.at according to the court of appeals,this statutory right to exclude alone justifies its general rule in favor of permanent injunctive relief.but the creation of a right is distinct from the provision of remedies for violations of that right.while the patentee right to exclude alone can not justify an injunction,it should not be ignored either.see acumed llc stryker,finding in a decision that,i n view of that right to exclude,infringement may cause a patentee irreparable harm not remediable by a reasonable royalty.
the abolition of categorical rules and the district court inherent discretion to fashion equitable relief,moreover,also do not mandate that district courts must act on a clean slate.discretion is not whim,and limiting discretion according to legal standards helps promote the basic principle of justice that like cases should be decided alike.ebay,at roberts,concurring quoting martin franklin capital corp.in this area,as others,a page of history is worth a volume of logic when it comes to discerning and applying those standards.id.quoting new york trust eisner,holmes.this wisdom is particularly apt in traditional cases,such as this,where the patentee and adjudged infringer both practice the patented technology.see id.at kennedy,concurring contrasting the relevant considerations in traditional patent infringement actions with certain cases arising now in which firms use patents not as a basis for producing and selling goods but,instead,primarily for obtaining licensing fees,w hen the patented invention is but a small component of the product,and those involving the burgeoning number of patents over business methods citation omitted.
over the past,this court has encountered many cases involving a practicing patentee seeking to permanently enjoin a competitor upon an adjudication of infringement.in deciding these cases,we have developed certain legal standards that inform the inquiry and,in particular,the question of irreparable harm.while none of these standards alone may justify a general rule or an effectively irrebuttable presumption that an injunction should issue,a proper application of the standards to the facts of this case compels the conclusion that bosch is entitled to the injunction it seeks.it is in ignoring these standards,and supplanting them with its own,that the district court abused its discretion.
we address each component of the test in turn.
bosch argues that the district court committed legal error by establishing categorical rules in its irreparable injury analysis.specifically,bosch contends that the district court adopted per se rules that the existence of additional competitors and the nature of bosch wiper blade business in relation to its business as a whole each independently preclude a finding of irreparable harm.appellant br.bosch further argues that,on this record,no court acting within its discretion could find an absence of irreparable harm.in this regard,bosch points to evidence of loss in market share and access to customers pylon inability to satisfy a judgment and direct competition between it and pylon in each and every distribution channel in the relevant market.id.at.according to bosch,decades of jurisprudence confirm that a patentee in these circumstances has suffered irreparable harm.id.at.
in response,pylon argues that the district court never concluded that there had to be a market or that the wiper blade business had to be at the core of bosch business in order for an injunction to be warranted.appellee br.emphases in original.instead,pylon contends,the district court applied the proper legal standard to the evidence presented and concluded,as a factual matter,that the evidence presented was inadequate to establish irreparable harm.id.at.
while we agree that the district court did not establish categorical rules,we nevertheless conclude that the district court committed legal error by the weight given to the factors cited,and made a clear error in judgment in its analysis of the irreparable harm factor.specifically,while facts relating to the nature of the competition between the parties undoubtedly are relevant to the irreparable harm inquiry,the court erred in relying exclusively on the presence of additional competitors and on the nature of bosch wiper blade business.in addition,the court committed a clear error of judgment when it concluded that bosch failed to demonstrate irreparable harm in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.this is particularly true in light of bosch evidence of the parties direct competition loss in market share and access to potential customers resulting from pylon introduction of infringing beam blades and pylon lack of financial wherewithal to satisfy a judgment.given these facts,there is no basis on which the district court rationally could have concluded that bosch failed to show irreparable harm.see datascope,at.we first address the court legal errors and then turn to the clear error of judgment.
the court first legal error lies in its conclusion that the presence of additional competitors,without more,cuts against a finding of irreparable harm.it is wellestablished that the fact that other infringers may be in the marketplace does not negate irreparable harm.pfizer,teva pharms.usa.as we explained in pfizer,a patentee need not sue all infringers at once.id.picking off one infringer at a time is not inconsistent with being irreparably harmed.id.were we to conclude otherwise,we would effectively establish a presumption against irreparable harm whenever the market contains a plurality of players.under such circumstances,the first infringer sued could always point to the existence of additional competitors.and,perversely,if that infringer were to succeed in defeating an injunction,subsequent adjudged infringers could point to the market presence of the first infringer when opposing a request for an injunction.consequently,without additional facts showing that the presence of additional competitors renders the infringer harm reparable,the absence of a market does not weigh against a finding of irreparable harm.
this principle,moreover,is not incompatible with the cases cited by the district court,in which courts found irreparable harm based,in part,on the absence of additional competitors.while the existence of a market may well serve as a substantial ground for granting an injunction,because it creates an inference that an infringing sale amounts to a lost sale for the patentee the converse is not automatically true,especially where,as here,it is undisputed that the patentee has sought to enforce its rights against other infringers in the market.the record reveals that bosch has diligently pursued infringers since the time it first learned of pylon infringing beam blades.once it became aware of the infringement,bosch immediately notified pylon supplier requesting that it cease production of infringing blades,to which it agreed.later,in october,bosch sued jamak fabrication tex in the district of delaware,alleging infringement of its beam blade patents.see robert bosch llc jamak fabrication tex,cv.
during the pendency of its suit against jamak,bosch learned that pylon had started selling a new infringing product.accordingly,in august,three months after resolving its suit against jamak,bosch filed this action against pylon.bosch subsequently sued an additional competitor,old world industries,in march in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois.see robert bosch llc old world,cv.for these reasons,the court erred in concluding that the absence of a market effectively prohibits a finding of irreparable harm in this case.
the court also erred in relying on the nature of bosch wiper blade business in relation to its business as a whole.as other courts have concluded,the fact that an infringer harm affects only a portion of a patentee business says nothing about whether that harm can be rectified.see,hoffman laroche,cobalt pharma,cv,dist.lexis,at,cobalt points to roche size and profitability,and the small impact the likely harms would have on roche overall profitability.that says nothing about whether such harms are irreparable.injuries that affect a aspect of a patentee business are equally capable of being irreparable as ones that affect more significant operations.
under the district court approach,for example,a large industrial corporation such as bosch would find it easier to obtain an injunction if it subdivided its operations into child companies,with each focusing on a particular product line.under such circumstances,pylon infringement would go to the core of the business of bosch beam blades llc,which would increase the likelihood of irreparable harm.no one could seriously contend,however,that the irreparability of any particular injury should turn on incidental details such as a patentee corporate structure.an injury is either of the irreparable sort,or it is not.consequently,the district court erred in attributing weight to the nature of bosch wiper blade business.see praxair,atmi,lourie,concurring a patent provides a right to exclude infringing competitors,regardless of the proportion that the infringing goods bear to a patentee total business.
it is true that some courts have referenced the fact that the patented product is at the core of a party business when explaining their bases for granting an injunction.trueposition andrew,d,granting a permanent injunction after finding that p laintiffs are also frequently successful when their patented technology is at the core of its business.the trial court error in relying on these cases again arises from its conclusion that,if a fact supports the granting of an injunction,its absence likely compels denial of one.that is not the law,however.
in addition to these legal errors,the district court committed a clear error in judgment when it concluded that bosch failed to demonstrate irreparable harm.the record here contains undisputed evidence of direct competition in each of the market segments identified by the parties.bosch also introduced unrebutted evidence of loss of market share and access to potential customers,as well as pylon inability to satisfy a judgment.the district court,however,did not address any of this evidence,but,instead,focused on the absence of a market the nature of bosch wiper blade business and bosch alleged failure to define a relevant market.in view of the entirety of the record,we are left with the firm conviction that there is no basis on which the district court rationally could have concluded that bosch failed to demonstrate irreparable harm.we begin with an overview of the nature of competition between the parties before turning to the parties arguments regarding harms arising from pylon competition with bosch and pylon apparent inability to satisfy a judgment.
although the parties dispute the finer details of the nature and extent of their competition,we agree with bosch that the undisputed facts show that it competes with pylon in all of the market segments identified by the parties.neither bosch nor pylon sells directly to consumers.instead,both offer their blades to intermediaries,who then sell the same to consumers.before the district court,bosch identified three channels of distribution in the relevant market mass merchandisers,such as wal mart automotive specialty retailers and original equipment manufacturers oems.pylon did not dispute the existence of these distribution channels,nor did it identify the existence of additional channels within the relevant market.rather,it disputed the extent of competition in each of these three markets.specifically,pylon argued,as it does now,that bosch sells original wiping systems to oems for installation on new vehicles,while pylon does not bosch has a great concentration of customers in automotive specialty retailers,while pylon lacks a significant beam blade presence in this market and bosch does not sell any beam blades to mass merchandisers.joint appendix ja.thus,while the parties disputed the extent of competition within each distribution channel,there was no dispute regarding the contours of the relevant market.while pylon now asserts that it does not agree that these channels comprise the relevant market,appellee br,it still fails to identify any additional distribution channels,and we reject its belated attempt to create a dispute as to this issue.
with respect to the channel,it is undisputed that both parties have competed for walmart business,which alone represents a substantial portion of not only the channel,but also the aftermarket as a whole.both bosch and pylon approached wal mart in in an attempt to secure its beam blade business,and wal mart initially agreed to distribute bosch icon beam blades beginning in april.bosch,however,failed to make a timely initial delivery and,when it requested an extension,wal mart refused,choosing to sell pylon infringing product instead.since losing the account,bosch has made numerous efforts to regain wal mart business and has even offered a new,cheaper blade in an attempt to compete with pylon lower prices.thus,while it is true that bosch has not succeeded in selling its beam blades in the channel,the evidence shows that it competes with pylon for business with the largest participant in the aftermarket.
the record,likewise,shows direct competition in the aftermarket specialty store segment.both parties have sold beam blades to autozone,and,although pylon has had limited success in securing business from other specialty stores,it has competed against bosch for business from at least five of autozone competitors.
with respect to oems,bosch sells its blades to most of the major car manufacturers,including bmw,chrysler,ford,general motors,hyundai,mercedes benz,toyota,volkswagen,and volvo.pylon admits that it has sold beam type wiper blades to at least one oem,and has attempted sell beam blades to at least two additional manufacturers.the undisputed evidence,thus,demonstrates that the parties directly compete for customers in each of the relevant distribution channels.
bosch argues that the harm caused by this competition is irreparable because it has suffered irreversible price erosion,loss of market share,loss of customers,and loss of access to potential customers.it also contends that pylon inability to satisfy a judgment renders its injury irreparable.as bosch notes,the district court did not address any of these factors when concluding that an injunction should not issue.
in response,pylon contends that,while bosch has preliminarily established that pylon sells allegedly infringing beam blades,it has not established that pylon sales have had any definable impact on bosch sales of its own beam blades.appellee br.according to pylon,bosch failed to prove that it was pylon competition,rather than that of other competitors,which caused it to suffer lost market share and price erosion.pylon further argues that bosch evidence of pylon inability to pay is unsupported and speculative.we disagree.
while it is true that at least some of bosch loss of market share is attributable to other competitors,it is undisputed that it was pylon that secured the wal mart account,which alone accounts for a substantial portion of the entire market.pylon argues that bosch presumes that wal mart would turn to bosch if pylon were enjoined.appellee br.bosch,however,makes no such presumption.rather,bosch relies on the fact that it previously secured the wal mart account as circumstantial evidence that it would reclaim wal mart business were pylon enjoined.while the party seeking an injunction bears the burden of showing lost market share,this showing need not be made with direct evidence.here,bosch made a prima facie showing of lost market share,and pylon proffered no evidence to rebut that showing.
pylon,likewise,failed to rebut the testimony of bosch director of product management,martin kashnowski,regarding its loss of access to potential customers.see ja n ot securing an account with wal mart has made it much more difficult for bosch to secure accounts with other,including sears,target and k mart.if wal mart was carrying bosch beam blades,then its competitors would want to sell bosch beam blades as well to maintain a competitive position.with respect to evidence of price erosion,although bosch could have developed the effects of pylon conduct from that of other competitors more clearly,kashnowski testimony on this issue also stands unrebutted.consequently,pylon arguments with respect to the sufficiency of bosch evidence of lost market share,the loss of access to potential customers,and irreversible price erosion are not 
as additional evidence of irreparable harm,bosch introduced evidence showing that the financial condition of both pylon and its corporate parent raised questions about pylon ability to satisfy a judgment.specifically,bosch submitted a risk management report indicating that pylon posed a m oderate risk of severe financial stress,such a bankruptcy,over the next months and fell within the percentile nationally in the category of financial stress,ja and a public filing showing that qualitor,which holds of pylon stock,obtained a five million dollar loan at a rate of.in response,pylon did not dispute the accuracy of these submissions,nor did it submit evidence demonstrating its ability to pay a damages award,either of past or future damages.instead,pylon responded with attorney speculation and argued that,if,as bosch alleges,pylon sells so many beam blades,then there is little reason to suspect that pylon will not have sufficient resources to pay a royalty to bosch.ja.
while the burden of proving irreparable harm was of course bosch,pylon failure to submit rebuttal evidence regarding its ability to satisfy an award of money damages is troublesome given the procedural history of this case.because the district court granted pylon motion to bifurcate damages,bosch had no opportunity to obtain discovery relating to pylon financial condition,or that of its corporate parent before the court considered its request for injunctive relief.consequently,facts relevant to pylon ability to satisfy a judgment were uniquely within its control.while bosch evidence of pylon inability to pay is not overwhelming gleaned as it had to be from public records,in light of pylon failure to introduce any rebuttal evidence or to even argue below or to this court that bosch characterization of its financial status is inaccurate,and the unique procedural history of this case,we conclude that this factor favors a finding of irreparable harm 
in view of the foregoing evidence,the record contains no basis on which the district court rationally could have concluded that bosch failed to demonstrate irreparable harm or that a remedy other than injunction is sufficient to address its harm.consequently,the court committed a clear error of judgment in analyzing this factor.
turning to the remaining equitable factors,we conclude that,on balance,they also favor entry of a permanent injunction.
with respect to the adequacy of money damages,bosch argues that it will continue to suffer irreparable harm due to lost market share,lost business opportunities,and price erosion unless pylon is permanently enjoined.according to bosch,money damages alone can not fully compensate bosch for these harms.we agree.there is no reason to believe that pylon will stop infringing,or that the irreparable harms resulting from its infringement will otherwise cease,absent an injunction.reebok int l,baker,recognizing that future infringement may have market effects never fully compensable in money.more importantly,the questionable financial condition of both pylon and its parent company reinforces the inadequacy of a remed
