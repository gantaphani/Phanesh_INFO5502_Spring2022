this case addresses what claims and remedies may be pursued by a plaintiff who alleges a lost business opportunity due to the unfair practices of a competitor.the republic of korea wished to purchase military equipment known as synthetic aperture radar sar systems and solicited competing bids from manufacturers,including loral corporation loral and macdonald,dettwiler,and associates macdonald dettwiler.plaintiff korea supply company ksc represented macdonald dettwiler in the negotiations for the contract and stood to receive a commission of over million if macdonald dettwiler bid was accepted.ultimately,the contract was awarded to loral now lockheed martin tactical systems.ksc contends that even though macdonald dettwiler bid was lower and its equipment superior,it was not awarded the contract because loral corporation and its agent had offered bribes and sexual favors to key korean officials.ksc instituted the present action asserting claims under both california unfair competition law bus,et and the tort of interference with prospective economic advantage.
we granted review to decide two issues.first,we address whether disgorgement of profits allegedly obtained by means of an unfair business practice is an authorized remedy under the ucl where these profits are neither money taken from a plaintiff nor funds in which the plaintiff has an ownership interest.we conclude that disgorgement of such profits is not an authorized remedy in an individual action under the ucl.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeal on this issue.
second,we address whether,to state a claim for interference with prospective economic advantage,a plaintiff must allege that the defendant specifically intended to interfere with the plaintiff prospective economic advantage.we conclude that a plaintiff need not plead that the defendant acted with the specific intent to interfere with the plaintiff business expectancy in order to state a claim for this tort.we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal on this issue.
because t his case comes to us after the sustaining of a general demurrer,we accept as true all the material allegations of the complaint.charles vacanti,state comp.ins.fund cal th,d,quoting shoemaker myers cal d.
plaintiff ksc is a corporation engaged in the business of representing manufacturers of military equipment in transactions with the republic of korea.in the,the republic of korea solicited bids for a sar system for use by its military.ksc represented macdonald dettwiler,a canadian company,in its bid to obtain the contract award.ksc expected a commission of percent of the contract price,or over million,if macdonald dettwiler were awarded the contract.
in june,the korean ministry of defense announced that loral an american competitor of the canadian company macdonald dettwiler,was awarded the contract,despite the fact that macdonald dettwiler bid was about million lower and that the project management office of the korean defense intelligence command had determined that macdonald dettwiler equipment was far superior to loral system.the ministry of defense explained that the decision to award loral the contract was based on a suggestion that the united states government would not be favorably disposed to share intelligence information with the republic of korea if the latter selected a canadian supplier.
beginning in october,major news publications in the republic of korea revealed that an internal investigation had established that the sar contract was awarded to loral as a result of bribes and sexual favors,rather than pressure from the united states government.loral agent for the procurement of the sar contract,defendant linda kim,had bribed two korean military officers.in addition,kim had extended bribes and sexual favors to the minister of national defense,the ultimate decision maker with respect to the award of the sar contract.kim reportedly received approximately million in commission from loral,an amount that exceeded the maximum established by the foreign corrupt practices act and foreign military sales policies and regulations.as a result of the internal investigation by the republic of korea,several persons were imprisoned,including korean military officers.kim herself was indicted in absentia she avoided imprisonment because she resides in the united states and refuses to travel to the republic of korea.
upon learning of these alleged reasons for the award of the sar contract to loral,ksc commenced the present action on may.in its first amended complaint,ksc alleged that defendants conspired,knowingly and intentionally to induce and did knowingly and intentionally induce the republic of korea,through its authorized agencies,to award the sar contract to loral instead of macdonald dettwiler by employing wrongful means including bribes and sexual favors.as a direct and proximate result of defendants actions,the republic of korea awarded the contract to loral but for the bribes and sexual favors,this contract would have been awarded to macdonald dettwiler.in securing the contract by wrongful means,loral acted with full knowledge of the commission relationship between plaintiff and macdonald dettwiler and knowing that its interference with the award of the contract would cause plaintiff severe loss.defendant lockheed martin has been the beneficiary of the illegal conduct and to that extent has been unjustly enriched.
the first amended complaint asserts three causes of action conspiracy to interfere with prospective economic advantage,intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,and unfair competition pursuant to business and professions code section for its unfair competition claim,ksc sought disgorgement to it of the profits realized by lockheed martin on the sale of the sar to korea.for the tort claims,ksc sought damages for the loss of its expected compensation from macdonald dettwiler.
lockheed martin,joined by kim,generally demurred to all counts.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,finding that plaintiff complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action under california law.judgment was entered dismissing the action on september.after the trial court subsequently denied ksc motion for reconsideration,ksc filed its notice of appeal.the court of appeal reversed the trial court judgment in full,finding that plaintiff had sufficiently stated causes of action for unfair competition and for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.
lockheed martin sought review in this court of two bases of the court of appeal decision first,its holding that disgorgement of profits is an available remedy under the ucl even where the disgorgement sought does not represent restitution of money or property in which plaintiff has an ownership interest and second,its holding that the tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage does not require plaintiff to plead that defendant acted with the specific intent to interfere with plaintiff business expectancy.we granted review on both issues.
we first address plaintiff unfair competition claim.business and professions code section et prohibits unfair competition,including unlawful,unfair,and fraudulent business acts.the ucl covers a wide range of conduct.it embraces anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.citations.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.standing to sue under the ucl is expansive as well.unfair competition actions can be brought by a public prosecutor or by any person acting for the interests of itself,its members or the general public.
section borrows violations from other laws by making them independently actionable as unfair competitive practices,supra,cal th at,d.in addition,under section,a practice may be deemed unfair even if not specifically proscribed by some other law,at,d.in the present case,ksc third cause of action,for unfair competition,borrowed from the federal foreign corrupt practices act,which prohibits,among other things,bribing a foreign government official for the purpose of influencing any act or decision in his or her official capacity and in violation of a lawful duty,or for the purpose of inducing the use of official influence to obtain or retain business.see a a,b.the court of appeal determined that a claim under the ucl may be predicated on a violation of this act 
while the scope of conduct covered by the ucl is broad,its remedies are limited,supra,cal th at,d.a ucl action is equitable in nature damages can not be recovered.bank of the west superior court cal th,d,bank of the west.civil penalties may be assessed in public unfair competition actions,but the law contains no criminal provisions.we have stated that under the ucl,p revailing plaintiffs are generally limited to injunctive relief and restitution,supra,cal th at,d.the question raised by this case is whether disgorgement of profits that is not restitutionary in nature is an available remedy for an individual private plaintiff under the ucl.
the court of appeal in this case held that plaintiff can recover disgorgement of profits earned by defendants as a result of their allegedly unfair practices,even where the money sought to be disgorged was not taken from plaintiff and plaintiff did not have an ownership interest in the money.this holding was based on language taken from our recent decision in kraus,supra,cal th,d.as we explain,the court of appeal reliance on this language was mistaken.
in kraus,we held that disgorgement of unfairly obtained profits into a fluid recovery fund is not an available remedy in a representative action brought under the ucl.kraus,supra,cal th at,d.we began by describing the remedies that are clearly available to a plaintiff under the ucl through the ucl a plaintiff may obtain restitution injunctive relief against unfair or unlawful practices.kraus,at,d.we then differentiated between the terms restitution and disgorgement in order to show why a plaintiff in a representative action under the ucl could recover restitution but could not obtain disgorgement of profits into a fluid recovery fund.
we defined an order for restitution as one compelling a ucl defendant to return money obtained through an unfair business practice to those persons in interest from whom the property was taken,that is,to persons who had an ownership interest in the property or those claiming through that person.kraus,supra,cal th at,d.we then clarified that disgorgement is a broader remedy than restitution.we stated that an order for disgorgement may include a restitutionary element,but is not so limited.id.at,d.we further explained that an order for disgorgement may compel a defendant to surrender all money obtained through an unfair business practice even though not all is to be restored to the persons from whom it was obtained or those claiming under those persons.it has also been used to refer to surrender of all profits earned as a result of an unfair business practice regardless of whether those profits represent money taken directly from persons who were victims of the unfair practice.ibid.relying on this distinction between restitution and disgorgement,we held in kraus that although restitution was an available remedy in ucl actions,a plaintiff in a representative action under the ucl could not recover disgorgement in the broader,nonrestitutionary sense,into a fluid recovery fund.kraus,at,d.
the court of appeal in the present case misread our opinion in kraus.noting that plaintiff in this case seeks disgorgement of profits unjustly earned by defendants,the court of appeal quoted our statement in kraus that a n order that a defendant disgorge money obtained through an unfair business practice may include a restitutionary element,but is not so limited s uch orders may compel a defendant to surrender all money obtained through an unfair business practice even though not all is to be restored to the persons from whom it was obtained or those claiming under those persons.it has also been used to refer to surrender of all profits earned as a result of an unfair business practice regardless of whether those profits represent money taken directly from persons who were victims of the unfair practice.quoting kraus,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.relying on this language,the court of appeal concluded that plaintiff adequately stated a claim under the ucl.
as lockheed martin and several amici curiae point out,however,this passage from kraus,cited by the court of appeal as authorization for disgorgement under the ucl,merely defined the term disgorgement in order to demonstrate that it was broader in scope than restitution.in the above cited quotation,this court was not approving of disgorgement as a remedy under the ucl.to the contrary,we held in kraus that while restitution was an available remedy under the ucl,disgorgement of money obtained through an unfair business practice is an available remedy in a representative action only to the extent that it constitutes restitution.we reaffirm this holding here in the context of an individual action under the ucl.we therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeal on this issue.
we begin our analysis with the statutory authorization for relief under the ucl,found in section any person who engages,has engaged,or proposes to engage in unfair competition may be enjoined in any court of competent jurisdiction.the court may make such orders or judgments,including the appointment of a receiver,as may be necessary to prevent the use or employment by any person of any practice which constitutes unfair competition,as defined in this chapter,or as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any money or property,real or personal,which may have been acquired by means of such unfair competition.
the fundamental objective of statutory construction is to ascertain the legislature intent and to give effect to the purpose of the statute.code civ.if the language of the statute is unambiguous,the plain meaning governs.day city of fontana cal th,d.under section,t he statutory authorization to make orders necessary to restore money to any person in interest is clear.kraus,supra,cal th at,d.an order for restitution,then,is authorized by the clear language of the statute.in fact,restitution is the only monetary remedy expressly authorized by section.ibid.
while a remedy of nonrestitutionary disgorgement of profits is not expressly authorized by the statute,ksc argues that the equitable language in section is sufficiently broad to allow courts to award this monetary remedy for an unfair competition claim.ksc contends that under the ucl a court may,in its discretion,order lockheed martin to surrender its profits to ksc because ksc allegedly has been wronged by lockheed martin unfair conduct.
here,since the remedy of nonrestitutionary disgorgement is not expressly authorized by the statute,we determine whether the legislature intended to authorize such a remedy under section.if the statutory language is ambiguous,we may look to the history and background of the statute.kraus,supra,cal th at,d.in ascertaining the legislature intent,we attempt to construe the statute to preserve its constitutional validity,as we presume that the legislature intends to respect constitutional limits.see ibid.
we described the legislative history of the ucl in kraus.kraus,supra,cal th at,d.as amended in,the predecessor to the current law provided express authority to enjoin unfair competition.civ.code,former,as amended by stats,ch.while no specific provision empowered courts to order monetary remedies,in people superior court jayhill cal d,we held that trial courts retained their inherent equitable power to order restitution under the ucl.three years after jayhill,express authority to order restitution was added to civil code section,the predecessor to section.stats,ch.as we have previously said,this revision of the act was intended to codify,not change,the remedies available to a trial court under the ucl.kraus,supra,at,d,with the amendments,the legislature confirmed,but did not increase,the powers of the court in a ucl action see also assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.may,congruent amendments to false advertising law were intended to affirm equity power already existing in courts com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.same.
while express authority to order restitution was added to the ucl,courts were not given similar authorization to order nonrestitutionary disgorgement.further,plaintiff has not pointed to anything in the legislative history that suggests that the legislature intended to provide such a remedy in an individual action.plaintiff contends that this court interpretation of the ucl and commentary by leading academic authorities establish that a court equitable power under the ucl is broad.notably absent from this argument,however,is any showing from the language or history of section that the legislature intended to authorize a disgorgement remedy that was not restitutionary in nature.instead,ksc merely asserts,without pointing to any particular statutory language or legislative history,that a court equitable powers under section are broad enough to encompass its requested remedy.
we have previously found that the legislature did not intend section to provide courts with unlimited equitable powers.in kraus,we rejected the argument,revived by plaintiff in this case,that the general grant of equitable authority in section implicitly permitted a disgorgement that case,into a fluid recovery fund in a representative action.we found that since there was nothing in the express language of the statute or its legislative history indicating that the legislature intended to provide such a remedy,the remedy was not available.kraus,supra,cal th at,d.here,again,we find nothing to indicate that the legislature intended to authorize a court to order a defendant to disgorge all profits to a plaintiff who does not have an ownership interest in those profits.
in fact,the language of section is clear that the equitable powers of a court are to be used to prevent practices that constitute unfair competition and to restore to any person in interest any money or property acquired through unfair practices.while the prevent prong of section suggests that the legislature considered deterrence of unfair practices to be an important goal,the fact that attorney fees and damages,including punitive damages,are not available under the ucl is clear evidence that deterrence by means of monetary penalties is not the act sole objective.a court can not,under the equitable powers of section,award whatever form of monetary relief it believes might deter unfair practices.the fact that the restore prong of section is the only reference to monetary penalties in this section indicates that the legislature intended to limit the available monetary remedies under the act 
our previous cases discussing the ucl indicate our understanding that the legislature did not intend to authorize courts to order monetary remedies other than restitution in an individual action.this court has never approved of nonrestitutionary disgorgement of profits as a remedy under the ucl.while prior cases discussing the ucl may have characterized some of the relief available as disgorgement,we were referring to the restitutionary form of disgorgement,and not to the nonrestitutionary type sought here by plaintiff.cortez purolator air filtration products cal th,d,cortez holding that because section authorizes an order compelling a defendant to pay back wages as a restitutionary remedy,we need not consider whether the order might be proper under the ucl on a disgorgement of benefit theory abc international traders,matsushita electric cal th,d,stating that the defendant victims may be entitled to restitution under section fletcher security pacific national bank cal d,fletcher trial court may order restitution under the ucl for bank customers challenging a bank computation of per annum interest on the basis of a year people superior court jayhill,supra,cal d at,court may order a defendant to pay restitution to victims who have been defrauded as a result of an unfair business practice.the present case merely confirms what we have previously held under the ucl,an individual may recover profits unfairly obtained to the extent that these profits represent monies given to the defendant or benefits in which the plaintiff has an ownership interest.
in an attempt to fit its claim within the statutory authorization for relief,and as an implicit acknowledgement that nonrestitutionary disgorgement is not an available remedy in an individual action under the ucl,plaintiff describes its requested remedy as restitution.this term does not accurately describe the relief sought by plaintiff.as defined in kraus,an order for restitution is one compelling a ucl defendant to return money obtained through an unfair business practice to those persons in interest from whom the property was taken,that is,to persons who had an ownership interest in the property or those claiming through that person.kraus,supra,cal th at,d.the object of restitution is to restore the status quo by returning to the plaintiff funds in which he or she has an ownership interest.
the remedy sought by plaintiff in this case is not restitutionary because plaintiff does not have an ownership interest in the money it seeks to recover from defendants.first,it is clear that plaintiff is not seeking the return of money or property that was once in its possession.ksc has not given any money to lockheed martin instead,it was from the republic of korea that lockheed martin received its profits.any award that plaintiff would recover from defendants would not be restitutionary as it would not replace any money or property that defendants took directly from plaintiff.
further,the relief sought by plaintiff is not restitutionary under an alternative theory because plaintiff has no vested interest in the money it seeks to recover.we have stated that t he concept of restoration or restitution,as used in the ucl,is not limited only to the return of money or property that was once in the possession of that person.cortez,supra,cal th at,d.instead,restitution is broad enough to allow a plaintiff to recover money or property in which he or she has a vested interest.in cortez,we determined that earned wages that are due and payable pursuant to section et of the labor code are as much the property of the employee who has given his or her labor to the employer in exchange for that property as is property a person surrenders through an unfair business practice.ibid.therefore,we concluded that such wages could be recovered as restitution under the ucl.we reached this result because equity regards that which ought to have been done as done citation,and thus recognizes equitable conversion.cortez,supra,at,d.
while the plaintiffs in cortez had a vested interest in their earned but unpaid wages,ksc itself acknowledges that,at most,it had an expectancy in the receipt of a commission.ksc expected commission is merely a contingent interest since ksc only expected payment if macdonald dettwiler was awarded the sar contract.see united states rodrigues cir,finding that under the federal victim and witness protection act of,restitution was not available for a contingent loss in which the company had only an expectancy interest restitution could only be recovered for the loss of a vested interest.such an attenuated expectancy can not,as ksc contends,be likened to property converted by lockheed martin that can now be the subject of a constructive trust.to create a constructive trust,there must be a res,an identifiable kind of property or entitlement in defendant hands.dobbs,law of remedies.as the united states supreme court recently said,a constructive trust requires money or property identified as belonging in good conscience to the plaintiff which can clearly be traced to particular funds or property in the defendant possession.life annuity insurance knudson,d.the recovery requested in this case can not be traced to any particular funds in lockheed martin possession and therefore is not the proper subject of a constructive trust.
ksc expectancy in this case is further attenuated since ksc never anticipated payment directly from lockheed martin.instead,it expected the republic of korea to pay macdonald dettwiler,which would then pay a commission to ksc.in contrast,in cortez,the defendant was the employer from which the plaintiffs expected payment.cortez,supra,cal th at,d.therefore,the order for restitution served to restore to the plaintiffs funds that were directly owed to them by the defendant.unlike cortez,then,the monetary relief requested by ksc does not represent a quantifiable sum owed by defendants to plaintiff.instead,it is a contingent expectancy of payment from a third party.for these reasons,we find that plaintiff claim is properly characterized as a claim for nonrestitutionary disgorgement of profits.
we reaffirm that an action under the ucl is not an substitute for a tort or contract action.cortez,supra,cal th at,d.instead,the act provides an equitable means through which both public prosecutors and private individuals can bring suit to prevent unfair business practices and restore money or property to victims of these practices.as we have said,the overarching legislative concern was to provide a streamlined procedure for the prevention of ongoing or threatened acts of unfair competition.id.at,d,italics omitted.because of this objective,the remedies provided are limited.while any member of the public can bring suit under the act to enjoin a business from engaging in unfair competition,it is well established that individuals may not recover damages.bank of the west,supra,cal th at,d.
the nonrestitutionary disgorgement remedy sought by plaintiff closely resembles a claim for damages,something that is not permitted under the ucl.as one court has noted compensation for a lost business opportunity is a measure of damages and not restitution to the alleged victims.mai systems uips.plaintiff suggests that its disgorgement remedy need not include all of the profits unfairly obtained by lockheed martin instead,its recovery might be limited to the amount it allegedly would have obtained as a commission had macdonald dettwiler been awarded the contract.this proposed recovery would be in exactly the same amount that plaintiff is seeking to recover as damages for its traditional tort claim of interference with prospective economic advantage.the only difference between what plaintiff seeks to recover as disgorgement and the damages it seeks under its traditional tort claim is that plaintiff would not recover its full expected commission under a disgorgement remedy if,for some reason,the profits obtained by lockheed martin did not equal the amount of plaintiff expected commission.
allowing the plaintiff in this case to recover nonrestitutionary disgorgement under the ucl would enable it to obtain tort damages while bypassing the burden of proving the elements of liability under its traditional tort claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.as we have stated,any member of the public can bring suit under the ucl.in addition,to state a claim under the act one need not plead and prove the element of a tort.instead,one need only show that members of the public are likely to be deceived.citation.bank of the west,supra,cal th at,d,see also fletcher,supra,cal d at,individual plaintiff knowledge of the unfair practice not needed in order to recover restitution.given the ucl liberal standing requirements and relaxed liability standards,were we to allow nonrestitutionary disgorgement in an individual action under the ucl,plaintiffs would have an incentive to recast claims under traditional tort theories as ucl violations.they could recover from a competitor without having to meet the more rigorous pleading requirements of a negligence action,or a breach of contract suit.the result could be that the ucl would be used as an substitute for a tort or contract action,something the legislature never intended.
in addition,it is possible that due process concerns would arise if an individual business competitor could recover disgorgement of profits under the ucl.while restitution is limited to restoring money or property to direct victims of an unfair practice,a potentially unlimited number of individual plaintiffs could recover nonrestitutionary disgorgement.allowing such a remedy would expose defendants to multiple suits and the risk of duplicative liability without the traditional limitations on standing.see stop youth addiction lucky stores,cal th,d,conc.opn.of baxter,disgorgement of profits to a party that has not paid money to the defendant and was not a party to the litigation raises substantial due process issues implicating the rights of both the defendant and the absent parties.the disgorgement remedy requested in this case would not require that the disgorged money or property have come from the prospective plaintiff in the first instance.nor is there any limit on the number of times the remedy could be sought or any limit on the monetary relief available.there is a risk of unfairness not only to defendants but also to direct victims of the unfair practice.if lockheed martin were forced to disgorge its profits to ksc,there might be little left for the republic of korea to recover,even though it is the party ostensibly entitled to restitutionary relief.
plaintiff suggests ways of alleviating these due process concerns,proposing several options to prevent abuse,including that this remedy be limited to instances where the defendant has engaged in egregious practices.none of plaintiff proposals,however,alleviate the possibility that defendants would be subjected to duplicate liability.further,none of plaintiff proposed options to prevent abuse are contemplated by the legislative scheme.
we conclude,therefore,that allowing plaintiff to recover monetary relief under the ucl in this case would be at odds with the language and history of the statute,our previous decisions construing the ucl,and public policy.we hold that nonrestitutionary disgorgement of profits is not an available remedy in an individual action under the ucl.we note that the ucl remains a meaningful consumer protection tool.the breadth of standing under this act allows any consumer to combat unfair competition by seeking an injunction against unfair business practices.actual direct victims of unfair competition may obtain restitution as well.the present decision merely reaffirms the balance struck in this state unfair competition law between broad liability and limited relief.
in addition,we note that our decision does not foreclose all relief to plaintiff.while plaintiff may not recover monetary relief under the limited remedies provided by the ucl,plaintiff may pursue a cause of action under traditional tort law.in fact,as we conclude below,plaintiff in this case can state a claim for the tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.while the pleading and proof requirements under this tort are more rigorous than under the ucl,if plaintiff succeeds in meeting its burden of proof,it may recover damages for the injuries it claims to have suffered as a result of unfair competition.
lockheed martin argues that ksc fails to state a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage because it has not shown that lockheed martin acted with the specific intent to disrupt ksc business relationship.ksc counters that a plaintiff need only show that the defendant acted with the knowledge that its wrongful acts were substantially certain to disrupt plaintiff business expectancy.we conclude that the tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage does not require a plaintiff to plead that the defendant acted with the specific intent,or purpose,of disrupting the plaintiff prospective economic advantage.instead,to satisfy the intent requirement for this tort,it is sufficient to plead that the defendant knew that the interference was certain or substantially certain to occur as a result of its action.
we first articulated the elements of the tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage in buckaloo johnson cal d,buckaloo.these elements are usually stated as follows an economic relationship between the plaintiff and some third party,with the probability of future economic benefit to the plaintiff the defendant knowledge of the relationship intentional acts on the part of the defendant designed to disrupt the relationship actual disruption of the relationship and economic harm to the plaintiff proximately caused by the acts of the defendant.citations.westside center associates safeway stores,th,d.
we most recently considered this tort in della penna toyota motor sales,cal th,d,della penna,where we held that a plaintiff seeking to recover damages for interference with prospective economic advantage must plead and prove as part of its that the defendant conduct was wrongful by some legal measure other than the fact of interference itself.id.at,d.in della penna,we did not address the elements of the tort as we had formulated them in buckaloo,other than noting that t o the extent that language in buckaloo addressing the pleading and proof requirements in the economic relations tort is inconsistent with the formulation we adopt in this case,it is disapproved.della penna,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
since our opinion in della penna,lower courts considering this tort have continued to apply the elements we articulated in buckaloo,with the added understanding that a plaintiff must plead that the defendant engaged in an act that is wrongful apart from the interference itself.see,limandri judkins th,d arntz contracting paul fire and marine insurance company th,d westside center associates safeway stores,supra,th at,d.the court of appeal in the present case,however,in considering whether a plaintiff must plead specific intent,determined that after della penna,it is no longer appropriate to apply the elements formulated in buckaloo in all actions for interference with prospective advantage.
we disagree with the court of appeal conclusion that the elements we first articulated in buckaloo,supra,cal d,do not still apply to this tort.in della penna,we did not abandon these elements.instead,we specifically stated that w e do not in this case go beyond approving the requirement of a showing of wrongfulness as part of the plaintiff case.della penna,supra,cal th at,d.in fact,we explicitly approved the trial court modified version of the standard jury instruction on intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,baji.the instruction at issue articulated the traditional elements of the tort,but changed the third element to provide that the defendant intentionally engaged in wrongful acts or conduct designed to interfere with or disrupt the relationship.della penna,at,fn,d,italics and brackets added.rather than overrule the established elements of this tort,della penna merely clarified the plaintiff burden as to the third element,stating that to meet this element,a plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant acts are wrongful apart from the interference itself.id.at,d.thus,as the majority of the courts of appeal have understood,after della penna the elements of the tort of interference with prospective economic advantage remain the same,except that the third element also requires a plaintiff to plead intentional wrongful acts on the part of the defendant designed to disrupt the relationship.
having clarified the required elements,we now consider the intent requirement of this tort.the question is whether a plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant engaged in wrongful acts with the specific intent of interfering with the plaintiff business expectancy.we conclude that specific intent is not a required element of the tort of interference with prospective economic advantage.while a plaintiff may satisfy the intent requirement by pleading specific intent,that the defendant desired to interfere with the plaintiff prospective economic advantage,a plaintiff may alternately plead that the defendant knew that the interference was certain or substantially certain to occur as a result of its action.
lockheed martin argues that specific intent is an established element of this tort.it contends that to satisfy the tort third wrongful acts designed to disrupt the plaintiff relationship with its plaintiff must allege that the defendant purposely sought the disruption.it asserts that the inclusion of the word designed in the typical formulation of the third element is evidence that a plaintiff is required to plead specific intent.we disagree.the elements of the tort of interference with prospective economic advantage do not require a plaintiff to allege that the defendant acted with the specific intent,or purpose,of disrupting the plaintiff prospective economic advantage.
contrary to lockheed martin assertion,the inclusion of the word designed in the third element of the tort does not necessarily mean that this tort contains a specific intent requirement.our analysis of the intent requirement for the tort of intentional interference with contract in quelimane company,stewart title guaranty company cal th,d,quelimane is instructive in quelimane,we articulated the elements of this tort,stating that the third element requires a plaintiff to plead the defendant intentional acts designed to induce a breach or disruption of the contractual relationship.id.at,d.notwithstanding the presence of the word designed,we found that this tort did not require a plaintiff to plead that the defendant acted with the specific intent to interfere.id.at,d.
in determining that intentional interference with contract does not contain a specific intent requirement,we relied on the restatement second of torts.quelimane,supra,cal th at,d.the restatement,section,comment j,makes clear that the tort of intentional interference with contract applies not only when a defendant acts with the purpose or desire to interfere but that i t applies also to intentional interference in which the actor does not act for the purpose of interfering with the contract or desire it but knows that the interference is certain or substantially certain to occur as a result of his action.the rule applies,in other words,to an interference that is incidental to the actor independent purpose and desire but known to him to be a necessary consequence of his action.rest d torts,com.j.
we similarly look to the restatement to determine whether the tort at issue in the present case,intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,contains a specific intent requirement.restatement second of torts section,entitled intentional interference with prospective contractual relation explains in comment d the intent required for this section is that defined in.the interference with the other prospective contractual relation is intentional if the actor desires to bring it about or if he knows that the interference is certain or substantially certain to occur as a result of his action.see,comment j.rest d torts,com.d.
in explaining the intent requirement for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,the restatement second of torts specifically refers to the intent requirement for the tort of intentional interference with contract,as defined in section,comment j.we relied on this section of the restatement in quelimane to conclude that this tort contained no specific intent requirement.quelimane,supra,cal th at,d.in addition,the restatement refers to the definition of intent in section,which states the word intent is used throughout the restatement second of torts to denote that the actor desires to cause consequences of his act,or that he believes that the consequences are substantially certain to derive from it.rest d torts.comment b to this section clarifies that i ntent is not,however,limited to consequences which are desired.if the actor knows that the consequences are certain,or substantially certain,to result from his act,and still goes ahead,he is treated by the law as if he had in fact desired to produce the result.rest d torts,com.b.
based on our reading of the restatement and our discussion in quelimane of the intent requirement,we reject lockheed martin argument that the tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage contains a requirement that a plaintiff plead and prove that the defendant acted with the specific intent,purpose,or design to interfere with the plaintiff prospective advantage.instead,we agree with the restatement that it is sufficient for the plaintiff to plead that the defendant knew that the interference is certain or substantially certain to occur as a result of his action.rest d torts,com.d.
we caution that although we find the intent requirement to be the same for the torts of intentional interference with contract and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,these torts remain distinct.we reiterate our statement in della penna that o ur courts should firmly distinguish the two kinds of business contexts,bringing a greater solicitude to those relationships that have ripened into agreements,while recognizing that relationships short of that subsist in a zone where the rewards and risks of competition are dominant.della penna,supra,cal th at,d.
we note initially that even though these two torts are distinct,some plaintiffs may be able to state causes of action for both torts.as we stated in buckaloo,the tort of interference with contract is merely a species of the broader tort of interference with prospective economic advantage.buckaloo,supra,cal d at.in the present case,ksc claim was appropriately stated as one for interference with prospective economic advantage.ksc did not allege in its complaint that it had a contractual agreement with macdonald dettwiler.ksc merely alleged that it had an economic expectancy in that it was acting as macdonald dettwiler broker and it expected a commission if the contract was awarded to macdonald dettwiler.ksc nowhere pleads that this expectancy amounted to an enforceable contract.
moreover,the existence of a contract does not mean that a plaintiff claim must be brought exclusively as one for interference with contract.in buckaloo,we concluded that the tort of interference with prospective economic advantage is considerably more inclusive than actions based on contract or interference with contract,and is thus is not dependent on the existence of a valid contract.buckaloo,supra,cal d at,see id.at,fn,the basic tort of interference with economic relations can be established by showing,inter alia,an interference with an existing contract or a contract which is certain to be consummated.thus,a plaintiff who believes that he or she has a contract but who recognizes that the trier of fact might conclude otherwise might bring claims for both torts so that in the event of a finding of no contract,the plaintiff might prevail on a claim for interference with prospective economic advantage.in the present case,even if ksc could have alleged a contractual relationship with macdonald dettwiler,its claim was properly brought as one for interference with prospective economic advantage.as we explain below,however,a plaintiff that chooses to bring a claim for interference with prospective economic advantage has a more rigorous pleading burden since it must show that the defendant conduct was independently wrongful.
as we have made clear in both della penna and quelimane,the distinction between these two torts is found in the independent wrongfulness requirement of the tort of interference with prospective economic advantage.we stated in quelimane because interference with an existing contract receives greater solicitude than does interference with prospective economic advantage citation,it is not necessary that the defendant conduct be wrongful apart from the interference with the contract itself.citation.intentionally inducing or causing a breach of an existing contract is a wrong in and of itself.because this formal economic relationship does not exist and damages are speculative when remedies are sought for interference in what is only prospective economic advantage,della penna concluded that some wrongfulness apart from the impact of the defendant conduct on that prospect should be required.quelimane,supra,cal th at,d.
thus,while intentionally interfering with an existing contract is a wrong in and of itself quelimane,supra,cal th at,d,intentionally interfering with a plaintiff prospective economic advantage is not.to establish a claim for interference with prospective economic advantage,therefore,a plaintiff must plead that the defendant engaged in an independently wrongful act.see della penna,supra,cal th at,d.an act is not independently wrongful merely because defendant acted with an improper motive.as we said in della penna,the law usually takes care to draw lines of legal liability in a way that maximizes areas of competition free of legal penalties.della penna,supra,cal th at,d.the tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage is not intended to punish individuals or commercial entities for their choice of commercial relationships or their pursuit of commercial objectives,unless their interference amounts to independently actionable conduct.marin tug barge,westport petroleum,cir.we conclude,therefore,that an act is independently wrongful if it is unlawful,that is,if it is proscribed by some constitutional,statutory,regulatory,common law,or other determinable legal standard see marin tug barge,supra,at see also della penna,supra,cal th at,d,conc.opn.of mosk,it follows that the tort may be satisfied by intentional interference with prospective economic advantage by independently tortious means.
here,ksc has clearly satisfied the independent wrongfulness requirement.in its complaint,ksc alleged that defendant kim,as an agent for loral,engaged in bribery and offered sexual favors to key korean officials in order to obtain the contract from the republic of korea.under the foreign corrupt practices act,it is unlawful to pay or offer money or anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of the foreign official,or to induce the foreign official to use his or her influence with a foreign government to affect or influence any act or decision of the government.a a,b.in addition,the complaint alleges that the commissions paid by loral to kim exceeded the maximum allowable amounts established by the foreign corrupt practices act.a a,b.the complaint thus clearly alleges that defendants engaged in unlawful behavior in order to secure the sar contract.ksc has,therefore,sufficiently alleged that defendants acts,in addition to interfering with ksc business expectancy,were wrongful in and of themselves.
it is this independent wrongfulness requirement that makes defendants interference with plaintiff business expectancy a tortious act.because we have determined that the act of interference with prospective economic advantage is not tortious in and of itself,the requirement of pleading that a defendant has engaged in an act that was independently wrongful distinguishes lawful competitive behavior from tortious interference.such a requirement sensibly redresses the balance between providing a remedy for predatory economic behavior and keeping legitimate business competition outside litigative bounds.della penna,supra,cal th at,d.
the independent wrongfulness requirement also differentiates california law from that of other states and the restatement second of torts.lockheed martin reliance on these authorities is unpersuasive since they require a plaintiff only to plead that the defendant interference was improper,and not that the interference was independently unlawful.as we explain,california independent wrongfulness requirement more narrowly defines actionable conduct under this tort.
according to the restatement,there are two requirements for liability under this tort the interference must be both intentional and improper.a defendant who intentionally and improperly interferes with another prospective contractual relation is subject to liability.rest d torts.the intent requirement,as described above,is that the defendant either desires to bring about the interference or knows that the interference is certain or substantially certain to occur as a result of its action.rest d torts,com.d.in addition to this general intent,the second requirement is that t he interference must also be improper.the factors to be considered in determining whether an interference is improper are stated in.one of them is the actor motive and another is the interest sought to be advanced by him.together these factors mean that the actor purpose is of substantial significance.if he had no desire to effectuate the interference by his action but knew that it would be a mere incidental result of conduct he was engaging in for another purpose,the interference may be found to be not improper.other factors come into play here,however,particularly the nature of the actor conduct.if the means used is innately wrongful,predatory in character,a purpose to produce the interference may not be necessary.on the other hand,if the sole purpose of the actor is to vent his ill will,the interference may be improper although the means are less blameworthy.rest d torts,com.d,italics added.
unlike california,the restatement second of torts does not require a plaintiff to plead that a defendant engaged in an independently wrongful act in order to show improper interference.instead,a general intent plus an actor motive or purpose to interfere is enough to subject a defendant to liability under the restatement.in the absence of an independent wrongfulness requirement,a purpose to interfere with the plaintiff business expectancy suffices to distinguish actionable conduct from behavior that is merely competitive,and therefore privileged.the restatement,however,recognizes that when the defendant conduct is innately wrongful,a purpose to interfere may be unnecessary.the restatement appreciates that the independent wrongfulness of a defendant acts may satisfy the improper requirement of the tort without the need to look to the motive or purpose behind a defendant acts.
thus,while california does follow the restatement general intent requirement,california law adheres to a narrower interpretation of what conduct is improper under this tort.after della penna,supra,cal th,d,california has required plaintiffs to show that a defendant has engaged in an independently,or inherently,wrongful act.under this requirement,a defendant motive or purpose is relevant only to the extent that it renders the defendant conduct unlawful.we are therefore unconvinced by lockheed martin reliance on the restatement in this regard.
lockheed martin citation to decisions holding that a plaintiff must plead that the defendant acted with a specific intent or purpose to interfere with the plaintiff economic relations is similarly unpersuasive.like the restatement second of torts,the cases cited by lockheed martin look to a defendant motive or purpose to distinguish tortious conduct from lawful behavior.see,ethyl balter so d,finding no interference because the defendant purpose or motive was not directed at the plaintiff bank computer network continental illinois bank and trust d,same k k management lee,same anderson v.the regents of the of california,same.unlike california,however,these states do not require a plaintiff to plead that the defendant has engaged in an independently wrongful act in order to state a claim for interference with prospective economic advantage.instead of independent wrongfulness,a plaintiff is required to plead a purpose or motive to interfere in order to demonstrate that the defendant interference was improper.
we additionally reject lockheed martin reliance on devoto pacific fidelity life insurance cir devoto.in that case,the ninth circuit court of appeals attempted to anticipate whether california courts would require a plaintiff to plead that the defendant acted with a specific purpose or motive to interfere with the plaintiff prospective economic advantage.id.at.devoto was decided prior to our opinions in della penna,supra,cal th,d,and quelimane,supra,cal th,d,and,as the ninth circuit noted,there was a scarcity of pertinent authority on this issue.devoto,at.we agree with the court of appeal in the present case that devoto does not support the requirement of an allegation of purposeful intent directed specifically at the plaintiff in every case.instead,the devoto court states where the actor conduct is not criminal or fraudulent,and absent some other aggravating circumstances,it is necessary to identify those whom the actor had a specific motive or purpose to injure by his interference and to limit liability accordingly.devoto,supra,at,italics added.
the devoto court,then,determined that a defendant motive or purpose to interfere is a necessary element only when the defendant conduct is not independently unlawful.after della penna,independent wrongfulness has been recognized as a required element of the tort.therefore,an additional showing of specific intent to interfere is not necessary.
lockheed martin additionally argues that a specific intent requirement is necessary to prevent potential plaintiffs with injuries remotely caused by a defendant acts from maintaining standing to sue for this tort.it contends that since ksc is an indirect victim of defendants alleged acts of interference,ksc should only be able to state a claim if it can show that lockheed martin acted with the purpose of interfering with ksc economic expectancy.we disagree.were we to adopt a specific intent requirement,a plaintiff standing would turn on the subjective intent of a defendant who has committed an independently wrongful act.such a requirement would lead to absurd and unfair results.a defendant who engaged in an unlawful act knowing that it would harm the plaintiff business interest could escape liability if the defendant acted with the purpose of furthering its own interest,rather than specifically harming the plaintiff interest.standing for this tort should not be made to turn on such a consideration.
as support for its argument,lockheed martin cites section of the restatement second of torts and argues that a defendant must act with the specific intent of interfering with a plaintiff business expectancy when the plaintiff is not the direct victim of the interference.we note,however,that section of the restatement second of torts is entitled factors in determining whether interference is improper.this section,then,refers to the element of the tort that defines when interference is improper,not to the element that defines the required intent.as stated above,california law does not follow the restatement definition of when interference is improper.instead,california law defines improper more narrowly than the restatement,allowing recovery only when the defendant conduct is independently unlawful.
we further note that even the restatement,with its broader definition of improper conduct,recognizes that an indirectly injured plaintiff may state a claim under this tort without pleading that the defendant acted with the purpose to interfere with the plaintiff business expectancy.section,comment h,of the restatement,discussing the proximity or remoteness of the defendant conduct to the interference,supports our conclusion this remoteness between the defendant conduct and the plaintiff injury conduces toward a finding that the interference was not improper.the weight of this factor,however,may be controverted by the factor of the actor conduct if that conduct was inherently unlawful or independently tortious.rest d torts,com.h,italics added.if the defendant improper conduct constitutes independently wrongful behavior,the fact that the plaintiff is an indirect victim does not preclude recovery.
contrary to the arguments of lockheed martin and the concurring and dissenting opinion,we find no sound reason for requiring that a defendant wrongful actions must be directed towards the plaintiff seeking to recover for this tort.the interfering party is liable to the party when the independently tortious means the interfering party uses are independently tortious only as to a third party.even under these circumstances,the party remains an intended or at least known victim of the interfering one that is indirect rather than direct.della penna,supra,cal th at,d,conc.opn.of mosk,citing rest d torts,com.c.in fact,the most numerous of the tortious interference cases are those in which the disruption is caused by an act directed not at the plaintiff,but at a third person.perlman,interference with contract and other economic expectancies a clash of tort and contract doctrine.
we do not share the concern of lockheed martin and the concurring and dissenting opinion that our ruling today will expose defendants to an unlimited number of potential plaintiffs the substantial certainty test used in the restatement,coupled with the independent wrongfulness requirement of della penna,sufficiently limits this tort.it is important to underscore that the independent wrongfulness requirement of this tort limits the class of potential defendants only defendants who have engaged in an unlawful act can be held liable for this tort.in addition,as described below,each of the five elements of the tort of interference with prospective economic advantage serves to limit the number of potential plaintiffs that can state a cause of action for this tort 
first,a plaintiff that wishes to state a cause of action for this tort must allege the existence of an economic relationship with some third party that contains the probability of future economic benefit to the plaintiff.this tort therefore protects the expectation that the relationship eventually will yield the desired benefit,not necessarily the more speculative expectation that a potentially beneficial relationship will arise.westside center associates safeway stores,supra,th at,d.here,ksc had an agency relationship with macdonald dettwiler under which ksc commission was fixed at percent of the contract price.as alleged in the complaint,if macdonald dettwiler had been awarded the contract,ksc commission would have exceeded million.this business relationship and corresponding expectancy is sufficient to meet this first element.only plaintiffs that can demonstrate an economic relationship with a probable future economic benefit will be able to state a cause of action for this tort.
second,a defendant must have knowledge of the plaintiff economic relationship.ksc alleges that loral acted with full knowledge of the commission relationship between plaintiff and macdonald dettwiler.again,this element serves to restrict the class of plaintiffs that can state a claim for this tort.
third,the defendant must have engaged in intentionally wrongful acts designed to disrupt the plaintiff relationship.as discussed above,this requires a plaintiff to plead that the defendant engaged in an independently wrongful act,and that the defendant acted either with the desire to interfere or the knowledge that interference was certain or substantially certain to occur as a result of its action.here,ksc alleges that defendants bribed and offered sexual favors to korean officials,and paid excessive commissions,in violation of the foreign corrupt practices act.further,ksc claims that loral acted knowing that its interference with the award of the contract on a competitive basis would cause plaintiff severe loss.
this intent requirement is an appropriate limitation on both the potential number of plaintiffs that may bring a claim under this tort and the remoteness of these plaintiffs to a defendant wrongful conduct.at the very least,a defendant must know that its action is substantially certain to interfere with the plaintiff business expectancy.this interference becomes less certain as the time frame expands,the identity of potential victims becomes more vague,the causal sequence becomes more attenuated,and the assumption of easy preventability becomes less plausible.if the interference is not certain or substantially certain to occur as a result of the defendant acts,then a plaintiff will not be able to state a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.however,if a defendant knows that its wrongful acts are substantially certain to injure the plaintiff business expectancy,the defendant can be held liable,regardless of the motivation behind its actions.
liability will not be imposed for unforeseeable harm,since the plaintiff must prove that the defendant knew that the consequences were substantially certain to occur.for example,if the president of macdonald dettwiler stood to receive a bonus if the company secured the sar contract,it would be unlikely that lockheed martin would have known this with substantial certainty.here,however,ksc has alleged that defendants had full knowledge of its commission relationship with macdonald dettwiler and that ksc would lose its commission if lockheed martin secured the contract through anticompetitive means.
fourth,only plaintiffs that can demonstrate actual disruption of their economic relationship will be able to state a claim for this tort.in this case,ksc sufficiently pleads actual disruption by alleging that it did not receive its expected commission,since macdonald dettwiler was not awarded the contract.
fifth,a plaintiff must establish proximate causation.specifically,this element requires a plaintiff to show that the economic harm it suffered was proximately caused by the acts of the defendant.here,ksc claims that macdonald dettwiler would have been awarded the contract but for lockheed martin interference.ksc specifically pleads that macdonald dettwiler product was superior and that its bid was significantly lower than the bid submitted by lockheed martin.ksc also alleges that its own loss of commission from macdonald dettwiler was directly caused by lockheed martin tortious acts.we therefore conclude that ksc has satisfied the proximate cause element.in other cases,however,this proximate cause requirement will prevent a plaintiff from recovering for harm that is more remotely connected to a defendant wrongful conduct.
an actor engaging in unlawful conduct with the knowledge that its actions are certain or substantially certain to interfere with a party business expectancy should be held accountable.liability for such actions,which are independently wrongful,should not turn on the subjective intent of the defendant.
we conclude that the court of appeal correctly determined that to state a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,a plaintiff need not plead that the defendant acted with the specific intent to interfere with the plaintiff business expectancy further,we agree that plaintiff in this case has sufficiently pled that defendants acted with the required intent,that is,the knowledge that its actions were certain or substantially certain to interfere with plaintiff business expectancy.
we reverse the judgment of the court of appeal with respect to its holding that plaintiff has stated a cause of action under the unfair competition law and we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal with respect to its determination that plaintiff has stated a cause of action for the tort of interference with prospective economic advantage.the present case is remanded to the court of appeal for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i concur in the majority opinion.
the majority holds that disgorgement of profits is not an available remedy under california unfair competition law ucl bus,et when the action is brought by an individual entity on its own behalf.this conclusion logically follows from this court decision in kraus trinity management services,cal th,d,kraus.that case held that disgorgement of profits is not an available remedy in a representative action under the ucl when the case is not brought as a class action.kraus explained t he legislature has not expressly authorized monetary relief other than restitution in ucl actions,but has authorized disgorgement into a fluid recovery fund in class actions.although the legislature is well aware of the distinction between class actions and representative actions,it has not done so for representative ucl actions.id.at,d.on this issue,i agreed with the majority in kraus.
i wrote separately in kraus,however,because i was troubled by dictum in that case suggesting it may be appropriate to condition payment of restitution to nonparty beneficiaries of a representative ucl action on execution of acknowledgement that the payment is in full settlement of claims against the defendant.kraus,supra,cal th at,d,conc.opn.of kennard,quoting,id.at,d.but here the issue of conditioning payment of restitution to nonparty beneficiaries in a representative ucl action is not implicated because this case involves an individual entity,the agent of unsuccessful bidders for a lucrative contract to supply military equipment to the republic of korea.because plaintiff here paid no money to defendant successful bidder,i agree with the majority that plaintiff is not entitled to restitution,ante,d at,at.
i agree with the majority that a plaintiff,in order to state a claim for interference with prospective economic advantage,need not plead that a defendant acted with the specific intent to interfere with the plaintiff business expectancy,and with the reasoning leading to that conclusion,ante,d at,at.under compulsion of kraus trinity management services,cal th,d,from which i dissented,i further agree that nonrestitutionary disgorgement of profits is not an available remedy in an individual action under the unfair competition law,business and professions code section et,ante,d at,at.accordingly,i concur in the judgment.
i agree with the majority conclusion that disgorgement of profits is not a proper remedy where an individual private plaintiff alleges a violation of california unfair competition law bus,et and the requested disgorgement would not be restitutionary in nature.however,i dissent from the majority conclusion that recovery for intentional interference with prospective advantage is available to a plaintiff whose alleged injury only indirectly and remotely followed from the defendant interference with the prospective economic advantage of a third party with whom the plaintiff had a contractual relationship.here,plaintiff korea supply company ksc alleges that it sustained such remote,indirect,and derivative injury as a result of the interference by defendants lockheed martin tactical systems,and lockheed martin corporation collectively lockheed with the prospective economic advantage of macdonald,dettwiler,and associates macdonald.thus,in my view,ksc may not state a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.
ksc claim fails for lack of a prospective economic advantage.
as a threshold matter,ksc has improperly brought its claim as one for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,when it should have brought the claim,if at all,as one for interference with contract.the first element of a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage is an economic relationship between the plaintiff and some third person containing the probability of future economic benefit to the plaintiff.blank kirwan cal d.here,ksc had no existing or prospective economic relationship with the republic of korea,which is the only entity with which lockheed had any dealings.as ksc alleged and as the majority explains,ante,d at,at,ksc expected to receive payment from macdonald,not from the republic of korea.thus,ksc only economic relationship here was its existing contractual relationship with macdonald,and ksc alleges that lockheed actions prevented ksc from realizing the benefits of that existing contract.given these allegations,ksc claim is,in reality,a claim for interference with contract,not intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.as the restatement second of torts restatement second explains,the latter claim is concerned only with intentional interference with prospective contractual relations,not yet reduced to contract.rest d,com.a,italics added see also shoemaker myers cal d,complaint identifying no prospective economic advantage other than continuation of plaintiff employment relationship is,in reality,claim for inducement of breach of contract.thus,as lockheed argued in its demurrer,ksc claim for prospective economic advantage fails at the threshold because the complaint fails to allege a prospective economic relationship between ksc and a third person,and the disruption of that relationship.
in reaching a contrary conclusion,the majority errs factually in stating that ksc does not allege that it had a contractual agreement with macdonald,ante,d at,at.ksc complaint alleges that ksc had a commission relationship with macdonald providing for ksc to receive fifteen percent of the contract price,and that lockheed interference caused ksc to lose its agreed commission.italics added.at oral argument before us,ksc cited these allegations in arguing that it had alleged a contract between itself and macdonald.similarly,at the hearing on lockheed demurrer,ksc argued that it could pursue the interference claim because it had a contract with macdonald affording ksc a percent commission on the contract price if macdonald won the contract.italics added.in the court of appeal,ksc argued that it was contractually entitled to receive fifteen percent of the contract price if macdonald obtained the contract,that its economic interests were intertwined with macdonald given its contractual representation of macdonald and its contractual entitlement to a commission if macdonald obtained the contract,and that it could pursue the interference claim by virtue of its commissionable contractual interest in macdonald prospective contract.italics added.thus,the record demonstrates that the majority is simply wrong in asserting that ksc does not allege an enforceable contract with macdonald,ante,d at,at.moreover,because this case comes to us after the sustaining of a demurrer,we must assume,based on these allegations,that ksc had a valid and enforceable commission contract with macdonald.
the majority also errs in asserting that the existence of a contract does not mean that a plaintiff claim must be brought exclusively as one for interference with contract,ante,d at,at.as support for its assertion,the majority cites dictum in buckaloo johnson cal d,buckaloo,ante,d at,at.in generally describing the historical development of the interference torts,buckaloo stated that the tort of interference with contract is merely a species of the broader tort of interference with prospective economic advantage.buckaloo,supra,cal d at.buckaloo also stated that the tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage is considerably more inclusive than actions based on contract or interference with contract,and thus is not dependent on the existence of a valid contract.id.at.buckaloo also seemingly endorsed a federal district court view that r ather than characterizing interference with contract and intentional interference with prospective business relations as separate torts,the more rational approach seems to be that the basic tort of interference with economic relations can be established by showing,inter alia,an interference with an existing contract or a contract which is certain to be consummated id.at,fn.the majority assertion rests exclusively on this dictum.see,ante,d at,at.
for several reasons,buckaloo dictum is insufficient to support the majority conclusion.first,other statements in buckaloo contradict the majority analysis.buckaloo explained that the tort of intentional interference with prospective advantage applies where a prospective economic relationship has not attained the dignity of a legally enforceable agreement buckaloo,supra,cal d at.buckaloo also stressed that the area of activity this tort protects is not a contractual relationship but an economic relationship with the potential to ripen into contract.id.at,fn.it is in this protection of non contractual buckaloo stated that the tort of intentional interference with prospective advantage is considerably more inclusive than the tort of interference with contract.id.at.as the statements i have quoted make clear,buckaloo was not,as the majority incorrectly suggests,indicating that the tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage also includes claims based on a valid and enforceable contract.thus,several statements in buckaloo contradict the majority view that a plaintiff may base a claim for intentional interference with prospective advantage on an interference with a valid and enforceable contract 
second,the majority reliance on buckaloo dictum is also incorrect because the federal decision buckaloo endorsed did not,as the majority erroneously suggests,state that a claim for interference with contract may be brought as one for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.rather,it suggested that these claims should be recognized not as separate torts,but as alternative theories for establishing a single,broader tort called interference with economic relations.buckaloo,supra,cal d at,fn,quoting builders corporation of america united states,fn,revd.on other grounds cir.despite buckaloo dictum,we have not recognized this broader tort.on the contrary,we have stressed the need to draw and enforce a sharpened distinction between claims for the tortious disruption of an existing contract and claims that a prospective contractual or economic relationship has been interfered with by the defendant.della penna toyota motor sales,cal th,d,della penna.indeed,the majority purports to reiterate della penna statement that california courts should firmly distinguish between these two separate torts,ante,d at,at.unfortunately,the majority fails to follow this statement.
finally,the other statement from buckaloo the majority the tort of interference with contract is merely a species of the broader tort of interference with prospective economic advantage,ante,d at,at is both imprecise and incorrect.buckaloo cited several authorities as establishing this proposition,but none of them stated that the tort of interference with contract is a species of the tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.rather,to the extent they spoke to this question,consistent with the federal decision discussed above,they characterized or analyzed interference with contract and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage as separate aspects of the broader subject of interference with commercial or economic relations.prosser,torts ed,see also harper james,torts,interference with contract is one of several segments of a large area of the law of tort in which damages may be recovered for unlawfully causing loss to the plaintiff in connection with his business relations id.at,actions for interference with contract and interference with reasonable economic expectations protect different rights and interests witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts,note,developments in the torts harv,stressing the difference between the action for inducing breach of contract and the action for interference with prospective advantage.consistent with these authorities,in an extensive historical discussion,we have previously labeled interference with contract and interference with prospective economic relations as,generally,the interference torts,and characterized them as two torts that are sibling s.della penna,supra,cal th at,d.thus,buckaloo dictum is erroneous and it fails to support the majority assertion that ksc may properly base a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage on allegations that lockheed interfered with the existing contract between ksc and macdonald.
the discussion of this subject in the restatement second,on which the majority heavily relies,fully supports the conclusion that buckaloo dictum,and the majority conclusion based on that dictum,are incorrect.consistent with the authorities i have already discussed,the restatement second explains that interference with contract and interference with prospective advantage are separate form s of the broader subject of intentional interference with business relations.rest d,com.b,see also,com.j,interference with contract and interference with prospective economic advantage are separate forms of interference with business relations.the restatement second also explains that,as their names suggest,intentional interference with contract involves only interference with an existing contract,whereas intentional interference with prospective economic advantage is concerned only with intentional interference with prospective contractual relations not yet reduced to contract.rest d,com.a,italics added.thus,the restatement second supports the conclusion that because ksc alleges only a loss of benefits under its existing contract with macdonald,and it had no prospective relationship with the republic of korea,its claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage fails at the threshold for lack of a prospective economic advantage with which lockheed allegedly interfered.the majority contrary conclusion improperly blurs the analytical line between interference with an existing business contract and interference with commercial relations less than contractual,thus invit ing both uncertainty and unpredictability della penna,supra,cal th at,d.
ii.ksc alleged injuries are too remote to warrant recovery.
in its demurrer,lockheed argued that the economic relationship it allegedly disrupted was macdonald effort to obtain the award of the contract from the republic of korea,and that ksc alleged injury was merely an indirect consequence of this alleged disruption.this indirect injury,lockheed continued,does not give rise to a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage because ksc can not show that the injury resulted from the disruption of a prospective economic relationship to which ksc was a party.in sustaining the demurrer,the trial court agreed with lockheed,finding that ksc claim failed because it was secondary and derivative and indirect and ksc has found no case from any state or federal jurisdiction giving cognizance to a comparable secondary or derivative or indirect claim.
the majority rejects this view and holds that an indirectly injured plaintiff may state a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,and may do so without pleading that the defendant acted with the purpose to interfere with the plaintiff business expectancy,ante,d at,at.the majority gives scant attention to this issue.it cites no decisions,from california or elsewhere,supporting either its analysis or its holding.the sole authority the majority cites is a portion of comment h to section of the restatement second comment h.the majority states section,comment h,of the restatement second,discussing the proximity or remoteness of the defendant conduct to the interference,supports our conclusion this remoteness between the defendant conduct and the plaintiff injury conduces toward a finding that the interference was not improper.the weight of this factor,however,may be controverted by the factor of the actor conduct if that conduct was inherently unlawful or independently tortious.citation.if the defendant improper conduct constitutes independently wrongful behavior,the fact that the plaintiff is an indirect victim does not preclude recovery,ante,d at,at,fn.omitted.
for several reasons,comment h is insufficient support for the majority conclusion that ksc status as an indirect victim does not preclude recovery,ante,d at,at.first,comment h does not,as the majority suggests,categorically state that a defendant commission of an independently wrongful act does overcome remoteness between the defendant conduct and the plaintiff injury.rather,in decidedly equivocal terms,comment h states that the significance of remoteness may be controverted perhaps by the factor of the actor conduct if that conduct was inherently unlawful or independently tortious.rest d,com.h,italics added.comment h equivocal language does not support the majority categorical holding that where a defendant conduct is independently wrongful,the fact that the plaintiff is an indirect victim does not preclude recovery,ante,d at,at.
second,comment h addresses proximity and remoteness in the context of an interference with an existing contract,not an interference with a merely prospective economic advantage.this fact is clear from the portion of comment h that immediately precedes the portion the majority quotes,which states if a induces b to sell certain goods to him and thereby causes him not to perform his contract to supply the goods to c,this may also have the effect of preventing c from performing his contractual obligations to supply them to d and c failure to perform his contracts is a much more indirect and remote consequence of a conduct than b breach of his contract with c,even assuming that a was aware of all contractual obligations and the interference can be called intentional.rest d,com.h,italics added.this fact is significant because,as the restatement second elsewhere explains,the law affords greater protection to the interest in an existing contract than to the interest in acquiring prospective contractual relations,and section weighing process therefore does not necessarily reach the same result in regard to these separate forms of interference with business relations.rest d,com.j,see also,com.a,weight of various factors may vary considerably with respect to different forms of the tort.thus,comment h discussion of the interaction between independently wrongful means and remoteness in the context of an interference with an existing contract does not necessarily apply to the same extent with regard to an interference with a merely prospective economic advantage.by failing to distinguish between these torts,the majority,in the words of the restatement second,produce s a blurring of the significance of the factors involved in determining liability.rest d,ch,introductory note.
third,and most important,the restatement second sections and comments regarding interference with contract and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage do not even purport to address the fundamental question before us whether lockheed alleged interference is the legal cause of the remote,indirect,and derivative injury ksc alleges.the relevant sections of the restatement second state rules for determining whether someone is subject to liability.rest d.under the restatement second,subject to liability means only that the actor conduct is such as to make him liable for another injury,if,in addition,the actor conduct is a legal cause of the injury.rest d,italics added.legal cause,according to the restatement,means that the causal sequence by which the actor tortious conduct has resulted in an invasion of some legally protected interest of another is such that the law holds the actor responsible for such harm unless there is some defense to liability.rest d.regarding the relationship between these concepts,the restatement second explains to become liable under the principles of the law of torts,an actor conduct must not only be tortious in character but it must also be a legal cause of the invasion of another interest.if the actor has engaged in conduct which is tortious in character,he thereby subjects himself to liability in order that the actor become liable to another,it is necessary,among other things,that his conduct be the legal cause of the invasion of the other interest rest d.in order that a particular act or omission may be the legal cause of an invasion of another interest,the act or omission must be a substantial factor in bringing about the harm,and there must be no principle or rule of law which restricts the actor liability because of the manner in which the act or omission operates to bring about such invasion.rest d,com.b.thus,a defendant may be subject to liability within the meaning of the restatement second but may escape liability if his or her conduct is not the legal cause of the plaintiff harm.rest d.because the restatement second sections on interference with contract and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage consider the circumstances only for determining whether a defendant is subject to liability rest d,they do not even purport to address the more fundamental question now before us whether lockheed alleged interference is the legal cause of the remote,indirect,and derivative injury ksc alleges.thus,the majority reliance on the restatement second is both inadequate and unpersuasive.
our prior decisions discuss similar concepts in tort law.as we have explained,p roximate cause involves two elements.citation.one is cause in fact.an act is a cause in fact if it is a necessary antecedent of an event.citation.to simply say,however,that the defendant conduct was a necessary antecedent of the injury does not resolve the question of whether the defendant should be liable t he consequences of an act go forward to eternity,and the causes of an event go back to the dawn of human events,and beyond.but any attempt to impose responsibility upon such a basis would result in infinite liability for all wrongful acts,and would set society on edge and fill the courts with endless litigation.citation.therefore,the law must impose limitations on liability other than simple causality.these additional limitations are related not only to the degree of connection between the conduct and the injury,but also with public policy.citation.as justice traynor observed,proximate cause is ordinarily concerned,not with the fact of causation,but with the various considerations of policy that limit an actor responsibility for the consequences of his conduct.citation.ppg industries,transamerica ins.cal th,d,holding that although the defendant was cause in fact of the plaintiff damages,for policy reasons,it was not proximate cause.in short,proximate cause is a legal filter on but for causation that courts apply to those more or less undefined considerations which limit liability even where the fact of causation is clearly established.citation.vons companies,seabest foods,cal th,d.moreover,to the extent proximate cause involves limitations imposed upon liability as a matter of public policy,the issue is for the court to decide as a question of law.mosley arden farms cal d,conc.opn.of traynor.thus,the majority errs in concluding that ksc has satisfied the proximate cause element merely by pleading that its injury was directly caused by lockheed alleged interference,ante,d at,at.this allegation does not render the complaint sufficient because,as i later explain,it affirmatively appears from other allegations that the act s made the basis of liability are,as a matter of law,not the proximate cause of the injury complained of.katz helbing cal.
regarding the more fundamental policy question of legal,or proximate,cause,the majority has little to say.the majority declares that there is no sound reason for requiring that a defendant wrongful actions must be directed towards the plaintiff,ante,d at,at.to do so,the majority suggests,would exclude what a law review article describes as the most numerous of the tortious interference cases those in which the disruption is caused by an act directed not at the plaintiff,but at a third person,ante,d at,at.
this analysis simply attacks a straw man of the majority own creation.contrary to the majority suggestion,no one asserts that we should allow recovery only where the defendant wrongful act is directed towards the plaintiff,ante,d at,at.rather,the issue here is whether to allow recovery where the wrongful act is not directed towards the plaintiff or towards anyone with whom the plaintiff had a prospective economic advantage.as i have previously explained,lockheed directed no actions towards either ksc or macdonald.it directed its actions only towards the republic of which ksc has no prospective economic ksc alleged injury is only a remote,indirect,and derivative consequence of those alleged acts towards the republic of korea.moreover,contrary to the majority suggestion,cases involving such derivative injury are not among those that the cited law review article described as being the most numerous.perlman,interference with contract and other economic expectancies a clash of tort and contract doctrine.according to the article,that category consists of cases in which the defendant act of interference was directed towards a third person who was in a r elationship with the p laintiff.see also id.at.again,this is not such a case,because lockheed alleged acts were not directed towards anyone having either an existing or prospective relationship with ksc 
the majority also summarily declares that because,under della penna,supra,cal th,d,a defendant liability for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage requires commission of an independently wrongful act,a plaintiff standing to sue should not turn on the defendant subjective intent,ante,d at,at.a contrary conclusion,the majority reasons,would produce absurd and unfair results.ibid.again,the majority cites no case law supporting its analysis and conclusion.moreover,the majority reliance on della penna wrongful act requirement subverts and distorts the purpose of that requirement.in della penna,we required an independently wrongful act in order to restrict the scope of the tort.contrary to this purpose,the majority here uses that requirement as justification for significantly expanding the tort scope by allowing recovery for remote,indirect,and derivative injuries.finally,the majority conclusion that it would be unfair to preclude recovery for indirect and remote injury simply because the defendant lacked specific intent begs the more fundamental,threshold question of whether a plaintiff with remote,indirect,and derivative injury should be able to recover even if the defendant had specific intent.
regarding this threshold policy question,and lacking governing california authority,we should follow the substantial body of case law from other the united states supreme deals with analogous causes of action and holds that parties with remote,indirect,and derivative injuries may not recover.the high court has addressed this subject in the context of antitrust law.consistent with the causation principles i have previously discussed,the high court has explained that although a n antitrust violation may be expected to cause ripples of harm to flow through the nation economy,there is a point beyond which the wrongdoer should not be held liable.citation.blue shield of virginia mccready,d blue shield.like remedies,the judicial remedy for an antitrust violation can not encompass every conceivable harm that can be traced to alleged wrongdoing.associated general contractors of california,california state council of carpenters,d associated general.thus,in an antitrust case,the question of which persons have been injured by the alleged antitrust violation is analytically distinct from the question of which persons have sustained injuries too remote to give them standing to sue for damages illinois brick illinois,fn,d,illinois brick see also blue shield,supra,at.
the high court focused on these questions in associated general,where several labor unions sought damages for an alleged antitrust violation by an employers association.the unions alleged that the employers association illegally coerced certain third parties to enter into business relationships with nonunion firms.this coercion,according to the unions complaint,adversely affected the trade of certain unionized firms and thereby restrained the business activities of the unions.associated general,supra,at.the court of appeals held that the unions had standing to recover damages for the injury to their own business activities because their injury was not only a foreseeable consequence of the antitrust violation,but also was specifically intended by the defendants.id.at.the high court disagreed and held that the unions could not maintain their antitrust action notwithstanding their allegation of intent to harm.id.at.
notably,in reaching its conclusion,the high court in associated general expressly relied on common law principles,which are,of course,applicable in the case now before us.the court reasoned in,notwithstanding general language in many state constitutions providing in substance that every wrong shall have a remedy,a number of rules circumscribed the availability of damages recoveries in both tort and contract such as foreseeability and proximate cause,directness of injury,certainty of damages,and privity of contract.although particular limitations were not debated in congress,the frequent references to principles in congressional debates on the antitrust laws imply that congress simply assumed that antitrust damages would be subject to constraints comparable to rules applied in comparable litigation.associated general,supra,at,fns.omitted.the court noted that,based on this understanding of congressional intent,federal judges had held as a matter of law that neither a creditor nor a stockholder of a corporation that was injured by a violation of the antitrust laws could recover because a plaintiff injury as a stockholder is indirect,remote,and consequential.citation.id.at.this holding,the high court continued,is consistent with t he general tendency of the law,in regard to damages at least,not to go beyond the first step.citation.id.at.thus,the court reasoned,as was required in damages litigation in,the question of whether the plaintiff may recover for the injury it allegedly suffered by reason of the defendants coercion against certain third parties requires evaluat ion of the plaintiff harm,the alleged wrongdoing by the defendants,and the relationship between them.id.at,fn.omitted.
in holding that the unions could not maintain their antitrust action,the high court in associated general stressed,among other factors,the indirectness of the unions asserted injury.associated general,supra,at.focusing on the chain of causation between the unions injury and the alleged antitrust violation,the high court found that any such injuries were only an indirect result of whatever harm may have been suffered by the construction contractors and subcontractors that lost business due to the defendants coercion.id.at.if either these firms,or the immediate victims of coercion by defendants,have been injured by an antitrust violation,their injuries would be direct and they would have a right to maintain their own actions against the defendants the existence of an identifiable class of persons whose would normally motivate them to sue diminishes the justification for allowing more remote part ies such as the unions to maintain an action.id.at.denying the u nion s a remedy on the basis of the allegations in this case is not likely to leave a significant antitrust violation undetected or unremedied.id.at.indeed,the court explained,if there is substance to the u nion s claim,it is difficult to understand why these direct victims of the conspiracy have not asserted any claim in their own right.id.at,fn.
in illinois brick,the high court applied similar principles in holding that where the defendant violates the antitrust laws by fixing prices and sells to an entity that passes the resulting overcharges on to its customers,the injuries of the customers resulting from the defendant antitrust violation are legally too remote to support recovery.illinois brick,supra,at.the court acknowledged that this holding denies recovery to indirect purchasers who may have been actually injured by antitrust violations.id.at.however,i n view of the relevant policy considerations,the court was unwilling to carry the compensation principle to its logical extreme by attempting to allocate damages among all those within the defendant chain of distribution citation ibid.the considerations the court cited were the defendant interest in avoiding multiple liability for the amount of the overcharge,the interest of absent potential plaintiffs in protecting their right to recover for the portion of the overcharge allocable to them and the social interest in the efficient administration of justice and the avoidance of multiple litigation.id.at.
the high court reaffirmed illinois brick in kansas utilicorp united,d.there,the court held that where natural gas suppliers illegally overcharged a public utility and the utility passed on the overcharge to its customers,the customers injuries were too remote to support an antitrust action.id.at.the court explained that the customers have the status of indirect purchasers because i n the distribution chain,they are not the immediate buyers from the alleged antitrust violators.id.at.the court next observed that its decision in illinois brick den ies relief to consumers who have paid inflated prices because of their status as indirect purchasers.citations.kansas,supra,at.finally,the court refused to create an exception to the illinois brick rule for cases involving public utilities,even assuming that any economic assumptions underlying that rule might be disproved in a specific case kansas,supra,at.
in holmes securities investor protection,d holmes,the high court applied these same principles to a claim under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico.in holmes,plaintiff securities investor protection corporation sipc alleged that the defendant,in violation of rico,illegally conspired in a scheme that disabled two from meeting obligations to customers,which in turn trigger ed sipc statutory duty to advance funds to reimburse the customers.holmes,supra,at.the court held that sipc could not maintain its claim because its injuries were too remote.
in reaching its conclusion,the holmes court began by finding it unlikel y that congress meant to allow all factually injured plaintiffs to recover holmes,supra,at,fn.omitted.the court explained that i n a philosophical sense,the consequences of an act go forward to eternity,and the causes of an event go back to the dawn of human events,and beyond.but any attempt to impose responsibility upon such a basis would result in infinite liability for all wrongful acts,and would set society on edge and fill the courts with endless litigation.citation.id.at,fn.relying on associated general,the holmes court then found that because congress incorporate d principles of proximate causation into rico,a plaintiff right to recover under rico require s a showing that the defendant violation not only was a but for cause of his injury,but was the proximate cause as well.holmes,supra,at.the court next explained that one aspect of proximate is a generic label for the judicial tools used to limit a person responsibility for the consequences of his or her acts is a demand for some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.thus,a plaintiff who complain s of harm flowing merely from the misfortunes visited upon a third person by the defendant acts i s generally said to stand at too remote a distance to recover.citation.id.at.
the holmes court next discussed its application of the proximate cause concept in antitrust cases.citing associated general,the court explained that directness of relationship between the plaintiff injury and the defendant conduct is one of the central elements of causation under antitrust law for a variety of reasons.first,the less direct an injury is,the more difficult it becomes to ascertain the amount of a plaintiff damages attributable to the violation,as distinct from other,independent,factors.citation.second,quite apart from problems of proving factual causation,recognizing claims of the indirectly injured would force courts to adopt complicated rules apportioning damages among plaintiffs removed at different levels of injury from the violative acts,to obviate the risk of multiple recoveries.citations.and,finally,the need to grapple with these problems is simply unjustified by the general interest in deterring injurious conduct,since directly injured victims can generally be counted on to vindicate the law as private attorneys general,without any of the problems attendant upon suits by plaintiffs injured more remotely.citation.holmes,supra,at.
finally,applying these principles to rico,the holmes court held that sipc could not maintain its rico action.after noting sipc theory of sipc was subrogated to the rights of those customers of the who did not purchase manipulated securities holmes,supra,at.the court explained e ven assuming,arguendo,that sipc may stand in the shoes of nonpurchasing customers,the link is too remote between the stock manipulation alleged and the customers harm,being purely contingent on the harm suffered by the.that is,the conspirators have allegedly injured these customers only insofar as the stock manipulation first injured the and left them without the wherewithal to pay customers claims.although the customers claims are senior in recourse to customer property to those of the general creditors,citation,the causes of their respective injuries are the same the simply can not pay their bills,and only that intervening insolvency connects the conspirators acts to the losses suffered by the nonpurchasing customers and general creditors.as we said,however,in associated general contractors,quoting justice holmes,the general tendency of the law,in regard to damages at least,is not to go beyond the first step citation,and the reasons that supported conforming antitrust causation to the general tendency apply just as readily to the present facts,underscoring the obvious congressional adoption of the clayton act limitation among the requirements of rico.holmes,supra,at,fns.omitted.a contrary conclusion would a llow suits by those injured only indirectly,thereby open ing the door to massive and complex damages litigation that would not only burde n the courts,but would also undermin e the effectiveness of suits.citation.id.at.
lower federal courts have applied these principles to preclude recovery for remote,indirect,and derivative injury in several cases that are relevant here because they involved commission relationships,bribes,pendent state claims for interference with prospective economic advantage,allegations of specific intent to harm.in brian clewer,pan american world airways,the court held that clewer,a travel agency,could not maintain an antitrust action against several airlines that had allegedly conspired to destroy laker,another airline with which clewer had a commission arrangement.like ksc,clewer alleged damages in the form of lost commissions.id.at.clewer also alleged that the defendants had acted with the object of damaging its business.id.at.despite this allegation,the court,applying associated general,found that clewer could not maintain the action because any injury to clewer was only an indirect result of whatever harm may have been suffered by laker,and thus clewer injury was derivative of laker.brian clewer,supra,at.the court explained that other potential plaintiffs laker,laker passengers,former laker employees stand in a better posture to assert antitrust claims due to a more direct harm than clewer.ibid.given all of these potential plaintiffs,if clewer and other similarly situated travel agencies are found to have standing to sue for a portion of laker revenues,a possibility exists of duplicative recovery against the defendants.id.at.in concluding,the court explained clewer stands in the same position as numerous other prospective plaintiffs whose alleged losses are indirect and derivative,other travel agencies,other supplie r s of goods and services,food vendors,waste disposal services,and custodians clewer injury is too indirect to provide standing under the antitrust laws.id.at.
on analogous facts,another federal court reached a similar conclusion in fallis pendleton woolen mills,cir.there,the plaintiff,a sales representative for the defendant,filed an antitrust action alleging that he lost commissions as a result of the defendant alleged scheme.id.at.the court held that the plaintiff could not maintain his action because his alleged injury was derivative it was simply a side effect of the defendant alleged antitrust violations any injury to the plaintiff was merely incidental to the purposes of the alleged arrangement,which was aimed at disciplining retailers and raising consumer prices,not reducing the commissions earned by salespersons.ibid.as is generally true where the plaintiff injury is indirect,more direct victims of the alleged conspiracy exist in the present case id.at.i f the court were to allow all indirect victims standing to sue,the dangers of duplicative recovery and complex apportionment of damages would become very real.citations.id.at.in light of these factors the indirectness of plaintiff injury,the existence of more direct victims,the possibility of duplicative court held that the plaintiff lack ed antitrust standing.id.at.
another case involving analogous facts is eagle foods,cir.there,fishermen alleged that fish canneries had violated the antitrust laws by conspiring to set tuna prices at artificially low levels.id.at.the fishermen worked as crewmembers on vessels owned by others,who sold the vessels catch to the canneries and then paid the fishermen based on a share of the catch or the price per ton.ibid.regarding damages,the fishermen alleged that the artificially low price levels result ed in a reduction of the wages they received.ibid.applying associated general,the court held that the fishermen could not maintain an antitrust action because their alleged injuries were derivative of the injuries suffered by the vessel owners.eagle,supra,at.in reaching its conclusion,the court rejected the argument that the fishermen were directly injured because calculation of their wages was completely and inextricably intertwined with the artificially low selling prices and because they were joint venturers with the vessel owners ibid.the court explained w hat exists between the vessel owners and the crewmembers is an relationship once a sale has been completed,the crewmembers are paid their wages either on a share of the catch or basis thus,any injury they suffered is derived from any injury suffered by the vessel owners when the employer reacts to a loss by terminating employees,or when employees receive diminished salary or commissions,as a result of the employers weakened market position,these employees suffer derivative injury only.citation.id.at,first italics added.the court also reasoned that the vessel owners have the requisite motivation to vindicate the public interest in enforcement of the antitrust laws,and that t he justification for allowing the crewmembers to bring the action is thereby diminished because they are more remote parties.eagle,supra,at.
still another relevant application of these remoteness principles occurred in hawaii health welfare trust fund for operating engineers philip morris,i d.there,numerous labor management health and welfare funds,which paid medical bills for union workers,filed a rico action against the major cigarette manufacturers alleging a conspiracy to suppress information regarding the effects of smoking and claiming damage in the form of payment of unnecessary medical costs to fund beneficiaries.id.at.applying holmes,the court held that the remoteness doctrine barred the claim because the funds themselves ha d suffered no direct injury.hawaii health welfare trust fund for operating engineers,supra,d at.the court explained that the remoteness doctrine,w hether analyzed in terms of proximate cause or standing,generally bars indirect claims where other more parties are the proper plaintiffs.citation.ibid.the court found the doctrine applicable because the alleged injuries were derivative,not direct,in that they were entirely dependent upon injuries sustained by fund participants and beneficiaries,making the plaintiffs at least one step removed from the challenged harmful conduct.citation.id.at.thus,the plaintiffs were seek ing recovery for the same injuries to victims represented,or able to be represented,in other direct suits.id.at.the court conclusion is especially relevant to the case now before us because,in applying the remoteness doctrine,the court expressly rejected the plaintiffs argument that the ir injury was allegedly intentional and directed specifically to the trust funds because the d efendants knew their fraudulent scheme would cause the trust funds to expend additional money on health related costs.ibid.
carter berger cir is relevant here because it applied these remoteness principles in a case involving alleged bribes.the plaintiffs in carter filed a rico action claiming that the defendant used illegal bribes to obtain lower property tax assessments,which resulted in higher taxes for everyone else.id.at.the court held that the plaintiffs were not the right parties to bring th e suit because their injury derive d from the county ibid.after describing illinois brick remoteness analysis,the court explained the same approach prevails throughout the law t he general tendency of the law,in regard to damages at least,is not to go beyond the first step.citations.carter,supra,at.thus,the indirectly injured party may not sue if a wrong committed against a firm causes it to become bankrupt and discharge its employees or discontinue its purchases,the injured employees and suppliers may not sue.ibid.a n indirectly injured party should look to the recovery of the directly injured party,not to the wrongdoer,for relief.id.at see also national enterprises,mellon financial services.number cir,unpaid creditor of bankrupt corporation could not pursue rico action against defendant that required kickbacks from corporation as a loan condition.
finally,among the federal cases,newton tyson foods,cir is particularly noteworthy here because it involved bribes and it applied these remoteness principles to claims for a rico violation and a pendent state law claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.in newton,cattle producers sued a poultry producer,alleging that it was able to exempt the poultry industry from strict regulations by providing illegal payments to government officials.id.at.they alleged that this exemption resulted in lower costs,which enabled poultry producers to lower poultry prices,which increased demand for poultry and lowered the demand for beef,which reduced beef sales by packers,which reduced the plaintiffs sales to packers and lowered the price of cattle sold.id.at.the court first held that the plaintiffs could not maintain their rico claim because their alleged injuries were far distant along the chain of causation from the defendant alleged wrongs and were too attenuated and removed from those wrongs to provide a basis for standing under rico.citation.id.at.noting that proximate cause was also an element of the plaintiffs claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,the court next held that the plaintiffs tort claim fail ed as a matter of law for the same reasons that the plaintiffs lack ed standing to pursue their rico claim.citation.id.at see also laborers local hlth.ben.fund philip morris,cir,applying rico cause analysis to dismiss common law claims for fraud and breach of special duty.
given the overlap between antitrust law and the tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,we should follow these federal decisions and decline to recognize a tort cause of action for plaintiffs,like ksc,that allege only remote,indirect,and derivative injury.liability for both the tort and an antitrust violation requires an independently wrongful act.moreover,the purpose of the tort is similar to the purpose of the antitrust laws to provid e a remedy for predatory economic behavior while keeping legitimate business competition outside litigative bounds.della penna,supra,cal th at,d.notably,the restatement second expressly recognizes the interplay between antitrust law and the law of tortious interference with prospective contractual relations.rest d,com.c.it explains that because a claim for this tort is often based on an antitrust violation,antitrust legislation and the very extensive case law that has developed as a gloss upon it are pertinent to a great number of the tort cases id.at see also,com.c,conduct that is in violation of antitrust provisions or is in restraint of trade may make interference improper.finally,as i have already explained,the federal courts have based their proximate causation analysis on common law principles,which are no less applicable in defining the scope of the common law tort.given this overlap,we should follow the extensive antitrust case law and decline to extend tort liability to plaintiffs,like ksc,that allege only remote,indirect,and derivative injury.
moreover,a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage by a plaintiff with only remote,indirect,and derivative injuries implicates the same factors the federal courts have cited in precluding antitrust recovery for such injuries.allowing recovery under these circumstances creates a risk of duplicative recovery.here,for example,the lost commission ksc seeks to recover represents a percentage of the contract price macdonald would have paid to ksc had macdonald obtained the contract.there are,no doubt,others who also stood to gain from the award of the contract to macdonald and who would have claims to other portions of the contract price.there is no principled way to cut off a myriad of other indirect claimants who can each claim that their business was somehow impacted or adversely affected by macdonald loss of the contract.sharp united airlines,cir,dismissing antitrust and prospective economic advantage claims of employees alleging that the defendant illegal conduct destroyed their employer.of course,macdonald may also sue for the entire contract price.moreover,macdonald,which is absent from this action,has an interest in protecting its right to recover.finally,given macdonald much more direct connection to lockheed alleged interference,denying ksc a remedy for its alleged remote,indirect,and derivative injury is not likely to leave tortious conduct undetected or unremedied.thus,the social interest in the efficient administration of justice and the avoidance of multiple litigation supports a rule precluding a plaintiff like ksc from maintaining a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage where the plaintiff injury only remotely and indirectly follows from a defendant alleged interference with the prospective economic advantage of some third party.illinois brick,supra,at.there is simply insufficient reason for the law to shoulder these difficulties when those directly injured can be counted on to bring suit for the law vindication.holmes,supra,at.the existence of an identifiable class of persons whose would normally motivate them to sue diminishes the justification for allowing more remote part ies,such as ksc,to maintain an action.associated general,supra,at.
indeed,courts applying new york law have reached precisely this conclusion and have held that parties with indirect and remote injuries may not recover for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.like california,new york precludes recovery for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage unless the means employed by the defendant were wrongful.nbt bancorp financial group.in addition,under new york law,in order for a party to make out a claim,the defendant must interfere with the business relationship directly that is,the defendant must direct some activities towards the third party and convince the third party not to enter into a business relationship with the plaintiff.citation.fonar magnetic resonance plus.applying this rule,in beverage honickman cir,the court held that soft drink distributors could not state a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage by alleging that the defendants acts to drive out of business a bottling company with which the distributors had contracted interfered with their relationships with retailers and other final purchasers of soft drinks.the court explained the defendants alleged goal was to obtain a monopoly in bottling,and the distributors relationship with their retail customers is irrelevant to that goal.the distributors thus make no allegations that the defendants had any contact with the distributors customers or that the defendants tried to convince the customers to make contracts with them rather than the distributors.it is axiomatic that,in order to prevail on this claim,the distributors would have to show that the defendants intentionally caused the retailers not to enter into a contractual relationship with them.citations.the distributors can not allege such intentional interference,and their claim therefore fails.ibid.
in piccoli calvin klein jeanswear d,the court applied similar principles in dismissing a claim for tortious interference with business relations.the plaintiff alleged that the defendant exported surplus calvin klein jeans to stores in scandinavia and that the presence of these jeans in stores caused the plaintiff exclusively clients to cease doing business with it.id.at,fn.omitted.the court held that such an indirect relationship can not form the basis of a tortious interference claim.u nder new york law,the defendant must interfere with the business relationship directly that is,the defendant must direct some activities towards the third party and convince the third party not to enter into a business relationship with the plaintiff.here,the plaintiff claim fails because the defendants alleged conduct concededly was not directed towards any third party with whom the plaintiff had an existing or prospective business relationship.id.at,fn.omitted.
in summary,regarding the fundamental policy question of proximate cause,we should adopt the approach of the courts applying federal and new york law and hold that parties who allege only remote,indirect,and derivative injury may not recover for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.applying this principle here,ksc claim fails because lockheed alleged acts were not directed towards macdonald or any other third party with which ksc had a prospective economic advantage they were directed solely towards the republic of korea.
the majority explanation for disregarding these decisions is demonstrably incorrect.the majority asserts that because the federal antitrust decisions analy ze the statutory language of the clayton act,as well as its relevant legislative history and objectives,they are inapplicable in determining standing to bring a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,which is governed by the common law,ante,d at,fn,at,fn.however,the high court decisions in both blue shield and associated general conclusively refute the majority assertion.in blue shield,the court explained that neither the statutory language nor the legislative history of the clayton act offers any focused guidance on the question of which injuries are too remote to support recovery.blue shield,supra,at.i ndeed,the court observed,the clayton act unrestrictive language and the avowed breadth of the congressional purpose,cautions sic us not to cabin the clayton act in ways that will defeat its broad remedial objective.ibid.finding no direct guidance from congress for determining whether a particular injury is too remote to warrant standing under the clayton act,the court turned to the analysis employed traditionally by courts at common law with respect to the matter of proximate cause.citations,italics added,fn.omitted.similarly,in associated general,the high court explained that despite the breadth of the clayton act statutory language and its legislative history,rules and constraints govern remoteness questions in antitrust damages litigation.associated general,supra,at.thus,in addressing remoteness issues under the clayton act,the high court has expressly looked to the common law,not,as the majority asserts,to the clayton act statutory language or legislative history.the majority rationale for disregarding the federal cases is,therefore,erroneous.we should follow the federal antitrust cases precisely because they apply common law remoteness principles 
iii.the majority substantial certainty standard is incorrect under prior california decisions.
the majority holds that to state a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,a plaintiff need not plead that the defendant acted with the specific intent,or purpose,of disrupting the plaintiff prospective economic advantage,ante,d at,at.instead,the majority states,to satisfy the intent requirement for this tort,it is sufficient to plead that the defendant knew that the interference was certain or substantially certain to occur as a result of its action.ibid.
the majority conclusion is incorrect under existing california law.in seaman direct buying service,standard oil cal d,seaman,we expressly considered whether intent is an element of a cause of action for intentional interference with contractual relations.we answered this question affirmatively,holding i n an action for inducing breach of contract it is essential that plaintiff plead and prove that the defendant intended to induce a breach thereof citations.similarly,to prevail on a cause of action for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,plaintiff must plead and prove intentional acts on the part of the defendant designed to disrupt the relationship.citations.id.at.thus,we rejected the plaintiff argument that the defendant intent to interfere with the contract is not a necessary prerequisite to liability.id.at,fn.omitted.notably,in defining the intent requirement,we also expressly rejected the plaintiff argument that to establish intent,it is necessarily sufficient to show that the defendant knew that interference with the contract was substantially certain to result from its conduct.id.at.we explained intent,of course,may be established by inference as well as by direct proof.thus,the trial court could properly have instructed the jury that it might infer culpable intent from conduct substantially certain to interfere with the contract.here,though,the jury was instructed that culpable intent was deemed to exist if the defendant knew that its conduct would interfere with the contract.under the principles outlined above,this instruction was clearly error.id.at.thus,seaman rejects the very standard the majority here adopts.our courts of appeal have followed seaman in this regard,kasparian county of los angeles th,d savage pacific gas electric th,d.
in reaching its conclusion,the majority virtually ignores our holding in seaman and relies instead on dictum in quelimane stewart title guaranty cal th,d,quelimane,ante,d at,at.in quelimane,the only issue the defendant raised in challenging the adequacy of the plaintiff claim for intentional interference with contract was the plaintiff failure to allege that the defendant conduct was wrong.quelimane,supra,cal th at,d.we disagreed,holding that w rongfulness independent of the inducement to breach the contract is not an element of the tort of intentional interference with existing contractual relations ibid.in dictum,we went on to state moreover,the tort of intentional interference with performance of a contract does not require that the actor primary purpose be disruption of the contract.as explained in comment j to section of the restatement second the rule stated in this section is applicable if the actor acts for the primary purpose of interfering with the performance of the contract,and also if he desires to interfere,even though he acts for some other purpose in addition.the rule is broader,however,in its application than to cases in which the defendant has acted with this purpose or desire.it applies also to intentional interference,as that term is defined in,in which the actor does not act for the purpose of interfering with the contract or desire it but knows that the interference is certain or substantially certain to occur as a result of his action.the rule applies,in other words,to an interference that is incidental to the actor independent purpose and desire but known to him to be a necessary consequence of his action.the fact that this interference with the other contract was not desired and was purely incidental in character is,however,a factor to be considered in determining whether the interference is improper.quelimane,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.
for several reasons,quelimane is insufficient authority to support the majority holding.first,as already noted,quelimane discussion of the intent requirement is dictum because the defendant did not raise this issue.it is dictum for another reason as well the complaint in quelimane allege d that defendants ha d deliberately,willfully,and intentionally interfered with the plaintiff contractual relations quelimane,supra,cal th at,d.thus,we had no need in quelimane to consider whether an allegation of substantial certainty is enough to state a claim second,quelimane dictum addressed the intent requirement for interference with contract,not intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.quelimane at,d.as quelimane also explained,because existing contracts receive greater solicitude than merely prospective economic advantages,the elements of interference with contract and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage are not identical.id.at,d.we made the same point earlier in della penna,explaining that e conomic relationships short of contractual,prospective economic relationships should stand on a different legal footing as far as the potential for tort liability is reckoned.della penna,supra,cal th at,d.logically,because prospective economic advantages receive less protection than existing contracts,the intent requirement for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage should be heightened.third,quelimane did not involve a plaintiff,like ksc,whose alleged injuries were only an indirect and remote consequence of the defendant conduct the complaint in quelimane alleged that the defendants directly interfered with the plaintiffs existing land sales contracts by refusing to issue title insurance.quelimane,supra,cal th at,d.because remoteness was not a factor in quelimane,its dictum regarding the intent required to recover for direct injuries carries even less weight in the case now before us.finally,quelimane did not consider or even cite seaman,which directly considered the intent question and held that proof of substantial certainty permits an inference of intent,but that substantial certainty is not a substitute for or an alternative articulation of intent to interfere.
the majority gives only slightly more consideration to seaman than did quelimane its discussion is as incorrect as it is brief.relegating seaman to a mere footnote,the majority states that in della penna,we expressly disapproved of seaman to the extent that it was inconsistent with della penna,ante,d at,fn,at,fn.the majority statement,though accurate see della penna,supra,cal th at,fn,d,is completely irrelevant because with regard to the intent requirement,seaman is not in any way inconsistent with della penna.della penna never discussed the intent requirement and,as the majority concedes,did not affect the elements of the tort other than to add the wrongfulness requirement,ante,d at,at.consistent with its concession,the majority cites nothing in della penna to support its the majority suggestion that seaman is somehow inconsistent with della penna with regard to the intent requirement.the majority also stresses della penna observation that seaman rel ied on the first restatement of torts without reviewing or even mentioning intervening revaluations of the tort by the restatement second,other state high courts and our own court of appeal.citation,ante,d at,fn,at,fn.however,in seaman,we based our holding regarding the intent requirement on prior decisions of both this court and our courts of appeal,and mentioned the first restatement of torts only briefly.seaman,supra,cal d at.notably,the majority fails to cite a single decision from our courts of from the courts of other seaman should have,but failed to,consider.nor did quelimane cite a case from either california or from some other jurisdiction to support its dictum regarding the intent requirement as i have already explained and as the majority acknowledges,ante,d at,fn,at,fn,quelimane completely ignored seaman and the cases following it and relied instead exclusively on the restatement second.unlike the majority,i consider a prior holding of this court to be more a better representation of california law,ante,d at,fn,at,fn.than the restatement second,or dictum that relied exclusively on the restatement second.
the other basis for the majority specific intent to interfere is unnecessary in light of della penna wrongful act requirement for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,ante,d at,at is both questionable and ironic.it is questionable because,as i have explained and as the majority acknowledges,ante,d at,at,della penna never discussed the intent requirement or considered whether the wrongful act requirement would affect the intent requirement.the majority analysis is ironic because,as i have also already explained,our purpose in della penna in adopting the wrongful act requirement was to restrict the scope of the tort of intention
