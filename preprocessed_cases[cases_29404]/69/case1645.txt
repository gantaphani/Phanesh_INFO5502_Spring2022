appellants collectively the coal producers appeal from the decision of the united states court of federal claims dismissing for lack of subject matter jurisdiction their complaints seeking damages in the amount of reclamation fees imposed and paid pursuant to the surface mining control and reclamations act of smcra.consolidation coal united states.because we conclude that the court of federal claims possesses jurisdiction to hear the coal producers complaints under the tucker act,we reverse and remand.we do not decide the issue of whether the takings clause provides an independent cause of action.
background 
in,congress enacted the smcra.to promote the reclamation of mined lands,congress established within the smrca the abandoned mine reclamation fund,a trust fund used for restoring various natural resources that had been damaged due to mining.id.a.specifically,the smcra provides 
all operators of coal mining operations subject to the provisions of the smcra shall pay to the secretary of the interior,for deposit in the fund,a reclamation fee of cents per ton of coal produced by surface coal mining and cents per ton of coal produced by underground mining or per centum of the value of the coal at the mine,as determined by the secretary,whichever is less,except that the reclamation fee for lignite coal shall be a rate of per centum of the value of the coal at the mine,or cents per ton,whichever is less.
id.a.the department of the interior subsequently promulgated a reclamation fee regulation,which imposes a fee on each ton of coal produced for sale,transfer,or use.a.pursuant to this regulation,the reclamation fee shall be determined by the weight and value of the coal at the time of initial bona fide sale,transfer or ownership,or use by the operator.id.b.
the coal producers are united states producers,sellers,and exporters of coal.pursuant to the statutory and regulatory provisions cited above,they have made quarterly payments of reclamation fees on coal extracted from mines in the united states and then sold for export.in april,they filed complaints in the court of federal claims based on the constitution and takings clauses seeking a refund of paid reclamation fees.specifically,they alleged that the reclamation fee imposed under,with respect to coal sold for export,is a tax or duty prohibited by the export clause.they claimed,therefore,that as applied to export sales of the coal,the reclamation fee violates the export and takings clauses of the constitution.
the government moved to dismiss the coal producers complaints arguing that the court of federal claims lacks jurisdiction to entertain their challenge to the reclamation fee regulation.specifically,the government argued that under a such challenges are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the united states district court for the district of columbia district court and must be brought within sixty days of the challenged action 
in granting the government motion to dismiss,the court of federal claims determined that the coal producers were challenging the substance of the regulation at issue,rather than its application.relying on amerikohl mining,united states,the court further concluded that pursuant to a,the district court had exclusive jurisdiction to review such a challenge.
the coal producers appeal and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
whether a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction has been properly granted is a question of law subject to complete and independent review on appeal.gould,united states.such review is sometimes referred to as de novo or plenary review.medline,united states.
on appeal,the coal producers raise two arguments.first,relying primarily on cyprus amax coal united states,they argue that,irrespective of a,they may invoke tucker act jurisdiction in the court of federal claims because the export clause provides them with an independent,cause of action for monetary damages.according to the coal producers,neither congress nor relevant precedent precludes tucker act jurisdiction in cases such as theirs and,even if congress had attempted to preclude jurisdiction,there would be a question as to the constitutionality of such action.alternatively,the coal producers contend that we must reverse the trial court decision because they are not challenging the validity of any regulation,but are rather challenging the application of the reclamation fee regulation to export sales of coal 
the government responds with essentially three arguments.first,it makes a procedural argument that the coal producers can not now argue that their constitutional challenge provides an independent cause of action under the tucker act because it was not raised below.next,relying primarily on amerikohl,and united states united states shoe,d,the government argues that a vests exclusive jurisdiction over the coal producers challenge to the reclamation fee regulation in the district court.finally,the government insists that the coal producers are challenging the substance of the reclamation fee regulation,not its application.
we turn first to the government procedural argument.it is indeed the general rule that issues must be raised in lower courts in order to be preserved as potential grounds of decision in higher courts.but this principle does not demand the incantation of particular words rather,it requires that the lower court be fairly put on notice as to the substance of the issue.nelson adams usa,d.it is correct that the coal producers appear not to have directly advanced the argument below.they did,however,clearly put the government and the trial court on notice of the constitutional issues involved specifically,that a should not be applicable to their case because it would have the effect of precluding constitutional review based on the export clause.see consolidation coal.at.therefore,that they did not utilize the independent self executing terminology employed here and cite cyprus,for a purpose other than the one asserted in the trial court is not dispositive.in addition,as the coal producers correctly note,under federal rules any court at any stage in the proceedings may address jurisdictional issues.thus,even if the issue is not properly raised,this court sua sponte may consider all bases for the trial court jurisdiction.see broughton lumber yeutter.accordingly,we conclude that based on the circumstances of this case,the coal producers jurisdictional argument with respect to their independent,constitutional claim can and should be considered.
we next turn to the issue at the crux of this appeal,namely whether the court of federal claims possesses tucker act jurisdiction over the coal producers constitutional challenge to the reclamation fee regulation,irrespective of a.the tucker act,which constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity by the united states,provides as follows 
the united states court of federal claims shall have jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the united states founded either upon the constitution,or any act of congress or any regulation of an executive department,or upon any express or implied contract with the united states 
a.to invoke jurisdiction under the tucker act,a party must base its cause of action on a complementary substantive right found in another source of federal law,such as the constitution,federal statutes,or executive regulations.cyprus,at.moreover,that substantive right must be fairly interpreted as mandating compensation by the federal government for the damages sustained.id.
in cyprus,the plaintiffs filed an action in the court of federal claims alleging that the coal sales tax violates the constitution export and takings clauses and seeking a refund of paid taxes.id.at.the issue was whether the court of federal claims possessed jurisdiction over the plaintiffs complaints despite the plaintiffs failure to comply with the jurisdictional prerequisites of the tax refund statute id.at.we held that the constitution export clause is one of those substantive rights that allows for tucker act jurisdiction because its restriction on taxing power requires congress to refund money obtained in contravention of the clau
