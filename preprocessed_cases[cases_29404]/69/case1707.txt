in this appeal,a personal injury plaintiff contends the trial court erred in denying her request for expert witness fees and prejudgment interest under civil code section.the plaintiff argues she was entitled to such fees and interest,which totaled over,because the defendants fail ed to obtain a more favorable judgment code civ,than the million offer to compromise she made under section.
the plaintiff contends the proper comparison is between her offer and an intermediate judgment based on a jury verdict that included an award for past medical expenses in the full amount billed to her,rather than the smaller amount actually paid by her insurer under the rates the insurer negotiated with the medical providers.this negotiated rate differential,the difference between the amounts billed and the amounts paid totaled.when it was subtracted from the verdict,the plaintiff recovered less than million in damages.
for purposes of determining whether a defendant failed to obtain a more favorable judgment under section,we conclude that any negotiated rate differential included in a jury verdict should be subtracted from the judgment or award before it is compared to the offer to compromise for the simple reason that the injured plaintiff did not suffer any economic loss in that amount.howell hamilton meats provisions,cal th,howell.in other words,defendants did not obtain a judgment that included the negotiated rate differential.
in this case,the trial court correctly reduced the jury verdict by the negotiated rate differential before making the section comparison and concluding the judgment obtained by the defendants was more favorable than the offer to compromise for million.
we therefore affirm the judgment.
facts and proceedings 
on april,plaintiff lena lee was injured when her gmc yukon collided with a large manure spreader that defendant joseph silveira had pulled onto ellenwood road in front of her.lee suffered fractures of her hips,leg,elbow and wrist and damage to associated nerves,ligaments and tendons.attempts to settle lee claim before the lawsuit was filed were unsuccessful.
before this personal injury lawsuit was filed,the california supreme court granted review of the decision in howell hamilton meats provisions,on march.the supreme court stated it would consider the following issues 
is the negotiated rate differential the difference between the full billed rate for medical care and the actual amount paid as negotiated between a medical provider and an insurer a collateral source benefit under the collateral source rule,which allows plaintiff to collect that amount as economic damages,or is the plaintiff limited in economic damages to the amount the medical provider accepts as payment did the trial court err in this case when it permitted plaintiff to present the full billed amount of medical charges to the jury but then reduced the jury award of damages by the negotiated rate differential see.
in april,lee sued joseph silveira and silveira custom farming collectively,defendants.
on august,lee attorney served defendants with a section offer to compromise in the amount of million defendants did not accept the offer which,by its terms,lapsed after days.
on august,the california supreme court filed its opinion in howell,supra,cal th and held that the negotiated rate differential could not be recovered by a plaintiff as past medical expenses for the simple reason that the injured plaintiff did not suffer any economic loss in that amount.id.at.the court also stated the collateral source rule does not expand the scope of economic damages to include expenses the plaintiff never incurred.id.at.
about a year after the howell decision,a jury trial began in this case.defendants filed a motion in limine requesting the trial court permit only the introduction into evidence of paid medical bills.the court denied the motion,concluding that the amount of billed medical expenses was relevant to the question of reasonable past medical expenses,future medical expenses and pain and suffering the court indicated that the verdict would be reduced to reflect the amount of paid medical expenses.counsel then stipulated that the amount of billed medicals was and the amount of paid medicals for lee was.
in september,the jury completed a special verdict form awarding lee damages totaling.the jury explicitly found the past economic loss for lee medical expenses totaled.this was the amount the parties stipulated was billed to her.
on october,the trial court filed a document labeled judgment on jury verdict.it stated that lee is entitled to judgment against joseph silveira in the amount of and her daughter was entitled to.it also stated the judgment is subject to amendment following post trial hearing concerning plaintiffs motion for interest and costs and the stipulated reduction for plaintiffs past medical expenses.
defendants immediately filed a posttrial motion for reduction of jury verdict that requested the award for past medical expenses be reduced from the amount charged,to the amount actually paid by lee insurer.lee agreed the deduction for the negotiated rate differential of eventually should be made,but opposed defendants motion on the ground her expert fees and prejudgment interest under civil code section should be determined before the negotiated rate differential was deducted.
the trial court agreed with lee position.the court ruling from the bench was confirmed in a december order stating defendants were entitled to a reduction of the judgment,but the reduction would be made after determining lee entitlement to prejudgment interest and expert witness fees under section.

discussion 
standard of review 
the question presented in this appeal involves application of section,subdivision d and whether defendants failed to obtain a more favorable judgment than lee offer to compromise for million.
issues of statutory construction as well as the application of that construction to an undisputed set of facts are questions of law subject to independent review on appeal.scheenstra california dairies,th.therefore,we will conduct an independent review of the issue presented.
ii.judgments and comparisons 
contentions of the parties 
lee contends that section contemplates a comparison of the section offer with the circumstances as they existed when defendants had the opportunity to accept the offer.boldface omitted.lee also contends that,during the relevant time frame,case law held that a plaintiff damages included the negotiated rate differential.lee supports her position with the following quote considering the amount of the verdict reduced only by offsets to which it was subject at the time the section offer was outstanding is consistent not only with the purpose but is implicit in the language of section.guerrero rodan termite control,th,guerrero.
defendants raise the following arguments.first,they contend that guerrero is distinguishable from cases involving negotiated rate differentials and therefore the rationale used in guerrero does not apply in this case.second,they contend the test referring to the status of the litigation at the time of the offer is used to assess the validity or reasonableness of the offer,not to determine whether the judgment was more favorable.third,defendants disagree with lee about the status of the law at the time of the offer.in their view,howell was retroactive and thus should be regarded as the applicable law at the time the offer was made.see corenbaum lampkin th,howell applied retroactively.
lee reply brief asserts that the retroactivity of howell is irrelevant to the analysis and the parties success and failure in this litigation should be evaluated without regard to postoffer deductions from the judgment.
background section and guerrero 
section is a statute that uses economic incentives to encourage pretrial settlements and avoid needless litigation.barba perez th.one economic incentive involves expert witness fees,which ordinarily are not recoverable costs.a party who declines an offer to compromise under section and fails to obtain a more favorable judgment may be compelled to pay the offeror expert witness fees incurred during trial,subds.c d.also,personal injury defendants who refuse to settle before trial for less than the plaintiff recovers at trial must pay interest on the judgment at percent annually from the date of the settlement offer,see cadlo metalclad insulation th.
a major dispute in this case concerns whether the principles used in guerrero should be extended to reductions based on negotiated rate differentials.
in guerrero,the plaintiff who purchased a house with dryrot sued the home seller,the real estate agent,and the home inspection firm.guerrero,supra,th at.ten months after the suit was filed,the inspection firm served the plaintiff with a section offer to compromise for.guerrero,supra,at.the plaintiff did not accept the offer.ibid.over two years later,shortly before the start of trial,the plaintiff entered a judicially approved good faith settlement with the real estate agent for.id.at.the case went to trial against the inspection firm and the jury awarded to the plaintiff.ibid.the inspection firm then filed a motion under section to offset the settlement amount against the verdict.guerrero,supra,at.the trial court granted the motion and reduced the judgment to zero.ibid.the inspection firm moved to tax the costs the plaintiff incurred after its offer to compromise was served.ibid.the trial court denied the inspection firm motion to tax costs.ibid.the appellate court affirmed the denial.id.at.
in guerrero,the issue presented on appeal was whether,for the purpose of allocating costs under section,a plaintiff whose judgment is reduced to zero by operation of section can be deemed to have obtain ed a more favorable judgment or award than a rejected section offer to pay.guerrero,supra,th at.the appellate court determined the plaintiff had obtained a more favorable judgment,stating 
i n determining whether plaintiff obtained a more favorable judgment or award than a section offer,the objective of encouraging settlement requires consideration of the status of the litigation when the section offer was submitted.in the present case,when the inspection firm submitted its offer early in the litigation,plaintiff had recovered nothing by way of settlement or otherwise and had a valid claim against the inspection firm that the jury later determined to be worth substantially more than the than the inspection firm offered.plaintiff thus did not reject an offer that the outcome of trial indicates should have been accepted.even if the inspection firm offer was not so low as to have been in bad faith,there is still no reason why the inspection firm should be rewarded for having submitted the offer,nor is there any reason to penalize plaintiff for having rejected it.the costs that plaintiff incurred subsequent to rejecting the offer were incurred in pursuit of a claim with a value of at least.regardless of the offset based on subsequent developments in the litigation,plaintiff was justified in rejecting the offer when he rejected it.
the situation would have been very different if the inspection firm had submitted a section offer for after plaintiff had accepted in settlement from help u sell.in that event,plaintiff would have been required to evaluate the likelihood of recovering at least from the inspection firm.had he rejected such an offer at that time,it would be entirely consistent with the objectives of section to shift the burden of subsequently incurred costs to him.however,because there had been no such settlement when the inspection firm made its offer,plaintiff had occasion to evaluate only the prospects of recovering more than.since plaintiff did in fact recover more than that amount and obtained a verdict against the inspection firm for more than that amount,there is no reason to give the inspection firm a windfall benefit because other defendants later decided to settle for an amount that offset plaintiff verdict against it.
considering the amount of the verdict reduced only by offsets to which it was subject at the time the section offer was outstanding is consistent not only with the purpose but is implicit in the language of section.guerrero,supra,th at.
based on this analysis,the appellate court concluded the trial court correctly determined the plaintiff had obtained a judgment or award more favorable than what he would have received,at the time the section offer was in effect,if he had accepted the offer.guerrero,supra,th at.as a result,the court affirmed the decision that the inspection firm was not entitled to shift the cost burden to plaintiff pursuant to section.guerrero,supra,at.
state of the law 
first,we consider the disagreement between the parties regarding the state of the law regarding the recovery of negotiated rate differentials at the time lee made her section
