on march,jeremy kunz spent the afternoon and evening in a bar watching march madness and consuming a few guinnesses.as the night wore on,he asked a fellow he knew from the bar,erik,if he could borrow erik suv for a short time.erik handed over the keys to his vehicle,and kunz left on his errand.the events relating to the rest of the evening gave rise to a car chase,a brutal interrogation,and a lawsuit against the city of chicago and certain police officers.kunz prevailed in that litigation,winning jury verdicts against officer defelice for in compensatory damages and later reduced to in punitive damages,as well as a verdict against the city for another in compensatory damages.defelice appeals from those judgments,and kunz from the district court grant of summary judgment in the defendants favor on several other counts.
in the end,we find that the evidentiary arguments on which defelice relies fail to show any abuse of discretion by the district court,much less the prejudice that would be necessary to upset the jury verdict.with respect to the,we conclude that kunz additional theories were properly dismissed.we therefore affirm the district court judgment in its entirety.
after kunz left on his turned out to be the delivery of some grazed a parked car and kept driving.his actions prompted a call from a witness officer defelice and his partner responded.despite the flashing lights on the police car,kunz kept driving,with the police in pursuit.defelice discovered,after running the suv plates,that it had been reported stolen.when kunz finally stopped the car,he got out and tried to flee on foot.throughout this time,he was trying to toss the packets of drugs away from himself.the chase ended after kunz tried scaling a fence.cornered at the top,he was ordered back to the ground and cuffed.
as he was being handcuffed,multiple police officers kicked kunz,eventually causing a sharp pain later diagnosed as a broken rib.the police then dragged the injured and restrained kunz to their squad car and took him back to the station,where they placed him in a room on a stool,still cuffed and facing defelice.defelice repeatedly punched kunz in the face hard enough to make him pass out several times.finally,kunz falsely confessed that he knew that the car he was driving was stolen.another officer,who had watched the entire exchange,typed out the confession.kunz was then photographed and taken to the.he complained of injuries but was not taken until the next afternoon to a hospital,where he was given a painkiller.a visit to an emergency room the day after that resulted in a prescription for motrin.
as a result of this incident,kunz was charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle,aggravated flight,and leaving the scene of an accident.four days after his arrest,he was returned to custody for violating a bail bond on an older retail theft charge he chose to exonerate his bond and remain in custody so that the money could be returned to his mother.while he was in jail awaiting trial on the stolen vehicle charge,he and a age were charged with possession of a controlled substance based on an unrelated incident.
distressed by the aftermath of kunz arrest,kunz mother filed a complaint on his behalf with chicago office of professional standards ops on april,and ops began to look into the matter.even though ops inquiries ordinarily take days to complete,this one dragged on.kunz requested the file in october in order to defend against the stolen motor vehicle charge and was told in november that the investigation was still active.ops never did turn over the whole file,despite numerous requests and subpoenas.
on june,as the state court patience with the slow discovery was wearing thin,the state attorney elected to forgo the charge of possession of a stolen motor vehicle in favor of the charge for possession of a controlled substance.the reason given for the change in strategy was the need to expedite trial for the younger,but at the hearing the prosecutor mentioned that the ops investigation was reaching a dead end kunz was convicted on the controlled substances charge and was sentenced on november.at the sentencing,kunz past convictions were introduced as aggravating factors,as was the possession of a stolen motor vehicle charge describing the facts from the police report plus kunz confession.kunz was sentenced to time served,and the state dismissed the stolen motor vehicle charge nolle prosequi.
kunz was freed on november.some time later,he filed a lawsuit under for,among other things,excessive use of force and failure to give medical treatment,as well as a claim for malicious prosecution under illinois law.during the pretrial stage of the proceeding,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendant michael goldston and it dismissed kunz malicious prosecution claim.on august,just before trial was to begin,kunz dismissed without prejudice all remaining defendants except the city and defelice.it is now much too late to revive those claims,and so these dismissals are now,as a practical matter,with prejudice.at that time,kunz also mentioned that he was seeking damages to compensate for the time he spent in detention.with respect to the latter point,the court ruled that kunz could not introduce this evidence unless and until the jury ruled in his favor on liability.
after a trial,the jury returned a verdict on august finding that one or more city police officers and defelice used excessive force against kunz and that city officers failed to provide him with medical attention.as we have already mentioned,it found that defelice was liable for in compensatory damages and in punitive damages,and the city was liable for since it had stipulated that it would pay any damages on behalf of the unnamed defendants in the suit.at that point,the record becomes murky.it is apparent,however,that kunz never asked the district court to permit him to introduce evidence on the additional damages claim he had raised just before trial.instead,on august,he moved for entry of judgment against defelice and the city.on august,the court responded with a minute order saying only motion by plaintiff jeremy kunz for entry of judgment is granted.no notice the docket indicates that this order was entered on august.eventually,on september,the court entered a formal judgment in a civil case interestingly,that judgment says that it is entered in favor of plaintiff jeremy kunz and against defendant city of chicago and richard defelice sic in the amount of for compensatory damages and in punitive damages against defendant richard defelice.it is unclear why the court added together the two compensatory damages verdicts,but as this has no effect on the appeal,we do not comment further on it.as we explain below,even this order left parts of the case hanging,but all claims of all parties were eventually wrapped up before the notices of appeal were filed.
in the meantime,on september,defelice moved under fed.civ.to reduce the punitive damages award.this motion was filed just three business days after the court minute order granting kunz motion for entry of judgment was entered,even though it came before the rule judgment.before the court ruled on defelice motion,kunz filed a motion on november,seeking to revive his claim for damages arising from his detention he argued in the motion that the fourth amendment supported such damages,and he added an argument based on the fifth amendment in his reply brief.the district court rejected kunz motion in an order of june.it ruled on defelice remittitur request on august,and reduced the punitive damages award to.it did not,however,enter a new rule judgment.both defelice and kunz filed their notices of appeal and on october.
we begin with officer defelice appeal.before turning to the merits,we must decide whether his notice of appeal was filed by the required date.in general,parties other than the united states have days from the date when the judgment or order is entered to file an appeal.fed.a a.a motion under.to alter or amend a judgment has the effect of postponing this deadline until the entry of an order disposing of that motion.fed.a a iv.in this case,the court disposed of defelice rule motion on august,and defelice did not file his notice of appeal until october,substantially beyond the period allowed.we must therefore see whether any rule effectively extended the time for his appeal.
the answer depends on whether the district court order granting his rule motion in part is one that is subject to the separate document requirement of rule a.that rule says e very judgment and amended judgment must be set out in a separate document,but a separate document is not required for an order disposing of a motion to alter or amend the judgment,under rule if the requirement applies,then both rule c and fed.a a ii provide that the time of entry is considered to be the earlier of the date when the judgment is set out in the separate document or days from the entry of the order or judgment in the civil docket.if the rule does not apply,then the time of entry is simply whenever the judgment is entered in the civil docket.for defelice,if the time is measured from the latter date,then his notice of appeal is too late.if,however,the rule applies,he is entitled to take advantage of the period provided by rule c b and fed.app.a a ii second bullet point.
the language of rule and its appellate counterpart does not contain any exceptions or qualifications for orders disposing of motions under rule.logically,therefore,one might think that the rule exempts from the requirement all such motions,not just a subset of them.that is not,however,the way that this court read the rule in employers insurance of wausau titan international,cir.we were concerned that the great majority of amended judgments would come about as a result of motions made under the various rules identified in rule a.appellate rule a b ii reinforces that assumption,insofar as it seems to contemplate an amended final judgment from which an appeal may be taken,after the district court rules on any of the motions listed in rule a a.
if orders disposing of this set of motions,including motions under rule,were not subject to the rule,there is a risk that we would effectively have read the requirement out of the rule for almost all amended judgments.moreover,rule a had good reason to require a separate document for at least some amended judgments the document clarifies what the ultimate result is,benefiting both the parties for purposes of enforcement and clarity of legal obligation and the judicial system for providing a clear time period for taking an appeal.in order to reach that desirable outcome,however,some stretching was necessary,as we explained 
the only way to reconcile the requirement that an amended judgment be set forth in a separate document with the exception to that requirement for an order disposing of a rule e motion is by reading disposing of a motion as denying a motion.the reading is supported,though muddily,by the committee note to the amendment to rule.the note states that if disposition of the rule e motion results in an amended judgment the amended judgment must be set forth on a separate document.granting a motion is one way of disposing of it,but when a motion to amend a judgment is granted,the result is an amended judgment,so the rule becomes incoherent if disposing is read literally,for then the order granting the motion both is,and is not,an order required to be set forth in a separate document.nonsensical,or as here logically impossible,interpretations of statutes,rules,and contracts are unacceptable so we are driven to interpret disposing as denying,not granting or denying.
titan,at citations omitted.as far as we can tell,no court of appeals has disapproved titan result.the result is a sensible one,putting to one side the tension it creates with the language of the rule,and titan is a relatively recent decision from this court.we therefore adhere to its ruling and conclude that the rule did apply to the district court august,order of remittitur.because no such document was ever prepared,the time of entry of that order is deemed to be days after the order was docketed.defelice appeal fell comfortably within that period,and we thus have appellate jurisdiction.
defelice challenges both the jury finding of liability and the amount of the punitive damages award,even as reduced.his primary complaint about the liability ruling relies on several evidentiary rulings that the district court made during the course of the trial.in order to review this kind of complaint,it is essential that counsel draw to this court attention the rulings and explanations the district court gave for its actions.that is why fed.a b c require the appellant to file an appendix containing the relevant portions of the pleadings,charge,findings,or opinion and the judgment,order,or decision in question.see also cir.a.unfortunately,none of the rulings that defelice challenges was attached to his brief.although kunz supplied several of the missing rulings albeit not always with correct citations,at least one of them was not.worse,there are places where the citations have not supported the points for which they were furnished.this violates fed.a b c and cir.a it also means that the certification required by cir.d was incorrect.as we pointed out in united states patridge,cir,t his court regularly fines lawyers who violate circuit rule yet falsely certify compliance under circuit rule d,united states white,cir united states evans,cir in re galvan,cir.at.we return to this topic at the end of the opinion.for now,we observe only that the appellate record included enough to permit us to carry forward with our review of the case.
exclusion of evidence of conviction 
the first ruling defelice asks us to examine is the district court decision to exclude one of kunz convictions from evidence.the state wanted to introduce a conviction for retail theft into evidence,even though it had already succeeded in putting many other convictions before the jury.defelice contends that the retail theft conviction is especially probative because it happened very close to trial and thus supposedly illustrated a consistent pattern of criminality.this is propensity by another name,however defelice calls it full flavor,and propensity is a forbidden basis for admitting evidence.see united states wright,cir see also.b.given the prior convictions for residential burglary already in evidence,the district court was entitled to conclude that the retail theft evidence was cumulative or inadmissible propensity evidence.
defelice also argues that the conviction should have been admitted either as a crime involving falsehood,see.a,or for impeachment.looking first at impeachment,here again the district court enjoys broad discretion.defelice cites green bock laundry machine,d,and campbell greer,cir,for the proposition that evidence of past convictions submitted under.a is not subject to the considerations of prejudice set forth in.he does not mention that rule was amended after green and campbell to incorporate expressly the balancing of probative value against prejudice that rule embodies.the district court was thus fully entitled to take rule into account.whether,in the final analysis,the court reasoning was predicated on cumulativeness or propensity,we find no indication that the court abused its discretion or that its ruling prejudiced defelice.
defelice also argues that the district court should have admitted kunz prior conviction as a crime involving falsehood under rule a,which does not incorporate rule.although defelice is correct that illinois considers theft to be a crime of dishonesty for the purposes of its version of rule a,people spates,he is incorrect to assume that this designation is binding on this is not.see united states cameron,cir.this circuit generally does not count retail theft as a crime of dishonesty.see united states amaechi,cir.if defelice had presented some independent reason to override amaechi and construe kunz conviction as a crime involving dishonesty,we could have evaluated that argument.see united states,cir.he did not,however,and we thus can not conclude that the district court abused its discretion by failing to follow rule a.
what defelice would really like to do is to portray kunz as a witness who is predisposed against police officers and who has a propensity to misbehave.but.generally forbids the use of past acts,even of criminality,to prove a criminal,dishonest character in a civil case.none of the exceptions to that rule applies here.the jury had ample evidence before it that alerted it to kunz prior encounters with the law.whether the court excluded the evidence because it raised an inference of propensity forbidden by rule or because it was cumulative and thus excludable under rule,we see no abuse of that discretion.
exclusion of expert witness 
defelice also argues that the district court erred by excluding his key expert witness,james.under the framework established by fed.evid.and the supreme court decision in daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,this court reviews de novo whether the district court understood the legal requirements of rule,and then reviews decisions to admit or exclude expert testimony for abuse of discretion.general electric joiner,d united states parra,cir.
kunz asserts that defelice failed to preserve this point properly in the district court,but we are satisfied that defelice offer of proof was enough to alert the court to the central questions what was going to testify about,what methods did he use,and on what information did he base his conclusions the first daubert question on the merits is whether the court handled its gatekeeping role properly.the court must decide whether the proffered expert testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data and is the product of reliable principles and methods.fed.evid.here,the district court found testimony unreliable because it was not based on a sound methodology.defelice wanted to testify about kunz ability to recall and narrate events on the night in question,given the fact that kunz had admitted to using a small amount of heroin earlier in the evening.the district court noted that knew neither a baseline against which to judge whether kunz was impaired,nor kunz habituation level which might influence the impairing effects of the drug.indeed,was a singularly unimpressive witness.his credentials were weak,at best his degree is called a he earned it after one year of classes,only one of which was in pharmacology.despite the title,his.is not actually in pharmacology,and admitted elsewhere to advertising falsely that it was.before he became a consulting expert witness,experience was as a nutritionist.in addition,practically admitted on that he had not referred to any scientific literature in formulating his opinion in this case except for one article,proffered by kunz,which contradicted conclusion.
the district court found testimony unhelpful,commenting that v irtually everything said,with respect to this,was anticipated by me.the court then compared to other expert witnesses who give you a long description of why or percent of eyewitnesses make errors but who really have nothing to offer as to why this particular eyewitness in the case did make an error.hoped to shed light on heroin users as a group,but he had nothing useful to say about kunz condition at the critical time.in addition,kunz pointed out that even if testimony were taken at face value,the impairing effects of the heroin should have worn off at least minutes before the car chase occurred.according to a defense expert,there might not have been any effect at any time.that expert opined that habituation levels are crucial in a case like this far from being impaired,a habituated heroin user can use a maintenance dose to avoid impairment and maintain normal function.under the circumstances,the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding testimony.see kumho tire carmichael,d.
restriction on about drug use 
defelice questions the district court ruling barring about drug use.the chief difficulty he faces on appeal is that the district court never made this ruling.as defelice acknowledges in his reply brief,the district court forbade only use of the word heroin,because at the time of the arrest,the officers did not know the nature of the drug or kunz usage and because mention of heroin would be more prejudicial than helpful.defelice apparently intended to kunz about his drug use in order to establish the foundation for testimony about the impairing effects of heroin use.
this court has explained when evidence of a witness drug use may be introduced 
evidence that a witness has used illegal drugs may be probative of the witness possible inability to recollect and relate this evidence may be admitted where the memory or mental capacity of a witness is legitimately at issue at the same time,however,there is considerable danger that evidence that a witness has used illegal drugs may so prejudice the jury that it will excessively discount the witness testimony a court must,therefore,be chary in admitting such evidence when it is offered for the sole purpose of making a general character attack.
united states cameron,cir quotations and citations omitted.the only link between kunz drug use on the night in question and his recollection would have been through testimony.absent that link,additional evidence of kunz drug use other than that to which he had already admitted would only have served to raise the inference that drug users tend to lie.that inference is impermissible.united states robinson,cir the appellants,in sum,insist that witnesses who have previously used narcotics are more likely to tell lies.this is exactly the type of character attack that cameron and jarrett united states,cir forbid.the district court did not abuse its discretion when it established limitations on the evidence about kunz drug use.
exclusion of witnesses as discovery sanction 
defelice takes issue with the district court decision to bar the testimony of five witnesses as a discovery sanction under.the district court took this step because it found that defelice failed to disclose the names properly.as kunz points out,the names were buried within a multitude of other names,such as a police district roll call,with nothing to signal that they had anything useful to add.the district court found that it would place an excessive burden on the plaintiff to require him to sift through every single name turned over in discovery.in fact,defelice is caught in a trap here.if the testimony of these witnesses was relevant and useful,then his failure to disclose was prejudicial,and the district court properly exercised its discretion to exclude the testimony as a rule sanction.on the other hand,the error could only be harmless if the testimony was irrelevant or not would be grounds for excluding it anyway.either way defelice wants to have it,the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the testimony.
punitive damages other defendants 
defelice final two arguments are intertwined he asserts that the district court should not have permitted kunz to dismiss all of the defendants other than defelice on the eve of trial.their absence at trial prejudiced him,he says,primarily because it led the jury to impose the full weight of the punitive damages on him alone.that award,he continues,even at the level,is disproportionate to the compensatory damages.
voluntary dismissal pursuant to fed.civ.a is allowed at the district court discretion.tyco laboratories,koppers,cir.a district court abuses its discretion only if the defendant shows that she will suffer plain legal prejudice.we have identified four factors that throw light on whether this kind of prejudice would arise t he defendant effort and expense of preparation for trial,excessive delay and lack of diligence on the part of the plaintiff in prosecuting the action,insufficient explanation for the need to take a dismissal,and the fact that a motion for summary judgment has been filed by the defendant.pace southern express,cir.
defelice does not come close to showing reversible error here.the assertion that his defense was hampered by creating too many empty chairs at the defense table seems backward far from preventing him from deflecting liability onto others,as he phrases it,it permitted him to point at those empty chairs a
