this is an employment discrimination case in which george williams,who is black,claimed that his employer,conagra poultry company,subjected him to a hostile work environment and terminated his employment based on his race.following a jury trial in the district court,judgment was entered for williams on both claims.conagra maintains on appeal that the district court erred in admitting certain evidence,failing to grant judgment as a matter of law,allowing the jury to consider the matter of punitive damages,and refusing to remit punitive damages that are unconstitutionally high.we affirm the judgment except on the matter of punitive damages.
for many years,williams worked in the el dorado,arkansas,poultry factory of conagra,first as an ordinary employee and later as a supervisor.after he quarreled with one of his supervisors and a,conagra fired him.the company asserted that williams was fired for fighting with the.williams believed that his firing was racially motivated and that he had been subjected to a hostile work environment,and he filed a charge with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.after receiving a letter from the eeoc,he filed this action claiming violations of title vii of the civil rights act of through,and the arkansas civil rights act ann.through.
before williams suit,john johnican had successfully sued conagra for employment discrimination.in williams action,conagra made a motion in limine to exclude all evidence relating to johnican suit.the district court ruled that williams could not introduce any evidence regarding the johnican verdict,but it withheld judgment on the admissibility of testimony relating to the events that formed the basis of johnican suit.at trial,conagra management denied that williams firing was racially motivated and that he suffered from a hostile work environment.williams witnesses testified to the incidents leading up to williams firing,as well as to numerous incidents of racially motivated harassment and disparate treatment of black employees,including incidents that formed a part of the earlier johnican suit.williams also testified about his firing and the harassment that he had personally suffered from.
at the end of williams case and again at the close of evidence,conagra moved for judgment as a matter of law,which the district court denied.the jury then found for williams on both claims,awarding him in compensatory damages and in punitive damages on the termination claim,and awarding him in compensatory damages and in punitive damages on the hostile work environment claim.conagra moved to set the verdicts aside and to remit the damages.the district court refused to set the verdicts aside,but it did remit the compensatory damages for the termination claim to and the punitive damages on the same claim to.on the harassment claim,the court remitted the compensatory damages to but let the exemplary damages award stand.although it is not clear from the record,we assume that these awards were made under,which does not include the caps on damages contained in title vii and the arkansas act.
conagra maintains that the district court erred in admitting certain evidence at trial.employees at the el dorado plant testified to numerous instances of racist remarks by fellow employees and managers.in addition,they testified to more threatening actions,such as nooses left at the work stations of black employees,a black doll hung by a noose in the factory,and invitations extended to black employees to attend ku klux klan kkk hunting parties where they would be the hunted.a black female employee testified that when black female employees responded favorably to sexually suggestive remarks by managers,they were given the longer breaks typically allowed white employees,but when they failed to respond favorably,they were required to take the shorter breaks allowed black employees.finally,one black female employee testified to being physically manhandled by a production supervisor with such force that she required medical treatment.
conagra points out that nothing in williams testimony indicates that he was aware of any of these activities,and the supreme court has stated that an actionable harassment claim requires a showing that the workplace was subjectively hostile,harris forklift,d.because a subjectively hostile environment is one that by definition the plaintiff is aware of,a plaintiff can not recover for harassment of which he or she is unaware.hence,none of this testimony would be relevant to the question of whether williams suffered from an actionable hostile work environment.see.as the seventh circuit has observed,or derogatory behavior of which a plaintiff is unaware,and thus never experiences,is not harassment of the plaintiff severe,pervasive,or other.mason southern,cir carter chrysler,cir.
but it does not follow from the fact that the testimony was irrelevant to whether williams environment was actionable that the court erred in admitting it.in the first place,we think that the testimony made more credible williams testimony about the environment that he was exposed to.in addition,at trial williams maintained and conagra denied that his firing was racially motivated.evidence of widespread toleration of racial harassment and disparate treatment condoned by management was relevant to its motive in firing williams.we believe that evidence of racial bias in other employment situations could permissibly lead to the inference that management was similarly biased in the case of williams firing.furthermore,williams alleged that part of the motivation for firing him was that he had complained about the racially hostile environment at the plant and that management wished to silence him in order to avoid addressing the issue.evidence of the extent of the hostile environment was thus probative on the matter of managerial motives.see estes dick smith ford,cir.furthermore,as we discuss below,the issue of motive was relevant to williams eligibility for punitive damages on his harassment claim,see kolstad american dental ass n,d,even if the conduct of which he was unaware was not relevant to the question of whether he experienced actionable harassment.hence,we conclude that the district court did not err in admitting this testimony.
conagra next argues that williams hostile work environment claim fails as a matter of law.we hold that it does not.on review,we give great deference to a jury findings.we therefore view the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict,assuming that the jury resolved all evidentiary conflicts in favor of the prevailing party,in this case williams.robinson hager,cir.in order to prevail on a harassment claim,a plaintiff must show that he or she is a member of a protected group,that there was unwelcome harassment,that there was a causal nexus between the harassment and membership in the protected group,and that the harassment affected a term,condition,or privilege of employment.see palesch missouri comm on human rights,cir.if the harassment comes from employees,the plaintiff must also show that the employer knew or should have known about the harassment but failed to take proper action.see id.at.
conagra contends that williams did not present evidence of racial harassment that was severe or pervasive enough to affect a term,condition,or privilege of his employment.as we have already noted,actionable harassment must be subjectively offensive.harris,at.accordingly,in considering williams claim we confine ourselves to the harassment that he testified to personally suffering from.in its order denying conagra judgment as a matter of law,the district court discussed at length incidents that williams did not testify to witnessing or suffering from,arguing that because they occurred in the same factory,williams could have been aware of them.because we believe that there must be some evidence,direct or indirect,showing that the plaintiff was subjectively aware of any harassment upon which his or her claim is based,we examine a narrower slice of the record than the district court did in determining whether the harassment that williams suffered from was objectively hostile.
