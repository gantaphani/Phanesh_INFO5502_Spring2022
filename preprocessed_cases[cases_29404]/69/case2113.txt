defendant and appellant william thomas minor,appeals a criminal conviction of infractions of the san bernardino county code,for accumulation of trash,rubbish and junk on his land,having a nonpermitted structure,using a storage unit as a residence,and maintaining a hog farm on the property without a conditional use permit.the criminal court not only found defendant guilty of these violations and entered orders for him to bring the property into compliance,it also,pursuant to san bernardino county code section,ordered him to repay the costs of investigating,analyzing,and prosecuting the criminal action,in the amount of.
defendant appealed to the appellate division of the san bernardino county superior court the appellate division.the appellate division panel concluded that,because there was no authorizing legislation permitting the county to recover the costs of criminal law enforcement in this instance,that portion of the sentence requiring defendant to pay the costs of the investigation and prosecution was unlawful.
we transferred the case to this court,on our own motion,pursuant to california rules of court,rule a and b,to secure uniformity of decision and to settle an important question of law.
after a thorough,independent review of the matter,we have reached the same conclusion as the appellate division.that is,the structure of the present legislative scheme does not authorize adding the costs of enforcement as a penalty in criminal prosecution of code infractions.accordingly,although we sympathize with the difficulties faced by code enforcement agencies,we conclude that the portion of the sentence requiring defendant to pay enforcement costs should be stricken.none of defendant other issues has merit,however,and in all other respects the judgment is affirmed.
facts and procedural history 
defendant lives in a rural area in san bernardino county the county.hugh oram,a code enforcement officer of the san bernardino county land use services department department,received a tip that defendant was operating an illegal hog farm on the property.officer oram inspected the property and found tons of trash,garbage,junk and wood debris,numerous unpainted,and substandard storage structures and animal pens,and more than hogs on the property.defendant apparently was occupying a mobile home and several small travel trailers.nine inoperative vehicles and piles of vehicle parts were present.after several courtesy notices,with no observable improvement,officer oram sent defendant a notice of violation,and set the matter for criminal prosecution.
on august,the court found defendant guilty of three infraction offenses for violation of various provisions of the san bernardino county code the court also ordered defendant to pay restitution to the city of sic land use services in the amount of 
defendant appealed to the appellate division of the superior court.the appellate division found none of the issues raised by defendant,upon his notice of appeal,to be meritorious,but on its own motion questioned the propriety of the part of the sentence requiring defendant to reimburse the county code enforcement costs.the court ultimately held that,in the absence of authorizing legislation,the county was not empowered to enact a criminal punishment consisting of the payment of such enforcement costs.the court ordered that portion of the sentence stricken,and certified its opinion for publication.
on our own motion,we ordered the matter transferred to this court,pursuant to code of civil procedure section as we have similar power to review any matter and make orders and judgments as the appellate division of the superior court would have in the case ibid,we consider the issues on appeal independently of the appellate division opinion.because we consider the entire appeal anew,we address all potentially dispositive matters raised by defendant appeal below.see snukal flightways manufacturing,cal th,d,discretion of the court of appeal to hear a case transferred to it from the appellate division under code of civil procedure section does not include discretion to select and review only an issue or issues not dispositive of the case.we next review the merits.
although we review the matter wholly anew,we find the appellate division opinion persuasive.while we adopt much of its language as our own,we also add material addressing further aspects of the county arguments.first,we take up the appellate division resolution of defendant assignments of error.second,we address the county claim that it may impose recovery of administrative enforcement costs as a criminal penalty in this case.
asserted errors,other than sentencing,are without merit 
ii.the administrative costs of enforcing code violations may not be recovered as a penalty in a criminal enforcement action 
the trial court ordered defendant to pay,as part of the criminal sentence,restitution or administrative costs of to the county.this amount represented hours at an hourly rate of for officer oram time investigating the code violations,attempting to remedy them,and preparing the criminal case for trial.the crux of the matter before us is whether the court could legally require defendant to repay the investigation and other law enforcement costs of the prosecution against him.
general law rule government must bear the costs of law enforcement 
as a general rule,a government entity may not recover the costs of law enforcement absent authorizing legislation under the general law,the expense of capture,detention,and prosecution of persons charged with crime is to be borne by the county.citations omitted.county of san luis obispo abalone alliance d.accord,people ex rel.of transportation outdoor media group th,d,fn.
the county challenges to the validity of the general law rule are without merit 
the county challenges this initial assertion,claiming that the foundations of the stated general law rule are unsound.the county arguments are unavailing.
the abalone alliance court cited department of mental hygiene hawley cal d,which in turn referenced napa state hospital yuba county cal,as the source of the stated rule.
county counsel first asserts in its brief that the majority decision of the first cited case,hawley,made no such statement.the quote to which the abalone alliance decision referred is located in the beginning of the dissent in hawley.this is quite simply false.hawley was unanimous it was authored by justice schauer,and concurred in by chief justice gibson,and justices traynor,mccomb,peters,tobriner,and peek.there was no dissenting opinion whatever in that case.
county counsel makes the further claim that the quoted text is actually from napa state hospital yuba county cal,which appeared in the context of a discussion whether one statute was unconstitutional as being in conflict with the provisions of a constitutional provision in regard to special laws.the quote from yuba county sic hawley only referred to the general law of who would bear the costs in context of whether the statute might charge the estate or relatives of an inmate.in the abolone sic alliance decision,the public entity argued that it had such authority pursuant to the state statutes regarding public nuisance.that is not the statutory authorization upon which the county here relies.hence none of this line of cases included a discussion of considerations of specific empowerments of article,section of the california constitution and local ordinances arising from it.
even so,the county argument articulates no reason why the general law should not be as stated in the source cases.
napa state hospital involved a person charged with crime who was adjudged insane,and therefore unable to stand trial,pursuant to penal code section et.the criminal trial was suspended in the meantime,until the person became well enough to resume trial,he was committed to the state hospital.the hospital director sought to recover,from the county in which the prosecution was to be held,the expenses of housing the person at the state hospital under the court order.penal code section,as existing at that time,provided that the expenses of sending the defendant to the asylum,of keeping him there,and of bringing him back,are in the first instance chargeable to the county in which the indictment was found or information filed,but the county may recover them from the estate of the defendant,if he have any,or from a relative,town,city,or county bound to provide for and maintain him elsewhere.cal.at,yuba county,where the defendant was being tried,argued that the provision of recovery of hospital costs from it,pursuant to penal code section,was improper,as an unconstitutional special statute.the california constitution provides now,as then,that,a all laws of a general nature have uniform operation,and that b a local or special statute is invalid in any case if a general statute can be made applicable.see,now,cal,art.iv.
the court held that penal code section was not a special law singling out the prosecuting county for differential treatment.as the court noted,the class of persons embraced in the chapter and section is one which in the nature of things requires laws applicable alone to such a class.persons charged with crime who are or become insane naturally belong to a class distinct and different from insane persons who are not so charged with crime.napa state hospital yuba county,supra,cal,
nonetheless,there was no improper special law under the general law,the expense of capture,detention,and prosecution of persons charged with crime is to be borne by the county.the party,though insane,is still detained under the law to answer for his crime when he shall become sane.if he were not charged with crime,though he were insane,he might not be sent to the asylum if,however,he is charged with crime,he must be committed to the asylum,if found insane he is thus committed that he may be held in the custody of the law and his commitment is part and parcel of the administraton sic of the criminal law.if he were not insane the defendant would,on a continuance of his case,be sent to jail or released on bail it is perfectly natural and proper,then,that the expense of his detention in the one place should be borne by the county as it is in the other the party is held in custody,not because he is insane,but primarily because he is charged with crime.the section allowing the state hospital to recover the costs from the prosecuting county then invades no constitutional inhibition against special laws,because it places the expense of the keeping in the asylum or hospital just where it should rest under the general law,and implies no classification,except such as must exist and be recognized in the very nature of things.napa state hospital yuba county,supra,cal.
even though,as the county points out,the napa state hospital court pronouncements involved a different context,its reasoning is nonetheless sound,and its result obtains precisely because the general law is as stated.
in hawley,the state sought to recover the costs of hospitalizing an insane criminal defendant,not from the prosecuting county,but directly from the estate or designated relatives of the hospitalized defendant.the defendant father in hawley appealed a judgment in favor of the state,charging him with the cost of his son care,even though the defendant was accused of crime,suffering from insanity,and therefore not capable of standing trial,and thus required to be committed to the state hospital.again,the general law rule,as first articulated in napa state,that counties must bear the costs of applied.the statement of general law was logically correct and compelled the result.we see no reason why the general law should be different simply because it was first articulated and considered in a different context.law enforcement is a quintessentially governmental function,and the government commands the requisite revenue to provide such services through the taxing power.it should come as no surprise,therefore,that the costs of law enforcement,carried out by the counties as an arm of the state,should be borne by the counties.
local ordinances purporting to authorize recovery of law enforcement costs conflict with the general law rule 
the ordinances here purport to authorize recovery of law enforcement costs 
section of the san bernardino county code,pertaining to penalties for code violations,states in pertinent part 
a ny person convicted of violating any provision of this title shall be guilty of an infraction offense and punished by a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars and not less than fifty dollars for a first offense guilty of an infraction offense and punished by a fine not exceeding two hundred dollars and not less than one hundred dollars for a second offense.the third and any additional offense shall constitute misdemeanors and shall be punishable by fines not exceeding one thousand dollars and not less than five hundred dollars or six months in jail,or both payment of any fine or service of a jail sentence herein provided shall not relieve a person from the responsibility of correcting the condition,in addition to the above penalties the court may order that the guilty party reimburse the county for all of its costs of investigating,analyzing and prosecuting the enforcement action against the guilty party the court shall fix the amount of any such reimbursement upon submission of proof of such costs by the county.boldface added by appellate division.
no enabling legislation authorizes the recovery of law enforcement costs 
article xi,section of the california constitution does not provide authorization for the ordinances 
while this ordinance purports to provide the court with the authority to order a defendant to pay the county enforcement costs,the ordinance can not actually vest the court with such power unless it is the type of valid authorizing legislation contemplated by abalone alliance,supra,d.
county counsel asserts that enactment of the ordinance is authorized by art.xi,section of the california c onstitution,which states 
a county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local,police,sanitary,and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.thus,we must evaluate whether any general laws exist on the topic of punishment for penal ordinances and,if so,whether sbcc section conflicts with them.
i.other general laws exist on the subject of penal ordinances,limiting the penalties which may be imposed for violation of local codes 
such g eneral laws do exist.california government code section reads 
a violation of a county ordinance is a misdemeanor unless by ordinance it is made an infraction.such a violation may be prosecuted by county authorities in the name of the people of the state of california,or redressed by civil action.b every violation determined to be an infraction is punishable by a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars for a first violation a fine not exceeding two hundred dollars for a second violation of the same ordinance within one year a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars for each additional violation of the same ordinance within one year.in addition,penalties for misdemeanors are set forth in penal code section,which provides 
except in cases where a different punishment is prescribed by any law of this state,every offense declared to be a misdemeanor is punishable by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding six months,or by fine not exceeding one thousand dollars,or by both.
read together,these statutes do the following first,they create a default classification of misdemeanors for code violations second,they authorize counties to classify the violations as infractions if they choose to do so and,finally,they set the respective punishments for both infraction and misdemeanor code violations.
these general laws would control criminal penalties in the absence of other legislation authorizing a local entity to fix additional penalties.government code section explicitly authorizes cities to set the penalties for violations of penal ordinances,but the county cites no statute conferring such power on counties.
ii.the constitutional grant of legislative power in the area of zoning is expressly subject to general law,and can not therefore provide authorization to contravene general law
