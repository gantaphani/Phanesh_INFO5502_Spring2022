in these appeals,we interpret a long term care insurance policy that plaintiff russell lee gillogly gillogly purchased from a predecessor to defendant insurer general electric capital assurance company geca we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment for gillogly on his claim that geca breached its contract with gillogly when it denied his request for benefits under the policy.we also reverse the district court entry of judgment in favor of gillogly on his claim that geca denied his request for benefits in bad faith.finally,we affirm the district court entry of judgment as a matter of law for geca on gillogly claim for punitive damages.therefore,we remand the case to the district court with instructions to enter judgment for geca on gillogly claims that geca breached its contract with gillogly and acted in bad faith.
background 
in gillogly purchased a long term care insurance nursing home indemnity policy policy from amex life assurance company.as a result of a merger,geca assumed all of amex life assurance company rights and obligations under the policy.
the policy provides a nursing home benefit a fixed daily benefit of per day for an inpatient stay in a nursing home for up to days after a deductible period of days is reached.specifically,the policy states 
we will pay the daily benefit for each day of a nursing home stay after the deductible period,if 
the policy is in force when the nursing home stay starts and 
you are confined in the nursing home as an overnight resident patient and a room and board charge is made for that day and 
your nursing home stay is necessary 
your nursing home stay is necessary as long as a doctor certifies that your admission is required due to injury or sickness and there exists a level of functional incapacity which makes your continued nursing home stay appropriate and reasonable.
this policy makes no distinction,in the duration or amount of benefits you will be paid,for different levels of care whether skilled,intermediate,or custodial as long as your nursing home stay is necessary.
the policy defines a nursing home as 
a facility or distinctly separate part of a hospital or other institution which is licensed by the appropriate licensing agency to engage primarily in providing nursing care and related services to inpatients and 
provides hour a day nursing service under a planned program of policies and procedures which was developed with the advice of,and is periodically reviewed and executed by,a professional group of at least one physician and one nurse and 
has a doctor available in case of emergency and 
has at least one nurse who is employed there full time and 
has a nurse on duty or on call at all times and 
maintains clinical records for all patients and 
has appropriate methods and procedures for handling and administering drugs and biologicals.
note the above requirements are typically met by licensed skilled nursing facilities,comprehensive nursing care facilities and intermediate nursing care facilities as well as some specialized wards,wings and units of hospitals.those requirements are generally not met by rest homes homes for the aged sheltered living accommodations residence homes or similar living arrangements.
the policy does not define the term nursing care and related services used in the first part of the policy definition of nursing home.
in gillogly began residing at the van buren house vbh of the mcalester regional health center mrhc in oklahoma.gillogly thereafter sought benefits from geca under the policy to pay for his stay at vbh.geca declined to award benefits because geca believed that vbh did not qualify as a nursing home under the policy,stating in a letter to gillogly that 
the referenced policy is a basic nursing home indemnity policy.it provides neither alternative care facility nor home health care benefits.its principal focus is to indemnify stays in care facilities that satisfy the policy definition of a nursing home.
the term nursing home is defined in the policy as a facility licensed by the appropriate licensing agency to engage primarily in providing nursing care and related services to inpatients.the policy also requires the facility to provide certain services these are listed in a bulleted format.
t he information submitted from the van buren house reflected they are not licensed by the appropriate licensing agency to engage primarily in providing nursing care.in fact,the care facility holds a license issued by the oklahoma department of health to function as a residential care home.
the state of oklahoma has provided a residential care home license in order to allow the care facility in question to provide personal care services only.
gillogly filed suit against geca in the united states district court for the eastern district of oklahoma,alleging that geca had breached its contract and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in denying his request for benefits under the policy gillogly sought both compensatory and punitive damages.
geca filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing that it had neither breached its contract with gillogly nor acted in bad faith in denying gillogly request for benefits.gillogly filed a motion for partial summary judgment,seeking to establish that geca was liable for breach of contract.the district court denied geca motion and granted gillogly motion,holding that geca was liable for breach of contract.however,because damages for the breach had not been determined,the court did not enter judgment on the claim.
the parties proceeded to a jury trial on gillogly claim that geca had acted in bad faith in denying his request for benefits.at the close of all the evidence,the district court determined as a matter of law that geca had acted in bad faith.the court also granted judgment as a matter of law to geca on gillogly claim for punitive damages.the jury then determined gillogly actual damages on the claim that geca had acted in bad faith to be million.the district court entered judgment on that claim on january.
on march,fourteen days after the district court rejected geca motion for judgment as a matter of law,a new trial,or remittitur of the jury verdict,geca filed a notice of appeal.in that notice,geca asserted that it would contest the district court entry of judgment on gillogly claim that geca had acted in bad faith,as well as the district court denial of geca motion.gillogly filed a notice of appeal on march,appealing the district court order granting geca judgment as a matter of law on his punitive damages claim.
on april,the district court entered judgment on gillogly breach of contract claim,awarding gillogly damages in an amount to which the parties had stipulated geca filed a second notice of appeal on may,this time challenging the district court order granting summary judgment to gillogly on his breach of contract claim.
discussion 
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we exercise jurisdiction over these appeals pursuant to reviewing de novo the district court rulings on the parties motions for summary judgment and a directed verdict.see welding bios,cir strickland tower maintenance,commc ns,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,deposition transcripts,affidavits and evidentiary material show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c welding,at.a party can obtain judgment as a matter of law in its favor only if the proof is all one way or so overwhelmingly preponderant in favor of the movant as to permit no other rational conclusion.conoco oneok,cir quotations omitted.
ii.breach of contract 
legal framework 
under the substantive law of the state of oklahoma,which we apply in this diversity case,see braun.gas,cir 
p arties to an insurance contract are bound by the terms of the contract and courts will not undertake to rewrite the terms thereof.the construction of an insurance policy should be a natural and reasonable one,fairly construed to effectuate its purpose,and viewed in the light of common sense so as not to bring about an absurd result a policy of insurance is a contract and should be construed as every other contract,that is,where not ambiguous,according to its terms.
wiley travelers ins.thus,if a reasonably prudent lay person would find that a term used in a policy is not susceptible to two interpretations on its face,see cranfill aetna life ins,the intent of the parties should be ascertained from the policy alone.see dodson paul ins.
at the time that gillogly first submitted his claim for benefits under the policy,and at all times since then,the oklahoma state department of health department did not license a category of facilities called nursing homes.rather,the department licensed nursing facilities and residential care homes pursuant to a pair of complementary statutes,the nursing home care act.stat.tit,to,and the residential care act.stat.tit,to.
at all times relevant to this appeal,the nursing home care act defined nursing facility as 
a home,an establishment or an institution,a distinct part of which is primarily engaged in providing 
skilled nursing care and related services for residents who require medical or nursing care,
rehabilitation services for the rehabilitation of injured,disabled,or sick persons,or 
on a regular basis,health related care and services to individuals who because of their mental or physical condition require care and services beyond the level of care provided by a residential care home and which can be made available to them only through a nursing facility.
stat.tit.the act stated that n o person shall establish,operate,or maintain in this state any nursing facility without first obtaining a license as required by the nursing home care act.id.a.the act also makes clear that its use of the term facility shall not include a residential care home or an adult companion home.id.
at all times relevant to this appeal,the nursing home care act defined residential care home as 
any home,establishment,or institution licensed pursuant to the provisions of the residential care act which offers or provides residential accommodations,food service,and supportive assistance to any of its residents or houses any resident requiring supportive assistance.the residents shall be persons who are ambulatory and essentially capable of managing their own affairs,but who do not routinely require nursing care.
id.at.the residential care act provides a similar definition for residential care home,though the precise wording of that definition was changed after gillogly requested benefits under the policy in.until,the residential care act defined residential care home as 
any establishment or institution which offers or provides residential accommodations,food service,and supportive assistance to any of its residents or houses any residents requiring supportive assistance said residents shall be ambulatory and essentially capable of managing their own affairs,but do not routinely require skilled nursing care or intermediate care.
historical and statutory notes.stat.tit.in,the oklahoma legislature amended the residential care act to define residential care home as 
any establishment or institution which offers,provides or supports residential accommodations,food service,and supportive assistance to any of its residents or houses any residents requiring supportive assistance the residents shall be ambulatory and essentially capable of participating in their own activities of daily living,but shall not routinely require nursing services 
okla stat.tit.thus,the earlier version of the residential care act provided that the residents of residential care homes shall not routinely require skilled nursing care or intermediate care,instead of stating that the residents of such homes shall not routinely require nursing services.
to implement the residential care act,the oklahoma state department of health issued residential care home regulations.see.admin.code tit,ch.at all times relevant to this appeal,these regulations defined residential care home as 
a ny establishment or institution which offers or provides residential accommodations,food service and supportive assistance to any of its residents or houses any residents requiring supportive assistance said residents shall be ambulatory and essentially capable of managing their own affairs,but do not routinely require skilled nursing care or intermediate care.
admin.code.thus,the language of the residential care home regulations is identical to the language of the earlier version of the residential care act.
application 
the policy definition of the term nursing home is not ambiguous.the policy requires that a nursing home be licensed to engage primarily in providing nursing care and related services to inpatients.the form that such a license will take is left to the appropriate licensing agency in each area where the policy is used.the policy is unambiguous as a matter of law,see wynn avemco ins,because the policy definition of the term nursing home simply is not susceptible to two interpretations on its face.see cranfill,at.thus we must interpret the intent of the parties in contracting for insurance from the policy alone,without examining outside evidence of their understanding of the contract.see id.
vbh does not qualify as a nursing home under the policy.in order for a facility to qualify as a nursing home under the policy,it must be,inter alia,licensed by the appropriate licensing agency to engage primarily in providing nursing care and related services to inpatients.it is undisputed that the department is the appropriate licensing agency for the state of oklahoma.the department licensed vbh as a residential care home,not as a nursing facility.under the nursing home care act,the residents of residential home facilities shall not routinely require nursing care.stat.tit.the act specifically excludes residential care homes from its definition of nursing facilit ies.id.the act also states that nursing facilit ies that provide skilled nursing care and related services do so for individuals who require care and services beyond the level of care provided by a residential care home.id.since vbh is specifically licensed as a residential care home and the oklahoma statutes require that the residents of vbh shall not routinely require nursing care,vbh is specifically designated by statute as something other than a facility that is primarily engaged in providing skilled nursing care and related services.it follows that vbh can not qualify under the policy as a facility licensed to engage primarily in providing nursing care and related services.see gregg ids life ins,denying benefits under a long term care insurance policy because the facility in which the insured resided was not a nursing home as defined by the licensing requirement contained in the policy see also waak bankers life ins,emphasizing that it is the formal licensing or categorization of an institution that controls whether the institution is covered by an insurance policy cullop rogue valley physicians,or,en banc noting that an institution licensed as a rehabilitation center by the state board of health did not constitute an approved hospital under an insurance policy requiring that a hospital be licensed to be covered.
it is true that at least one district court reached a different conclusion in an unpublished disposition interpreting a geca insurance contract that defines nursing home in the same way as the policy at issue in this case.in mcdonald general electric capital assurance,no.may,unpublished,the district court determined that the insured was entitled to benefits for a stay in an assisted living facility apparently not licensed as a nursing facility.the court reasoned that t he plain language of the policy does not require a specific type of license,and therefore rejected the insurer contention that.stat.tit,regulating nursing facilities was controlling.the court stated that all that is required is that the facility be licensed to primarily provide nursing care and related services and summarily concluded that the facility satisfies this requirement.however,the mcdonald court did not discuss how that facility met this requirement or what constitutes nursing care.mcdonald is not persuasive in light of the statut
