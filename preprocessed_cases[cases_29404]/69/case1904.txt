this action concerns a dispute over a road known as king way that runs over property owned by defendants kathie and joe beckham in nevada county.the dispute arose when plaintiff zora biagini,who owns property adjacent to the beckhams,cut down trees and other vegetation on the beckhams property near the road.biagini sought injunctive relief against the beckhams and the beckhams to quiet title and for damages for trespass.biagini asserted she had the right to cut vegetation of the beckhams property because king way had become a public road by virtue of public use of the road following the beckhams offer to dedicate the road to nevada county.the trial court disagreed,finding the beckhams had revoked their offer of dedication before it was accepted by public use of the roadway,although the offer remained open for nevada county to accept formally.as a result of this finding and another finding that biagini did not have a prescriptive easement,the court found biagini had no right to trim or destroy trees and vegetation on the beckhams property and held her liable for in damages to the beckhams for the trees she had cut down.
on appeal,biagini contends the trial court erred in finding there was insufficient public use of king way to constitute acceptance of the beckhams offer of dedication.she also contends the trial court erred in determining that a statutory offer of dedication such as the one the beckhams made can be revoked as to the public at large under common law principles.she makes some further arguments as well that rest on the validity of the previous two.
as we will explain,we find no error.the trial court was correct that the public use of king way shown by biagini was not sufficient to constitute implied acceptance of the beckhams statutory offer to dedicate that road for public use,although we do not agree with the trial court reason for reaching that result.the trial court concluded the nature and duration of the public use shown was insufficient to constitute acceptance of the offer of dedication.we conclude otherwise however,we also conclude that because the use shown was within the scope of express private easements that biagini and another adjacent landowner hold over king way,there is no basis for concluding that that use amounted to acceptance by the public at large of the offer of dedication.
we also conclude that the trial court was correct in determining that a statutory offer of dedication may be revoked by the offeror to preclude later,implicit acceptance by public use,even though the offer must remain open as to the public entity to which it was made under the provisions of the subdivision map act 
factual and procedural background 
to understand the present dispute,it is helpful to understand some of the history of the properties at issue here.those properties are depicted on a map that was admitted into evidence as plaintiff exhibit,a copy of which is appended to this opinion 
from what we can determine,the ownership and makeup of these properties as of was as follows the property the beckhams now own labeled beckham on the appended map was the southern part of a parcel known as the grover cleveland quartz lode mining claim,or lot,which was owned by someone named mcleary.the northern part of lot,only part of which is depicted on the appended map,is labeled jiannino on the map.the property biagini now owns labeled biagini on the appended map was the northern part of a larger parcel that lay to the south and east of lot.the southern part of that parcel is labeled king on the map.to the north of this larger parcel and to the east of the northern part of lot lay property that was owned by theodore and betty swartz.only part of this property,which is labeled on the appended map,is depicted on the map.
in february,the parcel south and east of lot was subdivided into two parcels a northern parcel labeled biagini on the appended map hereafter referred to as the biagini parcel and a southern parcel labeled king on the appended map hereafter referred to as the king parcel.at that time,access between the biagini parcel and allison ranch road which lies to the west of the properties was to be provided by a curved driveway that ran from the south boundary of the biagini parcel to a point where the king parcel bordered lot,and from there over an existing to allison ranch road.that driveway access is depicted on the appended map it does not appear,however,that it was ever used.no express easement for that driveway access was included in later conveyances of the biagini parcel.
sometime after,ownership of the biagini parcel and lot came into the hands of sharon king.in june,king deeded to the swartzes a wide roadway easement over the southern part of lot to provide access from their property to allison ranch road.this roadway was known,or came to be known,as king way.
in july,king deeded the biagini parcel to ray and angela fackrell along with the same easement over lot she had deeded to the swartzes.at this time,two driveways extended from king way onto the biagini parcel near the north end of that parcel.those driveways are partially depicted on the appended map.as it was identical to the easement king granted the swartzes,the easement king granted the fackrells did not describe any part of the two driveways onto the biagini parcel that lay on lot.nevertheless,there appears to have been no dispute that the fackrells easement across lot included the right to cross all the way to the biagini parcel.
at the same time she gave the swartzes and the fackrells easements across lot,king entered into and recorded a road maintenance agreement with the swartzes and the fackrells governing the private street running over the easement on lot,king way.
in april,king deeded lot to the beckhams.at that time,as it ran across lot king way was about to feet wide.
in december,the swartzes deeded their property to daren and susanne runion,along with the easement across lot.
in,the beckhams undertook to divide lot into two parcels a northern parcel that they would sell to michael and kathleen jiannino labeled jiannino on the appended map hereafter referred to as the jiannino parcel and a southern parcel that they would retain for themselves labeled beckham on the appended map hereafter referred to as the beckham parcel.to accomplish this division,the beckhams recorded a parcel map for a lot line adjustment that depicted a wide over the beckham parcel to the jiannino parcel,providing access from the jiannino parcel to allison ranch road.this corresponded generally,though not exactly,with the easement over king way that king had previously granted to the swartzes and the fackrells.as particularly relevant here,the wide abuts about half of the western boundary of the biagini parcel starting with the northwest corner of that parcel,whereas the actual roadway on the property lies entirely on the beckham parcel.see the appended map.
at the same time they recorded the parcel map,the beckhams also recorded an offer of dedication that offered to dedicate to nevada county f or ingress,egress,road construction and road maintenance purposes a road purportedly designated on the parcel map as queens lane.although the label queens lane does not appear on the parcel map,it appears undisputed that this was an offer to dedicate for public use the wide shown on the parcel map.
as part of the property division,nevada county required the gravel roadway across the beckham parcel to be widened to feet.instead of simply widening the gravel road,however,the beckhams and the jianninos agreed to pave it with asphalt and concrete,which they did.around this same time,the beckhams and the jianninos entered into a road maintenance agreement governing the roadway.the agreement referenced both the deeded easement to king way and the parcel map on which the wide roadway offered for dedication to the county was depicted.
in august,the county declined to accept the offer of dedication of the roadway across the beckham parcel but retained the right to accept that offer at a later date under the provisions of the subdivision map act.
in may,the beckhams recorded a parcel map to split the beckham parcel into two parcels both of which are labeled beckham on the appended map.the parcel map depicted the wide the beckhams had offered for dedication in.it also depicted the centerline of the wide easement from the grant deed to the swartzes in.around this same time,the beckhams and the jianninos signed another road maintenance agreement governing king way that was essentially identical to the one from.
in june,the fackrells deeded the biagini parcel to biagini,along with the easement across the beckham parcel.while in the process of purchasing the biagini parcel,biagini obtained from the fackrells real estate agent a copy of the parcel map from that depicted the wide the beckhams had offered to dedicate to the county.biagini did not have the property surveyed before she bought it,however.
when biagini fire insurance on the property was canceled less than a month after she purchased the property due to the presence of heavy brush,she began clearing the brush.at one point,when she was clearing brush near the northwest corner of her property alongside the road,or contemplating the need to do so,the beckhams came and told her that the property line was feet beyond the east side of the road.
what followed was a running dispute over the property line that led to this action.as biagini admits,however,no issues on appeal turn on the specific facts of that dispute.suffice it to say,as biagini does,that she thought she was within her rights to cut and remove brush and vegetation that she saw as interfering with her,and the beckhams disagreed.in the course of logging trees on her property,she also had her forester remove two trees next to her lower driveway without having them surveyed,she believed they were not on the beckhams property it turned out one of the trees was right on the property line,and the other was entirely on the beckhams property.it was this conflict over brush and tree removal that fueled this litigation.during the course of this dispute,the beckhams erected a fence along the property line between their parcel and biagini parcel.
in august,biagini sought a civil harassment restraining order against joe beckham.at that time,the parties agreed to have the property lines surveyed.later,in september,biagini filed a complaint for injunctive relief,seeking to enjoin the beckhams from cross ing the road dividing our properties until the property matter is resolved.in their answer filed later that month,the beckhams asserted as an affirmative defense that they had the right to defend their property from biagini repeated trespasses and vandalism.
in january,the beckhams filed their first amended for quiet title,trespass,slander of title,malicious mischief,and declaratory relief.in her answer to that,biagini asserted that the beckhams offer to dedicate king way to the county had been accepted by actual use of it being made by members of the public and that any acts of alleged trespass or malicious mischief were absolutely privileged by virtue of the dedication,which included the right to trim remove trees and vegetation.
the case was tried in january and february.ultimately,the trial court issued its statement of decision and judgment in january.as relevant here,the trial court found the beckhams had revoked their offer to dedicate king way before that offer was accepted by public use of the roadway,although the offer remained open for the county to accept formally.as a result of this finding and another finding that biagini did not have a prescriptive easement,the court found that biagini had no right to trim or destroy trees and vegetation on the beckhams property.the court found biagini liable for in damages to the beckhams for the trees biagini had cut down on the beckhams property.
biagini filed a timely notice of appeal.

biagini contends the trial court erred here in finding there was insufficient public use of king way to constitute implied acceptance of the beckhams offer of dedication.as we will explain,we agree with the trial court that under the circumstances of this case,no acceptance of the dedication by public use was shown,although our conclusion rests on different reasoning than that of the trial court.
we begin with the standard of review.biagini asserts that the insufficiency of evidence to support a finding of dedication is a question of law.italics omitted.we disagree.whether there was an implied acceptance of an offer of dedication is a question of fact city of santa clara ivancovich d,and we review the trial court findings of fact under the substantial evidence rule.of course,where there is no conflict in the relevant evidence,the question is one of law as to which we exercise our independent judgment.sonora diamond superior court th,d.
here,there was no conflict in the evidence of public use of king way the only question is whether the use that was shown by that evidence was sufficient to constitute acceptance of the beckhams offer of dedication.thus,we turn to what the evidence showed.
biagini testified that in operating three businesses from her home,she sees clients at home approximately times per month.she also testified that she had observed cars coming and going from the runions several times a day,that the jianninos get people in and out occasionally,and that joe beckham operates a drafting business from his home.
susanne runion testified that in her work as a chiropractor,she began seeing clients in her home beginning in approximately.over the approximately three years before the time of trial,she saw about to clients per week.
there was no evidence of whether any of joe beckham clients visit his home in connection with his drafting business.
based on the foregoing evidence,biagini contends t here was a steady flow of traffic in and out,approximately six to twelve trips a day,year in and year out,five days a week,amounting to a minimum of to a maximum of trips in any given year.in her view,this was a substantial amount of public usage that sufficed to show public acceptance of the offer of dedication.the trial court,on the other hand,concluded that much more intensive use over a much longer period of time is required for a finding of common law dedication.focusing on the fact that the evidence of use relating to runion chiropractic business showed use over no more than a period spanning only two or three years,the court stated that no case the court had examined had found a completed dedication for such a short period of time,no matter what type of offer or extent of use.added to that the facts that the dedicated road only serves five parcels,it is a,use by the general public has been limited,and it is a country road,the evidence is not clear and unequivocal,nor does it even predominate,that a completed common law dedication has occurred based on public use amounting to acceptance.
one problem with the trial court reasoning is that the court appeared to be looking for an intensity of public use of king way beyond what could reasonably be expected of a road of that,a dead end road in a rural area serving only a limited number of parcels.the applicable rule,however,is that i n ascertaining whether or not a highway,park or public place has been accepted by user,the purpose which the way,park or place is fitted or intended to serve must be the standard by which to determine the extent and character of use which constitutes an acceptance.koshland cherry.thus,the pertinent question here is not whether greater public use has consistently been shown in other cases where an implied acceptance of an offer of dedication was found,but whether the public use of king way shown by biagini was commensurate with what could reasonably be expected of a dead end road in a rural area serving only a limited number of parcels.see hanshaw long valley road,supra,th at,d upholding a finding of implied acceptance where the road was used freely to access the parcels by all who had need to access them and was used by all members of the public who had reason to use it.we conclude the public use shown here was commensurate with the nature of the road.
as for the duration of the public use shown,we similarly conclude that it does not matter whether the cases the trial court examined all involved longer periods of time.as we have observed,the question in determining whether acceptance has been manifested by public use is whether a use has been made of the property by the public for such a length of time as will evidence an intention to accept the dedication.county of inyo given,supra,cal.at.no certain amount of years or even months is necessary to satisfy this standard.as the supreme court explained in schwerdtle county of placer cal,where actual consent and acquiescence of the owner to use his land as a highway can be proved,then the length of time of the public use ceases to be of any importance,because the offer to dedicate,and the acceptance by use,both being shown,the rights of the public have immediately vested.id.at.as long as the length of time of public use evidences an intention to accept the dedication,that is all the law requires.
the foregoing would appear to lead to the conclusion that the evidence of the use of king way by susanne runion clients and biagini clients was sufficient to evidence public acceptance of the beckhams offer to dedicate king way for public use.there is one more relevant factor,however,that must be considered.on its way to finding that the evidence of public use was not sufficient to constitute implied acceptance of the offer of dedication,the trial court observed that t he use shown wa s that of two property owners and their clientele,which use is consistent with their ownership of a private easement.this observation raises the following question when a offered for dedication to the public is also subject to one or more private easements,does use of the road have to exceed the scope of use permissible under those easements to constitute implied acceptance of the offer of dedication stated another way,if the use of king way by susanne runion and biagini clients was within the scope of the easements held by biagini and the runions,can an implied acceptance of the offer of dedication nonetheless be found based on that use 
the answers to those questions lie in the foundational principles underlying the doctrine of common law dedication.the common law doctrine of dedication rests on public convenience and has been sanctioned by the experience of ages.it is based on public policy and good faith,in that,while securing to the public only such rights as it has honestly enjoyed or learned to depend on,it takes from the landowner nothing that was not intended to be given.the doctrine of dedication is sometimes seen as analogous,founded on,or resting largely on,grounds of estoppel dedication,fns.omitted.
long ago,our supreme court explained that d edication is but a phase of estoppel it does not operate as a grant,but is in the nature of an estoppel in pais,which debars the owner from recovering it back.prescott edwards cal.a dedication operates against the dedicator by estoppel,and this estoppel may be invoked by or on behalf of the public at large.sussman san luis obispo county cal.indeed,dedication is a matter purely between the owner and the public.there is no such thing as a dedication between the owner and individuals.the public must be a party to every dedication.prescott edwards,supra,cal.at.thus,where the public at large relies on an offer to dedicate land to public use to such an extent that it would be unfair under principles of estoppel to deny the public continued use of the land for that purpose,implied acceptance of the offer of dedication will be found.in this vein,our supreme court has stated that the duration of public use necessary to establish implied acceptance of an offer of dedication ought to be such length of time that the public accommodation will be affected materially by an interruption of the enjoyment.san francisco canavan cal.
applying these underlying principles to the issue before us leads to the conclusion that the trial court reached the right conclusion albeit for the wrong reason when it found that the use of king way shown by biagini was not sufficient to establish implied acceptance of the beckhams offer of dedication.it is undisputed that biagini and the runions both had express private easements over king way at all times that their business invitees used the road to access their properties.additionally,there appears no basis for concluding that the use of king way by those invitees was beyond the scope of the private easements,which allowed for ingress and egress to the biagini and parcels inasmuch as these easements will continue to allow for the same access to and from the biagini and parcels that biagini offered evidence of,regardless of the disposition of the beckhams offer of dedication,the conclusion that an implied acceptance of the beckhams offer of dedication never occurred results in no injustice or unfairness,and thus the fundamental basis for finding such an acceptance does not exist.
our supreme court has explained that when one lays out a tract of land into lots and streets and sells the lots by reference to a map which exhibits the lots and streets as they lie with relation to each other,the purchasers of such lots have a private easement in the streets opposite their respective lots,for ingress and egress and for any use proper to a private way,and this private easement is entirely independent of the fact of dedication to public use,and is a private appurtenance to the lots,of which the owners can not be divested except by due process of law.danielson sykes cal.although not directly applicable here,this principle supports our conclusion inasmuch as it confirms that a private easement over a roadway is an entirely different matter than a dedication of that roadway to use by the public in general.where,as here,the use of property is consistent with a private easement,there is no basis for finding an implied acceptance of an offer of dedication by public use.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude the trial court did not err in determining there was insufficient public use of king way to constitute implied acceptance of the beckhams offer of dedication.
common law revocation of a statutory offer of dedication 
the trial court found that the beckhams revoked their offer of dedication to the public at large by object ing to biagini use of the property,the building of the fence,and contesting biagini right to use their property in this litigation.consistent with this finding,the court ordered that c ontinued public use of the
