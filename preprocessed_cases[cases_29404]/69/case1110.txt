these appeals require us to decide whether confirmation of an arbitration award in favor of the ministry of defense and support for the armed forces of the islamic republic of iran is contrary to the public policy of the united states under the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,known as the new york convention.we hold,consistent with the position of the united states as amicus curiae,that confirmation of the award does not violate any public policy of the united states.we also hold that the district court judgment is a money judgment subject to postjudgment interest,and that a district court has discretion to award prejudgment interest and attorney fees in an action to confirm an arbitration award under the convention.accordingly,we affirm the judgment in part,vacate it in part and remand to the district court for reconsideration of the ministry motions for prejudgment interest and attorney fees.
background 
in,cubic international sales corporation,predecessor in interest to appellant cubic defense systems,cubic,a united states corporation,contracted with the ministry of war of the government of iran,predecessor of appellee ministry of defense and support for the armed forces of the islamic republic of iran ministry,for sale and service of an air combat maneuvering range for use by iran military.the iranian revolution resulted in nonperformance of the contracts.consequently,the parties agreed in that the contracts would be discontinued and that cubic would try to resell the equipment,with a later settlement of the accounts.in,cubic sold a modified version of the equipment to canada.
in,the ministry filed breach of contract claims against cubic with the iran united states claims tribunal at the hague.in,that tribunal issued an order stating that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter.see ministry of def.of the islamic republic of iran gov t of the united states,iran cl.trib,wl.
in,the ministry filed a request for arbitration before the international court of arbitration of the international chamber of commerce icc.the icc,sitting in switzerland,made a final award in those proceedings in may.the final award makes a net award of plus interest in favor of the ministry.the icc also directed cubic to reimburse the ministry for arbitration costs.
in june,after cubic failed to pay,the ministry filed a petition in federal district court to confirm the icc award under the new york convention.see the district court issued an order granting the ministry petition in december.
the ministry subsequently filed a motion for prejudgment interest covering the period between the icc final award and the district court confirmation.the motion also requested attorney fees based on cubic alleged failure to comply with the icc decision.the district court denied the motion,concluding that prejudgment interest and attorney fees were unavailable in an action to confirm a foreign arbitration award under the convention.
the district court entered judgment in august.cubic timely appealed confirmation of the award,and the ministry timely cross appealed denial of prejudgment interest and attorney fees.proceedings were suspended pending litigation over whether certain judgment creditors of iran could attach the ministry judgment.that litigation has now been concluded.see ministry of def.support for armed forces of islamic republic of iran cubic def,d,aff,cir,vacated and remanded,d,remanded to,cir,rev,d,remanded to,cir.
following oral argument in february,we invited the united states to express its view on whether confirmation of the icc award would be contrary to the public policy of the united states under article v b of the convention.the united states filed an amicus brief supporting affirmance.we then directed the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing the united states brief,which they have done.these appeals accordingly are ripe for decision.
discussion 
cubic argues that the district court erred by confirming the icc award because confirmation is contrary to the public policy of the united states and,in the alternative,because the award has not yet become binding on the parties.cubic also argues that the district court judgment is not subject to interest because the district court did not specify the dollar amount of the confirmed award.on cross appeal,the ministry argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying its motion for prejudgment interest and attorney fees.we address these arguments in turn.
confirmation of foreign arbitration awards is governed by the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,june,known as the new york convention,and federal law implementing the convention.section provides 
within three years after an arbitral award falling under the convention is made,any party to the arbitration may apply to any court having jurisdiction under this chapter for an order confirming the award as against any other party to the arbitration.the court shall confirm the award unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the said convention.
the seven grounds for refusing to confirm an award are set out in article v of the convention these defenses are construed narrowly,and the party opposing recognition or enforcement bears the burden of establishing that a defense applies.see polimaster rae,cir.
cubic invokes two of these defenses here,arguing that recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of the united states,and,in the alternative,that the award has not yet become binding on the parties.convention,art.v e,v b.although cubic did not raise these issues in the district court,we exercise our discretion to consider them for the first time on appeal because they are purely questions of law and do not depend on further factual development of the record.see hesse sprint,cir.we hold that neither defense applies,and accordingly affirm the district court confirmation of the icc award.
cubic argues that confirmation of the award would be contrary to the public policy of the united states.the convention public policy defense,article v b,states 
recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award may be refused if the competent authority in the country where recognition and enforcement is sought finds that b the recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of that country.

cubic argues that confirmation of the icc award is contrary to a fundamental public policy of the united states against trade and financial transactions with the islamic republic of iran.as evidence of this policy,cubic points to the sanctions the united states has imposed on iran,including the iranian assets control regulations,pt,the iranian transactions regulations,pt,and the weapons of mass destruction proliferators sanctions regulations wmd sanctions regulations,pt.cubic argues that these sanctions regimes are relevant to the public policy analysis for two related reasons.first,the sanctions prohibit cubic from paying the icc award unless the treasury department office of foreign assets control ofac issues a specific license cubic contends that the existence of a policy prohibiting payment of the award is sufficient to demonstrate the existence of a fundamental public policy against confirmation of the award as well.second,even though the sanctions do not specifically prohibit confirmation of the award,cubic sees them as evidence of a comprehensive united states policy against trade,investment and economic support for iran that makes even confirmation of the icc award repugnant to the public policy of the united states.
in support of this latter argument,cubic cites bassidji goe,cir,where we considered the scope and purposes of the iranian transactions regulations a set of sanctions prohibiting virtually all trade with and investment in iran by a united states person.see.bassidji described the regulations as a means toward the larger end of exerting economic pressure on iran,in order to induce iran to abandon policies that the united states deems adverse to its interests.bassidji,at.having thus defined the underlying purposes of the regulations broadly,we suggested that virtually any transfer of wealth to iran,or any payment that would provide funds to the iranian economy,would violate the fundamental purposes,if not necessarily the letter,of the regulations.id.at.
we are not persuaded by cubic argument,which gives too little weight to this country strong public policy in support of the recognition of foreign arbitration awards,and too much weight to the regulatory restrictions governing payment of the icc award.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the ministry,and the united states as amicus curiae,have the better argument.
our analysis begins with the strong public policy favoring confirmation of foreign arbitration awards.the goal of the convention,and the principal purpose underlying american adoption and implementation of it,was to encourage the recognition and enforcement of commercial arbitration agreements in international contracts and to unify the standards by which agreements to arbitrate are observed and arbitral awards are enforced in the signatory countries.scherk alberto culver,d.as we have said before,t he public policy in favor of international arbitration is strong.ministry of def.of the islamic republic of iran gould,cir alteration in original quoting fotochrome,copal,cir internal quotation marks omitted.to prevail,therefore,cubic must demonstrate a countervailing public policy sufficient to overcome this strong policy favoring confirmation of the icc award.cubic has not met that substantial burden.id.
first,although american relations with iran are heavily regulated,the applicable sanctions regulations do not preclude the confirmation of the icc award.br.of the united states as amicus curiae.the iranian assets control regulations,which the united states adopted in response to the seizure of american hostages in tehran in,block the transfer of certain property in which iran has an interest.a general license,however,authorizes the transfer of property interests acquired after january,see a,and the supreme court has already held that iran interests in this case are covered by that general license.see ministry of def.support for the armed forces of the islamic republic of iran elahi,d.the iranian assets control regulations accordingly do not prohibit payment,let alone confirmation,of the icc award.
the iranian transactions regulations and the wmd sanctions regulations also permit confirmation of the award.as noted,each of these sets of sanctions independently prohibits payment of the icc award without a specific license issued by ofac.see c,a.neither regime,however,prohibits confirmation of the award.
second,although cubic places great stock in the regulations prohibition on payment absent a license,there is a great deal of difference between payment and confirmation.see br.of the united states as amicus curiae.confirmation,standing alone,transfers no wealth to iran.thus,even if cubic is correct that the united states has a fundamental public policy against economic support for the government of iran,confirmation does not violate that policy.see oil libyan sun oil,although sun oil argues that confirmation of this award would mean that dollars would end up financing qadhafi terrorist exploits,the court has already pointed out that the president is empowered to prevent any such transfer through the libyan sanctions regulations.
third,the difference between confirmation and payment is accentuated when,as in this case,payment is subject to licensing rather than barred absolutely.we should not refuse to confirm an arbitration award because payment is prohibited when payment may in fact be authorized by the government issuance of a specific license.according to the united states brief,i f this court affirms the confirmation of the award,the treasury department can issue a license requiring cubic to make any payment satisfying the judgment into a blocked account held in the ministry name by a financial institution.br.of the united states as amicus curiae the possibility that ofac could issue a license supports confirmation of the award.belship navigation,sealift,civ,wl,at july,any award that belship might recover through arbitration would be placed in a blocked interest bearing account until relations with cuba improve to the point where the funds may be released to belship.allowing arbitration to proceed will hardly violate the united states most basic notions of morality and justice.
fourth,the applicable regulations provide general licenses authorizing legal representation of iran in legal proceedings in the united states relating to disputes between iran and a united states national.see a authorizing legal services to persons whose interests in property are blocked,for the i nitiation and conduct of domestic legal proceedings in defense of property interests subject to jurisdiction id.a authorizing the provision of legal services for the i nitiation and conduct of domestic united states legal proceedings on behalf of the government of iran.although these regulations do not expressly authorize confirmation of foreign arbitration awards in favor of iran,they show that legal proceedings to resolve disputes such as this one are,short of payment of a judgment,not in conflict with united states sanctions policy.
finally,as noted,the united states as amicus curiae supports affirmance of the district court confirmation of the icc award.an expression of national policy is not necessarily dispositive of the public policy issue under the convention.see parsons whittemore,at to read the public policy defense as a parochial device protective of national political interests would seriously undermine the convention utility.nonetheless,given cubic invocation of our country fraught relationship with iran as expressed through various trade sanctions,the government confirmation that the icc award comports with the national and foreign policy of the united states is entitled to great weight.oil.at given that the current administration has given libya permission to bring this action,this court simply can not conclude that to confirm a validly obtained,foreign arbitral award in favor of the libyan government would violate the united states most basic notions of morality and justice.
for these reasons,we hold that confirmation of the icc award is not contrary to the public policy of the united states under article v b of the new york convention.cubic has not identified a public policy sufficient to overcome the strong federal policy in favor of recognizing foreign arbitration awards.see br.of the united states as amicus curiae.
cubic argues in the alternative that confirmation of the icc award is contrary to the public policy of the united states because affirmance of the judgment would put cubic in the nightmare position of being subject to an apparently enforceable judgment when cubic and any of its involved agents would commit crimes by paying or allowing payment.supplemental br.of cubic def.cubic asserts that the mere existence of an unstayed judgment may threaten the existence of the judgment debtor,by violating covenants in core financing agreements.id.at.
there has,however,been no showing that the judgment is unpayable ofac has discretion to issue a specific license,and may do so.in any event,were a court to confirm an unpayable arbitration award,we presume the affected party could seek a stay of execution of judgment,avoiding the nightmare cubic fears.as a general matter,a stay of execution is proper upon a showing that an immediate enforcement of the judgment will result in unnecessary hardship to the judgment debtor.d executions see also executions a court may grant a stay in the furtherance of justice whenever it would be unjust to further execute or enforce the judgment,or where,although it is proper to enforce the judgment,there is good reason why execution should be postponed.footnote omitted hewlett packard,berg,cir holding that a district court has discretion,in an action under the new york convention,to stay confirmation of an arbitration award for prudential reasons.cubic argument is therefore unpersuasive.
cubic argument that the icc award has not become binding on the parties is similarly without merit.under article v e of the convention 
recognition and enforcement of the award may be refused,at the request of the party against whom it is invoked,only if that party furnishes to the competent authority where the recognition and enforcement is sought,proof that e the award has not yet become binding on the parties,or has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority of the country in which,or under the law of which,that award was made.
convention,art.v.this defense may be invoked when an action to confirm or enforce an arbitration award is filed before the award has become final.see publicis commc true commc ns,cir.an arbitration award becomes binding when no further recourse may be had to another arbitral tribunal that is,an appeals tribunal.fertilizer of india idi,quoting aksen,american arbitration accession arrives in the age of aquarius united states implements united nations convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,sw,internal quotation marks omitted.cubic does not dispute that all arbitration appeals have been exhausted here.the award has thus become binding,and article v e does not apply 
in sum,neither the public policy defense nor the finality defense applies.the district court thus properly granted the ministry petition for confirmation of the icc award.
cubic contends the district court judgment is not a money judgment and thus is not subject to postjudgment interest because it does not specify the dollar amount of the arbitration award the governing statute provides that i nterest shall be allowed on any money judgment in a civil case recovered in a district court.a.we have not previously defined the term money judgment.the third circuit has done so,however,and we find its definition persuasive.
under this definition,a money judgment consists of two elements an identification of the parties for and against whom judgment is being entered,and a definite and certain designation of the amount which plaintiff is owed by defendant.penn terra dep t of envtl,cir defining the term money judgment for purposes of former bankruptcy code b see also eaves cnty.of cape may,cir extending penn terra definition to a in re haugen,cir employing a similar definition.
in eeoc gurnee inns,cir,the district court ordered the defendant to pay specified sums to a number of employees,less appropriate payroll deductions.id.at.the seventh circuit rejected the defendant argument that this was not a money judgment,stating the awards did not lose their character as sums certain simply because they were subject to the mechanical task of computing the payroll deductions.id.at.here,although the judgment does not spell out the amount of the icc award,a definite and certain designation of the amount that cubic owes the ministry is readily discernible by looking to the arbitration award itself.as the district court recognized,the icc ordered cubic to pay iran with simple interest of per annum from september,until may,and to reimburse iran which was advanced by iran for the costs of arbitration.the district court confirmed this award without modification.the judgment therefore satisfies both elements of a money judgment.
cubic argues in the alternative that postjudgment interest should be tolled because cubic has been prevented,through no fault of its own,from paying the judgment after it was confirmed by the district court.this argument is foreclosed by the plain language of,which provides that i nterest shall be allowed on any money judgment in a civil case recovered in a district court.a emphasis added.this language is mandatory,not discretionary.see air separation,underwriters at lloyd of london,cir.the ministry is therefore entitled to postjudgment interest.
in its cross appeal,the ministry argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying the ministry motion for,prejudgment interest covering the period following the icc final award in may.the district court concluded it lacked authority to award prejudgment interest 
according to the ninth circuit,a district court review of a foreign arbitration award is quite circumscribed,and,the district court has little discretion.ministry of defense of the islamic republic of iran gould,cir.the convention does not provide for the award of interest by a district court,but rather only provides for the confirmation of the arbitral award.in this case,the award does provide for some interest,and it is that which this court confirmed.however,iran can point to no binding authority under which this court would be authorized to award interest in addition to that already awarded by the icc.neither the convention,congress implementation of that convention under,nor binding case law authorize s the award of interest by a district court reviewing an arbitral award under the convention.
we agree with the ministry that the district court erred.
the second and eleventh circuits have held that,prejudgment interest is available in an action to confirm an arbitration award under the new york convention.see indus.risk insurers gutehoffnungshutte gmbh,cir waterside ocean navigation int l navigation,cir we find their reasoning persuasive.
first,w hether to award prejudgment interest in cases arising under federal law has in the absence of a statutory directive been placed in the sound discretion of the district courts.waterside ocean navigation,at alteration in original quoting lodges,int l ass of machinists united aircraft,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also frank music metro goldwyn mayer,cir c ourts may allow prejudgment interest even though the governing statute is silent.this general rule reflects the widely accepted,remedial purpose of interest which is to compensat e the injured party for the loss of the use of money he would otherwise have had.frank music,at.
second,nothing in the federal statutes implementing the convention,or in the convention itself,reveals any intention on the part of congress or the contracting states to preclude,prejudgment interest.t he convention is silent on the question of interest.waterside ocean navigation,at.
third,although a court review of an arbitration award is limited,nothing in the convention or the implementing statutes restricts the court jurisdiction over collateral issues such as prejudgment interest.to be sure,a court review of the award itself is minimal the convention requires a court to confirm the award unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the said convention.judicial review of the award is therefore quite circumscribed r ather than review the merits of the underlying arbitration,we review de novo only whether the party established a defense under the convention.china metal prods.imp.exp.apex digital,cir quoting gould,at.actions under the convention,however,arise under the laws and treaties of the united states.thus,as in other federal question cases,whether to award prejudgment interest falls within the district court discretion.
