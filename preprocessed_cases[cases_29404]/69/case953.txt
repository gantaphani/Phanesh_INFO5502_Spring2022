kenneth and rachel seymour appeal from the district court order granting summary judgment to the city of des moines,iowa the city,and des moines police officers detective brian danner and sergeant barry arnold collectively the defendants.we affirm.
a.the events of march,
on march,the seymours whom we shall refer to by their first names were the parents of three sons joshua,joseph,and nathaniel.at about that evening,rachel left the home to do some shopping,taking joshua with her while kenneth remained at home with joseph and nathaniel.sometime during the evening,nathaniel became fussy.kenneth tried to calm him by holding him and placing him in a child swing.nathaniel remained fussy.believing that the child might be hungry,kenneth tried twice to reach his wife on her cell phone,but was unsuccessful.nathaniel eventually calmed down,and kenneth placed him on the chair upon which nathaniel typically slept during the day.kenneth was later able to reach his wife and suggested that she come home.
after rachel returned home,she and kenneth prepared joseph and joshua for bed.when rachel checked on nathaniel,she discovered that he was not breathing.kenneth called,and emergency medical personnel came to the home shortly thereafter.members of the des moines police department,including officer richard ramsey a patrol supervisor and officer lorena bland,arrived around the same time as the ambulance.rachel accompanied nathaniel in the ambulance to the hospital.kenneth remained home with joshua and joseph,intending to join his wife at the hospital once someone arrived to watch the children.
officer ramsey called sergeant arnold,who was the head of the department child abuse investigative team,and apprised him of the following facts that the child had been fussy that the father had twice tried unsuccessfully to reach the mother on her cell phone that the child eventually fell asleep that when the mother later returned the father call the father told her that it was time for the child to be fed and that when the mother got home and checked on the infant,he was not breathing.arnold was also told that the mother had already left for the hospital and that the father had stayed home to care for their two other children.arnold told ramsey,well,just have him kenneth wait there,and we will be out there very quickly.
arnold then called detective brian danner,the officer in the crimes against children unit,and told danner to meet him at the seymour residence.arnold next called detective james keller of the child abuse unit and directed him to go to the hospital.arnold testified that he thought that kenneth wanted to stay with the children and that,assuming neighbors or family came to the home to watch the children,he arnold would quickly arrive at the seymour residence,take kenneth to the hospital,and conduct a short interview.arnold also called the child protective services supervisor and apprised him of the situation.arnold testified that he made the call as a matter of professional courtesy and that he was not reporting child abuse,which would have required child protective services to respond.
kenneth father arrived at the residence shortly after the ambulance had departed.at some point,other individuals arrived as well.kenneth told the officers on the scene that he wanted to leave for the hospital,but was informed that he had to stay where he was until the detectives arrived.relatives asked whether kenneth could leave and were told that he was required to remain.
shortly before arnold arrived at the seymours home,keller called him from the hospital and told him that kenneth presence was requested at the hospital.he also told arnold that nathaniel was not going to survive and that the doctors would stop performing cpr once kenneth arrived.arnold called detective danner,who by this time had arrived at the seymour home,and told him that he would be there very shortly and that he and danner would need to drive kenneth to the hospital as soon as they were able to do so.
danner arrived approximately twenty minutes after kenneth father.danner was inside the residence for a short while and then went outside with kenneth.arnold arrived while danner and kenneth were outside.upon arriving at the seymour residence,arnold briefly discussed with kenneth which of kenneth relatives would stay behind with the children.arnold and danner then drove kenneth to the hospital,with danner questioning kenneth during the trip.once they arrived at the hospital,it appears that arnold,who had been driving,began asking most of the questions.some of the questions concerned the possibility that kenneth may have accidentally dropped nathaniel or that kenneth,frustrated by nathaniel fussiness,may have shaken him.kenneth told the officers that nothing out of the ordinary had happened while he was watching nathaniel,whereupon arnold concluded the questioning and permitted kenneth to leave the vehicle.nathaniel died shortly after kenneth arrived at the hospital.the parties agree that nathaniel death was not the result of any criminal behavior by kenneth.the most likely cause of death was sudden infant death syndrome sids 
training,policies,and procedures 
because arnold was the officer in charge of the investigation,it is his training and experience,rather than danner,that we will discuss.in addition to his other training,arnold had attended classes on child fatality investigations and a course on investigating the physical and sexual abuse of children offered by fox valley technical college fox valley and sponsored by the united states department of justice the des moines police department does not offer formal internal training on child abuse investigations,relying instead on the training offered in courses such as those offered by fox valley.the department procedures are derived from the fox valley course as well as from the fox valley training manual.arnold testified that although the procedures they use are adopted from the fox valley training,the fox valley training manual does not establish city policies.
arnold testified that the child abuse unit initial response is to treat all child death as a possible homicide until their investigation proves otherwise,and explained that in child death investigations evidence of physical trauma sometimes fails to appear until the autopsy.the department standard practice in child death cases is to interview the individuals who were caring for the child before the medical emergency occurred.standard procedure also calls for detaining and separating those persons present at the scene.arnold noted,however,that nobody is considered a suspect.he also testified that it would not always be necessary to detain those persons at the scene.questioning generally serves a purpose that of obtaining medically useful information and acquiring information about possible crimes.both arnold and danner testified that not all investigations call for the same procedures.
testimony regarding kenneth detention 
arnold testified that w e did not have any indications while he was on his way to the seymour residence that there was any child abuse.he also testified,however,that the officers did not know whether nathaniel medical distress was the result of sids or an inflicted injury.when asked why he ordered kenneth to be detained,he stated that his first thought was that he had stayed there on his own volition to care for his children.we wanted to talk to him.and i believe that we were going to make a very timely response there.arnold also added that he thought that kenneth would try to contact family members or neighbors who could come over and watch the children and that once arnold arrived,he would be able to take kenneth to the hospital.arnold testified that there was no reason why kenneth would be detained once family members had arrived to take care of the children and that had he been informed of kenneth desire to go to the hospital,he would have tried to accommodate that request.he added that taking kenneth to the hospital would be consistent with his training.arnold testified further that,in the circumstances,it was appropriate to interview kenneth while he was apart from the other family members.
d.the present action 
this case was removed to federal court under federal question jurisdiction.see a and c.the seymours third amended petition alleges that the defendants violated their constitutional rights while acting under color of state law,in violation of.they also allege various state law causes of action that include defamation,false imprisonment,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment,concluding,inter alia,that the section claim failed because the officers were entitled to qualified immunity.as for the state law claims,although the district court rejected the defendants argument that they were entitled to emergency response immunity,it nevertheless concluded that the seymours state law claims failed for other reasons.
we review de novo the district court order granting the defendants motion for summary judgment.ferguson united states,cir citation omitted.summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party presents no genuine dispute of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fischer andersen,cir citations omitted.
a.the federal cause of action 
in their section claim,the seymours contend that kenneth detention at his home violated his fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures.specifically,they argue that the seizure was unsupported by reasonable suspicion of criminal activity,that it was unreasonably lengthy,and that it was tantamount to an arrest without probable cause.they further contend that arnold and danner are not entitled to qualified immunity for this constitutional violation because reasonable officers in their position would have known that their conduct violated the law.the seymours also argue that the city is liable for the officers constitutional tort because the violation sprang from the city constitutionally suspect policies regarding child death investigations.
the officers liability 
to determine whether an officer is entitled to qualified immunity,courts undertake the analysis set forth in saucier katz,d.the first step requires us to ask whether the officer conduct violated a constitutional right.id.at.if the officer has violated a constitutional right,the inquiry next turns to whether that right was clearly established in the context of the situation the officer faced.id.at.
for an investigative seizure to be constitutional under the fourth amendment,an officer must be aware of particularized,objective facts which,taken together with rational inferences from those facts,reasonably warrant suspicion that a crime is being committed.united states donnelly,cir.quotation omitted,cert.denied,d.courts must balance the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual fourth amendment interests against the importance of the governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion.united states place,d.an investigative detention may turn into an arrest if it lasts for an unreasonably long time,donnelly,at quoting united states,cir,or if it is too intrusive.pace city of des moines,cir citing united states dixon,cir.
before addressing kenneth detention in detail,we observe first that,on appeal,the defendants justify the detention primarily in terms of the state interest in investigating a possible crime rather than on acquiring information that may have been useful for nathaniel treatment.this emphasis on criminal investigation echoes evidence in the record indicating that the officers actions were directed principally toward investigating possible criminal activity accordingly,our inquiry will focus on whether kenneth detention was a reasonable law enforcement measure and not on whether there were any community caretaking concerns that may have justified the restriction on kenneth liberty.samuelson city of new ulm,cir recognizing that law enforcement may,under some circumstances,seize someone for the purposes of protecting public and individual safety,even if there is no suspicion of criminal activity citations omitted.
the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the seymours indicates that kenneth detention commenced when kenneth was told by an officer on the scene that he was to remain at the seymour home until arnold arrived.although arnold testified that he thought that kenneth had stayed behind willingly so that he could watch his other children,the order nevertheless constituted a curtailment of kenneth freedom.even if he was unlikely to have used that freedom to go to the hospital before neighbors or relatives had arrived,a reasonable person in kenneth position would have believed that he was not at liberty to ignore the officers instructions to remain at home.united states mendenhall,d we conclude that a person has been seized within the meaning of the fourth amendment only if,in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident,a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.in sum,we conclude that kenneth seizure commenced upon his being told that he was not free to leave and did not end until he was allowed to exit arnold vehicle 
we turn next to the justification for the seizure.the defendants appear to contend that the seizure was based upon a reasonable suspicion that kenneth may have committed a crime.in their brief,the defendants recite a litany of crimes that an officer might have suspected child endangerment,willful injury,attempted murder,and murder.in appraising this argument,we note first that there is nothing inherently suspicious about a fussy baby or about a father calling the child mother to inquire about the mother return so the baby could be fed.moreover,the record does not clearly indicate the likelihood that an infant otherwise unexplained medical distress should be attributed to criminal conduct,as opposed to causes,such as sids.arnold offered no testimony regarding the relative frequency of criminal as compared to causes in child death cases.rachel,who has worked since as an attorney with the polk county juvenile public defender office,and who is active in a sids support group,testified that sids is the leading cause of infant deaths.the defendants contend,referring to arnold deposition testimony,that arnold knew from his training and experience that fussy children often become battered children.appellee br.at.the record does not appear to reflect any such testimony by arnold arnold testified instead that he had told kenneth in the car that i n cases of shaken babies,crying is the most frequent trigger mechanism that causes good people to make a really poor decision and shake them just to try to get them to stop crying.observing that shaking is commonly precipitated by frustration over fussiness is not the same as suggesting that fussiness often leads to shaking.it bears mention,too,that arnold testified that there was no indication of child abuse at the time he ordered the detention.
we also observe that in cases such as this,where the facts allegedly giving rise to a suspicion of criminality may reasonably appear to untrained eyes to be innocent in nature,we require some explanation regarding how the officer training endowed seemingly innocent facts with criminal significance.see united states johnson,cir t he fourth amendment requires an officer to explain why the officer knowledge of particular criminal practices gives special significance to the apparently innocent facts observed.emphasis in original.the officers do not adequately explain how their training and experience might have led a reasonable officer to suspect that kenneth had committed a crime.in light of the foregoing,we can not conclude from this record that kenneth detention was supported by a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.
having determined that the detention violated kenneth constitutional right to be free from unreasonable seizures,we turn to the second step of our qualified immunity analysis,which requires us to consider whether the right was clearly established.saucier,at.this second step is a inquiry and must be undertaken in light of the specif
