brown williamson tobacco company b w appeals from the judgment entered by the district court on the jury verdict in favor of henry boerner boerner on his design defect claim.we affirm,conditioned on boerner acceptance of the remittitur ordered on the punitive damages portion of the jury award.
lung cancer was identified in the and its incidence rose sharply in that same decade.in,alton oschner and michael debakey published carcinoma of the lung in archives of surgery.the article noted the parallel rise in smoking and lung cancer,concluding that the latter was due mostly to the former,and included a lengthy bibliography of sources from multiple countries.in response,edward harlow,a chemist at the american tobacco company,circulated an internal memorandum.referring to research funded or conducted by american tobacco,harlow predicted that impartial research would vindicate cigarettes but that this would never be suspected by reading the extensive medical literature on tobacco.he also noted that the medical profession is the group which it is most desired to reach and convince and that the tobacco industry is very much in need of some friendly research in this field.ex.at to.
ernest wynder,while in his second year of medical school,began conducting surveys of cancer patients in.evarts graham,the head of the surgery department at washington university school of medicine in louis and the first person to successfully remove a whole lung from a human being,granted wynder access to his wards in order to gather more data the following year.the journal of the american medical association published wynder survey data in.wynder compilations of case after case among a variety of groups showed that lung cancer was extremely rare in non or minimal smokers.he had also begun laboratory studies on mice that tended to support the linkage.
wynder continued his research at the institute,a leading private center for cancer research in new york.american tobacco,also based in new york,contributed funds to through the damon runyan fund and sought to intervene.recalling the events at a meeting of these two groups,hiram hanmer,the research director at american tobacco,explained how he told them we were disturbed about some of the activities of wynder and graham.rhoads of replied that wynder work and publications could be controlled,but not his activities outside of work.
in the early,numerous studies agreed on the linkage and were widely disseminated in the press.a study by cuyler hammond of the american cancer society surveyed the smoking habits of people and then monitored their health.it obtained similar results in and the incidence of lung cancer was approximately higher among pack a day smokers as compared to nonsmokers.critics alleged researcher bias,arguing that a linkage could be shown only by taking two groups of people and forcing one to smoke and the other to abstain.wynder replied as follows there are fields of human endeavor in which facts can be suppressed and at times submerged forever.not so,however,in science if one negates the value of statistics as part of scientific proof and sets a goal for acceptable proof that is based upon impossible conditions,the very aim to resolve a given issue is paralyzed.an appraisal of the issue,new eng.med.june.in,president kennedy inquired into the linkage,leading to a finding by the surgeon general that smoking was related to lung cancer,at least in men.in,the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act was passed,branding cigarette boxes with the words caution cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health,stat,at codified as amended at.
mary jane boerner boerner began smoking in at the age of.but for a short initial period during which she smoked lucky strike cigarettes,she smoked only pall mall brand cigarettes until she quit smoking in.in,she developed lung cancer.in june of,she and boerner,her husband,filed this lawsuit against b successor entity of american tobacco,which was the manufacturer of the pall mall claims of failure to warn,design defect,violation of a voluntarily undertaken duty,fraud,and conspiracy to commit fraud.following boerner death in august,the complaint was amended to include a wrongful death claim.
the district court granted b w motion for summary judgment as to all of the claims.on appeal,we affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded the design defect and failure to warn claims for trial.boerner brown williamson tobacco,cir.on remand,b w moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of boerner case in chief.the district court denied the motion with respect to the failure to warn claim and reserved its decision on the design defect claim pending the jury verdict.the jury found that the defective condition of pall mall cigarettes proximately caused boerner illness and death,as well as the resulting injuries to henry boerner,and awarded in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages.the jury found for b w on the failure to warn claim.the district court initially granted b w motion for judgment as a matter of law on the award of punitive damages,but reversed itself on reconsideration and reinstated the full jury award.b w now raises four issues for our review on appeal.
we consider first b w contention that the district court improperly refused to grant its motions for judgment as a matter of law and for new trial.we review de novo the district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and making all reasonable inferences in favor of the jury verdict.douglas county bank trust united financial,cir.we review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion for new trial.id.
to succeed on a design defect claim under arkansas law,the plaintiff must establish that the product was in a defective condition,that the defective condition rendered the product unreasonably dangerous,and that the defect proximately caused the injury.ann.boerner i,at.a product is unreasonably dangerous when it is dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary and reasonable buyer,consumer,or user.ann.boerner i,at.
b w offers two bases for reversal of the district court denial of its motions.first,b w contends that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because boerner failed to present any evidence establishing the defective condition of pall mall cigarettes specifically,making instead only a categorical attack on cigarettes generally.
we conclude that there was sufficient evidence adduced at trial to support the jury verdict on the design defect claim.some evidence not specific to pall mall was indeed presented cigarettes contain nicotine,which is addictive cigarettes contain carcinogens carcinogens are the causal link between smoking and cancer and historically the average smoker did not fully appreciate the nature or severity of the health risks associated with smoking.there was also significant expert testimony,however,that related specifically to boerner case and the pall mall brand.peter marvin,boerner treating physician,testified that she died from the effects of cigarette smoke,and marvin blinder testified that she was addicted to pall mall cigarettes because of their nicotine content,which resulted in her cancer.additionally,other evidence indicated that pall mall cigarettes had higher levels of carcinogenic tar than any other brand and that reduction of tar intake by smoking low tar cigarettes could have reduced the health risks associated with smoking.similarly,the evidence indicated that pall mall cigarettes lacked effective filter technology,which would have reduced the level of carcinogenic tar inhaled into the lungs.indeed,there was evidence that pall mall cigarettes utilized a tobacco filter that actually increased the amount of tar taken into the body.finally,boerner stated in her deposition testimony that she did not fully appreciate the extent of the potential health risks associated with smoking.this evidence was sufficient to provide a reasonable basis for the following findings by the jury pall mall cigarettes were in a defective condition due to faulty design the faulty design resulted in excessively high levels of carcinogens being introduced into boerner lungs the defective condition yielded the paul mall cigarettes unreasonably dangerous and the defective condition proximately caused boerner illness and death.accordingly,we reject b w contention that boerner evidence constituted only a,categorical attack on cigarettes.
next,b w argues that it is entitled to judgment because,as a matter of law,pall mall cigarettes could not be unreasonably dangerous following the enactment of the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act labeling act,et as currently codified.b w contends that the labeling act established the standard for notice to consumers of the dangerousness of cigarettes,with the result that any finding that a cigarette dangerousness exceeded the required warning would be preempted by the act.once congress has regulated aspects of the design,manufacture,or sale of a product,the doctrine of conflict preemption,including implied preemption,forecloses claims premised on such regulated aspects.where there is an actual conflict between a state law cause of action and congress express policy,state law must give way under the supremacy clause.geier american honda motor,d holding that a design defect claim based solely on a car lack of an air bag was preempted because congress provided manufacturers with the option of installing air bags or other passive safety devices.boerner argues that the doctrine is inapplicable here because congress has expressed an intent through the labeling act to preempt only those state law claims related to advertising or promotion and not those based upon design defects.cipollone liggett group,d.

we turn next to b w contention that the district court erroneously admitted four reports of the surgeon general pursuant to the public records exception to the hearsay rule.b w maintains that the reports were inadmissible because their conclusions were not based on the independent investigation of a federal agency.in the alternative,b w contends that the reports should have been ruled inadmissible under.because they were based on information that was not specific to the pall mall brand or to boerner particular illness,and because b w had no opportunity to the reports authors.
we review for abuse of discretion a district court decision to admit evidence,bergfeld unimin,cir,and we conclude that the reports were properly admitted under the public records exception,inasmuch as they were prepared pursuant to a legal obligation.for instance,the report was prepared in response to congress charge in public law to report new and current information on smoking and health to the congress.the reports also include factual findings,although these were made by independent scientists and not on the basis of independent research by the surgeon general.we have held,however,that similar reports based on research were properly admitted under the public records exception.see,kehm proctor gamble,cir see also jones,at assuming the admissibility of a report of the surgeon general entitled preventing tobacco use amongst young people.once the evaluative report is shown to have been required by law and to have included factual findings,the burden is on the party opposing admission to demonstrate untrustworthiness.kehm,at.as to trustworthiness,we noted in kehm that the author unavailability for does not render the report inadmissible,for the fact that a report was prepared by a disinterested governmental agency pursuant to a legal obligation constitutes a badge of trustworthiness.id.b w has made no affirmative showing that the reports are untrustworthy.the reports are final and thus are distinguishable from those at issue in a number of cases cited by b see,brown sierra nevada memorial miners hospital,cir.
we turn to b w challenge to the district court award of punitive damages.b w proposes four bases for reversal of the award.first,b w challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to warrant a punitive damages charge.we review de novo the district court decision to instruct the jury on punitive damages.carpenter auto.club interinsurance,cir.such a charge should not be submitted to the jury unless there is substantial evidence supporting the claim that the conduct was malicious or done with the deliberate intent to injure another,ellis price,or was done with a wanton and conscious disregard for the rights and safety of others.dalrymple fields.there was ample evidence adduced at trial to show that american tobacco was aware,as early as the and,that cigarette smoke contained carcinogens,that cigarette smoke contained nicotine,that the risk of cancer increased with the amount of exposure to carcinogens,that the risk of cancer could be reduced by the use of effective filter technology,and that nicotine addiction increased the likelihood of increased exposure to carcinogens.despite this knowledge,the evidence indicates that american tobacco manufactured,marketed,and sold pall mall cigarettes containing excessively high levels of carcinogenic tar and lacking effective filter technology,for and in the state of arkansas untruthfully represented that pall mall cigarettes were not unhealthy untruthfully represented that cigarette smoking did not cause cancer and actively attempted to suppress research into the harmful health consequences of cigarette smoking.the jury could reasonably have determined,based on this evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom,that american tobacco acted with a conscious disregard for the safety of others.accordingly,the district court did not err in finding that the evidence justified submitting the punitive damages claim to the jury.
second,b w argues that it should not be liable for american tobacco conduct.arkansas law,however,provides that the successor entity after a merger takes on all the liabilities of the predecessor companies.ann.b.
third,b w contends that a punitive damages award in this case would not advance the policy objectives underlying the rule allowing for punitive damages and is therefore inappropriate.to support this contention,b w argues as follows the purpose of punitive damages is to punish the wrongdoer the wrongdoer no longer exists in this case and no individuals who were in leadership positions at american tobacco are in similar positions at b w and,accordingly,that there is no wrongdoer to punish.we are not persuaded.punishment is only one of the policies underlying punitive damages.deterrence is another.see state farm mut.auto.ins.campbell,d p unitive damages serve a broader function than compensatory damages they are aimed at deterrence and retribution bmw of north america,gore,d punitive damages may properly be imposed to further a state legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and deterring its repetition.under arkansas law,a punitive damages award serves not only to deter similar conduct on the part of the particular tortfeasor,but also others who might be inclined to engage in such conduct.robertson oil phillips petroleum,cir en banc quoting ray dodge,moore.because b w and other companies similar to it are still in the business of making and selling cigarettes,there is deterrent value in the punitive damages award.
fourth,b w argues that the amount of the award is excessive and therefore violative of state law and federal due process guarantees.under arkansas law,the question is whether the award is so great as to shock the conscience of this court or to demonstrate passion or prejudice on the part of the trier of fact.routh wrecker service,washington.because the arkansas courts employ the united states supreme court due process analysis,we conflate both state and federal review.stogsdill healthmark partners,cir.
the supreme court has provided three guideposts for due process review of the amount of a punitive damages award the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant conduct the disparity between actual or potential harm suffered and the punitive damages award often stated as a ratio between the amount of the compensatory damages award and the punitive damages award and the difference between the punitive damages award and the civil penalties authorized in comparable cases.gore,at.b w argues that there is no evidence of reprehensibility,that the award does not bear a reasonable relationship to the compensatory damages,and that the million award is vastly greater than the possible penalty for a violation of the labeling act.boerner responds that b w conduct was particularly reprehensible it resulted in physical harm evinced indifference to the health and safety of others involved repeated incidents and was the result of deceit illustrated by american tobacco efforts to stifle research and publication as well as its officers practice of making public statements contending that smoking was not a health risk.second,he argues that the than to well within the acceptable range established by the supreme court.third,boerner argues that the labeling act penalty provision is inapplicable because the jury did not base its award on a failure to warn.he instead cites as a more apt comparison the potential financial consequences of an injunction barring further sale of the defective product.
the degree of reprehensibility is the most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award.state farm,at.quoting gore,at.the evidence at trial indicated that american tobacco conduct was highly reprehensible pall mall cigarettes were extremely carcinogenic and extremely more so than other types of cigarettes the sale of this defective product occurred repeatedly over the course of many years despite american tobacco knowledge that the product was dangerous to the user health and american tobacco actively misled consumers about the health risks associated with smoking.moreover,the reprehensible conduct was shown to relate directly to the harm suffered by boerner a most painful,lingering death following extensive surgery.
in light of the second gore guidepost,however,we conclude that the punitive damages award is excessive when measured against the substantial compensatory damages award.though the supreme court has been reluctant to identify concrete constitutional limits on the ratio between harm to the plaintiff and the punitive damages award,id.at,it has identified a circumstance in which caution is required when compensatory damages are substantial,then a lesser ratio,perhaps only equal to compensatory damages,can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee.id.at.as the supreme court noted in gore,there is no simple mathematical formula that marks the constitutional line.at.see also state farm,at.w e decline again to impose a ratio which a punitive damages award can not exceed.notwithstanding the absence of a simple formula or ratio,the general contours of our past decisions lead to the conclusion that a low ratio is called for here.see williams conagra poultry,cir remitting the punitive damages award to an amount equal to the compensatory damages award of stogsdill,at approving a ratio of compensatory damages to punitive damages as an upper limit where the compensatory award was morse southern union,cir upholding close to a ratio where the compensatory award was only.
factors that justify a higher ratio,such as the presence of an injury that is hard to detect or a particularly egregious act that has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages,are absent here.see gore,at.we also note that,despite evidence that american tobacco exhibited a callous disregard for the adverse health consequences of smoking,there is no evidence that anyone at american tobacco intended to victimize its customers.eden electrical,amana,cir affirming an award of punitive damages approximately times greater than the compensatory damages award where the defendant had devised a scheme of fraud and evinced an intent to f and kill the plaintiff business.
accordingly,given the compensatory damages award in this case,we conclude that a ratio of approximately would comport with the requirements of due process.thus,we conclude that the punitive damages award must be remitted from million to million.
finally,we consider b w argument that the district court jury instructions were erroneous.we review a district court decisions on jury instructions for abuse of discretion,looking to the instructions as a whole to determine whether they fairly submitted the issues to the jury.brown sandals resorts,cir.b w argues that by failing to instruct the jury that it could consider only the harm to boerner and b w conduct in arkansas,the district court violated the supreme court requirement in state farm that a jury must be instructed that it may not use evidence of conduct to punish a defendant for action that was lawful in the jurisdiction where it occurred.at.we conclude that the district court instructions properly limited the jury inquiry to only those facts relevant to boerner claimed injuries,which had the practical effect of preventing the jury from punishing b w for conduct unrelated to his claims additionally,there is no indication in the record that b w conduct would have been lawful elsewhere,so we need not be concerned with the possibility that b w was punished for conduct that would have been legal where it occurred.
we conditionally affirm the judgment entered on the verdict,subject to boerner acceptance of a remittitur judgment on the punitive damages award in the amount of million.absent his acceptance of the remittitur,we reverse and remand for a new trial on the claim for punitive damages.
i concur in affirming the district court with the condition boerner accept a remittitur on the punitive damage award.because i reach such result on different grounds,i write separately to explain my position.
i disagree with the court analysis regarding the excessiveness of this punitive damage award.in eden electrical,amana,cir,we affirmed a punitive damage award approximately times greater than the compensatory damage award,despite the substantiality of the latter.to be sure,eden ratio may crowd constitutional limits.see state farm mut.auto.ins.campbell,d when compensatory damages are substantial,then a lesser ratio,perhaps only equal to compensatory damages,can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee.but it does not exceed the ratio the supreme court has intimated as setting the constitutional limit for all cases,save those where a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages or where the injury is hard to detect or the monetary value of noneconomic harm may have been difficult to determine,id.quoting bmw of,gore,d,and we justified the ratio in eden because the case involved an extraordinarily reprehensible scheme to defraud.eden,at.
here,the ratio between compensatory and punitive damages is less than four to one,and i have trouble reconciling a reduction in this award with our affirmance in eden.the court distinguishes eden on the grounds amana intended to victimize eden,while american tobacco merely exhibited a callous disregard for the adverse health consequences of smoking.ante at.i find the rationale less than satisfying.eden inv
