this case concerns the department of energy doe or the government breach of its obligation to accept spent nuclear fuel from the nation nuclear power utilities.liability is not at issue.the parties dispute various aspects of the court of federal claims damages award.
first,the government contends that the trial court erred in awarding damages based on testimony that absent breach,the plaintiff would have successfully bargained its way to the front of doe fuel acceptance queue and would have transferred away all spent nuclear fuel in the first year of performance.relatedly,dairyland the amount of damages award,contending that the trial court erred in reducing the damages awarded by the cost of purchasing the exchange.second,the government argues that the trial court erred in awarding the plaintiff damages to compensate for various indirect overhead costs it claims were caused by the breach.third,the government contests the trial court award of plaintiff investment in an industry consortium to build a private spent fuel storage facility,particularly because,the government points out,plaintiff received significant equity in the venture for its investment.see generally dairyland power coop.united states,fed.cl.trial op.
we hold that the court of federal claims did not commit reversible error in three of these four issues.we therefore affirm the award of damages based on plaintiff exchange model and the award of indirect costs,as well as the discounting of plaintiff damages.regarding the plaintiff investment in a private venture to build a spent fuel storage facility,we hold that the court was required to only award the cost of that investment to the extent it was made for mitigation,and not as a speculative venture for profit.we vacate the award of damages for the investment in the private fuel storage venture,and we remand for determination of the extent to which the investment was mitigation and the extent if any to which it was speculation.
background 
this appeal,like a number of others recently before or pending with this court,concerns the government liability for damages in connection with its failure to develop a permanent solution for the storage of spent nuclear fuel snf from to,plaintiff dairyland power cooperative dairyland operated a nuclear power plant in genoa,wisconsin called the la crosse boiling water reactor.the reactor is no longer active,but dairyland maintains metric tons of spent uranium there in a wet storage pool.the fact that there is snf stored prevents dairyland from permanently decommissioning the la crosse plant.
in dairyland,along with the nation other operating nuclear utilities,entered into a contract with the department of energy doe to address the question of what to do with snf.see standard contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel high level radioactive waste,standard contract.the standard contract obliged doe to accept possession of and title to the signatory utilities snf no later than january.id.art.ii.doe had a mandate from congress to take responsibility for storage of contract holders snf.see generally nuclear waste policy act of,et.
the standard contract provided that doe would accept a certain amount of snf from various utilities each year until all the snf from all the signatory utilities had been removed.standard contract,art.ii.while the contract did not set forth a detailed schedule for this removal,it stated generally that acceptance priority rankings would be assigned based on the date of discharge of such material,snf from the civilian nuclear power reactor,sec.a.this became known as the oldest fuel first priority ranking.the standard contract required doe to issue an annual capacity report acr that would project in a more detailed fashion doe acceptance of snf from the utilities,sec.b.
the schedules on which doe would accept spent fuel from the utilities were known as delivery commitment schedules.see standard contract,sec.the standard contract permitted the utilities to negotiate with each other to adjust the delivery commitment schedules proposed by doe 
purchaser,the utility shall have the right to determine which snf hlw radioactive waste is delivered to doe provided,however,that purchaser shall comply with the requirements of this contract.purchaser shall have the right to exchange approved delivery commitment schedules with parties to other contracts with doe for disposal of snf hlw provided,however,that doe shall,in advance,have the right to approve or disapprove,in its sole discretion,any such exchanges 
doe was unable to meet its contractual obligation to take possession of the utilities snf by january,and as a result,partially breached the standard contract.pac.gas united states.due to doe breach,dairyland has had to maintain the metric tons of snf in its wet storage pool.had doe performed,the parties agree that,based on the acr,the last of the snf at the la crosse plant would have been removed in late early.trial,fed.cl.at.the cost of maintaining the snf,according to dairyland estimate,is about million along with approximately milhon in general overhead costs.
dairyland also sought a solution for storing snf.it became associated with a venture to privately develop an snf repository known as private fuel storage,llc pfs.pfs was formed by a consortium of eleven nuclear utilities dairyland included in order to locate,license,build,and operate such a facility.dairyland decided to become a shareholder in pfs as a means of sharing with other nuclear operators the cost associated with such a project.
dairyland structured its participation in pfs as fouows.in,it set up genoa fuel tech,gft as a subsidiary incorporated in wisconsin.this permitted dairyland to avoid potential legal liability and unfavorable tax treatment associated with its investment in pfs.see trial,fed.cl.at.dairyland contributed about milhon into gft,which gft then invested in pfs in exchange for shares.dairyland also incurred about million in various other costs to support gft,most of which were administrative expenses.dairyland also allocated about million in general and administrative overhead costs to its involvement with gft and pfs.
dairyland sued for breach of contract in the court of federal claims in january.the court entered summary judgment of habihty.dairyland power coop.united states,dkt,unreported citing energy nw.united states,fed.cl.the case proceeded to damages.
shortly before trial,the court denied the government plea for summary judgment that dairyland could not recover damages for its investment in pfs.dairyland power coop.united states,fed.cl.july,sj denial.it held a bench trial,and awarded dairyland about million.trial,fed.cl.at.the award included roughly milhon for dairyland cost of maintaining snf from late to and roughly million for its investment in pfs.about million of the award was for various overhead costs associated with dairyland mitigation

b.the court of federal claims committed no error in adopting dairyland exchanges model 
several of the issues on appeal concern the trial court award of damages for dairyland cost of snf maintenance from the end of to the close of damages,december.see trial,fed.cl.at.
as discussed,there is no dispute that,under the oldest fuel first rubric of the standard contract,dairyland was not entitled to have the last of its fuel removed until.nevertheless,the court of federal claims awarded damages for dairyland storage costs from to because it credited dairyland evidence that it would have participated in exchanges to eliminate au of its snf in.trial,fed.cl.at.this had the effect of making all dairyland costs from that time to the end of the damages period recoverable.
the court holding for dairyland in this respect was largely based on dairyland argument that an exchanges market would have existed.dairyland presented legal argument and fact and expert testimony that,had the government not breached,utilities who believed their delivery commitment schedules were unacceptably late would have negotiated with those who held delivery commitments.this exchanges market did not actually emerge because the government breached,but dairyland contended that it was a foreseeable aspect of the world,pointing particularly to the standard contract exchanges provision.standard contract,sec.dairyland expert modeled this market,and opined that dairyland would have successfully bargained with the other utilities for acceptance of all dairyland snf,doe would have removed of dairyland tons of snf by the end of.dairyland expert also testified that dairyland,as a shutdown reactor with a small amount of snf,would have been willing to pay among the most for each ton of acceptance allocations.trial,fed.cl.at.the trial court agreed,and so computed dairyland damages as covering the period from late to.
on appeal,the government argues that the trial court award was clearly erroneous.the government cites a number of alleged deficiencies.for example,the government complains that dairyland did not identify the specific utilities it would have obtained delivery commitment schedules from.the government also argues that local communities might have pressured utilities having delivery commitment schedules to use those schedule slots themselves and so remove waste from the area,and that dairyland proof fails to take this pressure into account.the government also contends that dairyland proof ignores the possibility that utilities having delivery commitment schedules might try to extract high prices for them.the government argues that the court award fails to reflect such motivations by the seller utilities.and the government argues that dairyland did not put forward sufficient evidence of any intent to press for early removal of snf from the la crosse plant.the government views these purported deficiencies as undermining dairyland case to the point that it was clear error for the court of federal claims to credit dairyland evidence and argument,and to hold that snf storage costs from late through the end of the damages period were recoverable.
this court reviews the factual findings of the court of federal claims only for clear error.the trial court opinion discusses in detail the evidence presented by dairyland,as well as the government arguments in opposition.the court viewed the government as essentially pointing out possible problems with dairyland proof,but without showing how those problems could be resolved or that they affected the outcome of the analysis.rather than undermining dairyland case,the government proffer was deemed not particularly helpful to the court.trial,fed.cl.at.we find no error in this conclusion,as it appears to have been grounded in proper weighing of the evidence.
concerning,for example,the government complaint that dairyland failed to identify specific utilities with whom it would contract for accelerated delivery commitment schedules,the court concluded that,even assuming some utilities refused to contract,the government did not make any showing that this would have substantially affected graves dairyland expert witness conclusions.id.at.the government has pointed to nothing in the record to reveal clear error in this conclusion.
concerning the government argument that dairyland had not shown intent to exchange for earlier acceptance,the court noted that dairyland and the doe had taken some steps in the direction of setting up a market for exchanges.id.at.the court noted the government complaint and stated that evidence of actual negotiation would certainly have strengthened dairyland claim,but cited other evidence put forward by dairyland as convincing evidence of its preexisting interest in utilizing the exchanges process.id.again,the government arguments on appeal do not demonstrate clear error in the trial court reasoning.
as to the government contention that local politics would have prevented utilities possessing delivery commitment schedules from bargaining,after review of the record we find no basis for concluding that such considerations should have barred the trial court findings.the government main evidence for this contention,testimonial suggestions that local politics would have been a factor in negotiations over delivery commitment schedules,was before the court and,in our view,properly weighed.we therefore defer to the trial court in its determination that the evidence of dairyland ability to negotiate for delivery commitment schedules was sufficient to prove the issue.
in a related vein,the government also contends that the model proposed by dairyland was too speculative to be the basis of a damages award.the government points particularly to dairyland claim that,once dairyland had completed negotiations for delivery commitment schedules for all its snf,doe would have approved the transaction.see standard contract,sec.citing this court precedent,the government contends that this is a step too far in the modeling of hypothetical behavior,and argues that there is no certainty at all as to whether doe would or would not have approved the transaction.appellant br.citing san carlos irrigation drainage dist.united states.certainly the standard contract reserves to doe the right to disapprove any proposed exchange of delivery commitment schedules,in its sole discretion.id.the government further points out that some of the snf at the la crosse plant is failed fuel,and argues that doe might have been reticent to accelerate its removal 
the question of whether dairyland model is or is not too speculative to be reliable is,again,a fact issue on which we owe deference to the court of federal claims.that court opinion demonstrates that it considered the government arguments and found them unpersuasive.trial,fed.cl.at.the evidence highlighted by the government on appeal does not demonstrate clear error.while considerations such as doe discretion to approve such transactions and worries about the presence of failed fuel are certainly relevant,they are not overriding concerns sufficient to make the court finding clearly erroneous.
san carlos irrigation is consistent with our reasoning.there,as here,this court affirmed the trial judge finding on whether certain claimed damages were too speculative to be awarded.in that case,the trial judge had denied a plaintiff attempt to recover the value of water it would have received if the government had not breached and if there had been an excess of water in that year and if the government had elected to designate part of that excess surplus and convey it to the plaintiff.san carlos irrigation,at.this court affirmed albeit on slightly different grounds than the trial court,and stated,too many contingencies including,most importantly,the discretion of the agency to dispose of excess water exist in the causal chain.id.at.
as this court found no error in the denial of damages in san carlos irrigation,we find no error in the damages award here.if anything,san carlos irrigation reminds us that the question of whether the causal chain is sufficiently is one of fact,to be made in the first instance by the trial judge and reversed by this court only for clear error.as that circumstance is not presented here,we affirm the trial court determination that dairyland was entitled to damages for its storage of snf for the entire period from to.
c.the court of federal claims committed no error in offsetting dairyland snf maintenance award to account for the cost of exchanges 
we next turn to dairyland and examine the trial court limitation of awarded damages.dairyland asked the trial court to award it to recover its snf storage costs.though adopting most of dairyland methodology for computing snf storage damages,the trial court disagreed that the full amount should be awarded.instead,the court awarded dairyland precisely half.trial,fed.cl.at.
the reason was that although dairyland damages proof relied on the premise that dairyland would negotiate for delivery commitments,the million figure did not account for the cost of those commitments.id.at.the court noted that acquiring delivery commitments would confer great benefits to dairyland.it reasoned that the sellers utilities holding delivery commitments would know their value 
the court is convinced that all utilities would have assigned significant value to their allocations,and would have behaved as sophisticated and negotiators.buyers would only have induced sellers to part with their allocations by offering to share the benefits of such a bargain.thus,as neuberger the government expert testified,you could have situations resulting in any price,up to and including the willingness to pay amounts.both buyers and sellers would have come to the negotiating table demanding no less than a fair share of the benefits of the bargain.
id.at second alteration in original citation omitted.
dairyland argued that if the cost of these allocations were to be taken into account,it should be about million.citing trial testimony,the trial court rejected that figure as requir ing substantial upward adjustment.id.it reasoned that the buyer and the seller of the delivery commitment would split the benefits evenly,and the cost of the commitments would be exactly half their value to dairyland.it wrote,the court wiu offset dairyland safstor,snf maintenance damages by that amount,half and award dairyland the other half,or.id.at.
on appeal,dairyland presents two arguments attacking this conclusion,one contending that there was legal error and one that there was factual error.
first,dairyland argues for legal error because it views the cost of the delivery commitments as a cost only deferred by the government breach,and not avoided.dairyland argues that,while a party recovery can in some cases be offset to account for costs it avoided because of the breach,it is inappropriate to offset for costs that are not avoided but only deferred.see carolina power,at.it argues that the government breach merely deferred dairyland cost of accelerating acceptance,reasoning that when the government ultimately performs,dairyland will have to negotiate again for delivery commitments from the other utilities.
the trial court disagreed,and so do we.see denial of,slip op.at.the cost of accelerating acceptance in is not one that will necessarily recur when and if the government eventually performs.the former is a past cost that,as has now been established,would have occurred in the absence of breach.the latter is an elective future cost that dairyland might or might not take up,depending on its situation.the trial court did not find that dairyland will in the future be saddled with this cost,and we see no error there.carolina power properly urges caution when speculating about the future in a case of partial breach usually,the proper approach is to wait for those events to actually occur,and to resist premature conclusions.energy,slip op.at citing carolina power,at.we therefore hold that there was no error of law in the trial court treatment of dairyland damages request.
dairyland next argues that there was an error of fact,and that the million reduction in its award was excessive and based on a misinterpretation of the evidence.on factual questions,we defer to the trial court absent clear error.dairyland points to its expert testimonial opinion that the exchanges market was one with multiple sellers,which would essentially compete with one another to sell their allocations to dairyland.cross appellant br.it argues that this negotiation would bring the final price of delivery commitment schedules to something near the marginal bid price which,in dairyland view,was dramatically lower than million.
in a similar line,dairyland argues that the court misinterpreted a statement by its expert that the cost of exchanges could have ranged as high as million.cross appellant br.dairyland argues that this testimony was limited to a damages analysis not applicable in this case dairyland also complains that to the extent there was any uncertainty about the amount dairyland would have had to pay to accelerate snf acceptance,that uncertainty should be resolved against the government.
the trial court order denying reconsideration addresses each of these arguments.denial of,slip op.at.on review,we do not find clear error in the court treatment of any of them.on the question of whether the presence of multiple sellers would drive down the price,the court noted that there were also multiple buyers,whose presence in the market dairyland expert had not sufficiently addressed.concerning the testimony of dairyland expert,the court confirmed that its holding applied the appropriate acr and gave proper weight to the expert opinion.and the court rejected dairyland implication that the government had failed to carry any burden of proof properly assigned to it.in the court view,the evidence allowed it to fashion a fair damages award with reasonable certainty.id.at.that award was the million award now on appeal.
this court affords the court of federal claims wide discretion in assessing an appropriate quantum of damages.carolina power,at.as the primary finder of fact,part of the trial court role is to fashion a fair assignment of responsibility even where,as here,the solution departs from the specific relief requested by either party.because we find no error to justify departing from the outcome the court has reached,we affirm its reduction of dairyland award.
d.the court of federal claims committed no error in awarding overhead and g a costs 
the government also argues that the trial court erred in including within its damages award indirect overhead and g a costs incurred by dairyland in support of its activities.appellant br.
the trial court based its award of overhead damages on testimony that analyzed dairyland accounts and determined the portion of its overhead expenses attributable to the breach.trial,fed.cl.at.the court accepted this as a foundation sufficient to award overhead and g a costs to plaintiff.id.the government disputes this holding.it argues that dairyland failed to show that these costs were actually caused by the government breach,and suggests that the costs at least some portion of them would have been incurred absent breach.it points out that dairyland offered the trial court only a post hoc computation of its overhead and g a costs dairyland does not allocate such costs during the normal course of business.the government also recites various cost categories which,in its view,should not have been included in the computation,such as costs associated with dairyland performance administration,plant operations,integrated planning,marketing and development,procurement,and headquarters cafeteria cost centers,management and other administrative tasks supporting dairyland as a whole and interest and depreciation on dairyland headquarters facility.appellant br.
it is that a plaintiff is entitled to recover costs actually caused by the defendant breach.energy,slip op.at citing.power,at.the government argues that dairyland failed to prove causation the trial court disagreed.in matters concerning the sufficiency of proof on such a question,we defer to the judgment of the trial court absent clear error.here,the court agreed with dairyland that these expenses represented resources that are consumed because of the consumption of breach related activities.trial,fed.ci.at quoting dairyland expert witness.in other words,to execute on its mitigation activities,dairyland provided its employees a variety of overhead services.to award a portion of those expenses attributable to the breach was consistent with this court precedent,and we see no error in the court acceptance of dairyland evidence.see energy,slip op.at affirming award of
