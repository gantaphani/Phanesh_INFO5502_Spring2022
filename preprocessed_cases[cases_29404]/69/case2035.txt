in,in response to charges of rampant mishandling of insurance claims arising out of the northridge earthquake of,the legislature enacted code of civil procedure section section,which revived certain previously insurance claims.in century ins.superior court th,d,we concluded the statute revived not only contract claims,but also tort claims for bad faith.we also concluded the revival statute did not destroy vested rights in violation of the due process clause.
plaintiffs and real parties in interest james and jobeth schwartz plaintiffs filed an action against century insurance company century alleging claims for damages arising out of the northridge earthquake.their complaint alleged causes of action for breach of contract and bad faith.they sought punitive damages incident to their cause of action for bad faith.century moved for summary adjudication of the claim for punitive damages,on the basis that revival of a claim for punitive damages violates the ex post facto clause of the united states constitution.the motion was denied.century sought review by petition for writ of mandate.
we issued an order to show cause.we hold that punitive damages are not sufficiently penal in intent or effect to trigger the protection of the ex post facto clause.we therefore deny the petition.
factual and procedural background 
the facts are not in dispute.plaintiffs were insured by century,and pursued an insurance claim for damages arising out of the northridge earthquake.the claim was denied.in,the legislature enacted section,reviving,for one year,previously civil actions against insurers arising out of the northridge earthquake.taking advantage of this statute,plaintiffs filed their complaint against century on december,alleging breach of contract and bad faith.the case was assigned to the complex litigation department of the los angeles superior court.
the trial judge presiding over this case was also presiding over several similar northridge earthquake insurance lawsuits.in one such suit,basurco century insurance company,los angeles superior court,no.bc,defendant century moved for summary adjudication of the claim for punitive damages,on the basis that the revival of such a claim violated the ex post facto clause of the united states constitution.the trial court denied the motion in the basurco action,concluding that the statutory revival of punitive damages was not an ex post facto law.
the parties in this action then agreed that the decision in basurco would apply to this case,and stipulated to entry of an order denying summary adjudication of the issue.century sought writ relief 
contentions of the parties 
the sole question presented is whether section violates the federal constitution prohibition against ex post facto laws to the extent it revives previously claims for punitive damages incident to causes of action for bad faith.century argues that it is unconstitutional,on the basis that revival of a criminal prosecution is an ex post facto violation,and punitive damages are akin to criminal penalties for purposes of ex post facto analysis.alternatively,century argues we should avoid the constitutional issue by simply construing section as not reviving liability for punitive damages.plaintiffs argue that section does not violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws,because that prohibition applies exclusively to penal legislation,while this statute is entirely civil in nature.
discussion 
general principles of ex post facto analysis 
article i,section of the united states constitution prohibits states from enacting any ex post facto law.o ur best knowledge of the original understanding of the ex post facto clause is that legislatures may not retroactively alter the definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal acts.collins youngblood,d.a statute which revives an otherwise criminal prosecution violates the ex post facto clause.stogner california,d.the ex post facto clause has been interpreted to pertain exclusively to penal statutes.kansas hendricks,d.
many other constitutional provisions also apply only to penal laws,such as the prohibition against double jeopardy,hudson united states,d and the fifth and sixth amendment rights granted criminal defendants,kennedy,d.while it is well established that only penal laws are subject to the restrictions of the ex post facto clause,the prohibition against double jeopardy,and the procedural protections afforded criminal defendants,the united states supreme court has acknowledged the possibility that a statute which is facially civil may in fact be penal enough in effect to trigger these constitutional protections,supra,at.
it is on this narrow ground that century bases its challenge to section.century argues that,to the extent that section revives a claim for punitive damages incident to a bad faith cause of action,the statute is penal and therefore violates the ex post facto clause.
the united states supreme court has never directly addressed the issue of whether punitive damages are penal for the purposes of ex post facto analysis.it has,however,acknowledged that the retroactive application of punitive damages would raise a serious constitutional question,without answering that question.landgraf usi film products,d.the landgraf court was concerned with whether to interpret a statute,allowing for punitive damages,retroactively.in the absence of a clear congressional intent that the statute be applied retroactively,and the presence of a serious constitutional question if the statute were so interpreted,the supreme court chose to interpret the statute prospectively only.id.at.in contrast,section is necessarily retroactive in application its entire purpose is to revive causes of action otherwise.as such,we decline century invitation to construe the statute to avoid the constitutional question.section is,by its terms,retroactive.we have already held that it applies to causes of action for bad faith,and punitive damages are incidental to such causes of action on proof of the requisite state of mind,section.the question of whether section violates the ex post facto clause is squarely presented.
controlling california authority has held punitive damages are not penal for ex post facto purposes 
in peterson superior court cal d,the california supreme court considered whether to give retroactive effect to a judicial decision holding punitive damages could be recovered from a drunk driver.the court applied the decision retroactively,rejecting the defendant contention that the principles underlying the ex post facto clause prohibited retroactive application.id.at.the court concluded that,since the ex post facto prohibition applies to criminal,not civil,statutes,there was no ex post facto problem.id.at.the court stated,the potential punitive damages award in this case is unquestionably a penalty civil in nature.there is no possibility of the stigma of a criminal conviction nor the potential loss of personal freedom.thus,although the award of punitive damages is a type of penalty imposed to deter wrongful conduct,t he authorization to award exemplary damages does not convert a civil action into a criminal action insofar as it affects constitutional protections in criminal proceedings.id.at.
century contends peterson is inapplicable because it considered the retroactivity of a judicial opinion while the ex post facto clause is concerned only with the retroactivity of statutes.in our view,this distinction is not relevant since whatever the factual context of the court analysis,it is clear that the supreme court held that punitive damages are a civil penalty not subject to the ex post facto prohibition.that holding would appear to be binding on us.
nonetheless,dictum in recent california supreme court authority suggests the possibility it might be willing to reconsider what it said in peterson.in myers philip morris companies,cal th,d,the court considered whether the repeal of a statutory immunity was to be given retroactive application so as to subject the defendant to liability for conduct which,at the time it occurred,was immunized.in the absence of clear legislative intent to apply the repealing statute retroactively,the court gave it prospective application only.id.at,d.additionally,the court,citing landgraf,noted that the retroactive imposition of punitive damages might violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws and considered avoidance of the constitutional issue to be an additional reason to construe the statute prospectively only.id.at,d.myers did not consider or overrule peterson,and we therefore still follow that decision.nonetheless,myers citation of landgraf suggests our supreme court might not consider peterson to be wholly dispositive in light of intervening united states supreme court authority thus,while we follow peterson,we will proceed to consider the issue as though peterson were not controlling.
section is a civil statute and is not penal in nature 
a.the test 
the ex post facto clause prohibits only ex post facto penal legislation.in determining whether a facially civil statute is penal for these purposes,there is a well established framework for our inquiry.smith doe,d.this framework is applicable not only to ex post facto analysis,but also to whether a statute is penal for purposes of double jeopardy see united states ursery,d and fifth and sixth amendment rights see united states.ward,d,among others smith doe,supra,at.noting the test origins are in sixth and eighth amendment jurisprudence,as well as bill of attainder and ex post facto cases.
t he question whether a particular statutorily defined penalty is civil or criminal is a matter of statutory construction.citations.our inquiry in this regard has traditionally proceeded on two levels.first,we have set out to determine whether the legislature,in establishing the penalizing mechanism,indicated either expressly or impliedly a preference for one label or the other.citation.second,where the legislature has indicated an intention to establish a civil penalty,we have inquired further whether the statutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate that intention.citation.in regard to this latter inquiry,we have noted that only the clearest proof could suffice to establish the unconstitutionality of a statute on such a ground.citations.united states ward,supra,at.see also kansas hendricks,supra,at.
the language used by the supreme court in describing the test is,by necessity,somewhat imprecise.for example,smith describes the intent portion of the test by saying,if the intention of the legislature was to impose punishment,the statute is to be considered penal for constitutional purposes.smith doe,supra,at,emphasis added.yet the supreme court has long recognized that the double jeopardy clause does not prohibit the imposition of all additional sanctions that could,in common parlance,be described as punishment.citations.the clause protects only against the imposition of multiple criminal punishments for the same offense.hudson united states,supra,at.as made clear in ward,the intent inquiry is whether the statute was intended to establish a civil penalty or a criminal one.united states ward,supra,at.similarly,while the supreme court has sometimes used the shorthand phrase of determining whether a facially civil statute constitute s punishment,united states ursery,supra,at,the court has recognized that the true inquiry is whether the statute is so punitive in form and effect as to render it criminal.id.at.
any suggestion,therefore,that punitive damages must fail the test simply because they are punitive,is an oversimplification.we must determine whether they are so punitive in form and effect as be considered criminal for constitutional purposes.
b.the legislative intent was that the statute be civil 
the first step of the inquiry is to determine whether the legislature intended to establish civil proceedings.in considering the legislature intent,we are to give considerable deference to the stated intent of the legislature.smith doe,supra,at.we should also consider the procedural mechanisms established by the statute for enforcing the alleged penalty.united states ursery,supra,at.we may also consider the manner of the statute codification.smith doe,supra,at.
century does not contend section as a whole violates the ex post facto clause its challenge is limited to that portion of section which revives claims for punitive damages incident to bad faith causes of action.putting it another way,century seeks a determination of the criminal or civil nature of punitive damages under section in general.
california statutory provisions providing for the recovery of punitive damages were intended to establish civil proceedings.punitive damages are provided for in the civil code,not the penal code.they are enforced by civil actions.we can conceive of no stronger indication that a statute was intended to establish civil proceedings than that it,in fact,established civil proceedings.
section,allowing civil tort plaintiffs to recover punitive damages when certain findings have been made,intended to establish civil,not criminal,proceedings.
c.the relevant factors to be considered 
once the legislative intent has been determined to be civil,we then consider whether the challenged statute is so punitive in purpose or effect as to outweigh the legislature intent.only the clearest proof will suffice to override the legislature stated intent and render a nominally civil statute penal for ex post facto purposes.smith doe,supra,at.
we consider the seven factors originally set forth in,supra,at.the factors are neither exhaustive nor dispositive but useful guideposts.smith doe,supra,at page.they are w hether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint,whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment,whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter,whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of and deterrence,whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime,whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it,and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned,supra,at,fns.omitted.
to this nonexhaustive list of factors,we add an eighth factor whether the sanction is imposed by means of government action.we believe the addition of this factor is mandated by case law.the cases on which relied in compiling its list of factors all involved government action thus,the issue of whether the absence of government enforcement was significant was not before the court.however,when the supreme court has considered statutes implicating private litigation,it has been quick to note that the absence of government action prevents the statute from being held criminal for constitutional purposes the protections of the double jeopardy clause are not triggered by litigation between private parties.united states halper,d,abrogated on another ground by hudson united states,supra,at.industries kelco disposal,d holding eighth amendment prohibition against excessive fines does not apply to punitive damages as that clause does not constrain an award of money damages in a civil suit when the government neither has prosecuted the action nor has any right to receive a share of the damages awarded.
as the effects portion of the test is geared toward determining whether a facially civil statute is so punitive in effect that it is to be considered criminal,and government action is a hallmark of criminal prosecution,we conclude the absence of government action is a relevant factor to be considered in the effects inquiry.
section is not so punitive in form or effect as to be considered penal for purposes of the ex post facto clause 
we consider section with respect to each of the factors discussed above.first,we inquire whether the sanction of punitive damages involves an affirmative disability or restraint.the paradigmatic restraint is imprisonment.smith doe,supra,at.occupational debarment is not an affirmative disability or restraint.hudson united states,supra,at.the same is true of civil monetary penalties.hudson united states,supra,at.united states ward,supra,at.as punitive damages payable to a private party are much more akin to civil monetary penalties tha
