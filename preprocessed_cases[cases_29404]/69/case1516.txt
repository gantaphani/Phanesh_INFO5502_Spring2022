this case marks the latest chapter in a dispute between two manufacturers of prosthetic limb accessories.the appellant,the ohio willow wood company oww,owns a group of patents directed to cushioning devices that fit over the residual stumps of amputated limbs to make the use of prosthetics more comfortable.oww has asserted its patents against defendant alps south,llc alps in several actions.
the cushioning devices at issue in this case consist of stretchable pieces of synthetic fabric that are coated with a gel on only the side touching the body.that design creates a gel side that reduces irritation to the skin and a dry side that allows free interaction with the prosthesis.
this case is back before us following an earlier decision remanding a portion of the case for trial.see ohio willow wood alps,llc.the facts and legal issues that we addressed then are similar to those presented in this appeal,so we offer an abbreviated version of the background facts,focusing mainly on the analysis of the district court findings of fact and conclusions of law in the remand proceedings.
oww filed the present action in,charging alps with infringement of patent the patent.after the district court issued a claim construction order,alps challenged the validity of the patent in two successive ex parte reexamination proceedings before the patent and trademark office pto.the district court stayed the litigation pending the resolution of the reexamination proceedings.
the first reexamination,initiated in,focused on advertisements for a prior art cushioning device called the silosheath,which was made by silipos,one of oww competitors.the silosheath consisted of a sheath made of nylon fabric with gel material on the inner side.the examiner initially rejected all the challenged claims of the patent based on the silosheath prior art.oww overcame the rejection by showing the examiner a silosheath product in which the gel on the inner or skin side of the liner had bled through to the outer or prosthetic side.the examiner then allowed oww to amend its claims to clarify that the gel coating was found only on the inner side of its claimed device and issued a reexamination certificate.
in,shortly after the completion of the first reexamination,alps initiated a second reexamination.the new request for reexamination was based on an advertisement in a trade magazine published on january,which depicted a gel liner identified as the single socket gel liner ssgl,from silipos silosheath product line.alps argued that the ssgl was invalidating prior art because it had gel on its inner surface,but not on its outer surface.the central issue in the second reexamination was whether the synthetic fabric used in the ssgl prevented the gel on the skin side of the liner from bleeding through to the prosthetic side.
in addition to the advertisement,alps presented a declaration and deposition testimony from jean paul comtesse,who worked at silipos when the silosheath and the ssgl were developed.comtesse stated that the ssgl did not have the same gel problem as the silosheath because it was manufactured from a fabric called coolmax that was thicker and denser than the fabric used in the silosheath.alps argued that,in light of the prior art evidence and comtesse testimony,it was clear that the amended claims were invalid.
the examiner agreed with alps and rejected the claims of the patent for obviousness in light of the ssgl and other prior art.oww appealed the rejection to the board of patent appeals and interferences the board.in its brief to the board,oww argued that comtesse testimony was unreliable because it was uncorroborated and because comtesse was a highly interested witness.as to comtesse interest in the case,oww argued that he was the inventor of the ssgl and that he continued to receive royalties on that product.as to the absence of corroboration,oww argued that aside from comtesse testimony the only evidence relating to the ssgl was the advertisement,which contained no reference to coolmax.according to oww,there was no other evidence of any sort in this regard,and because the comtesse testimony is not corroborated as required it can not be properly used to cure the very deficiencies in the advertisement for which corroboration is lacking.
in oral argument before the board,oww pressed its contention that there was no evidence corroborating comtesse testimony about the ssgl.oww also continued to argue that comtesse was an interested witness,asserting that he was an inventor of the ssgl and was still receiving royalties from silipos sales of that product.
the board reversed the examiner rejection.the board agreed with oww that comtesse testimony was uncorroborated and that he was an interested third party.based on those conclusions,the board held that the examiner had erred in crediting comtesse testimony that the ssgl was made of coolmax and had gel on only its inner side.
following the second reexamination,the district court lifted the stay of the litigation.the court then granted alps motion for summary judgment of invalidity as to all the asserted claims of the patent.the court invalidated some of the claims based on the collateral estoppel effect of a decision against oww in a case from a different district court.it invalidated the remaining claims for obviousness based on the silosheath,the ssgl,and other prior art references.the court also addressed alps inequitable conduct claim,which was predicated on oww conduct before the pto during the two reexamination proceedings.as to that claim,the court granted summary judgment to oww,holding that there was no triable issue of inequitable conduct on oww part.
both sides appealed.this court affirmed the summary judgment of invalidity.with respect to inequitable conduct,however,we concluded that the case presented genuine issues of material fact.accordingly,we reversed the summary judgment of no inequitable conduct and remanded the case to the district court for trial.ohio willow wood.
we noted that oww was only able to obtain issuance of the patent in the reexamination proceedings by arguing that the prior art lacked gel liners with no observable gel material on their exterior surfaces.id.at.in the second reexamination,we added,oww was only able to overcome the examiner final rejection in view of the ssgl by convincing the board that comtesse was a highly interested witness and there was no evidence,as required by law,to corroborate his testimony that the ssgl was constructed using a coolmax fabric.id.at.
as to corroboration,we stated that the evidence as a whole provided consistent and convincing evidence that corroborates comtesse testimony regarding the structure of the ssgl prior to the patent critical date of march.id.at.
as to whether comtesse was an interested witness,we agreed with the district court that oww had misrepresented comtesse testimony to the board.we stated that comtesse never admitted that he was interested in the outcome of the present dispute nor did he ever admit that he was receiving royalty payments at the time of his deposition in.id.at.
finally,with respect to the issue of intent,we stated that oww withheld various pieces of material information and had no reasonable explanation for the several misrepresentations it made to the pto.id.at.the collective weight of the evidence,we concluded,would support a finding of intent that is the single most reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence at this stage of the proceedings.id.
on remand,the district court held a bench trial on the inequitable conduct issue.following the trial,the court issued a lengthy opinion finding inequitable conduct in the second reexamination,but not in the first.the inequitable conduct in the second reexamination,the court found,arose from the conduct of james colvin,oww director of research and development,who was responsible for overseeing the alps litigation for the company.
oww used the same law firm for both the litigation and reexamination proceedings in this case.the firm established an ethical screen to separate the attorney handling oww reexamination proceedings from the attorneys handling oww litigation matters.with the creation of the screen,colvin became the connection between oww litigation and reexamination counsel.the district court found that,with occasional exceptions,colvin was the ultimate decision maker with respect to some of oww patent litigation matters,including this case.the court also found that colvin had reviewed filings and attended hearings in both the litigation and the reexamination proceedings,and that colvin was sophisticated with respect to patents and patent prosecution,as he had overseen the prosecution of about patents and was an inventor on about patents.colvin testified that,although he understood that he was the person in the middle,he did not send oww reexamination counsel all information regardless of how important it might have been.instead,colvin explained that he sent oww reexamination counsel only whatever he requested or i thought was appropriate.
the district court ruled that colvin engaged in inequitable conduct during the second reexamination of the patent based on a series of factual findings regarding whether comtesse testimony was uncorroborated.the court found that colvin was aware that oww reexamination counsel had represented to the board that comtesse testimony was entirely uncorroborated that colvin was aware of materials that corroborated comtesse testimony and that colvin failed to correct his counsel misrepresentations.
the items the court identified as corroborative of comtesse testimony included a pair of letters sent to oww in april and october of by michael scalise,an attorney for silipos the scalise letters.the first of the scalise letters stated that silipos had sold the silosheath product line since at least as early as and that one of the products in that line contained the polymeric gel on only the inside of the sock.that letter concluded that silipos original sales of their silosheath sock product line having the gelatinous materials on only the inside of the sock the filing date of the patent.the letter also enclosed a patent application amendment for the silosheath product line that disclosed a protective garment having an inner layer comprising a gel.
the second scalise letter claimed that silipos sale of liners having the gelatinous material on only the inside of the sock the filing date of the application that became the patent by more than one year.attached to the letter was a november,shipping invoice that the letter claimed was for one of the silipos products with gel on only one side.
oww did not disclose the scalise letters to its reexamination counsel,and the letters were not disclosed to the pto in the course of either reexamination.the district court found that colvin was aware of the scalise letters and that the letters were corroborative of comtesse testimony.for that reason,the court ruled,the letters became material when oww contended that comtesse testimony was uncorroborated.
the district court also found that colvin had knowledge of three declarations that were attached to alps summary judgment motion in the district court litigation.the declarants stated that silipos had offered the ssgl product prior to january,and that the ssgl had no gel on the exterior of the liner and no,as was the case with some of the products.one of the three declarants stated that he had fitted a patient with the ssgl,which used a substantially thicker fabric than the silosheath,and as a result did not allow the gel to pass through to the exterior of the liner.
the court found that the board accepted as true oww representation that comtesse testimony was uncorroborated.the court further concluded that absent oww misrepresentations that no corroborating evidence existed,the board would not have reversed the examiner and reinstated the patent.the court finding mirrored the board opinion that the dispositive issue in this appeal is the testimony of comtesse in support of the rejections.
moving to the issue of intent,the district court found that the evidence was sufficient to infer deceptive intent on the part of colvin and oww reexamination counsel.while the court was not persuaded that deceptive intent was the single most reasonable inference to draw from the evidence with respect to reexamination counsel,it reached the opposite conclusion with respect to colvin.
the court found that colvin was deeply involved in both the reexamination proceedings and the infringement litigation,and that he knew about various items bearing on the inequitable conduct allegations.the court therefore found that colvin was in a position to correct the misrepresentations regarding the evidence corroborating comtesse testimony,but did not do so.in particular,the court found that colvin was aware of the scalise letters and the declarations.the court rejected as not credible colvin testimony that he had never seen the declarations because he was barred from seeing them by the protective order entered in the district court case.
as to the scalise letters and the silipos patent application referred to and attached to one of the letters,the district court noted that colvin had no explanation for his failure to present those documents to either oww prosecution counsel or the pto.the court therefore held that the most reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence is that oww acted with deceptive intent in misrepresenting the existence of evidence corroborating the comtesse testimony.
based on its inequitable conduct finding,the district court held the patent unenforceable,found the case to be exceptional,and imposed a fee award against oww.the fee award required oww to pay alps attorneys fees incurred in litigating this case after september,the date of the board decision on the second reexamination.
alps also requested that the district court extend its holding that the patent was unenforceable to three other related patents owned by oww,patent,and.the court denied that request.it noted that alps had not requested that relief in its counterclaim and that alps arguments regarding the similarity of the three related oww patents go beyond the scope of evidence presented in this case.
oww argues that the district court erred in finding that oww,through colvin,was guilty of inequitable conduct during the second reexamination.
a party seeking to prove inequitable conduct must show by clear and convincing evidence that the patent applicant made misrepresentations or omissions material to patentability,that he did so with the specific intent to mislead or deceive the pto,and that deceptive intent was the single most reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence.ohio willow wood,at therasense,becton,dickinson,en banc.on appeal,we review the district court findings of fact on the issues of materiality and intent for clear error.am.calcar,am.honda motor,citing intellect wireless,htc.we review the district court ultimate finding of inequitable conduct based on those underlying facts for an abuse of discretion.id.
to prove the element of materiality,a party claiming inequitable conduct ordinarily must show that the patentee withheld or misrepresented information that,in the absence of the withholding or misrepresentation,would have prevented a patent claim from issuing.ohio willow wood,at therasense,at.
the district court acknowledged that the scalise letters did not conclusively answer the questions whether the ssgl was on sale before the critical date of the patent and whether the ssgl had gel only on the inside of the liner.however,the court explained that the significance of that evidence was not that it conclusively proved that an anticipating device was on sale before that date,but that it corroborated comtesse testimony to that effect.
comtesse testified that the ssgl depicted in the january,advertisement represented invalidating prior art having gel only on the inner side.the assertion in the scalise letters that silipos sold a product with gelatinous material on only one side prior to march,corroborates comtesse testimony 
the district court found that the withheld evidence became material to patentability in the second reexamination once oww argued to the board that comtesse testimony was uncorroborated.that fin
