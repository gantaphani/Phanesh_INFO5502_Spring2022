the secretary of the interior and others the secretary appeal the preliminary injunction of march,which superseded and replaced an injunction of july,and required disconnection of substantially all of the department of the interior computer systems from the internet.cobell norton,d cobell xi.the injunction also requires the secretary to submit a plan for secure reconnection of interior computer systems.in cobell norton,cobell vi,the court affirmed the district court finding of a breach of fiduciary duty by the secretary of the interior and the other defendants,as trustees of funds held in trust for individual native americans hereafter,indians,in failing to provide an accurate accounting.on remand,the district court entered several injunctive orders mandating interior to disconnect its computers from the internet in light of concerns about the security of individual indian trust data iitd,which are the basis for accounting for indian funds and are housed on an unknown number of interior computer systems.on appeal from the latest injunction entered march,the secretary contends that the district court exceeded its lawful authority and,alternatively,lacked a factual predicate for the injunction.
we hold,contrary to the secretary contention,that issuance of the march,injunction is not precluded by pub,stat,which applies only to historical accounting activities.as the district court noted,interior present obligation to administer the trust presents sufficient grounds for finding that plaintiffs will be irreparably injured.cobell xi,d at.we further hold that the district court jurisdiction properly extends to security of interior information technology systems it housing or accessing iitd,because the secretary,as a fiduciary,is required to maintain and preserve iitd.we nevertheless vacate the injunction because the district court erred by placing the burden of persuasion upon the secretary,disregarding interior certifications on the state of it security,and failing to hold an evidentiary hearing prior to entering the injunction.
the underlying litigation concerns individual indian money accounts iim,which collectively form a trust established by the general allotment act in for the benefit of american indians the trust corpus consists of the revenues derived from land that was carved out of preexisting indian reservations under the act.see generally cobell vi,at.in,after decades of mismanagement of the trust by the interior and treasury departments,the secretaries of which serve as trustees for the trust,congress enacted the indian trust fund management reform act act,stat,which requires the interior secretary,among other things,to provid e adequate systems for accounting for and reporting trust fund balances.cobell vi,at d.in,the district court found a breach of fiduciary duty by the secretary,and ruled that,pursuant to the act,the secretary must provide an accurate accounting of all money in the iim trust,and establish written policies for the computer and business systems architecture necessary for an accurate accounting.cobell babbitt,d,cobell v.
this court affirmed,although holding in cobell vi that the actual legal breach by the secretary is the failure to provide an accounting,not failure to take the discrete individual steps that would facilitate an accounting.at.noting interior stipulation that it was unable to meet the requirements of numerous provisions of the act,the court observed that the federal government will be unable to provide an adequate accounting without computer systems,staffing,and document retention policies that are adequate for the task.id.the court also stated there was no need to alter the district court order in cobell v because while 
t he level of oversight proposed by the district court may well be in excess of that countenanced in the typical delay case so too is the magnitude of government malfeasance and potential prejudice to the plaintiffs class 
accordingly,the district court should not abdicate its responsibility to ensure that its instructions are followed.this would seem particularly appropriate where,as here,there is a record of agency recalcitrance and resistance to the fulfillment of its legal duties.
id.at citing in re center for auto safety.the court added n onetheless,we expect the district court to be mindful of the limits of its jurisdiction.id.at.
on remand,as relevant here,the district court,in light of the special master recommendation regarding inadequate it security of iitd,granted the plaintiffs motion for a temporary restraining order on december,requiring interior immediately to disconnect from the internet its it systems housing or accessing iitd.see cobell norton,d,cobell ix.the plaintiff also moved for a preliminary injunction and an order to show cause why the secretary and counsel for the secretary should not be held in contempt.with the consent of interior,the district court on december,entered a consent order providing that interior shall not reconnect any information technology system to the internet without the concurrence of the special master,and the special master shall verify compliance with this consent order id.at.the relationship between the special master and interior in carrying out the consent order apparently operated effectively,with almost percent of interior it systems being reconnected within one year,cobell xi,d at,until april,when the special master and his contractor attempted to recheck whether computers recently found vulnerable were secure against unauthorized internet access,id.the special master suspected that an interior employee had frustrated the penetration of the vulnerable computers by providing advance warning to the computer administrator.cobell ix,d at.this dispute escalated and resulted in the breakdown of the relationship between the special master and interior and its attorneys from the justice department.see generally id.
on june,the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to mandate the secretary to disconnect from the internet all interior computers and it systems that house or access iitd until the special master certified that all the data was properly secured.id.at.following a hearing,the district court entered a temporary restraining order,modifying the order in light of interior suggestions.interior,while protesting entry of any order,stated that it was willing to work things out with the special master.id.at.soon thereafter,however,interior requested that special master balaran be disqualified from acting in any capacity in this case.id.at.following a hearing on july,the district court entered a preliminary injunction,and stayed the consent order.id.at.the july,injunction called for disconnection of all interior computers from the internet,except those essential for protection against fires or other threats to life or property and those that interior certified in accordance with rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,were secure from unauthorized internet access or did not house or access iitd.id.at.in light of interior objection to any further involvement by the special master in determining the security of interior it systems,the district court decided to make the determinations itself.id.at.the secretary appealed.
in the interim,on august,the secretary filed certifications on the state of it security in response to the july,injunction.on march,the district court entered a preliminary injunction that supersede d and replace d the july,injunction.cobell norton,d,cobell xi order.the march,injunction called for disconnection from the internet of all interior computers,with exceptions for systems essential to protect against fire or other threats to life or property,and it systems of the national park service,the office of policy management and budget,and the united states geological survey.id.at.the injunction further provides for reconnection if the secretary submits and the court approves a suitable proposal.id.at.in issuing the injunction,the district court rejected the secretary certifications as procedurally and substantively defective,finding they were not properly subscribed as true as required by local rule and statute and the very interior officials who drafted the reports simultaneously gave conflicting information to other government agencies such as the office of management and budget and the general accounting office stating that interior it systems were in fact vulnerable.cobell xi,d at.further,the district court found the secretary proposal for reconnections unsatisfactory,essentially because past experience indicated the secretary and interior contractor could not be relied upon to do an adequate job.id.at.the district court,however,emphasized in its accompanying memorandum opinion that it is not telling interior how to run its operations nor foisting management directives on the agency.it is interior that is tasked with proposing a security standard id.at.the secretary appeals.this court consolidated this appeal with the secretary appeal of the july,injunction and stayed the march,injunction pending appeal.cobell norton,wl.
the secretary challenges the march,injunction as lacking any legal foundation or factual predicate.according to the secretary,the injunction lacks a legal basis in the act,is contrary to the mandate in cobell vi,and violates settled limitations on judicial review.not only did the district court fail to amend its order in cobell v in compliance with cobell vi,at,but by ordering sweeping equitable relief calling for wholesale improvement of interior it systems security,the district court exceeded its authority under the apa and violated separation of powers principles.moreover,in the secretary opinion,pub.removed any legal basis for the injunctions.
the court reviews the grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.doran salem inn,d serono,shalala.the district court legal conclusions are subject to essentially de novo review,city of las vegas lujan,while its findings of fact,which include the district court assessment of whether the secretary has taken sufficient actions to fulfill her fiduciary duties and to comply with court orders,are reviewed for clear error,id.upon de novo review of the secretary challenges to the district court authority,we hold that the district court possessed authority on remand from cobell vi to issue a preliminary injunction regarding it security.
as a threshold matter,the secretary contention that pub.removes any legal basis for the march,injunction is unpersuasive.this statute provides that nothing in any law shall be construed or applied to require interior to commence or continue historical accounting activities stat.at.as such,the plain text of the statute addresses only the historical accounting activities required by the district court september structural injunction,cobell x,d,rather than the secretary current trust obligations addressed in the march,injunction.it is indisputable that the secretary has current and prospective trust management duties that necessitate maintaining secure it systems in order to render accurate accountings now and in the future.cobell vi,at.consequently,pub.does not affect the iim trust beneficiaries current and prospective substantive rights,which hinge on accurate accountings,and the court has no occasion to consider the plaintiffs challenge to its constitutionality.
the secretary other challenges to the district court legal authority to enter the march,injunction are also unpersuasive.in contending that the district court ignored the narrow mandate of cobell vi by undertaking to oversee interior computer security,the secretary relies on this court of the legal breach of fiduciary duty in cobell vi as a failure to provide an accounting,not the separate steps directed by the district court toward facilitating an accounting,and on this court expectation that the district court would be mindful of the limits of its jurisdiction.id.at.but the secretary ignores relevant discussion in cobell vi.the court made plain in cobell vi that it was premature to rule on the precise scope of the district court planned proceedings in addressing the difficult task of extracting an accounting from an agency with an intransigent past.id.at.the court likewise made plain that maintaining adequate computer systems,along with staff and document retention policies,is critical to the completion of an adequate accounting.id.at.while the court also stated that interior should be afforded sufficient discretion in determining the precise route it take s,so long as this threshold of producing an adequate accounting is met,the court did not limit the district court authority to exercise its discretion as a court of equity in fashioning a remedy to right a wrong or to enforce a consent decree,see frew hawkins,d.the court merely suggested that the district court should grant the secretary some leeway in fashioning solutions,and the district court memorandum opinion accompanying the injunction reflects this approach.
contrary to the secretary view,w hile the government obligations are rooted in and outlined by the relevant statutes and treaties,they are largely defined in traditional equitable terms,cobell vi,at,and the narrower judicial powers appropriate under the apa do not apply.jicarilla apache tribe supron energy,cir seymour,concurring in part and dissenting in part,adopted as majority opinion as modified en banc,cir.although the apa is the device whereby sovereign immunity was waived in this case,cobell vi,at,and the court considered whether final agency action was involved,id.at,the secretary has an overriding duty to deal fairly with indians,id.at quoting morton ruiz,d,and the secretary actions must be judged by the most exacting fiduciary standards,id.quoting seminole nation united states,in this litigation.the secretary can not now try to escape h er role as trustee by donning the mantle of administrator to claim that courts must defer to h er expertise and delegated authority.cobell vi,at quoting jicarilla,at.the district court,then,retains substantial latitude,much more so than in the typical agency case,to fashion an equitable remedy because the underlying lawsuit is both an indian case and a trust case in which the trustees have egregiously breached their fiduciary duties.id.at.the secretary suggestion that the appropriate role for the district court was confined to retaining jurisdiction and ordering periodic progress reports,as in in re united mine workers of america international union,ignores these salient considerations.
it is only by mischaracterizing the march,injunction that the secretary can now contend that the district court dictated interior actions for improving it system security,and therefore violated the separation of powers.the plain language of the injunction as well as the district court memorandum opinion requires the secretary to develop the it security programs.the district court did not order the type of wholesale programmatic changes rejected in lujan national wildlife federation,d,and cobell vi,at.nor does the injunction include particular tasks for interior to perform based on policies developed by the district court,as in cobell cobell vi,at.the injunction does no more than ensure that the secretary is tak ing reasonable steps toward the discharge of the federal government fiduciary obligations to iim trust beneficiaries id.at.the district court has limited its role to accepting or rejecting the secretary proposals,rather than dictating their substance or even the standard for measuring the security of interior it systems.cobell xi order,d at.given the admissions in the consent order of interior past gross computer security failures,and the impasse between the parties regarding the manner in which the consent order should be implemented,cobell ix,d at,the district court had authority to require the secretary to propose a workable plan in order to ensure that its instructions are followed.cobell vi,at.
we do not reach the merits of the secretary challenges to the factual predicate for the march,injunction because related procedural and evidentiary issues require that we vacate the injunction.
a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy that should be granted only when the party seeking
