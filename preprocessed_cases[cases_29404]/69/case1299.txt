the plaintiffs in this class action are independent truck drivers,known in the trucking industry as,and an association of.defendants are federally regulated motor carriers that contract with to transport cargo across the country.federal regulations require that motor carriers and enter into written leases that explicitly address certain contractual issues,such as compensation and duration.plaintiffs contended that defendants standard form lease agreements failed to comply with the regulations in various respects,and moved for a preliminary injunction.the district court applied the traditional balancing test to the motion,and denied it.
plaintiffs appeal,asserting that the district court committed an error of law by applying the traditional equity balancing test to their motion.they contend that the district court should have granted the motion for injunctive relief upon a showing of reasonable cause to believe that defendants leases violated the regulations.we disagree.the proposed reasonable cause test applies only when congress makes clear its intent to depart from the traditional equity balancing test used to grant or deny preliminary injunctions.because congress has not made such an intent clear,we apply the traditional test.under that test,we affirm the district court.
background 
there are hundreds of thousands of in the united states,many of whom contract with various federally regulated motor carriers.under federal law,motor carriers are required to register with the department of transportation dot in order to ship most types of cargo in interstate commerce,requirements for registration.once registered,these carriers are statutorily obliged to comply with certain regulations promulgated by the dot.a.a primary goal of this regulatory scheme is to prevent large carriers from taking advantage of individual due to their weak bargaining position.for example,the statute authorizes the dot to require that all leases between motor carriers and be in writing and contain certain basic information,such as the duration of the lease and the compensation to be paid the.a see a requiring that leases be in writing id.b requiring that leases specify the time and date on which the lease begins and ends id.d requiring that the amount to be paid to the be clearly stated on the face of the lease.
the regulations,part,were originally promulgated and enforced by the interstate commerce commission.when congress abolished the commission in,it placed enforcement responsibility with the by enacting a statute that provides a private right of action for violations of the regulations.see a.in that statute,congress expressly provided that,in addition to seeking damages,a party injured due to a violation of the regulations may bring a civil action for injunctive relief.id.
plaintiffs brought a class action pursuant to a against several motor carriers alleging that the carriers standard form lease agreements violate the regulations in various respects.for example,they alleged that defendants form lease agreements do not clearly state the amount the is to be paid.see d requiring a clear statement on the face of the lease of the compensation.a week after filing their class action complaint,plaintiffs moved to preliminarily enjoin defendant motor carriers from contracting with until they executed lease agreements that complied with the regulations.
plaintiffs argued to the district court that they had established reasonable cause to believe that defendants were shipping cargo in violation of the regulations,and that they were therefore entitled to a preliminary injunction.plaintiffs asserted that this reasonable cause standard,rather than the traditional equity balancing test,governed their motion.compare burlington bair,cir describing the reasonable cause test,with miller california pac.med,cir en banc describing the traditional equity balancing test.the district court rejected plaintiffs argument and applied the traditional equitable balancing test.it denied a preliminary injunction under that test,concluding that 
plaintiffs are not entitled to the issuance of a preliminary injunction because they have not established through the evidence of the record either that they will suffer any irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted or that their legal remedies are inadequate.
plaintiffs appeal the district court ruling that the traditional equitable balancing test governs their motion.they do not,however,appeal the district court conclusion that,under the traditional test,they are not entitled to the preliminary injunction they seek.
ii.discussion 
federal courts usually apply traditional equitable principles to petitions for injunctive relief that seek to prevent or deter statutory violations.see weinberger,d collecting supreme court cases.the essence of equity jurisdiction has been the power to do equity and to mould each decree to the necessities of the particular case.flexibility rather than rigidity has distinguished it.hecht bowles.see also,city of harrisonville dickey clay.an injunction is not a remedy which issues as of course.this equity practice has a background of several hundred years of history,hecht,at,and still guides the federal courts today.see,verio,cir quoting hecht,at.
we have established the following traditional equitable criteria for deciding whether to grant a preliminary injunction 
the likelihood of the moving party success on the merits the possibility of irreparable injury to the moving party if relief is not granted the extent to which the balance of hardships favors the respective parties and in certain cases,whether the public interest will be advanced by granting the preliminary relief.the moving party must show either a combination of probable success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable harm,or the existence of serious questions going to the merits,the balance of hardships tipping sharply in its favor,and at least a fair chance of success on the merits.these two formulations represent two points on a sliding scale in which the required degree of irreparable harm increases as the probability of success decreases.

congress,however,has the power to alter the traditional equitable balancing test.if congress wishes to do so,it can require the federal courts to automatically enjoin actual or imminent violations of a statute without an individualized balancing of the equities,at.tennessee valley authority hill,d tva hill,is the leading case sustaining such a congressional restriction of the courts equitable discretion.
in tva hill,plaintiffs brought suit under the federal endangered species act esa seeking to enjoin the tva from finishing a dam on the little tennessee river.under the esa,all federal the obliged to tak e such action necessary to insure that they do not jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species.id.at.quoting the esa.the damming of the little tennessee would have flooded the only known habitat of the snail darter,a small fish that had very recently been declared an endangered species.such flooding would have destroyed the snail darter critical habitat,id.at,in violation of the esa flat ban on destruction of the critical habitats of endangered species.see amoco prod.village of gambell,d explaining tva hill.nevertheless,the district court denied plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction on the ground that the snail darter continued existence was outweighed by considerations on the other side,notably the tens of millions of dollars already expended in constructing the dam that would be wasted by stopping the project.tva hill,at.
