in,following a jury trial,the circuit court of cook county entered judgment in favor of plaintiff terry ready in a action stemming from the death of her husband,michael,in a workplace accident.the appellate court affirmed in part and reversed in part and remanded for a new trial,directing that fault for the accident be reapportioned.d.we allowed plaintiff petition for leave to appeal.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the appellate court.
background 
in december,a project was under way at the midwest generation,power plant in joliet,illinois,where michael ready was employed as a maintenance mechanic.as part of this project,scaffolding material had to be raised from the ground to the level of the eighth floor.the general contractor of the project,bmw constructors,bmw,had subcontracted with services,united,to perform the scaffolding work,including the lifting of scaffolding materials.
on december,a united employee was supervising the lifting of wooden trusses.another united employee was rigging the trusses for lifting,using a single sling.ready was standing beneath the rigging so that he could give hand signals to the operator of the tugger that was being used to lift the trusses.the tugger was owned by midwest and was being operated by a midwest employee.eight trusses were lifted without incident.as the ninth truss was being lifted,it slipped out of the sling,falling eight floors to the ground level where it struck and killed ready.
ready was survived by his wife,terry,and two children.the suit brought by terry,as administrator of ready estate,named two defendants united and bmw.both defendants filed complaints against midwest pursuant to the joint tortfeasor contribution act contribution act ilcs et west.plaintiff thereafter amended her complaint,adding midwest as a defendant.she reached settlement agreements totaling million with bmw and midwest.united did not object to the settlements and the trial court found that they were reached in good faith.
prior to trial,the parties filed numerous motions in limine,some of which the trial court granted.as a result of these rulings,united was not allowed to present any evidence at trial regarding the conduct of the settling defendants.in addition,the trial court denied united motion to list bmw and midwest on the verdict form so that if the jury found united at fault,it could consider whether to allocate some portion of the fault not only to ready,but also to his employer and the general contractor.
the case proceeded to trial with united as the sole defendant.the jury found united liable for negligence and awarded damages of million.based on section of the code of civil procedure code,ch,par,the trial court found united jointly and severally liable for the amount of the verdict remaining after offsets for ready comparative negligence and the settlement amounts paid by bmw and midwest.united was held liable in the amount of million.
on appeal,united argued that the trial court erred by failing to include the settling defendants on the verdict form so that the jury could determine their share of fault,if any,for the fatal accident.if the jury had been asked to consider their relative fault,united argued,its share of fault might have been set at less than and,under section,united would have been only severally liable.
the appellate court affirmed in part and reversed in part and remanded the cause for a new trial as to liability only.d.the appellate court concluded that,under section,a nonsettling defendant fault should be assessed relative to the fault of all defendants,including settling defendants.the court thus held that,in the case at bar,bmw and midwest should have been included on the verdict form for purposes of fault apportionment.the court also concluded,contrary to the circuit court,that evidence relating to the culpability of these settled defendants was relevant and admissible.the appellate court affirmed the amount of the damages award,concluding that united had forfeited the right to challenge this amount.
we permitted the illinois trial lawyers association,the illinois association of defense trial counsel,and the illinois chamber of commerce to file amicus curiae briefs.
the central issue in this appeal is whether settled tortfeasors are defendants sued by the plaintiff within the meaning of section of the code.plaintiff argues that the statute unambiguously excludes settling defendants from the apportionment of fault.united takes the opposite view,contending that the statute unambiguously requires a jury to allocate fault to settling and dismissed defendants.
united argues,in addition,that the appellate court erred in affirming the amount of the damages award.
section was amended in before the appellate court below,the parties disagreed as to which version of section applied in the case at bar.the appellate court concluded that the preamendment version of the statute was applicable.the parties are no longer in dispute on this point.our analysis,therefore,is limited to the version of section in effect at the time of plaintiff accident,the version.
section provides 
joint liability.except as provided in section,in actions on account of bodily injury or death or physical damage to property,based on negligence,or product liability based on strict tort liability,all defendants found liable are jointly and severally liable for plaintiff past and future medical and medically related expenses.any defendant whose fault,as determined by the trier of fact,is less than of the total fault attributable to the plaintiff,the defendants sued by the plaintiff,and any third party defendant who could have been sued by the plaintiff,shall be severally liable for all other damages.any defendant whose fault,as determined by the trier of fact,is or greater of the total fault attributable to the plaintiff,the defendants sued by the plaintiff,and any third party defendants who could have been sued by the plaintiff,shall be jointly and severally liable for all other damages,ch,par.
in construing the meaning of a statute,our primary objective is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature.deluna burciaga.the best evidence of the legislature intent is the language of the statute,which must be given its plain and ordinary meaning.hadley illinois department of corrections,paris feder.however,if the language of a statute is ambiguous,courts may look to tools of interpretation to ascertain the meaning of a provision.wade city of north chicago police pension board,deluna,at.the construction of a statute is a question of law,which we review de novo.wade,at,deluna,at.
the first sentence of section deals with liability for a plaintiff medical expenses.the sentence states,in pertinent part a ll defendants found liable are jointly and severally liable for plaintiff past and future medical and medically related expenses,ch,par.liability for medical expenses is not at issue in the case at bar.
the second and third sentences of section deal with liability for all other damages.according to this portion of the statute,a defendant whose fault is or greater is jointly and severally liable for these damages,while a defendant whose fault is less than is only severally liable.in making this determination,the fault to be considered is that of the plaintiff,the defendants sued by the plaintiff,and any third party defendants who could have been sued by the plaintiff,ch,par.
the relevant phrase,for purposes of our analysis,is defendants sued by the plaintiff.the question is whether settling defendants such as bmw and midwest are defendants sued by the plaintiff within the meaning of section.united answers this question in the affirmative,arguing that the statutory language plainly includes settling defendants within its scope.noting that sued is in the past tense,united asserts defendants dismissed from an action prior to verdict based on settlement were sued by the plaintiff.united thus contends,citing lannom kosco,that all defendants,including settling defendants,must be included in the apportionment of fault.
plaintiff takes the opposite view,arguing that the plain meaning of section does not permit the apportionment of fault to dismissed defendants.according to plaintiff,the phrase defendants sued by the plaintiff includes only those defendants who remain in the case when it is submitted to the fact finder.necessarily excluded from this group are settling defendants such as bmw and midwest who were dismissed from the action.plaintiff states dismissed or former defendants are not defendants.plaintiff cites lannom in support of her view of section.
initially,we reject the parties simultaneous claims that lannom supports their opposite viewpoints.even disregarding the contradictory nature of these claims,we note that the relevant issue in lannom,unlike the case at bar,was whether section prohibited the dismissal of a defendant or third party from an action where such dismissal was otherwise warranted.the instant appeal presents a different issue whether section requires the inclusion of settled and otherwise dismissed defendants in the allocation of fault.lannom did not interpret the statutory language to determine this question.
more important,we disagree with both plaintiff and united that section is unambiguous with regard to whether settled tortfeasors are to be included in the apportionment of fault.a statute is ambiguous when it is capable of being understood by reasonably persons in two or more different senses.wade,at.
the phrase defendants sued by the plaintiff is not defined in the statute.the standard dictionary definition of sue includes to seek justice or right from a person by legal process bring an action against prosecute judicially,as well as to proceed with a legal action and follow up to proper termination gain by legal process.webster third new international dictionary.the first of these definitions appears to correspond with united view that any defendant who was sued by the plaintiff is included within the scope of section,regardless of whether that defendant may have settled with the plaintiff.the second definition,on the other hand,appears to comport with plaintiff view that section applies only to those defendants who remain in the case when it is submitted to the fact finder.these definitions thus provide no help in determining which of these contradictory views might have been intended by the legislature.
nor is this matter clarified by an examination of the statute as a whole.we find no clear indication of a legislative preference for either of the parties asserted meanings over the other.accordingly,based on a careful examination of the language of section,we conclude that the statute is ambiguous with regard to whether it includes within its scope settling tortfeasors such as bmw and midwest.
we disagree with the dissent that the phrase defendants sued by the plaintiff unambiguously includes settling defendants such as bmw and midwest.we note that,in establishing this alleged plain meaning,the dissent,in addition to citing multiple dictionary definitions,engages in a rather complex discussion of grammatical principles,particularly those relating to participial verb forms.the need for such an extended discussion strongly belies the notion that the statute unambiguously speaks in terms that the ordinary person,exercising ordinary common sense,can understand.
our determination that section is ambiguous finds support in the conflicting interpretations of the statute by our appellate court.in blake hy ho restaurant,d,for example,the court held that defendants who had settled were no longer defendants in the suit and were not to be included in the apportionment of fault under section.blake holding was noted in lombardo reliance elevator,d,which concluded that blake establish ed guidelines for using the attributions of fault for purposes of determining whether the defendants meet the threshold of responsibility requisite for joint liability.in remanding for a new trial,lombardo instructed the circuit court to consider the fault of only those parties specified in section for purposes of determining joint liability.following blake,the court should not subject the settling defendants to the expense of discovery.emphasis added.lombardo,d at.accord yoder ferguson,d,in lombardo,the first district of this court adopted the holding of the fifth district in blake.in skaggs senior services of central illinois,d,on the other hand,the court held that a settling defendant does not lose its status as a defendant sued by the plaintiff,and settling defendants therefore are to be included in the apportionment of fault.see also yoder,d at,following blake in limiting fault allocation to remaining defendants heupel jenkins,d,concluding that section applies to all tortfeasors,including those who settled with the plaintiff.indeed,individual members of this court disagree on this same point.compare at.at,at kilbride,specially concurring concluding that the language of section,viewed in its entirety,clearly excludes settling tortfeasors from the allocation of fault with at.at,at garman,dissenting,joined by karmeier,concluding that the plain language of the statute clearly includes settling tortfeasors in the allocation of fault.
though the difference in appellate court interpretations of section is not dispositive as to whether the statute is ambiguous,it strongly suggests that it is.once a court has concluded,through an examination of statutory language,that a statute is ambiguous,the existence of differing interpretations in the lower courts may be considered in support of the finding of ambiguity.see avery state farm mutual automobile insurance,holding that the wealth of competing interpretations of section f of the consumer fraud act is a compelling indication of the statute ambiguity.
where a statute is ambiguous,courts may look to tools of interpretation to ascertain the meaning of a provision.deluna,at,wade,at.one such aid to construction is the principle that,where the legislature chooses not to amend a statute after a judicial construction,it is presumed that the legislature has acquiesced in the court statement of the legislative intent.wakulich mraz,see also bruso alexian brothers hospital,applying this principle to prior judicial construction by appellate court.as previously noted,in our appellate court held that,under section,settling defendants were not to be included in the apportionment of fault.blake,d at.the amendment to section did not deal with this prior holding in blake.the legislature failure to address blake holding at that time is an indication of the legislature acceptance,as of,of this judicial interpretation of section.yoder ferguson,d,accepting argument,based on bruso,that legislature failure to alter relevant language of section in created presumption that legislature agreed with interpretation of statute in blake.
also applicable in this case is the rule that an amendment to a statute creates a presumption that the amendment was intended to change the law.people hicks.plaintiff cites this principle in arguing that the amendments included in public act,entitled tort reform act of,indicate that settled tortfeasors were not to be included in the apportionment of fault under the original,statute.plaintiff points,in particular,to the public act amendments to section of the code,which was titled,as amended limitation on recovery in tort actions fault.the amended section b defined tortfeasor as any person,excluding the injured person,whose fault is a proximate cause of the injury for which recovery is sought,regardless of whether that person is the plaintiff employer,regardless of whether that person is joined as a party to the action,and regardless of whether that person may have settled with the plaintiff.emphasis added.ilcs b west.plaintiff asserts that,under this amendment,settling tortfeasors were to be included on the verdict form.according to plaintiff,this amendment constituted a recognition by the legislature that settling tortfeasors were not originally included in the apportionment of fault.plaintiff cites hicks,which stated 
it is an elementary rule of statutory construction that t he addition of a new provision in a statute by amendment is an indication of the absence of its implied or prior existence.citation.absent substantial considerations to the contrary,an amendatory change in the language of a statute creates a presumption that it was intended to change the law as it theretofore existed.hicks,at.
in best taylor machine works,this court held public act unconstitutional in its entirety.as a result,section,as well as section,which also was amended by public act,reverted to the original language of the version,the language in effect prior to the adoption of public act.the effect of enacting an unconstitutional amendment to a statute is to leave the law in force as it was before the adoption of the amendment.people gersch.according to plaintiff,the amendment to include settling defendants in the apportionment of fault is a strong indication that the statute at issue in the case at not intended to include such defendants.
united responds that the amendments are irrelevant to the interpretation of section.united notes that the amendments were declared void ab initio and without legal effect.according to united,these amendments therefore have no bearing on the analysis of section.this argument misses the mark.
in contending that the amendments are relevant to the analysis,plaintiff does not argue that they are legally effective.instead,plaintiff simply cites the amendments as record evidence that is indicative of the original intent of the statute.we agree with plaintiff that the amendments are a compelling indication that settling defendants were not meant to be included in the apportionment of fault under the statute.
based on the principles set forth above regarding the legislature failure to amend a statute following a judicial construction and the amendment of a statute to add a new provision,we conclude that section,as enacted in,was never intended to include settling tortfeasors in the apportionment of fault.
although not necessary,additional support for this conclusion is found in statements made by illinois senator john cullerton during floor debate on senate bill,which is aimed at amending section.senate bill was passed by the senate on march,but remains pending in the house.while the statements of senator cullerton,a cosponsor of the bill,are nonbinding,they are nevertheless informative and serve to confirm our conclusion,reached above,regarding the meaning of section.
on march,during the discussion of senate bill,senator cullerton provided some historical background regarding section.senator cullerton stated that,since the enactment of section in,the law has been that if a defendant is less than negligent,that defendant only has to pay the percentage that the jury found the defendant liable,senate proceedings,march,at statements of senator cullerton.senator cullerton indicated that in a situation where the plaintiff settles with defendants,the plaintiff then continues the lawsuit against the remaining defendant,and after the verdict,there a subtraction from the verdict of the amount of money that the defendants who settled the case had to pay.and the remaining the remainder,senate proceedings,march,at statements of senator cullerton.senator cullerton emphasized that senate bill was intended to clarify what the intent of the law was.it just makes it clear,if you settle with somebody,their names do go on the verdict form,senate proceedings,march,at statements of senator cullerton.
notwithstanding the foregoing,united argues various policy reasons in support of its interpretation of section.united argues,for example,that the exclusion of settling defendants from the apportionment of fault results in unfairness.plaintiff,for her part,argues policy reasons as well.she contends,for example,that the inclusion of settling tortfeasors in the allocation of fault would discourage future settlements.deciding between such competing policy positions is,in our view,a task better left to the legislature.see heckendorn first national bank of ottawa,board of education of dolton school district miller,d.
in sum,we disagree with the appellate court holding that,under section,a remaining defendant culpability must be assessed relative to the culpability of all defendants,including settling defendants.we reverse that portion of the appellate court judgment reversing the circuit court as to liability.
we next consider united claim that the appellate court erred in affirming the amount of the damages award.united argues that because the appellate court reversed the circuit court as to liability,it should also have reversed as to damages.starting from the premise that damages flow from liability,united contends that,once the appellate court reversed as to liability,there were no damages for the appellate court to affirm.we need not resolve this question.our decision today reverses the appellate court judgment as to liability,effectively eliminating the basis for united claim that the damages award should have been reversed.
the remaining issue before us is whether the appellate court erred in concluding that united forfeited the right to challenge the damages amount.the appellate court held that united forfeited this issue by mentioning the damage award only in the concluding remarks section of its brief,without presenting it as a separate issue for review.specifically,the appellate court noted,united failed to set forth in its brief specific reasons or argument as to why the damage award was excessive or unreasonable and failed to specifically argue that the damage award was improper.d at.the appellate court pointed to supreme court rule h,which requires that arguments shall contain the contentions of the appellant and the reasons therefor,with citation of the authorities and the pages of the record relied on.h.
before this court,united argues that the appellate court erred by applying the doctrine of procedural default.a review of the appellate court application of the doctrine would necessarily require that we examine the briefs filed in the appellate court.however,united has failed to utilize supreme court rule c,which provides if it is important for the supreme court to know the contentions of any party in the appellate court,copies of the pertinent appellate court briefs certified by the clerk of that court may be filed in the supreme court.c.because the briefs filed by the parties in the appellate court are not a part of the record provided to this court,we are unable to review whether the appellate court erred in applying procedural default.
we affirm the judgment of the appellate court upholding the amount of the damages award.
in its petition for rehearing,united argues that this court,in light of its resolution of the section question,should address united concern that it was deprived of a sole proximate cause defense when the trial court refused its request for an instruction on sole proximate cause.we note that the issue was raised in the appellate court,but that court concluded that,because it was remanding for a new trial,it need not now address united contention.d at.because our opinion today reverses the appellate court judgment ordering a new trial,we remand the cause to the appellate court for a decision on united claim that the jury should have been instructed on sole proximate cause.
conclusion 
we affirm the appellate court upholding of the damages award,but reverse the remainder of the judgment of the appellate court.we hold that section does not apply to settling tortfeasors who have been dismissed from the lawsuit.we remand the cause to the appellate court for a decision on united claim that the jury should have been instructed on sole proximate cause.
appellate court judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part cause remanded with directions.
while i agree with the plurality determination that the meaning of the phrase defendants sued by the plaintiff is unclear,i disagree with its conclusion that an examination of the statute as a whole fails to clarify that meaning.therefore,i respectfully concur in the plurality opinion.
as this court recently noted in people perry,
the principles guiding our analysis are well established.our primary objective is to ascertain and give effect to legislative intent,the surest and most reliable indicator of which is the statutory language itself,given its plain and ordinary meaning.
see also illinois graphics nickum.nonetheless,w e do not view words and phrases in isolation but consider them in light of other relevant provisions of the statute.people beachem,quoting people campa.see also town country utilities,illinois pollution control board.here,an examination of the statute as a whole aids in the construction of the critical statutory phrase.
the first sentence of section provides 
except as provided in section,in actions on account of bodily injury or death or physical damage to property,based on negligence,or product liability based on strict tort liability,all defendants found liable are jointly and severally liable for plaintiff past and future medical and medically related expenses.emphasis added,ch,par.
in this sentence,the legislature limits the statute scope to specific categories of tort actions.only those defendants found liable in the specified actions are implicated.emphasis added,ch,par.the legislature decision to limit section application only to defendants in the specified categories of actions strongly suggests that the statute was intended to include only those defendants who remained in the action when liability was determined.under the express language of the first sentence of section,former defendants who are not parties in the specified tort action when liability is determined are not subject to joint and several liability for a plaintiff medical expenses.
the reach of the second and third sentences of section is similarly limited to the types of actions noted in the first sentence.therefore,the same limitation on the procedural status of the defendants subject to liability also applies to the final two sentences in the statute.in other words,those two sentences apply only in the same type of actions listed in the first sentence.they do not apply to other categories of legal actions.
a comparison of words used in all three sentences in section is instructive.the second and third sentences state 
any defendant whose fault,as determined by the trier of fact,is less than of the total fault attributable to the plaintiff,the defendants sued by the plaintiff,and any third party defendant who could have been sued by the plaintiff,shall be severally liable for all other damages.any defendant whose fault,as determined by the trier of fact,is or greater of the total fault attributable to the plaintiff,the defendants sued by the plaintiff,and any third party defendants who could have been sued by the plaintiff,shall be jointly and severally liable for all other damages,ch,par.
a comparison with the first sentence reveals that the legislature repeats the word defendants throughout the provision.nothing in the statute indicates that the legislature intended the word defendants to have a different meaning in the second and third sentences than it has in the first sentence.accordingly,the language chosen by the legislature in all three sentences appears to include in the allocation of fault for liability purposes only those defendants who remain in the tort action until verdict.
this interpretation also comports with the ordinary meaning of the word defendant.in webster third new international dictionary,a defendant is defined as a person required to make answer in an action or suit in law or equity or in a criminal action.emphasis added.webster third new international dictionary under this definition,a defendant must answer and defend against claims made in a legal action and must,therefore,be a party in the lawsuit.thus,under this definition,the need for opposition in an action or suit in law or equity establishes the adversarial nature of the relationship required between the plaintiff and any defendant in the action who is included in the apportionment of fault.this same adversarial relationship is expressly required by the first sentence of section,where all defendants found liable in the specified tort actions are jointly and severally liable for the plaintiff medical expenses.
additionally,construction of section comports with the use of the word defendant as a legal term of art.in black law dictionary,a defendant is defined as t he person defending or denying the party against whom relief or recovery is sought in an action or suit or the accused in a criminal case.emphases added.black law dictionary ed.applying this definition,a settled tortfeasor who has been dismissed from the lawsuit is no longer defending or denying and is no longer a party against whom relief or recovery is sought in an action or suit.emphasis added.
notably,the legislature chose to limit the allocation of fault to only three types of parties the plaintiff,the defendants sued by the plaintiff,and any third party defendants who could have been sued by the plaintiff,ch,par.by expressly creating three categories for the allocation of fault within the specified tort actions,the legislature signaled that fault should be apportioned only among those parties.the legislature did not choose to create a fourth category for former defendants or settled defendants.under the plain meaning of the relevant words,the absence of that express category signals the legislature intent to exclude persons or entities no longer engaged in an active relationship at the time of fault allocation.see,aldridge,where a statute lists the things to which it refers,there is an inference that all omissions should be understood as exclusions.therefore,i wholeheartedly agree with the plurality conclusion that section does not permit the allocation of fault to settling defendants that have been dismissed from the lawsuit.
this conclusion is consistent with our statements in unzicker kraft food ingredients,even though that case is not directly on point.in unzicker,this court determined that the language of section demonstrated the legislature intent to determine tort liability by dividing responsibility among those people in the suit who might have been responsible for the plaintiff injuries.emphasis added.unzicker,at.
although unzicker was superceded by statute,the amendments did not affect the statutory language at issue in this case,and unzicker is still applicable to the version of section.the statutory analysis in unzicker is instructive here.in unzicker,we noted that in enacting the version of section,the legislature referred to a division of fault among the plaintiff,the defendants sued by the plaintiff,and any defendants who could have been sued by the plaintiff.unzicker,at.
as this court recognized in unzicker,in apportioning responsibility under section,the legislature looked to those people in the suit.emphasis added.unzicker,at.unzicker explained that the party must already have been brought into the case by a defendant for that party to be included in the division of fault.unzicker,at.our decision in unzicker,therefore,is consistent with the plurality current,de novo,interpretation of section,holding that the legislature intended to divide responsibility only among those parties in the suit,not among those that have been dismissed.for the reasons stated,i specially concur in the plurality decision.
the plurality concludes that the phrase defendants sued by the plaintiff in section of the code of civil procedure ilcs west is ambiguous.it then construes the phrase as referring to only those defendants who were sued by the plaintiff but did not enter into a settlement agreement prior to the entry of judgment.at.at,at.i believe that the phrase defendants sued by the plaintiff unambiguously refers to those individuals or entities against whom the plaintiff filed suit.i,therefore,dissent.
plain meaning 
the plurality begins its analysis by noting that the phrase is not defined in the statute.at.at,at.the lack of a statutory definition could be seen as an indication of the legislature belief that the words it chose were so clear that they did not require further definition or that a standard legal dictionary would reveal that words are unambiguous.black law dictionary defines the word sue as t o institute a lawsuit against another party.black law dictionary ed.given this meaning,all three of the defendants in the present case were sued by the plaintiff.
as the plurality notes,a statutory term is ambiguous if it is capable of being understood by reasonably persons in two or more different senses.at.at,at,citing wade city of north chicago police pension board.although there is no reason to suppose that the legislature intended the word sued to carry any meaning other than the plain and simple definition found in the standard legal dictionary,the plurality finds ambiguity in two alternate usages given in a general usage dictionary.at.at,at.
while it is not inappropriate to utilize a general usage dictionary to determine the meaning of a statutory term,even if that term may also be found in a legal dictionary see,people beachem,finding use of the undefined statutory term custody to be ambiguous because the broad definition found in the legal dictionary was not clarified by the equally broad definition found in a general usage dictionary,the plurality overlooks the requirement that a term will be found to be ambiguous only if the two asserted meanings are themselves reasonable.in re.
as united points out,the legislature choice of the word sued,as opposed to some other form of the verb,renders only one of the two usages reasonable.the plurality dismisses the verb tense without discussion at.at,at.
it is well established that the tense of a verb used in a statute is an element of plain meaning.in re gwynne,concluding that the verb phrase in the statute is in the present perfect tense.see also ingalls shipbuilding,director,office of workers compensation programs,department of labor,d,the use of the present tense of the verb enter in the statutory phrase if the person entitled to compensation enters into a settlement agreement in g indicates that the person must be so entitled at the time of settlement emphasis omitted dole food patrickson,d,plain text of statute,because it is expressed in the present tense,reveals its meaning.
the dictionary entry for the word sue is immediately followed by the words sued sued suing sues.webster third new international dictionary.according to the dictionary explanatory notes,the principal parts of each verb are listed in the following order the past,the past participle,the present participle,and the present singular.the example is given of the entry for the verb tie,which contains the principal parts tied tied tying ties.webster third new international dictionary.thus,in ingalls shipbuilding,the supreme court found plain meaning based on the drafters use of the word enters,the present third person singular form of the verb enter.ingalls shipbuilding,at.at,d at.
sue,like tie,is a regular verb,that is,one whose past tense and past participle forms are created by the addition of d or ed.webster third new international dictionary.sued is both the past tense and the past participle of the verb sue,just as tied is both the past tense and the past participle of tie.
a participle is a nominal verb form used with an auxiliary verb to indicate certain tenses and also functioning independently as an adjective.webster ii new college dictionary.in the phrase defendants sued by the plaintiff,the word sued is used as a past participle.because no auxiliary verb is used,the word sued describes the defendants and,therefore,functions as an adjective.
participles,like the verbs from which they are derived,have not only tense,but voice.the voice of a verb shows whether the subject of the verb has performed the action active voice,or has received the action passive voice.shertzer,the elements of grammar.the active voice participles of the verb sue are suing in the present tense and having sued in the past tense.thus in the active voice,present tense the plaintiffs suing the corporation are former employees.and in the active voice,past tense the plaintiffs,having sued their employer,abandoned their workers compensation claims.
the passive voice participles are being sued in the present tense,sued in the past tense,and having been sued in the present perfect tense.in the passive voice,present tense the defendants being sued are the hospital,the physician,and the nurse.in the passive voice,present perfect tense the defendants,having been sued,tendered the matter to their insurance carrier.
the phrase used in section defendants sued by the plaintiff is in the passive voice,past tense.because it is in the past tense,it clearly refers to all defendants against whom the plaintiff filed suit.if the legislature had intended this provision to apply to only those defendants remaining in the lawsuit at the time of trial,it would have used the present tense of the participle.
reliance on the rules of grammar to determine whether statutory language is ambiguous is no more unusual than reliance on the dictionary definition of a statutory term.see,bowman american river transportation,stating that anyone well versed in statutory construction,or even english grammar would understand the plain meaning of the statutory provision at issue in re marriage of kates,distinguishing between an independent and a subordinate clause.this court should not utilize the generally accepted rules of grammar as a means of finding plain meaning in some cases,but ignore these rules in others.
indeed,the phrase defendants sued by the plaintiff employs a common and popularly understood construction consisting of a plural noun,a past participle,the preposition by,and a singular noun,as in films directed by george lucas,a phrase that clearly includes not only the film he is currently working on,but all of his previous movies.the phrase players coached by lovie smith includes not only the current roster of chicago bears players,but those he coached before coming to chicago.yet,the plurality willfully ignores the basic rules of grammar and popularly understood meaning to conclude that defendants sued by the plaintiff means only those defendants who remain in the case at the time the verdict is rendered.however,even if all three defendants in the present case had settled and it had never gone to trial,all three would still be defendants sued by the plaintiff.
in sum,the plain meaning of the statutory language,which best indicator of legislative intent michigan avenue national bank county of cook,is consistent with the simple definition found in black law dictionary and the first of the two usages described in webster.united,midwest,and bmw are all defendants sued by the plaintiff because the plaintiff instituted a lawsuit against each of them black law dictionary ed,seek ing justice by legal process,by bring ing an action against them webster third new international dictionary.
the second usage found in webster,to proceed with a legal action and follow up to proper termination webster third new international dictionary,is not a reasonable reading of the phrase in the context of section.in this sense,not even united was a defendant sued by the plaintiff until after the trial court entered judgment on the jury verdict.it would be absurd to read the term sued to refer only to those defendants against whom judgment has been entered when the statute as a whole is designed to operate during trial.see michigan avenue national bank,at,all provisions of a statute are to be viewed as a whole words and phrases are not to be viewed in isolation,but must be interpreted in light of other relevant provisions of the statute.
because the phrase defendants sued by the plaintiff in the context of section is reasonably capable of only one meaning,it is unambiguous and our responsibility is to give effect to the intent of the legislature.
construction of the statute 
having found section ambiguous,the plurality employs two canons of statutory construction to determine its meaning.first,the plurality applies the canon that where the legislature amends the statute after it has been judicially construed,it may be presumed that the legislature acquiesces in the court construction.at.at,at.second,the plurality applies the canon that an amendment to a statute may be presumed to be intended to change the law.at.at,at.
although i believe that no construction is necessary because the meaning of the statute is plain,i must comment on the manner in which the plurality employs these tools of statutory construction because i believe that this decision may cause this court and our circuit and appellate courts to improperly apply these tools in future cases.
the plurality applies these two canons in reverse chronological order.i believe that it is simpler to apply them in historical sequence.thus,i begin at the beginning.
the operative language defendants sued by the plaintiff was enacted in.pub.act,eff.november.in,this court discussed section of the code in its decision in lannom kosco.i agree with the plurality that lannom did not interpret the statutory language at issue at.at,at and,therefore,does not provide any guidance in this case.in,the appellate court decided blake hy ho restaurant,d,settling defendants are not to be included in the apportionment of fault under section.
the next significant event in the history of section was its amendment as part of public act,commonly referred to as the tort reform act of.under this amendment,fault was to be apportioned among the defendant being held liable at trial and all other tortfeasors,as defined in section,whose fault was a proximate cause of the injury or death.section defined tortfeasor as any person,excluding the injured person,whose fault is a proximate cause of the death,bodily injury to person,or physical damage to property for which recovery is sought,regardless of whether that person is the plaintiff employer,regardless of whether that person is joined as party to the action,and regardless of whether that person may have settled with the plaintiff.pub.act,eff.march,subsequently held unconstitutional in its entirety in best taylor machine works.
in discussing this failed amendment to section,the plurality employs the canon of construction that an amendment to a statute is evidence of a legislative intent to change the law.at.at,at,citing people hicks.thus,the plurality concludes,the general assembly clear and unequivocal intent to include settling defendants in the apportionment of fault signals that,prior to this amendment,settling defendants were not included in the apportionment of fault.
the plurality,however,relies on an incomplete statement of the canon of construction dealing with subsequent amendments.as recently as,this court has stated that an amendment of an unambiguous statute indicates a purpose to change the law,while no such purpose is indicated by the mere fact of an amendment of an ambiguous provision.williams staples,quoting v.a p enterprises.this canon reflects the commonsense notion that if a statute is ambiguous,a subsequent amendment will clarify the statute rather than change the law by replacing the intent of the enacting legislature with the intent of the amending legislature.
this places the plurality in a.if,as the plurality asserts,the phrase defendants sued by the plaintiff is ambiguous,the amendment can not be used to reveal a presumed intent to change the law.their reliance on this canon is,therefore,entirely misplaced.in my opinion,the phrase is unambiguous and,therefore,it is inappropriate to utilize this or any other canon of construction.
this court again considered the meaning and application of section in unzicker kraft food ingredients,a case not mentioned in the plurality opinion.the plaintiff worked for a contractor,installing pipes at a plant owned by kraft.after he was seriously injured while on the job,he applied for and was awarded workers compensation benefits.he sued kraft,which filed a complaint against the employer.unzicker,at.
at the time the injury occurred,section provided that for purposes of determining whether defendant would be held jointly and severally liable,his fault was to be compared to the fault of the plaintiff,the defendants sued by the plaintiff,and any third party defendants who could have been sued by the plaintiff.ilcs west.the question for this court was whether the employer,who was immune from liability under the workers compensation act ilcs et west,was nevertheless a defendant who could have been sued by the plaintiff.see unzicker,at.
this court did not specifically state in unzicker whether it found the phrase to be ambiguous.it did,however,agree with the appellate court interpretation,including the conclusion that the clear legislative intent in section was that minimally responsible defendants should not be responsible for entire judgments.unzicker,at,citing unzicker kraft food ingredients,d.in addition,this court noted that reading the phrase third party defendants who could have been sued by the plaintiff to include employers who were immune from further liability under the workers compensation act was consistent with the existing body of law holding that immunity under the workers compensation act is in the nature of an affirmative defense that must be raised in the trial court if the plaintiff brings a suit.unzicker,at.this court further noted that if the legislature intended to use language that would exclude employers,we believe that it would have simply put in language specifically excluding employers.unzicker,at.
the plurality does not mention unzicker,yet it is relevant to the amendment to section that added the phrase except the plaintiff employer.see pub.act,eff.june.in assessing the significance of this amendment,the plurality ignores the legislature clear intent to supersede this court decision in unzicker in favor of employing the canon of construction that when the legislature chooses not to amend a statute after a judicial construction,it is presumed to acquiesce in the court statement of the legislative intent.at.at,at citing wakulich mraz,and bruso alexian brothers hospital.
the plurality overstates the power of the canon.because the canon is a tool of construction and not a rule of law,the court may rely upon the canon to presume legislative intent to acquiesce if circumstances warrant,but it goes too far to say that such intent is presumed see perry,at.the basis for applying the presumption is very weak where,as here,the legislature was clearly acting for a specific purpose,that is,to supersede this court holding in unzicker,which involved a different portion of the statute than is at issue in the present case.
the plurality nevertheless finds that the legislature implicitly acquiesced in the appellate court holding in blake because it failed to address blake holding at that time.at.at,at.i have several concerns about the manner in which the plurality applies this canon of construction.
first,while it is true that we have utilized this canon in the past,we have done so in the context of deeming the legislature to be aware of and,thus,acquiescing in previous constructions of this court.in wakulich,for example,we noted that we had considered and rejected the plaintiff suggested reading of the dramshop act eight years previously in charles seigfried.we observed that prior to our decision in charles,the general assembly had considered imposing some form of social host liability upon adults who furnish alcohol to underage persons at least six times,but that such attempts were rejected.wakulich,at.we then noted that since our decision in charles,the general assembly had considered,but not adopted,several bills that would have superseded our holding in that case.applying the acquiescence canon,we concluded that although the legislature had continued to amend the statute in other respects,it had made no change that would have superseded this court previous and interpretation that the dramshop act was intended to preempt the entire field of liability.wakulich,at.
in the present case,however,the plurality is applying the canon to presume that when the legislature acted for the specific purpose of rejecting this court holding in unzicker,it is to be presumed that it was aware of and acquiesced in the appellate court holding eight years previously in blake,a case that was not even cited in our unzicker decision because it construed an entirely different phrase in the same statute.the plurality provides no legislativ
