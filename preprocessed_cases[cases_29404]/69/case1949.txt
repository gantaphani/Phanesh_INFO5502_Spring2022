following the trial court sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend,plaintiff deharo street investors appeals from a dismissal of its third amended complaint alleging that defendant department of housing and community development the department breached a contract regulatory agreement by denying plaintiff request to increase rents in an apartment building for which plaintiff received a loan in exchange for renting units to households under a statutory and regulatory scheme health,et,tit,et.the regulatory agreement,as well as the underlying scheme,called for the department to approve specified rent increases if plaintiff proved specified matters to the department satisfaction.plaintiff challenges the trial court conclusions that dismissal was warranted because plaintiff complaint was uncertain as to whether it alleged the rent increase was mandatory or discretionary,and plaintiff sole avenue for relief for a discretionary increase was a petition for writ of mandate code civ,rather than a breach of contract and declaratory relief action we shall conclude plaintiff complaint pled a viable cause of action for breach of contract and that plaintiff may also pursue his claim for declaratory relief.we shall therefore reverse the judgment 
background 
health and safety code section authorizes the department to establish a special user housing rehabilitation program the program under which it may make loans to sponsors for the rehabilitation or the acquisition and rehabilitation of rental housing developments to be occupied by eligible households of very low and low income.the statute provides prior to disbursement of any funds pursuant to this section,the department shall enter into a regulatory agreement with the sponsor which provides for the limitation on profits in the operation of the rental housing development upon recordation of the agreement in the office of the county recorder in the county in which the real property subject to such agreement is located,the agreement shall be binding upon the sponsor for the loan term up to years.health,subd.d.as pertinent to this case,t he department shall fix and alter,from time to time,a schedule of rents on each development as may be necessary to provide residents of the rental housing development with affordable rents,to the extent consistent with the financial integrity of such development.no sponsor shall increase the rent on any unit without the prior permission of the department which shall be given only if the sponsor affirmatively demonstrates that such increase is required to defray necessary operating costs or to avoid jeopardizing the fiscal integrity of the housing development.health,subd.e.a department regulation for the program states in part that the sponsor may request a rent increase if it can demonstrate,to the department satisfaction,that the increase is necessary due to unforeseeable cost increases and to preserve fiscal integrity,tit,subd.c.
plaintiff filed a series of complaints alleging the department,by denying plaintiff request for a rent increase,breached the regulatory agreement executed by plaintiff and the department pursuant to the program.the original complaint which,according to the department,was never served is not part of the record on appeal appellant appendix in lieu of clerk transcript.
the first amended complaint was a declaratory relief action to interpret the regulatory agreement.the department moved for judgment on the pleadings,arguing in part that,to the extent plaintiff alleged denial of a discretionary rent increase,it had to proceed by petition for writ of administrative mandamus under section.the department argued a declaratory relief action is appropriate to enforce mandatory obligations but is not appropriate for review of administrative discretion,for which section is the only proper avenue for relief 
the trial court granted the motion with leave to amend,stating the court was unable to determine from the current pleading whether plaintiff was alleging failure to perform a mandatory or a discretionary act.
the second amended complaint alleged claims for breach of contract and declaratory relief.the department demurred,arguing the pleading failed to identify whether plaintiff was claiming breach of a mandatory or discretionary nature,and administrative mandamus was plaintiff sole remedy.the trial court sustained the demurrer,stating the pleading was still uncertain,and if plaintiff was claiming the department inappropriately exercised its discretionary authority,plaintiff sole remedy was a section petition.although the demurrer was sustained without leave to amend,the court later granted plaintiff leave to file a third amended complaint 
the third amended complaint the operative pleading raised counts for breach of contract and declaratory relief.the pleading alleged plaintiff,a for profit bought castle garden apartments apartments in sacramento county in.in november,plaintiff entered an agreement with the department pursuant to the program,whereby plaintiff obtained a loan to rehabilitate the housing for households.the parties executed a number of documents,including a regulatory agreement.
the third amended complaint alleged 
the regulatory agreement states it reflects a loan pursuant to the program under health and safety code section et.health and safety code section,subdivision e,says the department shall fix rents as may be necessary to provide residents of the rental housing development with affordable rents,to the extent consistent with the financial integrity of such development.no sponsor shall increase the rent on any unit without the prior permission of the department which shall be given only if the sponsor affirmatively demonstrates that such increase is required to defray necessary operating costs or to avoid jeopardizing the fiscal integrity of the housing development.health,subd.e.
the regulatory agreement defines fiscal integrity to mean that the total of operating income plus funds released pursuant to the regulatory agreement from the operating reserve account is sufficient to pay all current operating expenses,pay all current debt service,fully fund for at least twelve consecutive months all reserves established pursuant to the regulatory agreement,maintain a debt service coverage ratio as specified in the regulatory agreement,and pay other extraordinary costs permitted by the regulatory agreement.
the complaint quoted paragraph f of the regulatory agreement,which provides borrower may apply to the department for a greater rent increase than allowed by paragraph above.the department shall grant such increase if the borrower can demonstrate,to the department satisfaction,that the increase is necessary to pay for unanticipated increases in costs related to the assisted units and to preserve fiscal integrity.the borrower may not receive a greater rent increase,however,on the grounds that fiscal integrity is threatened by a shortfall in nonresidential income,unanticipated expenses attributable to nonresidential spaces or other financial problems attributable to nonresidential space or nonassisted units.italics added.
plaintiff alleged it asked the department,and the department unreasonably denied,requested rent adjustments,even though the adjustments were supported by unanticipated increases in plaintiff costs to the assisted units,were necessary to preserve fiscal integrity,and were at or below rental levels allowed by the regulatory agreement.
the pleading alleged given that this case involves the disputed contract terms,a paradigm of mandatory rental adjustments versus discretionary rental adjustments is inapplicable,the requested rent adjustments,and the ensuing dispute,are governed by the parties intentions,the contract,and the enabling statutes and regulations.given the myriad rules of contractual construction,the department has breached the parties contract by unreasonably withholding approval of plaintiff requested rent adjustments.
plaintiff alleged the parties construe the disputed contract terms differently.in plaintiff view,the department breaches the disputed contract terms when it unreasonably withholds approval of requested rent adjustments that would provide for appropriate rental rates for low income and very low income households,and as well,provide revenue sufficient to cover amortized principal,interest,and distributions.in the department view,the disputed contract terms need not provide for revenue sufficient to cover amortized principal,interest,and distributions even when rental rates generating such revenue would be at or below permissible rates for low income and very low income households.the disputed contract terms should be construed in accordance with the parties intentions,the contract provisions,the enabling legislation,and the department regulatory provisions.
the third amended complaint then quoted statutes,regulations,and contract provisions which allegedly showed the parties intention that rents would cover amortized principal,interest,and distributions,as long as rents remained at or below specified levels.the pleading alleged the department loaned plaintiff approximately million for forty years at the below market rate of percent plaintiff has rented of the apartments units to households during the forty year loan period and the department was to approve annual rental rates for the units that a did not exceed an arithmetic formula set forth in the contract,and b permitted plaintiff to cover its operating expenses,debt service,and distributions when appropriate in order to encourage private owners like plaintiff to provide affordable rental units.
the complaint alleged,the contract includes no hearing process and none occurred here if a dispute arises between the parties as to the annual rental rates for the affected units of the apartments.
the complaint alleged that for and thereafter,the department breached the contract by not approving rental rates that a did not exceed the contract maximum levels,and b covered plaintiff operating expenses,debt service,and distributions.the complaint alleged the department breach of the contract damaged plaintiff by resulting in less rental income than permitted by the contract,in an amount in excess of.
the department demurred to the third amended complaint,arguing the pleading was still uncertain in that it failed to identify whether plaintiff was claiming breach of mandatory or discretionary authority plaintiff received an administrative hearing,albeit of a purely documentary nature,satisfying section and plaintiff failed to state facts sufficient to allege breach of contract.
the trial court sustained the demurrer to the third amended complaint,without leave to amend.
the judgment of dismissal states in part 
plaintiff alleges the department breached the agreement when it refused plaintiff request for an increase in the rental rates.in its complaint,plaintiff fails to distinguish between mandatory and discretionary increases.in fact it appears from the complaint that plaintiff is relying on discretionary increases.at the same time it appears that it is using the discretionary provisions to bolster claims for a mandatory increase.
the court has previously ruled that plaintiff must proceed by writ of mandamus if it is challenging a discretionary decision by the department.the court has also ruled that plaintiff must identify which exercise of the department authority it is challenging.plaintiff continues to ignore the distinction and pleads that the paradigm of mandatory rental adjustments versus discretionary rental adjustments is inapplicable.the court disagrees.
plaintiff must proceed by writ of mandate if it seeks to challenge the department denial of proposed rent increases based on paragraph f of the regulatory agreement,discretionary increases.
since this is plaintiff fourth attempt to state a cause of action and since plaintiff continues to ignore the court directions to distinguish between mandatory and discretionary increases,the court concludes that plaintiff is unable or unwilling to amend the complaint to state a cause of action.hence,the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
plaintiff appeals from the judgment of dismissal.

standard of review 
on appeal from a judgment dismissing an action after sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded.aubry hospital dist.cal th,d.we do not,however,assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of law.ibid.our review is de novo.mccall pacificare of,cal th,d.
ii.section does not apply 
the trial court concluded plaintiff sole remedy was a petition for administrative mandamus pursuant to section.we respectfully conclude the trial court erred.
plaintiff alleged that no administrative hearing occurred in this case,which we accept as true for purposes of reviewing the demurrer and which is supported by law.
the writ of administrative mandamus authorized by section applies only to claims challenging administrative orders or decisions made as the result of a proceeding in which by law a hearing is required to be given,evidence is required to be taken,and discretion in the determination of facts is vested in the administrative tribunal,subd.a.in order for section to apply,the hearing must be required by law.lightweight processing county of ventura d.
here,no statute or regulation required the department to hold a hearing on plaintiff request for a rent increase.the parties appear to agree plaintiff simply submitted its request in writing,as it was required to do by the regulations and the regulatory agreement,tit,subd.b,subd.f.as indicated,health and safety code provides,the department shall fix and alter,from time to time,a schedule of rents on each development as may be necessary to provide residents of the rental housing development with affordable rents,to the extent consistent with the financial integrity of such development.no sponsor shall increase the rent on any unit without the prior permission of the department which shall be given only if the sponsor affirmatively demonstrates that such increase is required to defray necessary operating costs or to avoid jeopardizing the fiscal integrity of the housing development.health,subd.e.a department regulation for the program states in part that the sponsor may request a rent increase if it can demonstrate,to the department satisfaction,that the increase is necessary due to unforeseeable cost increases and to preserve fiscal integrity,tit,subd.c.
thus,no hearing was required by law.
where,as here,an agency makes a decision based upon one party unilateral submissions of information and documents,without taking and considering evidence from opposing parties,no hearing occurs within the meaning of section.royal convalescent hospital,state board of control d.unilateral submission of grievance to agency and administrative appeal based solely on information from claimant was not a hearing under section.
the department argues plaintiff written request for a rent increase,and the department denial of the request based upon its review of his paperwork,constituted a paper hearing.the department cites case law such as friends of the old trees department of forestry fire protection th,d friends,which said that purely documentary proceedings can satisfy the hearing requirement of section,so long as the agency is required by law to accept and consider evidence from interested parties before making its decision.id.at,d.the department cites regulations,tit,subd.f,subd.b requiring landlords to apply for rent increases in writing.
however,even assuming the department review of plaintiff request could be characterized as a hearing,it does not trigger section review unless the hearing was required by law lightweight,supra,d at,which was not the case here.
moreover,even if a purely documentary hearing can satisfy section,there must still be something in the nature of a hearing,an adversarial process in which the agency resolves disputed facts after affording interested parties an opportunity to present evidence.the cases cited by the department involved input from opposing parties.carrancho california air resources bd.th,d public meetings,workshops,and ample opportunity for input from public regarding plan to divert rice straw left over after harvest friends,supra,th at,d defendant approval of a timber harvesting plan by law provided numerous opportunities for public and agency input and required defendant to respond in writing to environmental concerns.
black law dictionary ed at page defines hearing in administrative law as a ny setting in which an affected person presents arguments to an agency ballentine law dictionary ed at page defines hearing in administrative law as t he presentation of a case or defense before an administrative agency,with opportunity to introduce evidence in chief and on rebuttal,and to witnesses,as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.
section contemplates an adversarial hearing grounded in due process.thus,mcgill regents of university of california th,d mcgill,held a trial court erred in applying section review to a university decision to deny tenure to a mathematics professor.he was reviewed by a variety of committees,with input from the mathematics department and outside reviewers,but he had no due process rights to a full adversarial hearing on denial of tenure.id.at,d.
here,no law required the department to entertain input from interested parties such as tenants or to allow plaintiff an opportunity for rebuttal.
we conclude no administrative hearing was required by law,and therefore section does not apply to this case.the trial court thus erred in dismissing plaintiff case based on section.
iii.breach of contract versus traditional mandamus 
plaintiff argues its complaint seeks relief for breach of contract,not breach of a legal duty,and therefore traditional mandamus is either inapplicable or an alternative remedy,and plaintiff should be allowed to choose to pursue its action for breach of contract.the department argues plaintiff real claim is not breach of contract but a challenge to an administrative decision exercising discretionary authority allowed by law,and therefore mandamus would be plaintiff sole remedy,but the complaint lacks sufficient facts to state a mandamus claim.
we shall conclude plaintiff can pursue a breach of contract action.
alleged breach re discretionary rent increase 
we first clarify our understanding of plaintiff complaint as presenting a dispute about a discretionary rent increase,not a mandatory increase.
as we have indicated fn,ante,the department position in the trial court was that the complaint was unclear as to whether plaintiff was claiming a mandatory rent increase under paragraph e of the regulatory agreement,or a discretionary rent increase under paragraph f.it is true the complaint did not allege whether plaintiff viewed the department denial of the rent increase as an abuse of discretion.however,it is clear from plaintiff complaint that plaintiff sought a rent increase under paragraph f the paragraph for discretionary increases,not paragraph e,of the regulatory agreement.thus,the complaint quoted paragraph f,alleged plaintiff request for an increase was justified in language parroting paragraph f,and did not quote or use language from paragraph e in the complaint.
we note the complaint also alleged that,in plaintiff view,the department breached the disputed contract terms by unreasonably denying the request.we recognize the word reasonably appears in a provision of the regulatory agreement that may or not apply here,paragraph c says the borrower landlord shall request approval for rent increases at least days before the end of the fiscal year,and p rovided that the department reasonably determines that borrower is in full compliance with all provisions of this agreement,that borrower request is in full conformance with this section and that the amount of the request is in compliance with subsection below,department shall not deny approval of borrower request.italics added.plaintiff says this provision by its own terms applies only to paragraph e mandatory increases which are not at issue in this case,not paragraph f discretionary increases.at this stage,it is not necessary for us to resolve whether or not this paragraph applies.even if it does not,the contract language quoted in the complaint,for a paragraph f discretionary rent increase,is that the department shall grant such increase if the landlord can demonstrate its necessity to the department satisfaction.reasonableness may be a component of satisfaction.guntert city of stockton d.
moreover,it has long been the rule in california that where a contract confers on one party a discretionary power affecting the rights of the other,a duty is imposed to exercise that discretion in good faith and in accordance with fair dealing.citations.cal.lettuce growers union sugar cal d,followed in perdue crocker national bank cal d.in kendall ernest pestana,cal d,our supreme court applied the lettuce growers rule to require a lessor,who had the power to approve an assignee of a written lease,to exercise the power in accordance with commercially reasonable standards.kendall,supra,at.and the rule has been applied to a public entity with the discretionary power to fix rates.orange county cable communications city of san clemente d.
we therefore respectfully disagree with the trial court that plaintiff complaint was fatally uncertain,as failing to plead whether the department had breached a mandatory or discretionary duty.read in its entirety,the complaint pleads that the department breached a discretionary duty by acting in an unfair and commercially unreasonable manner by failing to provide plaintiff with sufficient revenue to cover amortized principal,interest,and distributions.
plaintiff can pursue a contract action 
plaintiff argues it had a viable contract action,and therefore traditional mandamus was not an available remedy,because mandamus is available only if there is no adequate remedy at law.plaintiff prefers the contract remedy because judicial review in mandamus is more deferential to the agency decision.bunnett regents of university of california th,d bunnett when review is sought by means of ordinary mandate the inquiry is limited to whether the decision was arbitrary,capricious,or entirely lacking in evidentiary support.
the department argues mandamus was the only available remedy.according to the department,the contract at issue does no more than incorporate the relevant law under statutes and regulations,indeed the contract is titled regulatory agreement,and therefore when the department denies a discretionary rent increase,it is not breaching a contract but rather applying the law to a set of facts in a manner.the department maintains that any challenge to a discretionary administrative action must be by way of mandamus.
we shall conclude plaintiff can pursue its claim in an action for breach of contract.
as a general proposition,mandamus is not an appropriate remedy for enforcing a contractual obligation against a public entity.citations.shaw regents of university of california th,d wenzler municipal court d.there are at least two reasons for this rule the first is that contracts are ordinarily enforceable by civil actions,and the writ of mandamus is not available unless the remedy by civil action is inadequate.citations.the other is that the duty which the writ of mandamus enforces is not the contractual duty of the entity,but the official duty of the respondent officer or board furthermore,the law imposes upon municipal corporations and their officers no special duty to carry out the terms of contracts or to refrain from breaches of contractual relations.they are not singled out,as distinguished from other corporate entities or other individuals,as especially enjoined to observe contractual obligations and when the writ of mandate is applied for,there must be a clear case to compel the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins as a duty resulting from an office,trust or station.wenzler,supra,d at.mandamus not available because person seeking return of criminal fines after dismissal of criminal prosecution had adequate remedy at law under theory.for the same reasons mandamus is generally said not to be an appropriate remedy for
