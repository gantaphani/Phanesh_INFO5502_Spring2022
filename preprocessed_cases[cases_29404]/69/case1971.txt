this case involves a dispute.in the published portion of the opinion we hold that damages for emotional distress are available under civil code former section,subdivision b in the unpublished portion of the opinion we reject the landlord challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence,the argument that a statute of limitations should apply and the argument that the court erred in awarding punitive damages because the record lacks evidence of actual damages.
in the,which also is unpublished,we conclude that the trial court should have allowed all of the tenants to testify in the damages portion of trial.even though not all of the tenants testified during the liability phase,the trial court found that the entire complex had serious unresolved roach and water problems throughout.we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
in two consolidated cases in,plaintiffs sued realty,victoria apartments,and hee cho each plaintiff was a tenant of a unit at victoria apartments,which consisted of four buildings and units.hee cho owned the apartments and realty managed the buildings while plaintiffs alleged numerous causes of action,the only successful ones were for breach of warranty of habitability and negligent and intentional violations of statutory duties.the unsuccessful causes of action included negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
prior to trial,tenants brought a motion to allow representative testimony on the issue of damages or,in the alternative,to bifurcate the issue of liability and damages.tenants counsel indicated that the trial estimate of days could be shortened to days by bifurcating the liability and damages portion of trial.tenants counsel explained that liability could be proven through the use of videos,photos,and experts,without requiring each plaintiff to testify.the parties agreed to have a bench trial on liability and subsequently agreed to a bench trial on damages.
liability trial 
tenants testified in the liability phase of trial.their testimony described an infestation of cockroaches in their units and in the common areas.pictures showed glue traps filled with cockroaches.tenants expert testified that he saw to roaches in every unit he inspected though he did not identify which units he inspected.
the tenants also complained of rust in the water.they testified that they did not drink the water and either purchased bottled water or water filters.they also testified that they were forced to bathe in and cook with the discolored water.one tenant showed the court discolored water from his unit.tenants described the water variously as yellow,light brown,and dark brown.
other tenants had more individual complaints such as pigeons and pigeon droppings incomplete repairs to their units inoperable appliances,including heaters and air conditioners inoperable electrical outlets floods termites paint carpet and a lack of either hot or cold water.several tenants complained about mold in the bathrooms,which some explained was painted over but never removed.in one unit,the bathroom ceiling collapsed.the malfunctioning elevator was another common complaint,with several tenants testifying that they were stuck in the elevator.
three health specialists from the los angeles county health department and two inspectors from the los angeles department of building and safety testified.they identified the following problems cockroaches,leaky faucets,mold,inoperable ventilation,inoperable appliances,pigeons and pigeon droppings.the inspectors provided reports that documented the problems found in each unit that was inspected.
when the building was inspected in,the plumbing had deteriorated.the piping eventually was replaced,but not within a reasonable time.timothy day visited the apartments times from november through october,and each time noted housing code violations.percent of the plumbing was in disrepair.the deficiencies were not corrected by the compliance date.after repeat inspections,some of the violations were corrected,but new violations were identified at each inspection.
hee cho and his wife,man park,the manager,and a few tenants testified for the defense.according to them,the water was clear and they never saw more than one or two,if any,cockroaches.a defense expert testified that the water was potable,but did not test the water for rust.there was evidence that pest control provided services on a monthly basis and was adequately performed according to pest control expert,james mcelroy.
liability findings 
the court found hee cho and victoria apartments partnership appellants or landlord breached the warranty of habitability and violated section.realty was found not liable.the court explained given the extent of testimony and the various notices by county and city inspectors,it is reasonable to infer that,at least,the entire complex has had serious unresolved roach and water problems throughout.moreover,the court finds that these problems are enough to conclude that the apartment complex was untenantable and subject to civil code section as pled by plaintiffs.the court found that dirty,unsanitary water in an apartment house qualifies as untenantable.
the court also held that only the plaintiffs who testified in the liability portion of trial could present evidence of damages.plaintiffs,be they spouses or otherwise,have presented no evidence of a basis of liability tort or contractual damages.the court exempted children for whom the testifying plaintiff was a guardian ad litem.
finally,with respect to the culpability necessary for a punitive damage award,the court found that appellants acted with malice in that their despicable conduct was carried on with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others,testifying plaintiffs.
damages trial 
tenants testified in the damages portion of trial.the tenants testimony regarding damages was similar.they were worried,concerned,frustrated,and upset.the housing conditions were stressful.some were ashamed to invite friends to their units.the tenants were inconvenienced by the water condition and described themselves as victims of conditions beyond their control.one tenant wedding gift,a carpet,was ruined,when her unit flooded.
damages findings 
twenty plaintiffs were awarded in actual damages,in special damages,and in punitive damages.tenants who did not testify in both trials received no recovery.the court found insufficient evidence to find any damage to the children who were represented by their guardians ad litem.
both sides appealed 
discussion 
appellants argue that the court erred in finding liability because not all of the requirements of section were satisfied.they also argue that an award for actual damages within the meaning of subdivision a of section can not be premised solely on emotional distress.in addition,they argue that there was no substantial evidence of emotional distress.finally,appellants contend the court should have applied a statute of limitations instead of a limitations period.tenants,in their,argue that the court should have allowed all of the tenants to testify at the damages portion of trial.
substantial evidence supports the trial court liability findings 
ii.award of damages for emotional distress 
section allows a tenant to recover actual damages,subd.a.here,the tenants testified to embarrassment,anger,fear,stress,helplessness,and frustration.some tenants testified that they were required to throw out food because of roaches.a few tenants testified that they were too embarrassed to invite friends into their apartments.most of the tenants described emotional distress,not physical damage.the parties dispute whether actual damages as used in section includes damages for emotional distress.
