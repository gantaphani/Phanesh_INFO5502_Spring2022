subsequently,the case was transferred to the court of federal claims for trial.as indicated,we earlier heard the breach of contract claims on appeal from the trial court and,determining contrary to the trial court view that breaches had occurred in certain years,we reversed and remanded the proceedings to the trial court for a determination of damages the trial court on remand awarded central in cost of cover damages,but denied any expectancy damages.central timely appeals the denial of expectancy damages.
we conclude that the trial court erred by not properly considering the effect of reclamation announced breaches on the amount of water that central may have expected to need to meet demand.this caused the trial court to discount central arguments regarding what would have happened in the world.accordingly,we affirm the trial court judgment granting cost of cover damages but vacate the trial court judgment denying expectancy damages,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
