william leonard pickard,an inmate at the federal correctional institution in victorville,california,seeks enforcement of his freedom of information act request to the drug enforcement administration for records pertaining to confidential informant gordon todd skinner.in response to pickard foia request,the dea submitted a glomar response refusing to confirm or deny the existence of any responsive records pertaining to skinner,citing exemptions and c,d and f of the act.pickard argues that the government is prohibited from submitting a glomar response because skinner has already been officially confirmed as a confidential informant in conformity with c,and that the government now should move on to the next step and produce a vaughn index.
we hold today that because the government officially confirmed skinner status as an informant in open court in the course of official proceedings,the government can not continue to neither admit nor deny skinner informant status in response to a foia request.this is not to say that all documents related to skinner are subject to disclosure.we simply hold that since skinner has already been officially identified as an informant by government counsel and agents,the cat is out of the bag and the government must proceed to the next step provide an index of the documents it has and make whatever additional objections to disclosure it deems appropriate.
procedural background 
on january,pickard submitted a request to the dea,an agency that is part of the united states department of justice,for information and documents pertaining to dea informant skinner.pickard specifically sought any information on skinner criminal history including records of arrests,convictions,warrants,or other pending cases,records of all case names,numbers,and judicial districts where he testified under oath,records of all monies paid in his capacity as a federal government informant,all records of instances where the dea intervened on his behalf to assist him in avoiding criminal prosecution,all records of administrative sanctions imposed for dishonesty,false claims,or other deceit,all records of any benefits of any nature conferred,all records of deactivation as a confidential informant and the reasons for deactivation,and all records concerning skinner participation in criminal investigations.
on february,the dea denied pickard request.citing foia exemptions and c,and without confirming or denying the existence of any records relating to skinner,the dea advised pickard that he would have to provide either proof of death or a privacy waiver from skinner before any information would be released.pickard appealed to the office of information and privacy.the oip upheld the dea response,and pickard filed a complaint in the district court to enforce his foia request.
after the district court reviewed the complaint and ordered it served,the dea moved for summary judgment arguing that the privacy act,subsections j and k,and foia exemptions and c,d and f,applied to pickard request.the district court denied the motion without prejudice,noting that the dea had not adequately justified its response to the request.the dea again moved for summary judgment,this time fully briefing why a glomar response the practice of refusing to confirm or deny the existence of records pertaining to a named individual,was appropriate to pickard request and attaching a declaration in support of its response.
pickard filed an opposition in which he cited to another district court decision on a motion in limine by the government.in that motion,the government sought to prevent pickard from submitting certain evidence at trial to impeach skinner.in its ruling,the district court stated that t he government provided the court with skinner dea informant file and suggested that the court conduct an in camera review to determine if there were any other occasions where skinner had served as an informant.united states pickard,d.pickard opposition also included a declaration of his own,attesting that at his criminal trial dea agent karl nichols testified that skinner acted as an informant in pickard case.pickard declaration also notes that dea agent ralph sorrell also testified at the trial about skinner identity and activities as an informant.pickard also cites to decisions from the tenth circuit and from the district court in his criminal case from which it can be deduced that the government called skinner as a witness at pickard trial and elicited testimony from skinner and dea agents in which they each specifically acknowledged that skinner had acted as a confidential informant.see,united states aperson,cir referring to testimony provided by skinner,the government primary confidential informant united states pickard,d,united states pickard,d,addressing government motion in limine regarding evidence offered to impeach skinner.the government contests the admissibility of certain evidence offered by pickard,but does not otherwise dispute that department of justice attorneys at pickard criminal trial elicited testimony in open court from skinner and dea agents that identified skinner as a confidential informant.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the government,holding that skinner identity as a confidential informant had not been officially confirmed within the meaning of c,and that a glomar response was appropriate under exemptions c and d.

discussion 
the freedom of information act calls for broad disclosure of government records.cia sims.however,congress has recognized that public disclosure is not always in the public interest,and has therefore provided the nine exemptions listed in b.aclu dep t of defense,internal citation and quotation marks omitted.given the foia broad disclosure policy,the united states supreme court has consistently stated that foia exemptions are to be narrowly construed.wolf cia,quoting dep t of justice julian.the dea may,however,provide a glomar response,refus ing to confirm or deny the existence of records where to answer the foia inquiry would cause harm cognizable under a foia exception.wolf,at internal quotation marks omitted.
pickard argues that the dea glomar response is improper is this case because the department of justice has officially confirmed skinner status as a confidential informant within the meaning of c by calling him as a witness in pickard criminal trial and eliciting testimony from skinner and from dea agents that identifies skinner as an confidential informant.subsection c states 
whenever informant records maintained by a criminal law enforcement agency under an informant name or personal identifier are requested by a third party according to the informant name or personal identifier,the agency may treat the records as not subject to the requirements of this section unless the informant status as an informant has been officially confirmed.
c.where an informant status has been officially confirmed,a glomar response is unavailable,and the agency must acknowledge the existence of any responsive records it holds.boyd criminal div.of dep t of justice.
the district court held that the dea glomar response was valid because skinner identity as a confidential informant had not been officially confirmed under subsection c.to determine whether skinner identity had been officially confirmed,the district court applied the standard for the official acknowledgment of information.see afshar dep t of state.a fact is deemed officially acknowledged only if it meets three criteria 
first,the information requested must be as specific as the information previously released.second,the information requested must match the information previously disclosed we noted,for example,that official disclosure did not waive the protection to be accorded information that pertained to a later time period.third,we held that the information requested must already have been made public through
