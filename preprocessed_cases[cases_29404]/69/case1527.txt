kansas gas and electric company kg e,kansas city power light company kcpl,and kansas electric power cooperative,kepco collectively the kansas companies suffered damages due to the government partial breach of the standard contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel high level radioactive waste standard contract.in june,the united states court of federal claims conducted a trial and awarded the kansas companies.
in determining the amount of damages,the trial court correctly did not award damages for cost of capital and for the costs associated with researching alternative storage options for spent nuclear fuel snf and high level radioactive waste hlw.the trial court also appropriately reduced the kansas companies damages by the value of the benefit they received as a result of their mitigation activities.however,the trial court erred by not accepting the kansas companies reasonable method for calculating overhead costs.therefore,this court and the trial court damages award.
in,congress enacted the nuclear waste policy act of nwpa.pub,stat.codified at.the nwpa authorized the department of energy doe to enter into contracts for the collection and disposal of snf and hwl.a.the standard contract required the owners of snf and hlw to pay fees into the nuclear waste fund,in exchange for which the doe would begin to dispose of the snf and hlw not later than january.a b.
on october,the kansas companies entered into the standard contract with doe.gas united states,kg e.the kansas companies collectively own wolf creek nuclear operating,which operates the wolf creek generating station wolf creek,a nuclear power plant located near burlington,kansas.id.at.wolf creek nuclear reactor initially operated with fuel assemblies.id.when fuel assemblies no longer efficiently generate energy,the plant is refueled.the refueling process removes the spent fuel assemblies from the reactor core and places them into storage cells in racks located in wolf creek spent fuel pool.the parties refer to this storage option as wet storage.id.
while government performance should have begun in,not all utilities would have expected recovery of their spent fuel at this time.see yankee atomic united states,explaining the role of the standard contract acceptance rate.in this case,the record shows that the government first scheduled collection of wolf creek snf would have been in.kg e.at.
as early as,the kansas companies anticipated they would need to pursue alternative storage options for wolf creek if doe declined to accept spent fuel by.id.at.the kansas companies tasked matthew morris,the nuclear engineer responsible for administering the standard contract at wolf creek,with exploring options to create more available space in wolf creek spent fuel pool.id.wolf creek principal engineer for nuclear fuels,scott ferguson,also researched additional storage options.id.at.
the kansas companies concluded their spent fuel storage study in.the report evaluated six options plant design increased storage dry storage technologies shipment to private interim storage facilities shipment to a federal facility and,combinations of the first five alternatives.id.at.the report concluded that the best three options were reracking the storage pool,dry cask storage,or a combination of the two.id.at.
the kansas companies ultimately decided to rerack the storage pool.id.under this option,they removed the existing racks from the pool,replaced them with higher density racks,and placed them closer together while still maintaining sufficient cooling flow.id.the kansas companies installed the racks with the help of a contractor,holtec international.
while conducting the rerack,the kansas companies both increased their storage capacity and used racks that could support higher enrichment fuel assemblies.joint app.at.these higher enrichment fuel assemblies allowed wolf creek to achieve the same energy output from the reactor with fewer fuel assemblies.this reduced the number of assemblies purchased and discharged.id.at.the rerack project was completed in the spring of.kg e.at.
of course,the government did not proceed to collect and dispose of snf and hlw on january.this court has previously held that the government thus partially breached the standard contract with the nuclear energy industry.see states power united states,and me.yankee atomic power united states.therefore,the trial court in this case focused on the quantum of damages owed to the kansas companies on account of the government breach.the trial court found that even if the government had not breached the standard contract,wolf creek would have run out of wet storage by,necessitating alternative storage measures.id.at.thus,the trial court,in applying this court precedent in yankee atomic power united states,required the kansas companies to both prove their damages and show what costs,if any,they would have experienced absent the breach.kg e.at.
the kansas companies presented numerous alternative storage measures they would have pursued in the world.the trial court found that the kansas companies would have pursued a measure wherein wolf creek would receive credit for the soluble boron already present in the water in the spent fuel storage pool.id.at.boron is a neutron absorber that can control the reactivity of spent fuel,and the nuclear regulatory commission had issued criticality credit to several utilities for the boron present in their pools.this credit would have allowed wolf creek to store fuel assemblies at a greater density,thus resolving its storage issues.
the trial court also found that the kansas companies would have performed a analysis in the world.id.at.due to the structure of wolf creek pool,storage cells were directly under a large moveable gate which,if it accidently fell into the pool,could have damaged fuel assemblies stored below.id.at.these storage cells could not be used without doing the appropriate analysis to show that,if the gate was to drop,that it would not damage the fuel causing a release.id.at.this analysis would have occurred in the world,allowing wolf creek to store fuel in these cells.the trial court found such an analysis would have cost at least.id.at.
after determining the costs in the world,the trial court examined the kansas companies direct costs of mitigating the government breach.the trial court awarded million for the rerack project,less in costs that the kansas companies minimally would have incurred but for the breach id.the trial court disallowed the kansas companies claim for the costs associated with the alternative storage options study conducted by morris and ferguson.specifically,the trial court noted that morris and ferguson adequately accounted for their time in studying all options,but made no effort to apportion this time to the rerack alternative id.at.
the trial court also awarded overhead costs.the kansas companies divided overhead into three pools of costs labor overhead,material overhead,and construction overhead.id.at.the parties did not dispute the labor overhead.id.in operating wolf creek,the kansas companies account for overhead costs using a allocation method.id.at.they have used this method since,and the method complies with federal energy regulatory commission ferc regulations regarding the allocation of costs between a particular capital project versus the applicable overhead account.id.at.
the trial court concluded that the kansas companies use of accounting was reasonable for business purposes,but stated that what makes for good business accounting does not translate automatically into a fair and reasonable apportionment of damages.id.at.the trial court found that the allocation method included the cost of construction materials in its base overhead rate,the inclusion of which unreasonably inflates the amount of construction overheads.id.at.thus,the trial court reduced the kansas companies construction overhead award by sixty percent,or the approximate percentage amount of material charges relating to the rerack project compared with the total cost of the project.id.thus,this judgment awarded the kansas companies their requested labor and material overhead costs,but only for construction overhead.
lastly,the trial court found that the kansas companies realized a real world savings due to the ability to use higher enrichment fuel assemblies at wolf creek.id.at.the net effect of the rerack was a savings of at least,and the trial court reduced the kansas companies total award by this amount.the total award to the kansas companies was.
the kansas companies appeal the trial court reduction in damages for the supposed benefit they received from the new fuel racks.they also appeal the trial court analysis of their construction overhead costs.lastly,they appeal the trial court refusal to award damages for the costs of studying alternative storage options and for their costs of capital.

as a general rule,a party is not entitled,through the award of damages,to achieve a position superior to the one it would reasonably have occupied had the breach not occurred.lasalle talman bank,united states,citing allen farnsworth,farnsworth on contracts ed.see also united states city of twin falls,cir contract damages to party are reduced by gains after breach because contract damages seek only to fairly compensate the injured party for his loss restatement second of contracts cmt.e the injured party is limited to damages based on his actual loss caused by the breach.if he makes an especially favorable substitute transaction,so that he sustains a smaller loss than might have been expected,his damages are reduced by the loss avoided as a result of that transaction.
damages do not extend to remote consequences of the breach.similarly,mitigation efforts may result in direct savings that reduce the damages claim.lasalle,at citizens fed.bank,fsb united states,finding that the benefits of mitigation must be credited to the government as the breaching party.thus,where the defendant wrong or breach of contract has not only caused damage,but has also conferred a benefit upon plaintiff which he would not otherwise have reaped,the value of this benefit must be credited to defendant in assessing the damages.lasalle,at quoting charles mccormick,handbook on the law of damages.
the kansas companies claim the trial court erred in reducing their damages by for the benefits they received from the rerack project,the ability to use fuel and purchase fewer fuel assemblies.the kansas companies claim that any benefit they received was too remote and not directly related to the breach because the decision to pursue more highly enriched fresh nuclear fuel was an independent business decision and influenced by the market price of uranium conversion,enrichment,and fabrication.corrected brief for plaintiffs appellants.they also argue that the benefit was not immediate because it accrued over time as wolf creek procured fresh fuel for its reactor.
the trial court correctly reduced the kansas companies damages to account for efficiency benefits from the rerack project.first,the kansas companies acquired higher enrichment fuel as a direct consequence of the decision to rerack the wet storage pool.to alter either the storage configuration of the wet storage pool or the enrichment levels of fuel used at wolf creek,the nrc had to approve a license amendment.joint app.at.in,as part of its mitigation efforts,wolf creek sought nrc approval to both rerack its fuel storage pool and to use higher enrichment fuel assemblies.see environmental assessment,fed.reg,the proposed action would revise the wolf creek technical specifications to allow an increase in the wolf creek spent fuel pool sfp storage capacity and to allow an increase in the maximum nominal fuel enrichment to nominal weight percent u.notice of issuance of amendment.march,granting the amendment to wolf creek license.
the kansas companies internal engineering and contract documents also confirm that the purpose of the rerack project was both to increase wolf creek spent fuel storage capacity and to allow an increase in the maximum allowable nominal fuel enrichment stored in the spent fuel pool to nominal weight percent.joint app.at.indeed,richard muench,former president and chief executive officer of wolf creek,testified that the kansas companies conducted an evaluation to show it was more economical to switch to higher enrichment fuel,and that they took the opportunity to go to the higher enrichment at the same time we were switching our racks.id.at emphasis added.thus the record shows that the decision to pursue higher enrichment fuel assemblies was not an independent business decision but part and parcel of the kansas companies mitigation efforts.
the record also shows that the higher enrichment fuel assemblies produced a benefit.morris testified that the new racks allowed wolf creek to use higher enrichment fuel assemblies and thus to purchase fewer assemblies.kg e.at joint app.at.muench confirmed that the net effect of switching wolf creek to higher enrichment fuel was a savings of hundreds of thousands of dollars per cycle,and that at least four fuel cycles had occurred since mitigation.kg e.at joint app.at.the trial court found that this constituted a savings,and accordingly reduced the damages.this court does not lightly disturb such a factual finding.citizens federal bank united states,denying the government request to reduce damages in a winstar case because,while the government was entitled to reduction in damages for any benefit obtained through the breach as a matter of law,the thrift did not in fact realize any of these benefits.
the kansas companies argue that this benefit was too remote because it accrued over time as influenced by market forces.as noted above,the kansas companies chose at the time of the breach and mitigation to pursue higher enrichment fuel assemblies.the benefit of fuel cost savings does not sever its connection to the kansas companies mitigation efforts.
this court upheld a similar damages determination in lasalle talman bank,a winstar case.talman bank,in mitigation of the government breach of contract,received a cash infusion of million.because the cash infusion was a direct result of the government breach,this court upheld a reduction in damages to account for benefits arising from the infusion.at.ultimately,the benefit was calculated as the earnings generated by the million cash infusion from the date of mitigation to.lasalle talman bank,united states,aff.this court did not change that reduction even though the plaintiff earnings resulted from uncertain market forces over time.the same result applies in this case.
by enhancing the racks to accommodate fuel assemblies,the kansas companies mitigated the government breach in a way that produced a benefit.while the passage of time causes greater realization of the benefit and market forces may influence a future valuation of the benefit,the kansas companies have,as of the time of this litigation,received a benefit as a direct result of their mitigation activity.thus,the trial court correctly reduced the kansas companies damages by the amount of the benefit received in mitigating the government partial breach of the standard contract.
this court precedent in dominion resources,united states,does not alter this decision.in dominion,the government asserted that because dominion disposal fee was not yet payable because of the government breach,dominion may have profited by having use of the money in the meantime.id.at.this court affirmed the trial court and refused to allow the government to question whether dominion received a benefit,but it did so as a matter of contractual interpretation.id.at.the standard contract provides options for the payment of the fee and expressly states that if the utility chooses to wait to pay the fee,interest is to be calculated from april,to the date of the payment based upon the week treasury bill rate.id.at.because the parties agreed ex ante to a fee with interest at the treasury bill rate,dominion could not ask for increased damages should its investment of the fee return less than the rate,and the government could not ask for a reduction in damages should dominion investments return more.id.at.this case does not feature the contractual concerns that governed the dominion case.
the kansas companies incurred overhead costs when managing their rerack operations to mitigate the breach.the kansas companies maintain an accounting system which tracks and apportions all overhead costs.the accounting system,termed a allocation methodology,uses a process to determine the percentage overhead rate.
in the first step,the capitalized administrative costs,indirect labor costs,and labor overheads on indirect labor for each department are split between capital projects and plant operations based on the amount of work the department does to support each of those functions.kg e.at joint app.at.the portion assigned to capital projects is called the available to allocate pool.for example,the kansas companies accounting department allocated of the ceo time towards construction projects,and of his time to plant operations.joint app.at.thus,of the ceo labor costs were allocated towards the plant total construction overhead.
next,the available to allocate pool is divided by the total costs of the planned capital projects for the year for the capital budget.kg e.at.this equation yields the construction overhead rate.the end result of the total cost allocation method is that the largest capital projects receive the largest share of the overhead pool allocations,while smaller capital projects receive smaller allocations.id.
the kansas companies make these calculations annually.joint app.at.however,throughout any given year,these calculations are compared against actual expenditures on direct costs to account for any discrepancies.review of the overhead rate occurs on at least a quarterly basis.kg e.at.
the kansas companies have used the allocation method for material overhead and construction overhead calculations since.id.at.this accounting method complies with ferc accounting regulations.ferc requires that all major electric utilities meet certain accounting standards called the uniform system of accounts.see.the standards require utilities to use an accounting system that properly measures,inter alia,direct and indirect overhead construction costs.id.the records must be so kept as to show the total amount of each overhead for each year,the nature and amount of each overhead expenditure charged to each construction work order and to each electric plant account,and the bases of distribution of such costs.id.in this case,the record shows that the kansas companies cost accounting method complied with ferc regulations.kg e.at.
as explained in indiana michigan,damages for breach of contract are recoverable where the damages were reasonably foreseeable by the breaching party at the time of contracting the breach is a substantial causal factor in the damages and the damages are shown with reasonable certainty.at citing energy capital united states.once a company has proved that certain work was undertaken because of the breach,it may proceed to prove the amount of the associated cost including both direct and indirect costs by any available and reasonable technique.energy nw.united states.these reasonable techniques need not prove damages with cartesian certainty.id.citing ferguson controls mega,llc.
this court upholds an internal accounting system as showing overhead costs with reasonable certainty when it allocates a portion of the expenses to a particular project using codes,carolina power light united states,when it allocates according to accepted accounting principles,energy,at,and when it allocates with accounting procedures that comply with mandatory ferc regulations,system fuels,united states.see also.yankee nuclear power entergy nuclear.yankee,reversing the court of federal claims when it denied damages for overhead costs despite acknowledging that the utility accounting practices followed gaap and ferc regulations consolidated edison of,entergy nuclear indian point,llc,reversing the court of federal claims denial of damages for overhead costs when the utility proved the costs with a separate accounting system compliant with ferc regulations.
this case bears strikingly similarity to system fuels and consolidated edison.in each of these cases,the utilities in question maintained a separate accounting system to allocate overhead costs,and these accounting methods were compliant with ferc regulations and generally accepted accounting principles gaap.consolidated edison,at.fuels,at.in each of these cases,the trial court found that the method employed by the utilities was imprecise,resulting in inflated overhead costs,and it denied portions of the utilities overhead costs as a result.in each of these cases,this court reversed the trial court,holding that where the utilities used accounting procedures as mandated by ferc and consistent with gaap,the utilities accounting records sufficiently demonstrated damages with reasonable particularity.consolidated edison,at.fuels,at.
in light of this record,the trial court erred by denying the kansas companies a portion of their overhead damages calculated via the allocation method.the kansas companies used an internal accounting system which coded costs to specific projects,the allocation rates were on a regular basis in order to reflect actual capital project costs,and the allocation method complied with required ferc accounting regulations.the trial court explicitly recognized that the allocation method was a reasonable technique,stating the court has no quarrel with the plaintiffs damages expert characterization of wolf creek use of the method as a reasonable form of cost accounting for business purposes.the fact that wolf creek has used this method since confirms this point.kg e.at.therefore,this court reverses the trial court denial of damages for overhead costs calculated via the allocation method as inconsistent with precedent and the record.
the kansas companies also appeal the trial court denial of damages for the costs of a report authored by morris and ferguson.the report,begun in,analyzed nearly two dozen spent fuel storage options.joint app.at.while the total hours spent by morris and ferguson in preparing the report were adequately accounted for,the trial court stated that b ecause no effort was made to apportion this time to the rerack alternatives,the court disallows the additional morris and ferguson labor.kg e.at.
viewing the record as a whole,this court notes that the trial court found,and the kansas companies have not challenged,that the first scheduled collection of wolf creek spent fuel in the world would have occurred in.id.at.but,as the trial court also found,would have been one year too late for wolf creek by spring,accumulating snf would have overcome wolf creek dwindling available storage,necessitating alternative storage measures.id.the trial court concluded that,after reviewing its options,wolf creek most likely would have pursued using soluble boron to lower the reactivity of the storage pool,thus mitigating its dwindling storage capacity.
thus,the record shows that wolf creek would have had to pursue alternative storage measures in both the breach and worlds.in other words,it would have needed similar research in both worlds to determine future options.the trial court denied breach world damages for the costs of such research b ecause no effort was made to apportion this time to the rerack alternatives id.at.in other words,the kansas companies did not meet their burden of proving any overlap between the costs of studying alternative storage options in the breach versus the worlds.without record evidence about
