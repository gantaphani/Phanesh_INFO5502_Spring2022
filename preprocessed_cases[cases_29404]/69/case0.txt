title,as amended by the court interpreters act,includes compensation of interpreters among the costs that may be awarded to prevailing parties in lawsuits.in this case,the district court awarded costs to respondent as the prevailing party in a civil action instituted by petitioner.the award included the cost of translating from japanese to english certain documents that respondent used in preparing its defense.the ninth circuit affirmed,concluding that covers the cost of translating documents as well as the cost of translating live speech.
held because the ordinary meaning of interpreter is someone who translates orally from one language to another,the category compensation of interpreters in does not include the cost of document translation.
a section reflects the substance of an act that specified for the first time what costs are allowable in federal court.that provision defines the term costs as used in federal rule of civil procedure d,which gives courts the discretion to award costs to prevailing parties.crawford fitting gibbons.as originally configured,contained five categories of taxable costs,but in,congress enacted the court interpreters act,which added a sixth category that includes compensation of interpreters.
b because the term interpreter is not defined in the court interpreters act or in any other relevant statutory provision,it must be given its ordinary meaning.asgrow seed winterboer.when congress passed that act in,many dictionaries defined interpreter as one who translates spoken,as opposed to written,language.legal dictionaries also generally defined interpreter and interpret in terms of oral translation.respondent relies almost exclusively on a version of webster third new international dictionary that defined interpreter as one that translates esp a person who translates orally for parties conversing in different tongues.although the sense divider esp for especially indicates that the most common meaning of the term is one who translates orally,that meaning is subsumed within the more general definition one that translates.that a definition is broad enough to encompass one sense of a word does not establish,however,that the word is ordinarily understood in that sense.see mallard united states dist.court for southern dist.of iowa.although all relevant dictionaries defined interpreter at the time of the statute enactment as including persons who translate orally,only a handful defined the word broadly enough to encompass translators of written materials.notably,the oxford english dictionary,one of the most authoritative,recognized that interpreter can mean one who translates writings,but it expressly designated that meaning as obsolete.any definition of a word that is absent from many dictionaries and is deemed obsolete in others is hardly a common or ordinary meaning.given this survey of relevant dictionaries,the ordinary meaning of interpreter does not include those who translate writings.nothing in the court interpreters act or in hints that congress intended to go beyond this ordinary meaning.if anything,the statutory context suggests that interpreter includes only those who translate orally.see.moreover,congress use of technical terminology reflects the distinction in relevant professional literature between interpreters,who are used for oral conversations,and translators,who are used for written communications.
c no other tool of construction compels a departure from the ordinary meaning of interpreter.this court has never held that rule d creates a presumption in favor of the broadest possible reading of the costs enumerated in.to the contrary,the court has made clear that the discretion granted by rule d is not a power to evade the specific categories of costs set forth by congress,crawford fitting,supra,at,but is solely a power to decline to tax,as costs,the items enumerated in,ibid.this court conclusion is in keeping with the narrow bounds of taxable costs,which are limited by statute and modest in scope.respondent extratextual arguments that documentary evidence is no less important than testimonial evidence and that some translation tasks are not entirely oral or entirely written are more properly directed at congress.in any event,neither argument is so compelling that congress must have intended to dispense with the ordinary meaning of interpreter in.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice alito delivered the opinion of the court.
the costs that may be awarded to prevailing parties in lawsuits brought in federal court are set forth in.the court interpreters act amended that statute to include compensation of interpreters.see also,stat.the question presented in this case is whether compensation of interpreters covers the cost of translating documents.because the ordinary meaning of the word interpreter is a person who translates orally from one language to another,we hold that compensation of interpreters is limited to the cost of oral translation and does not include the cost of document translation.
this case arises from a personal injury action brought by petitioner kouichi taniguchi,a professional baseball player in japan,against respondent kan pacific saipan,the owner of a resort in the northern mariana islands.petitioner was injured when his leg broke through a wooden deck during a tour of respondent resort property.initially,petitioner said that he needed no medical attention,but two weeks later,he informed respondent that he had suffered cuts,bruises,and torn ligaments from the accident.due to these alleged injuries,he claimed damages for medical expenses and for lost income from contracts he was unable to honor.after discovery concluded,both parties moved for summary judgment.the united states district court for the northern mariana islands granted respondent motion on the ground that petitioner offered no evidence that respondent knew of the defective deck or otherwise failed to exercise reasonable care.
in preparing its defense,respondent paid to have various documents translated from japanese to english.after the district court granted summary judgment in respondent favor,respondent submitted a bill for those costs.over petitioner objection,the district court awarded the costs to respondent as compensation of interpreters under.explaining that interpreter services can not be separated into translation and interpretation,app.to pet.for cert,the court held that costs for document translation fal l within the meaning of compensation of an interpreter,ibid.finding that it was necessary for respondent to have the documents translated in order to depose petitioner,the court concluded that the translation services were properly taxed as costs.
the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed both the district court grant of summary judgment and its award of costs.the court rejected petitioner argument that the cost of document translation services is not recoverable as compensation of interpreters.the court explained that the word interpreter can reasonably encompass a translator,both according to the dictionary definition and common usage of these terms,which does not always draw precise distinctions between foreign language interpretations involving live speech versus written documents.more importantly,the court stressed,this construction of the statute is more compatible with rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,which includes a decided preference for the award of costs to the prevailing party.ibid.the court thus concluded that the prevailing party should be awarded costs for services required to interpret either live speech or written documents into a familiar language,so long as interpretation of the items is necessary to the litigation.at.
because there is a split among the courts of appeals on this issue we granted certiorari.
although the taxation of costs was not allowed at common law,it was the practice of federal courts in the early years to award costs in the same manner as the courts of the relevant forum state.alyeska pipeline service wilderness society.in,congress enacted a statute that authorized the awarding of certain costs to prevailing parties based on state law 
that there be allowed and taxed in the supreme,circuit and district courts of the united states,in favour of the parties obtaining judgments therein,such compensation for their travel and attendance,and for attornies and counsellors fees as are allowed in the supreme or superior courts of the respective states.act of,stat.
although twice reenacted,this provision expired in.alyeska pipeline,supra,at,crawford fitting gibbons.yet even in the absence of express legislative authorization,the practice of referring to state rules for the taxation of costs persisted.see alyeska pipeline,at.
not until did congress enact legislation specifying the costs allowable in federal court,at.the impetus for a uniform federal rule was largely the consequence of two developments.first,a great diversity in practice among the courts had emerged.ibid.second,losing litigants were being unfairly saddled with exorbitant fees for the victor attorney.ibid.against this backdrop,congress passed the fee act,which we have described as a act specifying in detail the nature and amount of the taxable items of cost in the federal courts.at.the substance of this act was transmitted through the revised statutes of and the judicial code of to the revised code of,where it was codified,without any apparent intent to change the controlling rules,as,at.
federal rule of civil procedure d gives courts the discretion to award costs to prevailing parties.that rule provides in relevant part unless a federal statute,these rules,or a court order provides otherwise,costs other than attorney fees should be allowed to the prevailing party.rule d.we have held that defines the term costs as used in rule d.crawford fitting,at.in so doing,we rejected the view that the discretion granted by rule d is a separate source of power to tax as costs expenses not enumerated in.ibid.
as originally configured,contained five categories of taxable costs f ees of the clerk and marshal f ees of the court reporter for all or any part of the stenographic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the case f ees and disbursements for printing and witnesses f ees for exemplification and copies of papers necessarily obtained for use in the case and d ocket fees under section of this title.stat.in,congress enacted the court interpreters act,which amended to add a sixth category compensation of court appointed experts,compensation of interpreters,and salaries,fees,expenses,and costs of special interpretation services under section of this title.see also,stat.we are concerned here with this sixth category,specifically the item of taxable costs identified as compensation of interpreters.
to determine whether the item compensation of interpreters includes costs for document translation,we must look to the meaning of interpreter.that term is not defined in the court interpreters act or in any other relevant statutory provision.when a term goes undefined in a statute,we give the term its ordinary meaning.asgrow seed winterboer.the question here is what is the ordinary meaning of interpreter 
many dictionaries in use when congress enacted the court interpreters act in defined interpreter as one who translates spoken,as opposed to written,language.the american heritage dictionary,for instance,defined the term as o ne who translates orally from one language into another.american heritage dictionary.the english dictionary defined the related word interpret as to translate orally.english dictionary.similarly,the random house dictionary defined the intransitive form of interpret as to translate what is said in a foreign language.random house dictionary of the english language emphasis added.and,notably,the oxford english dictionary defined interpreter as o ne who translates languages,but then divided that definition into two senses a translator of books or writings,which it designated as obsolete,and o ne who translates the communications of persons speaking different languages spec.one whose office it is to do so orally in the presence of the persons a dragoman.oxford english dictionary see also concise oxford dictionary of current english ed.one who interprets one whose office it is to translate the words of persons speaking different languages,esp.orally in their presence chambers twentieth century dictionary one who translates orally for the benefit of two or more parties speaking different languages a translator obs.
legal dictionaries also generally defined the words interpreter and interpret in terms of oral translation.the edition of black law dictionary,for example,defined interpreter as a person sworn at a trial to interpret the evidence of a foreigner to the court,and it defined interpret in relevant part as to translate orally from one tongue to another.black law dictionary,ed.see also anderson,a dictionary of law one who translates the testimony of witnesses speaking a foreign tongue,for the benefit of the court and jury abbott,dictionary of terms and phrases used in american or english jurisprudence one who restates the testimony of a witness testifying in a foreign tongue,to the court and jury,in their language but see ballentine law dictionary,ed.defining interpreter as o ne who interprets,particularly one who interprets words written or spoken in a foreign language,and interpret as to translate from a foreign language 
against these authorities,respondent relies almost exclusively on webster third new international dictionary hereinafter webster third.the version of that dictionary in print when congress enacted the court interpreters act defined interpreter as one that translates esp a person who translates orally for parties conversing in different tongues.webster third the sense divider esp for especially indicates that the most common meaning of the term is one who translates orally,but that meaning is subsumed within the more general definition one that translates.see words a supplement to webster third explaining that esp is used to introduce the most common meaning included in the more general preceding definition for respondent,the general definition suffices to establish that the term interpreter ordinarily includes persons who translate the written word.explaining that the word interpreter can reasonably encompass a translator,the court of appeals reached the same conclusion,at.we disagree.
that a definition is broad enough to encompass one sense of a word does not establish that the word is ordinarily understood in that sense.see mallard united states dist.court for southern dist.of iowa,relying on the most common meaning and the ordinary and natural signification of the word request,even though it may sometimes double for demand or command the fact that the definition of interpreter in webster third has a sense divider denoting the most common usage suggests that other usages,although acceptable,might not be common or ordinary.it is telling that all the dictionaries cited above defined interpreter at the time of the statute enactment as including persons who translate orally,but only a handful defined the word broadly enough to encompass translators of written material.see supra,at.although the oxford english dictionary,one of the most authoritative on the english language,recognized that interpreter can mean one who translates writings,it expressly designated that meaning as obsolete.see supra,at.were the meaning of interpreter that respondent advocates truly common or ordinary,we would expect to see more support for that meaning.we certainly would not expect to see it designated as obsolete in the oxford english dictionary.any definition of a word that is absent from many dictionaries and is deemed obsolete in others is hardly a common or ordinary meaning.
based on our survey of the relevant dictionaries,we conclude that the ordinary or common meaning of interpreter does not include those who translate writings.instead,we find that an interpreter is normally understood as one who translates orally from one language to another.this sense of the word is far more natural.as the seventh circuit put it robert fagles made famous translations into english of the iliad,the odyssey,and the aeneid,but no one would refer to him as an interpreter of these works.extra equipamentos e exportação ltda.case.
to be sure,the word interpreter can encompass persons who translate documents,but because that is not the ordinary meaning of the word,it does not control unless the context in which the word appears indicates that it does.nothing in the court interpreters act or in,however,even hints that congress intended to go beyond the ordinary meaning of interpreter and to embrace the broadest possible meaning that the definition of the word can bear.
if anything,the statutory context suggests the opposite that the word interpreter applies only to those who translate orally.as previously mentioned,congress enacted as part of the court interpreters act.the main provision of that act is a,codified in and.see stat.particularly relevant here is.as it now reads,that statute provides for the establishment of a program to facilitate the use of certified and otherwise qualified interpreters in judicial proceedings instituted by the united states.a.subsection d directs courts to use an interpreter in any criminal or civil action instituted by the united states if a party or witness speaks only or primarily a language other than the english language or suffers from a hearing impairment so as to inhibit such party comprehension of the proceedings or communication with counsel or the presiding judicial officer,or so as to inhibit such witness comprehension of questions and the presentation of such testimony.d as originally enacted,subsection k mandated that the interpretation provided by certified interpreters shall be in the consecutive mode except that the presiding judicial officer may authorize a simultaneous or summary interpretation.k,supp.ii see also stat.in its current form,subsection k provides that interpretation shall be in the simultaneous mode for any party and in the consecutive mode for witnesses,unless the court directs otherwise.the simultaneous,consecutive,and summary modes are all methods of oral interpretation and have nothing to do with the translation of writings taken together,these provisions are a strong contextual clue that congress was dealing only with oral translation in the court interpreters act and that it intended to use the term interpreter throughout the act in its ordinary sense as someone who translates the spoken word.as we have said before,it is a normal rule of statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.gustafson alloyd,quoting department of revenue of acf industries,
the references to technical terminology in the court interpreters act further suggest that congress used interpreter in a technical sense,and it is therefore significant that relevant professional literature draws a line between interpreters,who are used for oral conversations,and translators,who are used for written communications.zazueta,supra,at see also frankenthaler,skills for bilingual legal personnel while the translator deals with the written word,the interpreter is concerned with the spoken language brislin,introduction,in translation applications and research brislin ed.explaining that when both terms are used together,translation refers to the processing of written input,and interpretation to the processing of oral input emphasis deleted herbert,interpreter handbook ed.in the jargon of international organisations,the words translate,translations,translator are used when the immediate result of the work is a written text and the words interpret,interpreter,interpretation when it is a speech delivered orally that congress specified interpreters but not translators is yet another signal that it intended to limit to the costs of oral,instead of written,translation 
in sum,both the ordinary and technical meanings of interpreter,as well as the statutory context in which the word is found,lead to the conclusion that does not apply to translators of written materials 
no other rule of construction compels us to depart from the ordinary meaning of interpreter.the court of appeals reasoned that a broader meaning is more compatible with rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,which includes a decided preference for the award of costs to the prevailing party.at.but we have never held that rule d creates a presumption of statutory construction in favor of the broadest possible reading of the costs enumerated in.to the contrary,we have made clear that the discretion granted by rule d is not a power to evade the specific categories of costs set forth by congress.crawford fitting,at.rather,we have said,it is solely a power to decline to tax,as costs,the items enumerated in.ibid.rule d thus provides no sound basis for casting aside the ordinary meaning of the various items enumerated in the costs statute,including the ordinary meaning of interpreter.
our decision is in keeping with the narrow scope of taxable costs.although costs has an everyday meaning synonymous with expenses,the concept of taxable costs under rule d is more limited and represents those expenses,including,for example,court fees,that a court will assess against a litigant.wright,miller,kane,federal practice and procedure,ed.hereinafter wright miller.taxable costs are limited to relatively minor,incidental expenses as is evident from,which lists such items as clerk fees,court reporter fees,expenses for printing and witnesses,expenses for exemplification and copies,docket fees,and compensation of experts.indeed,the assessment of costs most often is merely a clerical matter that can be done by the court clerk.hairline creations,kefalas.taxable costs are a fraction of the nontaxable expenses borne by litigants for attorneys,experts,consultants,and investigators.it comes as little surprise,therefore,that costs almost always amount to less than the successful litigant total expenses in connection with a lawsuit.wright miller,at.because taxable costs are limited by statute and are modest in scope,we see no compelling reason to stretch the ordinary meaning of the cost items congress authorized in.
as for respondent extratextual arguments,they are more properly directed at congress.respondent contends that documentary evidence is no less important than testimonial evidence and that it would be anomalous to require the losing party to cover translation costs for spoken words but not for written words.brief for respondent.respondent also observes that some translation tasks are not entirely oral or entirely written,at.one task,called sight translation,involves the oral translation of a document,at.another task involves the written translation of speech.ibid.and a third task,called document comparison,involves comparing documents in the source and target language to verify that the two are identical,at.respondent argues that a narrow definition can not account for these variations and that a definition of interpreter as someone who translates spoken and written words would avoid complication and provide a simple,administrable rule for district courts.
neither of these arguments convinces us that congress must have intended to dispense with the ordinary meaning of interpreter in.first,congress might have distinguished between oral and written translation out of a concern that requiring losing parties to bear the potentially sizable costs of translating discovery documents,as opposed to the more limited costs of oral testimony,could be too burdensome and possibly unfair,especially for litigants with limited means.fleischmann distilling maier brewing,noting the argument that since litigation is at best uncertain one should not be penalized for merely defending or prosecuting a lawsuit,and that the poor might be unjustly discouraged from instituting actions to vindicate their rights if the penalty for losing included the fees of their opponents counsel congress might also have concluded that a document translator is more akin to an expert or consultant retained by a party to decipher documentary evidence like,for instance,a forensic accountant than to an interpreter whose oral translation services are necessary for communication between litigants,witnesses,and the court 
second,respondent has not shown that any of the hybrid tasks to which it points actually arise with overwhelming frequency or that the problem of drawing the line between taxable and nontaxable costs in such cases will vex the trial courts.it certainly has not shown that any such problems will be more troublesome than the task of sifting through translated discovery documents to ascertain which can be taxed as necessary to the litigation.in any event,the present case does not present a hybrid situation it involves purely written translation,which falls outside the tasks performed by an interpreter as that term is ordinarily understood.
because the ordinary meaning of interpreter is someone who translates orally from one language to another,we hold that the category compensation of interpreters in does not include costs for document translation.we therefore vacate the judgment of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

to be comprehended by the parties,the witnesses,and the court,expression in foreign languages must be translated into english.congress therefore provided,in,that the prevailing party may recoup compensation paid to interpreters.the word interpreters,the court emphasizes,commonly refers to translators of oral speech.ante,at.but as the court acknowledges,ante,at,and,interpreters is more than occasionally used to encompass those who translate written speech as well.see webster third new international dictionary of the english language hereinafter webster defining interpreter as one that translates esp a person who translates orally for parties conversing in different tongues black law dictionary ed.defining interpreter as a person who translates,esp.orally,from one language to another ballentine law dictionary ed.defining interpreter as o ne who interprets,particularly one who interprets words written or spoken in a foreign language 
in short,employing the word interpreters to include translators of written as well as oral speech,if not the most common usage,ante,at,is at least an acceptable usage,ibid.moreover,the word interpret is generally understood to mean to explain or tell the meaning of translate into intelligible or familiar language or terms,while translate commonly means to turn into one own or another language.webster.see also random house dictionary of the english language,defining the transitive verb interpret as,inter alia,to translate,and translate as to turn something written or spoken from one language into another

in practice,federal trial courts have awarded document translation costs in cases spanning several decades.see,raffold process castanea paper,supp,wd.before the court interpreters act added to the taxation of costs statute in,district courts awarded costs for document translation under,which allowed taxation of f ees for exemplification and copies of papers,ed,or under predecessor,ed.see,bennett chemical atlantic commodities,sdny raffold process,at,district courts also awarded costs for oral translation of witness testimony.see,kaiser industries mclouth steel,ed.nothing in the court interpreters act,a measure intended to expand access to interpretation services,indicates a design to eliminate the availability of costs awards for document translation.see,hereinafter the committee feels the time has come to provide by statute for the provision of and access to qualified certified interpreters,for a broader spectrum of people than the present law allows.rulings awarding document translation costs under indicate the courts understanding both that the term interpreter can readily encompass oral and written translation,and that congress did not otherwise instruct i agree that context should guide the determination whether b is most sensibly read to encompass persons who translate documents.see ante,at.but the context key for me is the practice of federal courts both before and after enactment.
the purpose of translation,after all,is to make relevant communication accessible to the litigants and the court.see,at the court interpreters act is intended to insure that all participants in our federal courts can meaningfully take part.documentary evidence in a foreign language,no less than oral statements,must be translated to equip the parties to present their case clearly and the court to decide the merits intelligently.see,united states mosquera,supp,edny for a speaking party to stand equal with others before the court requires translation of relevant documents.lockett hellenic sea transports,ed to be understood by counsel for plaintiffs and defendant,as well as for use at trial,the ship deck log had to be translated from greek into the english language.and it is not extraordinary that what documents say,more than what witnesses testify,may make or break a case.
distinguishing written from oral translation for purposes,moreover,is an endeavor all the more dubious,for,as the court acknowledges,ante,at,some translation tasks do not fall neatly into one category or the other.an interpreter,for example,may be called upon to sight translate a written document,to convey a written document content orally in english.gonzález,vásquez,mikkelson,fundamentals of court interpretation theory,policy and practice hereinafter gonzález.sight translation,taniguchi concedes,counts as interpretation,even though it does not involve translating verbal expression.tr.of oral arg.yet an interpreter preparation for sight translation by translating a written document in advance,taniguchi maintains,does not count as interpretation.ibid.but if the interpreter then reads the prepared written translation aloud in court,that task,in taniguchi view,can be charged as interpretation,at,even though the reading involves no translation of expression written or oral at all.
similarly hard to categorize is the common task of listening to a recording in a foreign language,transcribing it,then translating it into english.see gonzález.although this task involves oral communication,it does not,taniguchi contends,qualify as interpretation,because it involves the luxury of multiple playbacks of the tape and the leisure to consult extrinsic linguistic sources.reply brief for petitioner internal quotation marks omitted.but sight translation which taniguchi concedes may be charged as interpretation may sometimes involve similarly careful linguistic analysis of a written document in advance of a court proceeding.davis hewitt,lessons in administering justice what judges need to know about the requirements,role,and professional responsibilities of the court interpreter,harv.latino.
taniguchi warns that translation costs can be exorbitant and burdensome to police.reply brief tr.of oral arg.the court expresses a similar concern.ante,at current practice in awarding translation costs,however,has shown that district judges are up to the task of confining awards to translation services necessary to present or defeat a claim.see eastman kodak,at district court should not award document translation costs carte blanche,but must determine whether such costs were necessarily incurred.see also,conn zakharov,cv,wl,nd ohio,june,denying translation costs where prevailing party did not demonstrate the costs were necessary maker mark distillery,diageo north,wl,wd,june,same competitive technologies fujitsu,no,wl,nd,same arboireau adidas salomon ag,no,wl,june,same oetiker jurid werke,gmbh,dc same lockett,at awarding costs for necessary translations kaiser,at same bennett,at same raffold process,at same.courts of appeals,in turn,are capable of reviewing such judgments for abuse of discretion.
in short,prescription on interpreters is not so clear as to leave no room for interpretation.given the purpose served by translation and the practice prevailing in district courts,supra,at,there is no good reason to exclude from taxable costs payments for placing written words within the grasp of parties,jurors,and judges.i would therefore affirm the judgment of the ninth circuit.
compare bdt products,lexmark int l,holding that document translation costs are taxable under because the definition of interpret expressly includes to translate into intelligible or familiar language quoting webster third new international dictionary,with extra equipamentos e exportação ltda.case,holding that document translation costs are not taxable under because an interpreter is normally understood as a person who translates living speech from one language to another 
a handful of other contemporaneous dictionaries used a similar formulation.see funk wagnalls new comprehensive international dictionary of the english language one who interprets or translates specifically,one who serves as oral translator between people speaking different languages world book dictionary barnhart barnhart eds.a person whose business is translating,especially orally,from a foreign language cassell english dictionary ed.one who interprets,esp.one employed to translate orally to persons speaking a foreign language 
this provision remains substantially the same as it appeared when first enacted.see d,supp.ii see also stat.
the simultaneous mode requires the interpreter to interpret and to speak contemporaneously with the individual whose communication is being translated.the consecutive mode requires the speaker whose communication is being translated to pause so that the interpreter can convey the testimony given.ibid.and the summary mode allow s the interpreter to condense and distill the speech of the speaker.see generally zazueta,attorneys guide to the use of court interpreters.
the dissent agrees that context should help guide our analysis,but instead of looking to the court interpreters act,it looks to the practice of federal courts both before and after enactment.post,at opinion of ginsburg.the practice of federal courts after the act enactment tells us nothing about what congress intended at the time of enactment.and federal court practice before the act under other provisions of tells us little,if anything,about what congress intended when it added subsection.we think the statutory context in which the word interpreter appears is a more reliable guide to its meaning.
some provisions within the united states code use both interpreter and translator together,thus implying that congress understands the terms to have the distinct meanings described above.see,b providing that appropriations for the immigration and naturalization service shall be available for payment of interpreters and translators who are not citizens of the united states b i providing that department of justice funds may be used for p ayment of interpreters and translators who are not citizens of the united states 
our conclusion is buttressed by respondent concession at oral argument that there is no provision in the united states code where it is clear that the word extends to those who translate documents.tr.of oral arg.see also brief for petitioner and the code is wholly devoid of any corresponding definition of interpreter extending to the translation of written documents as respondent acknowledged,either the word is used in a context that strongly suggests it applies only to oral translation or its meaning is unclear.see tr.of oral arg.
the dissent contends that document translation,no less than oral translation,is essential to equip the parties to present their case clearly and the court to decide the merits intelligently.post,at.but a document translator is no more important than an expert or consultant in making sense of otherwise incomprehensible documentary evidence,yet expenses for experts and consultants are generally not taxable as costs.to be sure,forgoing document translation can impair a litigant case,but document translation is not indispensable,in the way oral translation is,to the parties ability to communicate with each other,with witnesses,and with the court.
translation costs,like other costs recoverable under,may be denied or limited if they were unreasonably incurred or unnecessary to the case.moore federal practice b,ed.
currently,some federal district courts make the practice of allowing fees for translation of documents explicit in their local rules.see rule cd cal.allowing f ees for translation of documents reasonably necessary to the preparation of the case rule guam same rule c idaho allowing reasonable fee if the document translated is necessarily filed or admitted in evidence rule md same rule same rule b e sd cal.same rule nj same rule d same rule nm allowing translator fee if the translated document is admitted into evidence rule c sdny allowing reasonable fee if translated document is used or received in evidence rule c edny same.see also rule f c sc allowing costs of certain document translations under rule b same rule c i same misc.order,allowable items for taxation of costs nd allowing fee of a competent translator of a document that is filed or admitted into evidence taxation of costs guidelines pr allowing fees for translation of documents filed or admitted into evidence,available at all internet materials as visited may,and included in clerk of court case file taxation of costs allowing fees for translation of documents reasonably necessary for trial preparation available at.
noteworthy,other paragraphs congress placed in cover written documents.see,supp.iv fees for printed or electronically recorded transcripts ed.fees and disbursements for printing and witnesses fees for exemplification and the costs of making copies of any necessary materials nothing indicates that congress intended paragraph,unlike paragraphs,to apply exclusively to oral communications.
the court also observes that t axable costs are limited to relatively minor,incidental expenses.ante,at.the tab for unquestionably allowable costs,however,may run high.see,in re ricoh.patent litigation,no.c,wl,nd,awarding in copying costs jones halliburton
