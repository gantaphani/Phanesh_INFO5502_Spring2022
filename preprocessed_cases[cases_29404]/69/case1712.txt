introduction 
respondent and plaintiff ken baker sued theresa castaldi and appellant alfonse castaldi for allegedly stealing antiques he owned.plaintiff sought punitive damages.trial proceeded to a first phase on march,and a punitive damages calculation phase on august.the first phase dealt with liability,compensatory damages and whether plaintiff was entitled to punitive damages.the second phase dealt with the calculation of the punitive damages.
after the first phase completed,the court found both theresa and alfonse jointly and severally liable for conversion.on may,months before the punitive damages phase began,a document entitled judgment was filed.the judgment indicated that judgment was against both defendants,jointly and severally,and set forth in compensatory damages plus interest and costs.the judgment went on to state that the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that both defendants alfonse castaldi and theresa castaldi have acted with malice and with oppression toward plaintiff ken baker warranting an award of punitive damages to be assessed at a separate trial 
several notices of appeal were filed in superior court,each identifying only the may,judgment as the subject of the appeal.
we conclude that the may,judgment was not a final,appealable judgment.since i t is the duty of an appellate court on its own motion to dismiss an appeal from an order which is not appealable,chapman tarentola d,we dismiss the appeal.
pretrial proceedings 
complaint and temporary restraining order 
on may,plaintiff filed a complaint against theresa and alfonse,alleging they converted antiques owned by plaintiff.the complaint sought punitive damages.
on the same day the complaint was filed,plaintiff filed an ex parte application for a temporary restraining order preventing defendants from selling,concealing,encumbering,hypothecating,damaging or destroying the antiques granting immediate access to all buildings at old highway in catheys valley,california,in order to view,inspect,inventory,and photograph or videotape all antiques and collectibles that are presently at the property and prohibiting defendants from spending or disbursing any funds derived from the sale of the antiques.the application was made without notice to defendants.see cal.rules of court,rule b.
on may,the court granted the temporary restraining order.the next day,the court ordered that the mariposa county sheriff department was authorized to cut locks,chains or otherwise force entry to the real property and all buildings at old highway,catheys valley,ca,for which defendants do not,immediately,allow entry.
preliminary injunction 
on june,the court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting all parties from selling,encumbering or hypothecating any of the antiques.the court also ordered all antiques be placed in storage at a specified location with no access to be allowed to the storage unit without written court order upon noticed motion.
defense motion for access to antiques to perform expert appraisal 
on september,defendants moved for access to the antiques to perform an expert appraisal.the court denied the motion without prejudice as premature.at the hearing,the court indicated that it would likely reconsider the motion once all parties have been deposed.
plaintiff ex parte application to access antiques to inspect for water damage 
on february,plaintiff filed an ex parte request for access to the antiques to inspect for water damage.the application indicated that it was made without notice to the other side as the castaldis currently represent themselves in pro per and time is of the essence to the protect the antiques.the court granted the request and authorized plaintiff to open the storage unit only in the presence of an independent person from the storage facility.
motion in limine to exclude testimony of theresa castaldi 
on march,the first day of trial,plaintiff moved to exclude any trial testimony of theresa castaldi on the basis that her deposition had not been concluded.defense counsel responded that he had received the motion seconds ago.defense counsel went on to say i do care what the court decides,but i have even decided whether i was going to call her anyway.
the court noted that it had indicated at a previous hearing that if theresa failed to complete a deposition the court would consider not allowing her to testify.the court ultimately decided to reserve its decision on the issue,but did indicate that it was leaning towards granting the motion.
theresa was not called as a witness at trial.

plaintiff testimony 
plaintiff testified that he and theresa castaldi lived together at old highway in catheys valley,california,for over a decade.plaintiff stored antiques in a temperature controlled room inside a barn on the property.by the time of trial,it was undisputed that alfonse had no ownership interest in these antiques.

on the call,alfonse said 
he took all the cattle stuff that we could move that was on the property.and we said ok fine,we had no place for it,we had not use for it anyway,but we want the stuff that in the barn.he said well if you want it you better come and get it before i do know what the date was,but we had like days to go get it.so we hired,hired one of our mexican workers and we took the truck and we loaded that stuff out of there,everything that was of value as much as we could get within that timeframe.he said we could do it.
alfonse testimony 
alfonse testified at trial,though the trial court ultimately found the testimony presented by alfonse castaldi to not be credible and in many respects untruthful.
alfonse testified that theresa wanted the items in the barn removed.alfonse suggested someone she could hire to help her out.an unidentified mexican worker did ultimately help theresa.alfonse accompanied the person to old highway,but did not pay him.alfonse also testified that he did not physically load the items.he testified that he was preparing for back surgery and was not lifting anything at the time.

discussion 
i.the appeal must be dismisseda.the appealability of a judgment is jurisdictional 
as a preliminary matter we must determine whether the may,judgment is indeed a final,appealable judgment.neither party raised this issue in their initial briefs.however,t he appealability of the judgment or order is jurisdictional and an attempt to appeal from a nonappealable judgment or order will ordinarily be dismissed.citations.marsh mountain zephyr,th.it is the duty of an appellate court on its own motion to dismiss an appeal from an order which is not appealable.citation.chapman tarentola,supra,d at.we afforded the parties the opportunity to file supplemental briefs regarding the appealability of the may,judgment.
in civil matters,our appellate jurisdiction is limited to the judgments and orders described in code of civil procedure section.only final judgments are appealable under that statute citations.papadakis zelis th,italics in original.
b.the may,judgment was interlocutory and not appealable 
a judgment is the final determination of the rights of the parties in an action or proceeding.code civ.generally,a judgment is final where no issue is left for future consideration except the fact of compliance or noncompliance with the order.griset fair political practices com.cal th,griset.b ut where anything further in the nature of judicial action on the part of the court is essential to a final determination of the rights of the parties,the decree is interlocutory.citations.id.at pp.
the present appeal is from a single purported judgment the may,judgment.that document states that judgment is made against defendants,jointly and severally,and sets forth in compensatory damages plus interest and costs.however,the document also states that the court finds plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages in an amount to be assessed at a separate trial.
under the general test in griset,it seems quite clear that the may,judgment was interlocutory.while a final judgment leaves no issue left for future consideration except compliance griset,supra,cal th at,the may,judgment did leave open an issue for future consideration the amount of punitive damages.determining the amount of punitive damages at a court trial seems quite clearly to be a type of judicial action on the part of the court that is essential to a final determination of the rights of the parties ibid.as a result,the may,judgment was interlocutory 
appellants contentions are unavailing 
appellants argue that if the may,judgment was not final,then respondent should not have been able to enforce that judgment until a final order issued.that may well be.but even if we accept appellants contention that the subsequent enforcement orders were erroneous,that would not confer appealability on the may,judgment.the merits of an appeal can not confer jurisdiction where it is lacking in re frederick d.
appellants argue the may,judgment implicitly refers to itself as the final judgment.but a paper filed in an action does not become a judgment merely because it is so entitled it is a judgment only if it satisfies the criteria of a judgment city of shasta lake county of shasta th,kurwa kislinger cal th,allowing the parties and trial court to designate a substantively interlocutory judgment as final and appealable would be inconsistent with the one final judgment rule.
appellants also cite the death knell doctrine but fail to explain why it would apply here.the death knell doctrine permits the appellate court to review an order denying a motion to certify a class when it is unlikely the case will proceed as an individual action.citation.szetela discover bank th.the doctrine is a tightly defined and narrow concept in re baycol cases i and ii cal th,and we strongly doubt it has any application outside the class action context.regardless,it is undisputed that the doctrine does not apply unless there is an order that amounts to a de facto final judgment for absent plaintiffs id.at.the may,judgment is not such an order.
finally,appellants ask that we find any objections to the appealability of the may,judgment were waived.jurisdiction can not be conferred upon an appellate court by waiver.in re marriage of corona th.
liberal construction of appellants notices of appeal does not save the invalid appeal 
in arguing that we may review the judgment debtor and probate orders,appellants cite the rule that a notice of appeal shall be liberally construed in favor of its sufficiency citation vibert berger cal d.
appellants argue the rule of liberal construction applies in this case,because their notices of appeal were,at worst,premature.they submit any flaw in the notices of appeal may be disregarded under groves peterson th,fn.groves and bardin daimlerchrysler th,fn.bardin.in groves and bardin,the appellants were attempting to challenge the trial court sustaining of a demurrer.however,the notices of appeal incorrectly identified the order sustaining demurrer rather than correctly identifying the judgment dismissing the complaint pursuant to the sustained demurrer.in each case,the court of appeal excused the flaw.bardin,supra,th at,fn.groves,supra,th at,fn.
we need not decide whether we agree with bardin and groves,because they are distinguishable.the notice s filed in the present case do not present a mere misdescription of the judgment glassco el sereno country club,cal,but instead clearly and correctly identify a single order or judgment the may,judgment.appellants would have us construe the notices of appeal,which identify one order,as a premature appeal from an entirely different order entered months later,which awarded in punitive damages for the first time.but it is well beyond liberal construction to view an appeal from one order as an appeal from a further and different order.russell foglio th.despite the rule favoring liberal interpretation of notices of appeal,a notice of appeal will not be considered adequate if it completely omits any reference to the judgment being appealed.shiver,mcgrane martin littell d.the rule favoring appealability in cases of ambiguity can not apply where there is a clear intention to appeal from only one of two separate appealable judgments or orders.citation.norman krug real estate investments,praszker d.
e.our conclusion is consistent with analogous precedent 
our conclusion that the may,judgment is not appealable is consistent with our decision in plaza tulare tradewell stores,d plaza tulare.that case involved a dispute over the interpretation of a written lease.id.at.the trial was bifurcated code civ,with the issue of lease interpretation to be tried separately from damages.plaza tulare,supra,at.respondents prevailed at the first trial regarding lease interpretation.ibid.appellants purported to appeal from the order adjudicating the issues presented at the first trial.ibid.
we noted that a positive verdict of liability in a bifurcated trial merely has the same status as a partial verdict or finding.citation.plaza tulare,supra,d at.consequently,we held that the adjudication of the issues in the first trial was an interlocutory judgment and could not be appealed.ibid.as a result,we dismissed the appeal.id.at.
appellants seek to distinguish plaza tulare,arguing that the present case did not involve a stipulated bifurcation.we see no legal significance to this distinction.appealability of an adjudication turns on its substance and effect.otay river constructors san diego expressway,supra,th at.the procedural history leading up to the adjudication is relevant insofar as it informs this inquiry.but whether the bifurcation in this case was stipulated or not is irrelevant because it does not change the fact that the may,judgment left unresolved an issue essential to the final determination of the rights of the parties.
the appeal must be dismissed.plaza tulare,supra,d at pp.
conclusion 
we understand the result in this case may seem harsh,as appellants are prevented from obtaining review of several unusual orders now and possibly ever however,t his court is without power to bestow jurisdiction on itself mid wilshire associates th.appellate jurisdiction is solely within the province of our legislature ibid,and we are not at liberty to modify the standards for appealability.in re baycol cases i and ii,supra,cal th at,fn.see also kurwa kislinger,supra,cal th at.

appellants request for sanctions under california rules of court,rule c b is denied.the appeal is dismissed.the parties shall bear their own costs.
