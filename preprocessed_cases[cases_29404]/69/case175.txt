douglas bruce appeals from a district court judgment which directed the tabloid weekly world news world news to pay him in damages and nonduplicative profits due to its acknowledged copyright infringement.bruce insists that he is entitled to additional damages amounting to between and.with but one exception,the district court judgment is affirmed.
background 
in march,bruce,a freelance photographer,photographed william clinton as he was shaking hands with an unidentified secret service agent.later,bruce consigned the photograph to the picture group,a photo stock agency.thereafter,a world news photo editor contacted the picture group to obtain a photograph of clinton while shaking hands.world news intended to alter any such photograph by superimposing,over the image of the person shaking clinton hand,its own image of the space alien.the space alien is a fictional creature which world news had been featuring prominently in its political campaign coverage ever since.world news then proceeded to manipulate the clinton photograph without first obtaining authorization from bruce.the picture group and world news were unable to reach agreement on an appropriate licensing fee.
on the cover of its august,issue,world news published the retouched photograph,together with the banner alien backs clinton the picture group billed world news for,which it shared equally with bruce pursuant to contract.thereafter,on each occasion that the retouched photograph appeared in world news,the picture group sent world news a bill.ultimately,bruce realized a total of in licensing fees.the picture group ceased its business operations in.
thereafter,in,bruce came upon a world news advertisement utilizing the august,cover containing his retouched photograph.in due course,bruce counsel transmitted a letter to world news,claiming copyright infringement.world news responded with an offer to pay for a general release of the bruce copyright.the same retouched photograph later appeared on a different featuring world news june,cover,containing photographs of twelve united states senators,under the banner senators are space aliens these advertisements subsequently were repeated times in world news,as well as numerous times on the world news internet site.during this period,world news ordered and sold of the alien backs clinton and ordered and sold of the senators are aliens.
in an article entitled alien endorses dole,appearing in the may issue,the world news cover included another photograph of clinton not taken by bruce holding a copy of the august,issue of world news,together with bruce retouched photograph as well as the cover of the august,issue,among a collage of earlier world news covers.in the may issue,the retouched photograph appeared both as a small inset on the cover,which prominently featured a photograph of george bush shaking hands with the space alien,and adjacent to the related news story inside.in addition,beginning in july,the august,world news cover,containing bruce retouched photograph,appeared times as part of a subscription advertisement placed inside the tabloid.
in june,bruce commenced the present action against world news for copyright infringement.see et supp.following a bench trial,during which world news acknowledged its infringements,the district court awarded bruce in damages,plus interest.bruce weekly world news,d the damages award included nine components 
on appeal,bruce challenges the amount of the damages award,contending that he is entitled to at least an additional.
discussion 
we review de novo the legal determination as to the appropriate standard for calculating damages awarded as a consequence of copyright infringements,but will upset the underlying factual findings only upon a showing of clear error.see tamko roofing,ideal roofing,cir.a plaintiff who establishes copyright infringement is entitled to recover actual damages,which consist of all income and profits lost as a consequence of the infringement and any nonduplicative profits earned by the defendant as a consequence of the copyright infringement,see b noting that plaintiff may recover any profits attributable to the infringement that are not taken into account in computing the actual damages.see data grumman systs.support,cir.
actual damages 
applicable legal standard 
at the outset,bruce asserts that it was reversible error for the district court to announce that the correct legal standard for calculating actual damages is the profits lost result ing from the infringement,bruce,d at emphasis added,rather than the reasonable fair market licensing fees,since the term profits lost more aptly applies to a distinct species of actual copyright damages,not pertinent here,and refers not to the extent to which plaintiff was deprived of defendant fee,but rather the extent if any to which defendant infringement prevented plaintiff from licensing his work to clients or customers other than the defendant.see data,at hamil,gfi,cir melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright a.yet,assuming arguendo that the district court prefatory reference to profits lost was,the error is plainly harmless,see,southex exhibitions,builders ass n,cir s uch error is harmless if it is highly probable that it did not affect the outcome of the case.citation omitted,since the body of its opinion makes it unmistakably clear that the court was assessing bruce actual damages through reference to the licensing fees which world news would have had to pay bruce were it not for the unauthorized use of the photograph 
apportionment of actual damages 
next,bruce contends that the district court erred by awarding only one half of the licensing fees,see supra section i chart,in order to reflect bruce contractual agreement to share all fees equally with the picture group,the photo stock agency to which bruce consigned the photograph.since the picture group went out of business in,bruce posits that he was entitled to of the fees thereafter,and,accordingly,that world news was unjustly enriched by virtue of the district court reduction in the licensing fees.
although considerable deference normally must be accorded the findings of fact made by the district court,as well as its balancing of the relevant equitable factors,see invest almaz forest,cir noting that rulings normally are reviewed for an abuse of discretion only,in the instant case we conclude that bruce is entitled to the share of the licensing fee which world news should have paid to the picture group in for its use of the bruce photo.
bruce freely contracted away his right to the share,and thus would be made whole upon receipt of the discount.the unjust enrichment doctrine,however,requires that the factfinder also consider whether world news,if permitted to retain the picture group share of the licensing fee,would realize an unfair windfall such that justice and equity mandate be disgorged.see id.at.as the picture group is presently defunct,its share would either be retained by world news or remitted to bruce.as world news is the copyright infringer,bruce unquestionably is the more deserving recipient.accordingly,we vacate the district court judgment insofar as it discounted the bruce share of the licensing fee by fifty percent,and remand with directions to enter judgment for an additional in damages in favor of bruce,times multiplier of.see nowaczyk warden,state prison,cir noting that an a buse of discretion may result when a material factor deserving significant weight is ignored citation omitted.
c.the limitation of the licensing fees to the original unauthorized use by world news 
bruce next contends that the district court incorrectly ruled that he was entitled to licensing fees solely for world news first unauthorized editorial uses of his photograph in august,but not for each ensuing unauthorized use,such as its reprinting of prior world news covers and its uses in and subscription advertisements.bruce conjectures instead that he may have been able to negotiate a more lucrative licensing contract with world news.see iowa state.res,am.broad,the infringer can not expect to pay the same price in damages as it might have paid after freely negotiated bargainin
