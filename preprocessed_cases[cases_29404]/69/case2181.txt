in this case we consider whether evidence of the value of a royalty interest in minerals can be considered in determining compensation for geologic services when the services were not rendered pursuant to a written agreement.we determine that it can not.
in early,michael quigley decided to sell his interest in oil and gas leases known as the samano leases.robert bennett,a geologist,agreed to help quigley by analyzing the leases and assisting with a sales presentation to louis dreyfus natural gas.bennett did not expect to be paid he agreed to do the presentation as a favor to a sick colleague who had been working with quigley.while bennett was preparing for the presentation,quigley asked him to do additional work as to the leases,including preparing more color graphs and maps.bennett testified that when he told quigley he did not have time to do the additional work because he had his own projects to work on,quigley told him,do worry bennett,i take care of you.bennett spent three or four days working on the maps and graphs and then participated in the presentation to dreyfus in april or may of.dreyfus decided not to purchase the leases,but quigley kept the maps bennett prepared.quigley continued to market his leases and in april,coastal oil gas bought them.quigley secured an overriding royalty interest as part of the transaction.
after the leases sold to coastal,bennett mentioned his compensation to quigley but the two did not discuss the matter in depth.around august,after coastal drilled two producing wells on the samano leases,quigley and bennett met for the purpose of determining bennett compensation.the issue was not resolved.
in february,bennett sued quigley,asserting causes of action for quantum meruit,conversion and fraud,and seeking attorneys fees.the case was tried to a jury.bennett presented evidence that he was a generating geologist,and generating geologists are usually compensated by receiving overriding royalty interests in the prospects they generate.he testified that he personally only accepted mineral prospect work for compensation of a royalty interest in the prospect.proof was offered at trial that the value of a royalty interest in the past and estimated future production of the samano leases was approximately million.evidence was presented that geologists who worked for cash compensation rather than overriding royalty interests earned between a day and per job.
the jury found in bennett favor on all three theories of liability.damages were found in the amount of on the quantum meruit claim million on the fraud claim and million on the conversion claim in connection with the quantum meruit claim the jury found that by august bennett should have discovered that quigley was not going to pay,and quigley fraudulently concealed from bennett that quigley was not going to pay,thereby causing bennett to delay filing suit.the jury also found reasonable attorney fees for bennett in the amount of for trial and appeal.bennett elected to recover on his fraud claim because that gave him the greatest recovery.the trial court entered judgment based on the jury findings in response to the fraud questions and answers.
quigley appealed.he asserted that bennett recovery on his fraud claim violated the statute of frauds,the parties had no binding agreement to support a fraudulent inducement claim,and the quantum meruit and conversion claims were barred by limitations.he also asserted legal and factual sufficiency challenges.the court of appeals,based in part on quigley having told bennett well do us a favor,work what you can and i pay you for your time doing it,determined that quigley had an agreement with bennett for bennett to provide geological services,affirmed the judgment on bennett fraud claim,and did not address the other jury findings.the court of appeals held that the fraud damages question submitted an improper measure of damages but quigley did not object to the submission quigley did not preserve error as to the proper measure of damages and there was evidence to support the jury finding based on the charge submitted.wl.
in this court quigley asserts,in part,that the court of appeals erred in affirming the award based on fraud referencing haase glazner,he argues that there was no agreement for bennett to receive a royalty interest as compensation.bennett does not disagree.in his brief bennett says that b ecause bennett did not claim an express agreement giving him an overriding royalty interest,bennett sought,under quantum meruit and fraud,restitution damages based on the value of the services he performed.but quigley also urges that allowing bennett to recover damages based on the value of an overriding royalty interest,under these facts,violates the statute of frauds.bennett disagrees with the latter position we do not.
an overriding royalty interest in an oil and gas lease is considered an interest in real estate that falls within the statute of frauds.consol.gas equip.thompson.absent a writing,an agreement to transfer such an interest is unenforceable.see id.allowing recovery of the value of a royalty interest when the interest itself could not be recovered because the statute of frauds bars recovery would circumvent protections of the statute.haase,at noting that when the bargain violates the statute of frauds and is unenforceable,allowing recovery for damages would deprive the statute of any effect.thus evidence of the value of a royalty interest,which was what bennett contended for as compensation,can not be given any weight or effect and legally can not be considered as evidence supporting the jury finding.see id.at see also merrell dow,havner,noting,in part,that a no evidence assertion will be sustained if the court is barred by rules of law from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove the matter at issue.
absent evidence of the value of a royalty interest,the only evidence of damages was testimony as to compensation for a geologist.the testimony regarding compensation is some evidence of the value of bennett work.it is,however,legally insufficient to support the entire million fraud damages finding and the court of appeals judgment must be reversed.see formosa plastics.usa presidio eng rs and contractors.
as noted above,there is some evidence that bennett suffered damages from quigley actions which the jury found constituted fraud.thus,we can not render judgment for quigley on the fraud claim.
citing scott walker,the concurring and dissenting justices would render judgment for bennett on the quantum meruit findings.they note that when suit was filed in february it was timely as a matter of law.the reasoning is that bennett quantum meruit cause of action did not accrue until the leases were sold in april when the unenforceable promise to transfer a royalty interest was breached and the obligation to pay value which the law substitutes for the unenforceable promise was also breached.we disagree that scott supports rendition for bennett.in scott,the walkers lived with and rendered housekeeping and personal services to bower over a period of years until bower died.id.at.the walkers sought compensation for fourteen years of services rendered to bower.they also contended that bower agreed to compensate them,in part,by devising his house and property to them when he died.the court noted that such an oral agreement to transfer real property would be unenforceable because it violated the statute of frauds,but that if such an agreement existed the law would substitute an obligation to pay value for the services rendered in exchange for the promise to devise property.the court further stated that it was important that the walkers establish an agreement by bower to devise property because the walkers cause of action for breach of the substituted obligation to pay for their services would accrue at the time the oral agreement to transfer property was breached at bower death.otherwise,limitations would begin to run on their claims for compensation at the time the services were rendered.id.the court held that there was no jury finding that bower made the claimed agreement to devise his house to the walkers,and that the
