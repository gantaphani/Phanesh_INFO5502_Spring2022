angela bernhardt has sued the county of los angeles and its county counsel,claiming that the county has a policy of settling civil rights cases only for a lump sum,including all attorney fees that violates both an implied federal right under and the supremacy clause.in summary,bernhardt contends the county lump sum settlement policy has made it impossible for her to retain counsel to represent her in litigating her federal claims against the county.this interlocutory appeal is before us following our decision in bernhardt county of los angeles,cir,in which we held that bernhardt had standing to assert her claims in limited respects and remanded her case to the district court for further proceedings.although the merits of those claims remain pending before the district court where bernhardt is appearing pro se,we are now asked to determine whether the district court properly denied bernhardt a preliminary injunction barring the county lump sum policy so that she can obtain counsel to represent her in those district court proceedings.
we hold,first,that our prior decision does not foreclose bernhardt from seeking a preliminary injunction for purposes of securing trial counsel.on the merits,we hold that although the district court did not err in denying bernhardt a broad preliminary injunction that would have barred the county use of a lump sum settlement policy in all civil rights cases pending the trial of her case,the district court did err in not considering a narrower injunction limited to bernhardt pending case only.given the serious questions bernhardt has raised concerning the county policy,and the balance of hardships that tips strongly in favor of removing an obstacle to her obtaining trial counsel,we hold that,pending her trial,bernhardt is entitled to a narrow injunction barring the application of the county alleged policy to her case alone.
factual and procedural background 
following an incident in a santa monica courtroom in,angela bernhardt initiated a excessive force case against los angeles county law enforcement officials and a santa monica college police officer.after she was unable to retain an attorney to represent her in that case the excessive force case,and while that case was still pending,bernhardt brought a separate case pro se the instant case against the county of los angeles and lloyd pellman,the county counsel collectively,the county in the instant case,bernhardt challenges the county alleged policy of settling all federal civil rights cases only for a lump sum,including all attorney fees.bernhardt claims that the county policy has deprived her of her implied federal statutory right under section to contract with an attorney for representation in exchange for an assignment to the attorney of the right to seek statutory attorney fees.bernhardt,at.she also alleges that the policy violates the supremacy clause by implicitly repealing at the time bernhardt filed the instant case,its premise was that the policy by requiring the waiver of statutory attorney fees as a condition of settlement effectively prevented bernhardt from retaining a lawyer to represent her in her excessive force case.thus she sought declaratory relief,damages and a permanent injunction against the county policy.although her objective included barring the county use of its policy generally so that she could obtain trial counsel in her excessive force case,she did not seek a similar injunction in the instant case where she was also proceeding pro se.
while the instant case against the county was pending,the district court dismissed bernhardt underlying excessive force case.see id.discussing the history of bernhardt case.she appealed,and another panel of this court dismissed the appeal.id.at.the rug had been pulled out from under the instant case the excessive force case for which bernhardt was seeking an attorney was over.
in the meantime,the district court dismissed the instant case sua sponte for lack of standing.bernhardt appealed,and attorney michael mitchell represented her for the limited purpose of the appeal on february,we reversed and remanded for further proceedings,holding that t he allegations made in bernhardt complaint established standing.id.at.we also held that bernhardt claims for prospective relief were moot because the excessive force case was over and her injury was not one capable of repetition,yet evading review.id.at.we concluded,however,that bernhardt presented a sufficient live controversy because she may be entitled to damages.id.at.although we were skeptical that bernhardt could prove that she deserved actual damages on the theory that she would have prevailed in her excessive force action if she had been represented by counsel,we accepted her argument that she might be entitled to actual damages because we examine only the face of her complaint.id.at.we also noted that even if bernhardt could not obtain actual damages,she still may be entitled to nominal damages on the basis that the county policy interfered with her implied federal right to obtain counsel in a civil rights action.id.
on remand,bernhardt again proceeded pro se.rather than simply begin to litigate her case for actual or nominal damages,bernhardt filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against the county policy on the theory that it was now preventing her from retaining an attorney in the instant case to pursue her claim for damages on remand bernhardt thereby shifted the initial focus of her case on remand from her inability to retain an attorney in her excessive force case to her inability to retain an attorney to press her remaining claims for damages in the instant case.affidavits from bernhardt,mitchell and robert alan seeman,another civil rights attorney who stated that he knew of the county policy and that over the years it had prevented him from representing many victims of civil rights abuses,supported the motion.the district court denied bernhardt injunction motion on july.nearly four months later,the district court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of its order.it concluded that bernhardt had no likelihood of success on the merits in the underlying instant case,the balance of hardships did not tip in her favor and the public interest weighed against granting the broadly worded injunction.
mitchell filed a timely notice of appeal on bernhardt behalf.the district court denied bernhardt motion to stay further proceedings pending our resolution of this interlocutory appeal.thereafter,on january,the county moved for judgment on the pleadings.faced with the prospect that this motion might be granted before we resolved bernhardt injunction appeal which,if successful,could result in her having trial counsel mitchell,again representing bernhardt only on appeal,sought a stay of the district court proceedings,which we granted.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

discussion 
reaching the merits of bernhardt appeal law of the case 
despite the county suggestion that our prior mootness holding bars bernhardt request for a preliminary injunction,we will reach the merits of bernhardt motion.her motion is not foreclosed by the law of the case.the law of the case doctrine provides that the decision of an appellate court on a legal issue must be followed in all subsequent proceedings in the same case.in re rainbow magazine,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the doctrine applies to our explicit decisions as well as those issues decided by necessary implication.united states hughes aircraft,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in our prior opinion,we concluded that the rejection of bernhardt appeal of her excessive force case mooted her requested injunction directed at obtaining an attorney to represent her in that action.nonetheless,we held that she might still have a retrospective claim for damages due to her inability to obtain counsel in the first place.neither we nor the parties addressed what the implications of the county alleged policy might be for bernhardt ability to obtain counsel to pursue her damage claim on remand.the law of the case doctrine does not bar bernhardt motion for an injunction or our review of its denial.
b.the denial of the motion on its merits 
on remand,bernhardt once again ostensibly not represented by counsel,allegedly because of the county lump sum settlement policy sought a broad preliminary injunction barring the county from offering,accepting,or entering into any agreement settling civil rights cases that inhibits,interferes with,or prohibits lawyers from applying for attorney fees under section or any similar statute,including but not limited to lump sum including all attorney fees settlements.in opposing the injunction,the county argued as a fallback that 
i f the court is inclined to grant plaintiff motion,the scope of the injunction sought is far too broad to serve the interests of justice.it appears that plaintiff could benefit from a far more limited order prohibiting the county from making a lump sum,including attorneys fees offer to plaintiff.
bernhardt pro se motion,however,did not request the district court to consider this more narrow injunction and the court did not do so,limiting its analysis to an assumed injunction that would affect cases beyond bernhardt.we conclude that the district court should have considered the narrower option as well.
courts have a duty to construe pro se pleadings liberally,including pro se motions as well as complaints.see zichko idaho,cir acknowledging that we must construe pro se prisoner motions and pleadings liberally see also karim panahi los angeles police dep t,cir in civil rights cases where the plaintiff appears pro se,the court must construe the pleadings liberally and must afford plaintiff the benefit of any doubt.christensen cir,cir construing a pro se taxpayer motion to place statements in the record as a motion to amend.this duty is particularly relevant here,where the gravamen of bernhardt complaint is that she has to litigate pro se because the county policy has prevented her from obtaining counsel in her excessive force case and now in her effort to challenge the county policy.whether she can ultimately prevail on the merits of that challenge,it ought not to fail because her ability to marshal legal arguments and evidence with the assistance of counsel has been undermined by the very policy she is challenging.
to prevail on her motion for a preliminary injunction,bernhardt must demonstrate either a probable success on the merits combined with the possibility of irreparable injury or b that she has raised serious questions going to the merits,and that the balance of hardships tips sharply in her favor.stuhlbarg int l sales john brush,cir.if the public interest may be affected by the proposed injunction,it should also be factored into the analysis.see caribbean marine servs.baldrige,cir.this court has explained that these two alternatives represent extremes of a single continuum,rather than two separate tests.thus,the greater the relative hardship to the moving party,the less probability of success must be shown.immigrant assistance project of los angeles county fed of labor afl cio ins,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.as we shall explain,we conclude that bernhardt merits limited injunctive relief under the second alternative when the preliminary injunction is narrowed to cover only bernhardt instant case in the fashion suggested by the county.that is,the county alleged policy would not be applied to her in the context of this litigation such that the county would be precluded from offering to settle this case only on terms that would effectively require bernhardt to waive her counsel ability to seek attorney fees under.
even though this case is still at the pleading stage,the record from the preliminary injunction proceedings is sufficient for us to evaluate the merits of bernhardt entitlement to such a narrowed injunction.therefore,for the limited purpose of determining whether bernhardt meets the threshold requirements for a preliminary injunction,we shall address the seriousness of her claims and the balance of hardships as between bernhardt and the county we do not in doing so decide whether she should ultimately prevail on those claims.
the seriousness of the claim 
as discussed above,the crux of bernhardt case is that the county alleged policy of settling civil rights cases for a lump sum including all attorney fees violates her implied federal right under to contract with an attorney for representation in exchange for an assignment to the attorney of the right to seek statutory attorney fees.bernhardt,at.because the county has a policy of requiring civil rights plaintiffs to waive statutory attorney fees as a condition of settlement,the theory goes,these plaintiffs can not contract to receive an attorney services in exchange for transferring the right to seek statutory attorney fees to the attorney because this right is rendered unenforceable.as a result,civil rights attorneys have little incentive to take on such cases since their prospects of recovering statutory attorney fees are low they would only be able to petition for such fees after prevailing at trial.although bernhardt has focused upon the alleged violation of her implied federal right,she also argues that the policy,by barring the application for statutory attorney fees in all cases that settle,violates the supremacy clause by effectively repealing.although at this stage of the remand proceedings bernhardt case still remains sketchy,she has shown enough to establish that her claim presents serious questions about the nature and effect of the county settlement policy.see republic of the philippines marcos,cir serious questions are those which can not be resolved one way or the other at the hearing on the injunction they need not promise a certainty of success,nor even present a probability of success.
one such question is a factual one,going to the existence and nature of the policy itself.attached to bernhardt second amended complaint is a copy of a march,letter from assistant county counsel,now county counsel,lloyd pellman that states in part 
this is to respond to your recent letter to the supervisors in which you describe an unofficial policy of this office of requiring a plaintiff,as a condition for settling his civil rights suit,to waive statutory attorneys fees.
this office does negotiate the settlement of liability litigation for a single sum to compensate the claimant for the injuries claimed,the expenses incurred,and the attorney services rendered to the claimant.
only in this manner can we evaluate the proposed settlement against the county possible liability should the matter proceed to trial.without having such an all inclusive settlement,we would not be in a position to advise either the operating department or the board of supervisors of the precise fiscal impact of the settlement.
we believe our practice of negotiating such all inclusive settlements is not only legal,but satisfies the objective of weighing the county maximum exposure as established by the settlement against the risks of proceeding with the litigation,just as you,representing the claimant,must do.
the county has argued that this outdated letter does not establish the existence of the policy and that,in addition,bernhardt has failed to show that the alleged policy is applied,without exception,to all civil rights cases the county settles.there is nothing in the record,however,to refute or qualify the plain language of pellman letter,or to suggest the policy he describes applies only to a subset of cases.
assuming the county does have a settlement policy requiring the waiver of fee applications,serious federal and constitutional questions are presented.does the policy infringe rights implied by does the policy effectively override the statute in violation of the supremacy clause 
violation of an implied federal right 
assuming,as the district court appears to have done and the county does not challenge in this appeal,that bernhardt has an implied federal right under,see blessing freestone,d,the question is whether the county policy might violate that right.this is a question prompted by the supreme court decision in evans jeff,d.there,the court addressed a plaintiff class argument that the district court reviewing their proposed class action settlement under federal rule of civil procedure e should have rejected the attorney fee waiver provision because it was inconsistent with.id.at.the court concluded that it is not necessary to construe the fees act as embodying a general rule prohibiting settlements conditioned on the waiver of fees in order to be faithful to the purposes of that act.id.at.we have recognized that evans holding that an offer to settle a civil rights class action conditioned on the waiver of fees does not by itself contravene the purposes of also applies to individual cases.see willard city of los angeles,cir.but evans did suggest,even in light of its holding,that might prohibit fee waivers in three particular scenarios.as we described them in our prior opinion 
first,might bar a governmental unit from implementing a statute,policy,or practice precluding the payment of attorney fees in settlements of civil rights cases.evans,at.second,a district court might be required to disapprove a fee waiver that was part of a vindictive effort to deter attorneys from representing plaintiffs in civil rights suits.id.at.finally,an action might lie if it were shown that fee waivers have had the effect,in the aggregate and in the long run,of shrinking the pool of lawyers willing to represent plaintiffs in such cases,thereby constricting the effective access to the judicial process for persons with civil rights grievances which the fees act was intended to provide.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
bernhardt,at.although willard did not decide whether these exceptions apply to individual cases,we treated them as doing so in our prior opinion and the county does not argue to the contrary.thus bernhardt would raise serious questions as to whether her implied federal right under was violated if she can show that at least one of these three scenarios is likely at work here.native village of venetie ira council alaska,cir a violation of the indian child welfare act formed the basis for concluding that the villages implied federal rights under that statute had been breached.the district court concluded that bernhardt failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits based on any of the three exceptions suggested in evans.we agree that bernhardt did not meet her burden as to the second and third exceptions,but we conclude she has shown enough to raise a serious question about the first whether the county has adopted a uniform policy or practice that insists on a fee waiver as a condition of settlement in civil rights litigation in conflict with the federal statute authorizing fees for prevailing parties,including those who prevail by way of settlement.evans,at.
we have no quarrel with the district court treatment of evans second and third exceptions.first,bernhardt concedes that she has offered no proof of a vindictive effort to deter attorneys from representing plaintiffs in civil rights actions.second,she has shown that the pool of available civil rights lawyers has shrunk by at least one,but this is not enough to present her case adequately under the third evans exception.compare id.at.we believe,however,that as a practical matter the likelihood of this circumstance creating exception three is remote.
the district court treatment of evans first exception is a different matter.although it correctly quoted the relevant language from evans,the court did not clearly address the application of this exception to bernhardt case.it simply concluded that bernhardt had failed to show a likelihood of success because she did not show that her case fit within evans second or third exceptions.to the extent that the district court did address whether the first exception applies,it only said that the evidence submitted by plaintiff does not establish either the scope or extent of such a policy.as we have discussed above,bernhardt has submitted enough evidence to raise serious questions as to the existence of the policy at this stage she need not establish its precise bounds.accordingly,we must consider whether the county alleged lump sum policy might fall into evans first exception because it is a blanket fee waiver that preclud es the payment of attorney fees in settlements of civil rights cases.bernhardt,at.
in a strict sense this policy does not appear to preclude the payment of fees,at least insofar as the county may include an estimated allocation of fees as part of the lump sum settlement.on the other hand,the lump sum policy does preclude the payment of statutory attorney fees as discussed in evans,because after reaching a settlement with the county the plaintiff is no longer able to petition the court for an independent award of fees.in willard,the plaintiffs settled their civil rights action against the city of long beach in exchange for the sum of,which included all attorney fees potentially recoverable under section.at.we treated this settlement as containing a condition waiving attorney fees,even though theoretically the lump sum included the fees,and we said that the plaintiffs would have needed to show a citywide statute,policy,or practice requiring waiver of fees as a condition of settlement to trigger evans concerns.id.bernhardt has made just such a showing for purposes of preliminary injunction analysis.guided by willard,we consider a lump sum settlement offer as the kind of fee preclusion that if embodied in a uniform policy or practice might come within evans first suggested exception.because the evidence before us suggests that the county may have such a blanket settlement policy,bernhardt has at least a fair chance of showing that her case fits into evans first exception.
violation of the supremacy clause 
bernhardt has also raised a serious question going to the merits of a supremacy clause claim that does not depend upon the existence of an implied federal right under.see bud antle,barbosa,cir even in the absence of an explicit statutory provision establishing a cause of action,a private party may ordinarily seek declaratory and injunctive relief against state action on the basis of federal preemption.see also golden state transit city of los angeles,d acknowledging that preemption claims may be asserted outside of.the supremacy clause of the constitution,art.vi,cl,invalidates state laws that interfere with,or are contrary to,federal law.audubon soc y davis,cir internal quotation marks omitted.under the supremacy clause,federal law can displace local law or regulation through express preemption,field preemption or conflict preemption.ting,cir.express preemption results when congress enacts a clear statutory command that local law is displaced.id.field preemption occurs when federal regulation of an area is so comprehensive that we must infer that congress left no room for local regulation.id.at.finally,c onflict preemption is found where compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.id.citations omitted.
bernhardt argues that the county runs afoul of the supremacy clause because its policy effectively repeals.we interpret her to be invoking the obstruction strand o
