a jury found that defendant nabors drilling usa,nabors terminated plaintiff thomas west west employment because of his age,in willful violation of the age discrimination in employment act of adea,et.we must decide whether the evidence is sufficient to support the jury findings that nabors discharged west because of his age and that it willfully violated the adea,and its implied finding that west mitigated his damages.we must also determine whether two trial rulings present reversible error.we affirm the verdict of willful age discrimination and hold that the trial rulings,even if assumed to be incorrect,do not require reversal.we reverse the awards of back pay and liquidated damages because the trial evidence permits only the reasonable finding that,except during a limited period,west failed to mitigate his damages.nabors also challenges the district court award of attorney fees and expenses.because they may be affected on remand by the reduced recoveries of back pay and liquidated damages and by the need for additional proceedings in the district court,we also vacate and remand these awards.
west worked for nabors and its predecessor companies for several years as a drilling rig nabors terminated his employment.at the time he was discharged,west was years old.nabors replaced him with an individual age.west alleged that his age was one reason nabors decided to fire him.nabors countered that it terminated west employment because he refused the explicit directive of his supervisor,james nash nash,to report for work.west sued nabors alleging willful age discrimination,in violation of the adea.
the first jury to hear the case deadlocked,resulting in a mistrial.during the second trial,nabors moved for judgment as a matter of law at the conclusion of west contending that west had failed to introduce substantial evidence of age discrimination and of a willful violation of the adea,and that the evidence demonstrated that he had failed to mitigate his damages.at the conclusion of all the evidence,nabors renewed the motion on all three grounds.the district court denied both motions.after the jury returned a verdict in west favor,the district court entered judgment awarding west in back pay,in liquidated damages for a willful violation,in attorney fees,in costs,and interest nabors renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law,and the district court denied the motion.
nabors appeals,contending there is insufficient evidence to support the jury findings that nabors discriminated against west because of his age and that it willfully violated the adea.it maintains in the alternative that the district court abused its discretion by excluding relevant and crucial evidence and argument concerning a comparison between west and another employee,that the evidence is insufficient to support the jury implied finding that west mitigated his damages,and that the district court abused its discretion in awarding excessive attorney fees and unallowable expenses.

we turn first to west age discrimination claim.
at trial,west primarily attempted to demonstrate intentional age discrimination through the combination of proving the elements of his prima facie case and of establishing that nabors proffered reason for discharging him was pretextual.he introduced no direct proof.west in fact conceded that,as far as he knew,during his tenure with nabors he was treated with respect,and no one,including nash,made any derogatory remarks or comments about,or made fun of him based on,his age.west does not contend that nabors engaged in any discriminatory act before the day he was terminated during his employment,he never complained of age discrimination.west received salary increases while working under nash supervision.no one at nabors,including nash,told west that he was being laid off or discharged because of his age.
absent direct proof of age discrimination,our analysis will focus on whether west developed adequate evidence to permit a reasonable finding of pretext.to understand our conclusion that he did,we will begin by recounting the principal components of the proof that nabors produced to justify its decision to terminate west.we will then discuss the evidence that permitted the jury reasonably to find that nabors stated reason was pretextual.
according to nabors,west worked as a toolpusher,the individual who supervises the employees and operations of a drilling rig.he was assigned to rig,working seven days on and seven off,from thursday to thursday.the other toolpusher on the rig was tommy price price.he also normally worked seven days on and seven off,from thursday to thursday.nabors and price thus alternated as the rig toolpusher.
in the early fall of,nabors stacked rig,that is,it removed it from operation due to lack of work.in december,however,rig was restored to operation at a well at hawkins,texas.nash was the drilling superintendent for nabors east texas district.he informed west that,on friday,december,rig was to be moved to its new location.west shift that week was scheduled to conclude on thursday,december,but he agreed to stay two additional days,to saturday,december.this would enable west to the new location and would permit price and the rig hands to report to the new location.west did not assist in the process.after the rig was moved,west returned to his home in mississippi.
price reported to rig on tuesday,december.he helped in the process of moving rig to its new location and rigging it up.commenced december and took about four days to complete.during this time,price worked long shifts,some days hours and other days hours,and he remained at the rig for the entire process.
west was supposed to relieve price on thursday,december,when price would have worked nine straight days.on december price telephoned west at his home in mississippi to discuss paperwork.during the call,west told price that he was not returning to the rig until saturday,december,because he had worked extra days during his last hitch.after speaking with west,price called nash to inform him that west was not returning until saturday.price complained to nash that he needed relief on the regular changeover day.nash knew that price was exhausted.after he tried unsuccessfully to reach west by telephone,nash called price and instructed him to call west and tell him to return to the rig the next day,december,or he would be fired.price reached west later that night and relayed what nash had said.west responded,well,okay,but he did not report as directed.
still at home in mississippi,west telephoned nash the morning of december,but he did not explain during the call why he had not reported.nash was mad at west because he felt that,before december,west had been drawing easy money for several months watching rig and nash had also previously given west extra time off with pay nash informed west that he was laid off,discharging him for cause,not because of his age,which never entered nash mind.
the evidence that west introduced to prove that nabors proffered reason for discharging alleged refusal to report for work on december pretextual centered on these five premises west had been a longtime,exemplary employee who had never failed to show up for work and was unlikely to refuse to do so or to disobey a supervisor direct order he in fact agreed to return to the rig,as directed,when price contacted him on december when nash informed west that he had been terminated,he stated that he had to lay off him or william cran cran,a much younger and toolpusher,and the evidence showed that nash had already decided to replace west with cran,before he spoke to west termination for one mistake of this type was inconsistent with company policy,and,in completing the employee status change form,nash selected layoff,not a reason,as the basis for discharging west and in an affidavit executed four months before trial,nash gave false reasons when attempting to explain why he had discharged west and replaced him with cran.
viewed favorably to the verdict,the evidence is sufficient to support the jury finding of pretext.during many years of employment with nabors and its predecessors,west had never been disciplined,refused to show up for work,refused a direct order of a supervisor,or been disciplined or counseled for failing to be where he was supposed to be.before west returned home to mississippi,he and price agreed that he could return on friday,december since he had worked two days over his hitch.toolpushers commonly reach such agreements.at approximately on wednesday,december,price telephoned west at his home to report on the status of the rig.price said nothing during this conversation about a need for west to return to work.later that day,between approximately and,price called a second time.he said that he had talked to nash,who directed west to return to the rig the next day,or he would be laid off.west responded that he would be there the next morning,as quickly as he and his wife could go to prayer meeting,his wife could wash his clothes,and he could pack.after the call,west asked his wife to get his clothes cleaned because he was returning to the rig the following morning.she testified that she understood that west intended to report as instructed.price testified that he expected west to return on time because he was the kind of man who followed orders.
between approximately and,price telephoned a third time.he said he had talked to nash and recounted what the two had discussed.during this call,price told west not to show up at the rig but to call nash the next morning around or because nash was putting another man in his place.west did not return to the rig because price had told him not to 
as directed,west telephoned nash the next morning.he asked him why he was being laid off or replaced.nash responded that price had told him he did not want to come back to work.nash did not tell west that he was being laid off because of his failure to show up that morning.instead,he said that if he did not put cran,on the rig,he would have to lay him off,and that either west or cran,had to be laid off.cran,was years old and had been a toolpusher for approximately two to three years.nash also told west to call him back in about a week,and if they had an opening,he would put him back to work 
west introduced evidence that permitted the conclusion that nash had already replaced him with cran,as toolpusher on rig before nash or price reached him and he allegedly refused to return to work.cran,testified that nash called him at approximately on december to tell him to report to rig the next morning.cran,rig had recently been stacked,and he had been reassigned to work as a driller a position on the rig of his father,william cran cran.according to nash cell phone records,on december he telephoned rig,where price was working,at.he later called at and spoke to price.at nash attempted to call west at home.he did not reach him,so he tried again at.when nash again failed to make contact,he telephoned price at the rig at.during this call,nash allegedly instructed price to tell west to return to the rig.but at,within nine minutes of allegedly attempting to contact west and one minute of purportedly attempting to call price with instructions for west to report for work,he telephoned cran,in mississippi and directed him to report to the rig.therefore,nash actually spoke to cran,before he talked to west 
nabors written employment policies and procedures provided that,before a supervisor could terminate an employee,three written disciplinary actions must have occurred,and west was not aware that he had ever been written up before his termination.nash testified that he considered west to be a good employee whose performance was always good and who had experienced no discipline problems until december.the nabors employee status change form stated that the reason for his termination was layoff.it did not reflect that west had been discharged for cause,including for misconduct,unsatisfactory performance,or violation of company policy.although nash asserted that west had not followed a direct order,had violated company policy,had been absent from the rig when he was supposed to be there,and had engaged in unsatisfactory performance and misconduct,when he directed his secretary to complete the form he stated only that west had been laid off.
in an affidavit that nash signed in september months before averred falsely that he had spoken to cran,only after he had talked to west and learned that he was not returning to the rig.nash also conceded during his trial testimony that he had falsely stated in the affidavit that he had called cran,because he was located in proximity to rig.this assertion was untrue because cran,like west,was at home in waynesboro,mississippi,not near rig,which was operating in hawkins,texas.
we hold that the jury could have considered it unlikely that an experienced,good employee who had never been disciplined,refused to show up for work,declined to follow a supervisor directive,or been disciplined or counseled for failing to be where he was supposed to be would refuse his supervisor direct order to report for work.it could have found credible west testimony that he told price on december that he would report to the rig as directed on december,and that price later informed him not to do so because nash had already decided to replace him with cran.it could reasonably have concluded that nash told west that,if he did not replace him,he would have to lay off cran,and that nash had already decided to replace west with cran,before he spoke to him.the jury could also have considered it unlikely,in view of nabors policy requiring multiple infractions before termination,that nash would discharge west based on a single mistake,especially considering his failure to designate a reason on the employee status change form.it could also have reasonably found pretext based on nash admission that he stated falsely in an affidavit executed just months before trial that he had arranged for cran,to act as toolpusher only after he had spoken to west,and that he had chosen cran,based on his proximity to the rig.
the district court decisions denying nabors motions for judgment as a matter of law are therefore affirmed 
nabors also challenges the jury finding that it acted willfully and,in turn,the award of liquidated damages.it points to an absence of evidence of age discrimination or disparate treatment before west was discharged,including the fact that nabors allowed west to watch rig,at full salary,rather than terminate him.nabors also essentially reargues its contention that the proof does not support a finding of age discrimination,much less willful discrimination.nabors maintains that willful discrimination requires that an employer act with knowledge or reckless disregard of the adea,that unreasonable conduct is not enough,and that liquidated damages are punitive and should be reserved for the most egregious adea violations.it cites our decisions in russell and purcell seguin state bank trust,cir,in which we deemed the evidence insufficient to support findings of willful violations,and it contends that the facts of those cases are much more compelling than those of the instant case,which nabors asserts do not include a single egregious fact.
a violation of the adea is willful if the employer knew or showed reckless disregard for whether its conduct was prohibited by the adea.smith berry,cir citing trans world airlines,thurston,d woodhouse magnolia,cir.an employer who knowingly relies on age in reaching a decision does not invariably commit a knowing and reckless adea violation.tyler union oil of,cir.if an employer incorrectly but in good faith and nonrecklessly believes that the statute permits a particular decision,then liquidated damages should not be imposed.id.quoting hazen paper,at.liquidated damages,however,are not recoverable only if there is evidence that the intentional violation of the adea was based on the employer,albeit mistaken,belief that the statute allowed an decision.woodhouse,at emphasis added citing thurston,at.
nabors urges us to overturn the verdict based on a supposed absence of any egregious facts surrounding west discharge.in hansard metropolitan bottling,cir,a panel of this court concluded that t he supreme court has held that liquidated damages are a punitive sanction and should be reserved for the most egregious violations of the adea.in russell another panel cited hansard for this proposition.russell,at we do not read hansard to superimpose a heightened test of egregiousness on the requirement of thurston that an employer must have kn own or show n reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by the adea.thurston,at.accord hazen paper,at.hansard followed its conclusion that liquidated damages should be reserved for the most egregious violations of the adea by identifying categorically in the next sentence what qualifies as an egregious violation one where the defendant acted knowingly or recklessly,a violation that satisfies the thurston standard.hansard,at.we therefore reject nabors reliance on a supposed absence of egregious facts.see tyler,at a finding of willfulness does not require a showing that the employer conduct was outrageous.citing hazen paper,at.
nabors also argues that,in russell and purcell,we reversed jury verdicts of willfulness on facts that are much more compelling than those developed in this case.we must focus,however,on the evidence presented in our case and evaluate it under the rule a standard.viewed favorably to the verdict,the jury found that nash decided to terminate west employment because of his age.nash could not have acted in the good faith,although mistaken,belief that his conduct was permissible under the adea.moreover,w e have upheld jury findings of willfulness when a jury finding of intentional violation of the adea necessarily implied a finding that the employer proffered explanation for the adverse employment action was pretextual.tyler,at citing burns.city refining,cir powell rockwell int l,cir see smith,at.
accordingly,we affirm the district court decision denying nabors motions for judgment as a matter of law on the issue of willfulness.
nabors argues in the alternative that the district court abused its discretion in excluding evidence concerning cran,who was approximately west age and also worked as a toolpusher under nash supervision.nabors maintains that this evidence would have permitted the jury to compare cran,and west circumstances and treatment.it also complains that the district court excluded its counsel,during opening statement and closing argument,from organizing and presenting to the jury in a coherent fashion the evidence about the comparative circumstances and treatment of cran,and west.
we consider first the district court evidentiary ruling.nabors complains that the district court refused to permit it to introduce evidence of cran,age.it posits that,w ithout this critical information,all other evidence concerning cran,was meaningless.appellant br.at.
even if we assume arguendo that the district court abused its discretion in making this evidentiary ruling,nabors must establish that it suffered substantial prejudice as a result.rutherford,at sex discrimination case citing mooney aramco servs,cir.we will reject an assertion of prejudice when we conclude that the differences between the evidence nabors was allowed to offer and what it sought to introduce were not so qualitatively significant that we can confidently discern any adverse effect on its substantial rights.id.we hold that nabors has failed to make the necessary showing.
nabors can not demonstrate substantial prejudice because cran,age was deducible from the trial evidence.cran,testified that he had lived in his hometown a bout sixty years.when his son,cran,testified,he stated that he was age.the jury could easily have inferred that cran,age was comparable to west.
nabors also maintains that the district court erroneously forbade its counsel from discussing cran,and west comparatively.nabors does not complain that the court excluded comparative evidence it argues that the court precluded nabors counsel from organizing and presenting the evidence coherently during his opening statement and closing argument.
we discern no reversible error.notably,it is not until nabors reply brief that we are told why nabors deemed it important to organize this evidence coherently for the jury.in the reply brief,nabors posits that it was vital to focus the jury on the fact that,although west was discharged when he failed to report for work as directed,cran,a toolpusher of approximately the same age,was not discharged because he was reliable and reported to work.according to nabors,t hat west failed to report to work and was discharged and cran,always reported to work and was not discharged in december is precisely why this comparative evidence is highly probative.appellant br.at.we find this to be an inapposite comparison.the relevant comparison would be between nabors discipline of west and of a younger employee with a similar unblemished employment record,evidence that nash discharged a younger employee the first time he refused to follow one of his directives,despite the employee otherwise exemplary record.
moreover,the jury was able to give fair consideration to this evidence even if nabors counsel was not permitted to argue it with desired clarity.in the district court preliminary instructions at the commencement of trial,it made clear to the jury that it could base its verdict on reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence.in its final instructions,the court incorporated these instructions and asked the jury to recall them.the comparative evidence on which nabors relies is neither so subtle nor so complex that counsel inability to argue it suggests the jury would have been unable or unlikely to compare the treatment of west and cran.
nabors maintains that the evidence is insufficient to support the jury implied finding that west discharged his duty to mitigate his damages.
a plaintiff suing for back pay under the adea has a duty to mitigate his damages.hansard,at the adea requires a plaintiff to use reasonable efforts to obtain other employment after he is terminated.he must use reasonable diligence to obtain substantially equivalent employment.migis pearle vision,cir title vii pregnancy discrimination case citing sellers delgado,cir.substantially equivalent employment is that employment which affords virtually identical promotional opportunities,compensation,job responsibilities,working conditions,and status as the position from which the title vii claimant has been discriminatorily terminated.sellers,at title vii case internal quotation marks omitted quoting sellers delgado cmty,cir.t he burden is on the employer to prove failure to mitigate.migis,at.although the employer is normally required to prove that substantially equivalent work was available and that the former employee did not exercise reasonable diligence to obtain it,once the employer proves that an employee has not made reasonable efforts to obtain work,the employer does not also have to establish the availability of substantially equivalent employment.sellers,at quoting sellers,at.a plaintiff may not simply abandon his job search and continue to recover back pay.hansard,at.
west maintains that the trial evidence supports the verdict.he relies on proof that,following his termination,he unsuccessfully attempted for several months to be rehired by nabors,after which he was forced to find employment that enabled him to meet his family immediate and serious financial situation.west argues that the jury had a full opportunity to consider the trial evidence,and that,to decide the case differently,we would be required to reweigh the evidence and assess the credibility of the witnesses.
we hold that the jury could reasonably have found that west mitigated his damages by seeking employment with nabors through february.west testified that,during the conversation in which he was discharged,nash told him to call him back in about a week and he would let him know whether he could put him back to work.as a result,west did call nash three or four times during the succeeding few weeks seeking employment.he deferred applying with other employers because he hoped that nabors would rehire him 
the trial evidence,however,permits only the reasonable finding that west made no attempts to find substantially equivalent employment after february.west conceded in his testimony that he did not seek work with any drilling company or any employment with any employer.on february,west applied for and obtained employment as a truck driver and roustabout with a construction company,a position that paid per hour.after that company business slowed,he sought employment at another company his employer at the time of trial driving a truck.west began work in september in a position that initially paid per hour and,at the time of trial,paid per hour.in,his last year of employment with nabors,west earned in salary and benefits.the trial record shows unmistakably that,apart from obtaining comparatively work with two companies,west did not seek any other employment and did not attempt to find substantially equivalent employment.the jury could therefore only have reasonably found that he failed to mitigate his damages after february.see,denesha farmers ins,cir affirming denial of front pay where plaintiff attempted without success for six months to find comparable employment and then took job,during which he applied only once for employment in his area of expertise,and holding that a plaintiff must make some sustained minimal attempt to obtain comparable employment hartley dillard,cir a plaintiff efforts to mitigate need not be successful but must represent an honest effort to find substantially equivalent work.
accordingly,the district court erred in denying nabors motions for judgment as a matter of law to the extent west sought back pay for any period except december,through february.we reverse the award of back pay and,in turn,the award of liquidated damages and remand for further proceedings.because back pay is an equitable remedy,giles general electric,cir,the district court need
