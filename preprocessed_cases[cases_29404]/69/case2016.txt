the city of los angeles on behalf of two of its employees,sharon morris,then interim general manager of the city animal services department,and david diliberto,director of field operations for the department,filed three petitions under code of civil procedure section seeking workplace violence protective orders against animal rights activist pamelyn ferdin vlasak ferdin and the animal defense angeles following a raucous nighttime protest at diliberto home.the trial court granted temporary restraining orders against ferdin and in the two actions initiated on behalf of diliberto,denied without prejudice a temporary restraining order in the action on behalf of morris against and set all three matters for a hearing with respect to the city request for permanent injunctive relief.in response ferdin and filed special motions to strike the actions under section,the statute 
the trial court denied the special motions to strike,holding the city workplace violence petitions fall within section,subdivision d exception for an enforcement action brought in the name of the people of the state of california by the attorney general,district attorney,or city attorney,acting as a public prosecutor and thus are exempt from scrutiny under section.ferdin and appeal from the trial court orders,contending the petitions are not enforcement actions within the meaning of section,subdivision d,and therefore are subject to a special motion to strike the city petitions for injunctive relief arise from acts in furtherance of their right of petition or free speech under the united states and california constitutions in connection with a public issue and the city has failed to demonstrate a probability it will prevail on its claims under section.we agree with ferdin and on all three points and reverse the trial court orders.
factual and procedural background 
the protest at david diliberto home 
shortly before on june,approximately protestors,including ferdin and her husband jerry vlasak,also a member of,participated in a noisy demonstration at diliberto home protesting what they believed to be the inhumane treatment and killing of animals by the city of los angeles at its six animal shelters.some of the demonstrators reportedly wore masks and others hooded sweatshirts with the hoods pulled tightly around their faces.according to diliberto,ferdin was yelling into a bullhorn from his front porch,knocking on the front door and banging both the door knocker and the lid on the mail slot on the front door.a flyer from criticizing the city animal services department and its personnel was put through diliberto mail slot.when diliberto demanded the protestors leave,the screaming and banging grew louder.the police were called,but the demonstration ended and the protestors left before the police arrived at the scene.
a news release apparently from and posted on its website described the protest on june,as the first in a series of mobile demo and reported the demonstrators had gone to the homes of morris and james hahn prior to their arrival at diliberto home.
the city workplace violence petitions 
on june,the city filed three substantially identical petitions pursuant to section seeking workplace violence protective orders on behalf of diliberto against ferdin and and on behalf of morris only against.in addition to the petitions themselves,filed on the mandatory form adopted by the judicial council of california the city filed declarations from morris and diliberto with attached exhibits in support of its requests for temporary restraining orders against ferdin in a petition filed on behalf of diliberto and against in separate petitions filed on behalf of diliberto and morris.
the petitions alleged in identical language ferdin and had made a credible threat of violence against morris and diliberto that can reasonably be construed to be carried out or to have been carried out at the employees workplace at south spring street,los angeles.the petitions described the protest at diliberto home,which it asserted violated applicable trespass laws and caused fear to diliberto and his family.the petitions further alleged,defendant plans to continue to attack employee home,leading persons wearing masks and hooded clothin g to employee home on a continuous basis.
the petitions and the attached declarations and exhibits also asserted the,described as a militant animal rights activist group headed by ferdin,has a web site on which high powered bullets are aimed at,which leads to employee name and home address and a page with employee name with bullet holes depicted.diliberto declaration states the website has his picture,home information and a page of allegations regarding his job performance.purporting to be from the website are attached to the declaration.diliberto also declared,i am afraid for my life and safety and i am especially afraid for the lives and safety of my wife and four children,who were badly frightened by the events of june.morris declaration also describes the website and and concludes by stating,based on activities and the fact that they have targeted me and my home,described themselves as militant,and posted my home address and telephone numbers on their web site with violent images,i am afraid for my safety and the safety of my family.
upon reviewing the petitions and supporting declarations and exhibits,the trial court issued orders to show cause for august,with respect to all three petitions and temporary restraining orders against and ferdin with respect to the two petitions filed by diliberto in addition to issuing in modified form many of the standard restraining orders preprinted on judicial council form,the court specifically directed and ferdin to remove diliberto home address and telephone number from their websites and ordered them not to post his home address or telephone number on the internet.
ferdin and special motions to strike and the city opposition 
in response to the city petitions ferdin and filed special motions to strike the actions under section,the statute,which they set for hearing on august,the same date as the hearing on the orders to show cause.ferdin and apparently also filed demurrers to the petitions.in a supporting declaration ferdin identified herself as an officer and cofounder of,which she described as an grass roots organization which,through its leadership,members,as well as the public,via the internet,protests,picketing,speeches,interviews,leaflets,and the like,advocate for the humane treatment of animals which it deems is a public issue and matter of public interest.
in her declaration ferdin asserted the june,protest at diliberto house lasted less than minutes,occurred only on public property or property open to the public,was peaceful and did not result in any violence,arrests,or otherwise require law enforcement to maintain the peace.ferdin testified she and vlasak were the only two members present during the demonstration.with respect to the website,ferdin stated hosted the site as a public forum and insisted it contained opinions and statements from anyone who desired to express his or her views about the humane treatment of animals.
the city filed oppositions to ferdin and special motions to strike,arguing section does not apply to section petitions for workplace violence restraining orders on the grounds that violence or the advocacy of violence is not a protected first amendment activity.the city also argued that,even if the petitions do arise from acts in furtherance of ferdin and right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue,the special motions to strike were properly denied because the declarations filed in support of the city request for temporary restraining orders demonstrated a probability it will prevail on its claims under section.
on august,the trial court permitted ferdin and to file a supplemental brief addressing whether section,subdivision d,excepted the city workplace violence petitions as governmental enforcement actions under city of long beach california citizens for neighborhood empowerment th,d citizens for neighborhood empowerment,and people health laboratories of north america,th,d health laboratories.
the trial court ruling 
on august,the trial court denied the special motions to strike,holding that under section,subdivision d,as interpreted by citizens for neighborhood empowerment,supra,th,d,and health laboratories,supra,th,d,the city workplace violence petitions were exempted from the provisions of the statute.the court also indicated that,if it had reached the issues,it would have held ferdin and activities were in furtherance of their right to petition and free speech in connection with a public issue within the meaning of section but their motions would nonetheless have been denied because the city had demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the merits.
ferdin and immediately filed notices of appeal,staying further proceedings in the trial court.varian medical systems,delfino cal th,d.we consolidated the three appeals on march.
contentions 
ferdin and contend the city workplace violence petitions are not civil enforcement actions within the meaning of section,subdivision d,and are therefore subject to a special motion to strike the city petitions arise from acts by ferdin and in furtherance of their right of petition or free speech under the united states and california constitutions in connection with a public issue and the city has failed to demonstrate a probability it will prevail on its claims under section as to because injunctive relief under that section is available only against natural persons,not corporate entities,and as to both ferdin and because the city failed to introduce evidence of any unlawful violence or credible threat of violence against either diliberto or morris that can reasonably be construed to be carried out or to have been carried out at the workplace.
discusssion 
section workplace violence petitions 
section authorizes a person who has been harassed to obtain an injunction under specified circumstances prohibiting any further harassment in diamond view limited herz d.the court of appeal held the term person as used in section to specify who may petition for injunctive relief against civil harassment was limited to a natural person and did not include a business entity,even if that entity was the employer of the victim of the harassment.
in response to the ruling in diamond view limited herz,supra,d,section,with provisions for temporary restraining orders and injunctive relief substantially similar to those in section,was enacted in authorizing an employer,specifically including a corporate or government employer to seek restraining orders on behalf of its employees to prevent threats or acts of violence in the workplace by another employee or a third person.scripps health marin th,d scripps health section was thus intended to enable employers to seek the same remedy for its employees as section provides for natural persons.see com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill first.as amended june,this bill enacts parallel provisions to section,to allow an employer to pursue a tro and an injunction.the bill limits the acts that may be sought to be enjoined by an employer to unlawful violence or a credible threat of violence.an individual could still pursue an injunction for harassment under section.
to obtain injunctive relief under section an employer must prove its employee has suffered unlawful violence or a credible threat of violence from an individual that can reasonably be construed to have occurred in the workplace,subds.a,e.in addition,the employer must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that it is reasonably likely such unlawful violence may occur in the future absent a restraining order,subd.f scripps health,supra,th at,d t o obtain a permanent injunction under section,subdivision f,a plaintiff must establish by clear and convincing evidence not only that a defendant engaged in unlawful violence or made credible threats of violence,but also that great or irreparable harm would result to an employee if a prohibitory injunction were not issued due to the reasonable probability unlawful violence will occur in the future.id,fn.t he requirement of establishing the reasonable probability wrongful acts,or simply unlawful violence,will occur in the future guarantees that injunctive relief will be issued to prevent future harm instead of punishing past completed acts.
section the statute 
section provides,a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b.in ruling on a defendant motion under section,the trial court engages in a process.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity.the moving defendant burden is to demonstrate that the act or acts of which the plaintiff complains were taken in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,as defined in the statute,subd.b.if the court finds such a showing has been made,it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.under section,subdivision b,the trial court in making these determinations considers the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d,equilon enterprises.the defendant has the burden on the first issue,the threshold issue the plaintiff has the burden on the second issue.citation.citation.kajima engineering construction,city of los angeles th,d kajima.
we review de novo the trial court rulings on an motion thomas quintero th,d kajima,supra,th at,d,including the question whether section applies to the challenged claim.thomas,at,d kyle carmon th,d.
section workplace violence petitions are subject to special motions to strike under section 
a petition for injunctive relief against civil harassment pursuant to section is subject to a special motion to strike under the statute.thomas quintero,supra,th at,d petitions brought pursuant to section are subject to attack by a special motion to strike under section.f acially the statute applies to petitions and no exception is made for one filed under the civil harassment statute id.at,d.we are fully cognizant that the civil harassment statute establishes a special procedure specifically designed to provide for expedited injunctive relief to persons who have suffered civil harassment because of the significant social and community value the civil harassment statute provides,like the trial court,we are wary of the potential for conflict between the statute and the civil harassment remedy.however,we can not ignore the relatively straightforward textual solution to the issue of section interpretation raised on appeal.fortunately,we also do not share the concerns expressed that allowing a petition for civil harassment to be attacked by a special motion to strike will interfere with the civil harassment statutory scheme,nor do we view it as being likely to inhibit the invocation of that procedure.id.at,d.
given the substantial similarity other than the identity of the petitioning party between petitions for civil harassment restraining orders under section and petitions for workplace violence restraining orders under section,the reasoning of thomas quintero,supra,th,d,applies equally to both statutes.thus workplace violence petitions in general,like civil harassment petitions,are subject to motions to strike under section.id.at,d.
without disputing the general applicability of section to workplace violence petitions,however,and relying in particular on this court decision in california citizens for neighborhood empowerment,supra,th,d,the city asserts the petitions it filed on behalf of its employees fall within section,subdivision d exception for an enforcement action brought in the name of the people of the state of california by the attorney general,district attorney,or city attorney,acting as a public prosecutor and thus are exempt from scrutiny under section.the city argues the petitions constitute civil enforcement actions because the conduct of ferdin and it sought to enjoin violates both section and penal code section,which makes it a crime to threaten a public officer with the intent to cause that individual to do or refrain from doing any act in the performance of his or her duties.the city position,adopted by the trial court in its order denying the special motions to strike,directly conflicts with the express language of section,subdivision d,and represents an unwarranted extension of the holding and rationale of our opinion in california citizens for neighborhood empowerment.
the city is correct section,subdivision d,applies not only to criminal prosecutions but also broadly to civil enforcement actions filed by one of the designated public prosecutors seeking injunctions,restitution or civil penalties but not damages.health laboratories,supra,th at,d california citizens for neighborhood empowerment,supra,th at,d.in addition,although the express language of the statute limits the exemption to enforcement actions brought in the name of the people of the state of california,an otherwise exempted enforcement action brought in the name of a city or county itself,rather than the people is not necessarily outside the ambit of the section,subdivision d,exception to scrutiny under the law.california citizens for neighborhood empowerment,at,d.a n examination of the legislative history of section shows there was concern on the part of the state attorney general that the statute as initially introduced without the exemption might impair the ability of state and local agencies to enforce certain consumer protection laws i t is reasonable to infer that the measure was designed to address the attorney general concern,which extended to all civil actions brought by state and local agencies to enforce laws aimed at consumer public protection.ibid.accordingly,notwithstanding the literal language of section,subdivision d,that provision applies to any civil enforcement action initiated by a city attorney,county counsel,district attorney or attorney general to enforce laws intended to protect the public.id.at,d.
although section,subdivision d,thus applies somewhat more broadly than the literal language of the provision may suggest,only actions brought by a governmental agency to enforce laws aimed generally at public protection qualify for this exemption to scrutiny.health laboratories,supra,th at,d rejecting equal protection challenge to exemption in,subd.d,on ground subjecting public prosecutors enforcement actions to statute could unduly hinder and undermine their efforts to protect the health and safety of the citizenry at large see california citizens for neighborhood empowerment,supra,th at,d.the city workplace violence petitions simply do not satisfy this definition of civil enforcement actions 
first,unlike the city of long beach campaign financing laws at issue in california citizens for neighborhood empowerment,supra,th at pages,d,and the statutes prohibiting false or misleading advertising and unfair competition involved in health laboratories,supra,th at pages,d,section authorizing workplace violence petitions,important as it is,plainly is not a law intended to protect the health and safety of the citizenry at large.health laboratories,at,d.it is a tool for permitting or ensure a safe workplace and to protect their individual employees scripps health,supra,th at,d enables employer to seek same remedy for its employees as provides for natural persons injunctive relief so as to prevent such acts of workplace violence see huntingdon life sciences,stop huntingdon animal cruelty usa,th,d huntingdon life allows employer to seek injunctive relief on behalf of its employees.thus,whether or not the city actually believed it was acting in some sort of a hybrid capacity as both employer and public prosecutor when it filed the workplace violence petitions,as it now insists,the nature of the actions initiated does not fall within the narrow ambit of the section,subdivision d,exemption.
second,the city and our dissenting colleague characterization of the city motive for filing the petitions notwithstanding,the record does not support the assertion these three workplace violence petitions were filed by the city,wholly or in part,in its capacity as public prosecutor.rather,the petitions were filed,as they must be under section,by the city as morris and diliberto employer,a term expressly defined by section,subdivision d,to include cities,counties and other governmental entities as well as private enterprises that have one or more individuals in their service.indeed,although the city now claims its workplace violence petitions were intended to enforce penal code section s prohibition against threats to public officers,the petitions themselves contain no allegation of a violation of that statute,alleging only that ferdin protest at diliberto home on the night of june,was in violation of trespass laws.
finally,although this court departed from the express language of section,subdivision d,in california citizens for neighborhood empowerment,supra,th at pages,d,when we applied the exemption to a civil enforcement action that had not been brought literally in the name of the people of the state of california,any further erosion of the specific requirements of that provision is unwarranted in light of the supreme court subsequent admonition in jarrow formulas,lamarche cal th,d,that the plain language of section is to be respected and that exceptions to the statute broad reach must not be lightly implied the legislature clearly knows how to create an exemption from the statute when it wishes to do so.ibid.
ferdin and challenged conduct was in furtherance of their right to petition and free speech in connection with a public issue 
the threshold issue in ruling on an motion is whether the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity.equilon enterprises,supra,cal th at,d.the statute definitional focus is not the form of the plaintiff cause of action but,rather,the defendant activity that gives rise to his or her asserted liability and whether that activity constitutes protected speech or petitioning.navellier sletten cal th,d.demonstrations,leafleting and publication of articles on the internet to criticize government policy regarding the alleged mistreatment of animals at animal activities in which ferdin and a classic exercise of the constitutional rights of petition and free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest within the meaning of section,subdivision e.huntingdon life,supra,th at,d lawsuit arising from demonstrations and internet postings against private laboratory animal testing based on exercise of first amendment rights thomas quintero,supra,th at,d tenants picketing and leafleting at landlord church to protest property management practices protected activities within,subd.e see also fashion coalition for humane immigrant rights of los angeles th,d no dispute demonstrations and picketing in front of retail stores and issuance of press releases and internet articles describing plight of immigrant workers arose from defendants exercise of first amendment right of free speech in connection with a public issue.
the city argues ferdin and have failed to satisfy the first prong of section because the workplace violence petitions challenge only their threats and other illegal activities citing once again to penal code section,not their legitimate protests,and therefore are based entirely on unprotected activity as this court has previously held,however,the legislature did not intend that in order to invoke the special motion to strike the defendant must first establish his or her actions are constitutionally protected under the first amendment as a matter of law.fox searchlight pictures,paladino th,d.instead,under the statutory scheme,a court must generally presume the validity of the claimed constitutional right in the first step of the analysis,and then permit the parties to address the issue in the second step of the analysis,if necessary.citation.otherwise,the second step would become superfluous in almost every case,resulting in an improper shifting of the burdens.chavez mendoza th,d see governor gray davis com.american taxpayers alliance th,d.to be sure,if the defendant concedes the conduct complained of was illegal,the defendant will be unable to make a prima facie showing the action arises from protected activity within the meaning of section.paul for council hanyecz th,d,disapproved on another ground in equilon enterprises,supra,cal th at,fn,d.far from conceding they engaged in illegal activity,of course,ferdin and vigorously insist their protests against the city inhumane treatment of animals were well within the law.kashian harriman th,d distinguishing paul for council when legality of defendant litigation activities was a matter of considerable dispute see also contacts,steinberg th,d finding paul for council inapplicable when case was distinctly not one in which defendants ha d effectively conceded the illegal nature of their activities.
the city failed to establish a probability it would prevail on its petitions 
i n order to establish the requisite probability of prevailing,subd.b,the plaintiff need only have stated and substantiated a legally sufficient claim.citation.navellier sletten,supra,cal th at,d,wilson parker,covert chidester cal th,d.although the showing required is only one of minimal merit navellier,at,d,the two workplace violence petitions directed to fail as a matter of law because section authorizes issuance of a workplace violence restraining order only against individuals,not against groups,associations or corporate entities.the city petition on behalf of diliberto against ferdin also fails because the city presented no evidence she conveyed a credible threat of violence that can reasonably be construed to be carried out at the workplace.
restraining orders under section may be directed only to natural persons 
section,subdivision a,is specifically directed to unlawful violence and credible threats of violence made by an individual any employer,whose employee has suffered unlawful violence or a credible threat of violence from any individual may seek a temporary restraining order and an injunction on behalf of the employee prohibiting further unlawful violence or threats of violence by that individual.italics added.we look to the usual and ordinary meaning of the statutory language in order to discern legislative intent.graham daimlerchrysler cal th,d,see murillo fleetwood enterprises,cal th,d,in resolving questions of statutory interpretation,the court must attempt to effectuate the probable intent of the legislature,as expressed through the actual words of the statutes in question the first step is to scrutinize the actual words of the statute,giving them a plain and commonsense meaning.citations.in ordinary usage the word individual denotes a natural person not a group,association or other artificial entity.see webster third new international dictionary ed.giving a primary definition of individual as a single human being as contrasted with a social group or institution.this commonsense interpretation of the word individual in section,subdivision a,is reinforced by section,subdivision g,which specifies either party may be represented by counsel or may appear on his or her own behalf,a provision that could not apply to a corporate entity such as.see gamet blanchard th,fn,d a corporation may not represent itself,except in a small claims proceeding merco constr.engineers,municipal court cal d,same.
the legislative history of section also supports interpretation of an individual subject to a workplace violence restraining order as a natural person only.as discussed,section was enacted in large part in reaction to the holding in diamond view limited herz,supra,d,which restricted the availability of civil harassment injunctions to natural persons,notwithstanding the use of the broader term person in section.scripps health,supra,th at,d.to overcome that limitation,in drafting section the legislature included a comprehensive definition of the term employer to ensure all types of private and public entities could seek workplace violence restraining orders on behalf of their employees,subd.d.the same provision also assigns an expansive definition to the term employee,including for example volunteers and independent contractors who perform services for the employer at the employer worksite,subd.d.as originally introduced,assembly bill first.also broadly authorized issuance of a workplace violence restraining order against either individuals or groups any employer,whose employee suffers harassment,from an individual or from a group,in conjunction with or stemming from his or her employment,may seek a temporary restraining order and injunction prohibiting further harassment by that individual or group.italics added.the references to harassment or intimidation by a group and to restraining orders directed to a group,however,were deleted by amendments soon after introduction of the measure.given section genesis as a reaction to a limited reading of the somewhat ambiguous term person in section,the legislature use of broad definitions in section for employer and employee,together with its conscious decision to authorize issuance of workplace violence restraining orders only against individuals,not individuals or groups,provides strong evidence a section injunction may not be issued against a corporate entity such as.see generally dix superior court cal d,because legislature is presumed aware of prior judicial constructions of a statute,alteration of statutory language significant to such a construction is compelling evidence the legislature intended to change the meaning of a law.
finally,although not dispositive in interpreting the authorized scope of a workplace violence restraining order,we believe it is significant that mandatory judicial council form,in both the iteration used in these actions by the city and as revised effective january,requires the petitioner to include a description of the defendant to be restrained,including sex,height,weight,hair color,eye color,race,age and date of features that obviously relate only to natural persons,not groups,corporations or other artificial entities 
we recognize the court in huntingdon life,supra,th at pages,d,affirmed the trial court denial of a special motion to strike filed by stop huntingdon animal cruelty usa,an artificial entity,finding plaintiffs huntingdon life sciences,hls and its employee claire macdonald had established a probability of prevailing in their harassment action by presenting evidence of a credible threat of violence within the meaning of section,subdivision b,and section,subdivision b.but the complaint in that case did not mention section at all.huntingdon life,at,d.rather,after finding macdonald had established a probability of prevailing in the section civil harassment action while hls had not because section applies only to natural persons,the court nonetheless concluded the complaint adequately alleged facts giving rise to a cause of action by hls under section,which it described simply as allow ing an employer to seek injunctive relief on behalf of its employees under the same criteria set forth in section.huntingdon life,at,d.in reaching that result,the huntingdon life court did not address the use of the term individual in section nor expressly consider whether a restraining order under that statute was properly addressed to an entity rather than a natural person.it is axiomatic an appellate court opinion is not authority for propositions never considered or questions not decided.people braxton cal th,d,people sapp cal th,d.
injunctive relief against for the type of unlawful conduct alleged by the city may well be available if sought under different provisions of the law.see generally slauson partnership ochoa th,d affirming trial court denial of special motion to strike following issuance of preliminary injunction limiting protest activities at private shopping mall.but section,like section,is a special statute that significantly modifies the ordinary procedures and requirements in actions for injunctive relief.the city potential entitlement to similar relief under different statutes does not establish a probability of prevailing on the workplace violence petitions actually filed.see diamond view limited herz,supra,d at,fn.
b.the city failed to present prima facie evidence of any threat of violence at diliberto workplace 
the city does not allege ferdin or,for that matter actually engaged in any act of unlawful violence.accordingly,to obtain a permanent injunction on behalf of diliberto against ferdin under section,the city must establish by clear and convincing evidence that ferdin made a credible threat of violence against diliberto that could reasonably be construed to occur or to have occurred in the workplace,subds.a,e and that it is reasonably likely unlawful violence may occur in the future in the absence of the requested restraining order,subd.f scripps health,supra,th at fn,d.diliberto workplace as alleged in the petition is spring street,los angeles,ca.
the june,demonstration led by ferdin that forms the centerpiece of the city workplace violence petitions took place at diliberto home,not his spring street workplace although we accept for purposes of the city opposition to the motion diliberto testimony that his four children were badly frightened by the events of june,and that he feared for his life and safety,as well as for the lives and safety of his family,nothing in that testimony or the exhibits submitted on his behalf in any way suggests violence will occur at diliberto workplace,an essential requirement for an injunction under section.scripps health,supra,th at,d.to the contrary,the internet postings described by the city,offensive as they may be in displaying red targets and bullet holes next to diliberto name,contain his home address,not his office address,and thus can not reasonably be construed as threats to be carried out at the workplace.similarly,morris declaration focuses on the militant nature of and the fact that they have targeted me and my home and posted my home address and telephone numbers on their web site with violent images.consistent with the perceived threats to diliberto at home,rather than the workplace,the temporary restraining order issued against ferdin,in addition to the standard orders preprinted on judicial council form,were directed to conduct aimed at diliberto home the court ordered ferdin not to telephone or send correspondence to employee home address or residence by any means and to remove employee home address and telephone number from the internet.
the city does not directly address the absence of any nexus between ferdin alleged course of conduct constituting credible threats of violence and diliberto workplace,instead arguing its evidence in support of a section restraining order is essentially the same as the evidence presented in huntingdon life,supra,th,d,in which the court of appeal affirmed the trial court order denying the defendants special motion to strike as to hls and macdonald harassment claims.macdonald cause of action for civil harassment in huntingdon life,however,was based on section,not section and accordingly there was no requirement the evidence of credible threats of violence in any way involve the workplace.huntingdon life,at,d.had diliberto filed his own petition under section,the evidence presented may well have justified issuance of a restraining order and been sufficient to defeat a special motion to strike but that hypothetical petition is not before us.
the city is correct a finding hls had a probability of prevailing on its harassment claim,which was filed under section but which the court of appeal evaluated as a cause of action for a workplace violence restraining order under section huntingdon life,supra,th at,d,should have included an examination of the workplace issue.however,as was the case with the question whether a restraining order can be directed to an artificial entity,the huntingdon life court did not address that issue presumably because it was not raised by the parties and simply concluded the criteria for an employer to obtain injunctive relief under section were the same as for an individual to obtain relief under section.as we have discussed,however,although the two provisions parallel each other in many respects,the circumstances under which an individual may obtain a section civil harassment restraining order are,in fact,broader than an employer right to a workplace violence restraining order under section.see,scripps health,supra,th at,d limits acts that may be enjoined on petition by employer to unlawful violence or credible threat of violence individual can pursue injunction for harassment under.a required nexus between the unlawful violence or credible threat of violence and the employee workplace is one such crucial difference between the two forms of restraining orders.compare,subds.a b with,subds.a b.
having failed to present a prima facie case that ferdin made a credible threat of violence that could reasonably be construed to occur or to have occurred in the workplace,the city similarly failed to demonstrate a probability it would prevail on its section petition on behalf of diliberto directed to ferdin.accordingly,her special motion to strike the petition should have been granted.
ferdin and are entitled to an award of costs and attorney fees,including costs and attorney fees on appeal 
section,subdivision c,provides,in any action subject to subdivision b,a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover his or her attorney fees and costs the award of attorney fees to the party bringing a successful special motion to strike under section is mandatory.ketchum moses cal th,d.accordingly,on remand the trial court is directed to conduct appropriate proceedings to determine the costs and reasonable attorney fees,including attorney fees incurred in connection with this appeal,to be awarded ferdin and.rosenaur scherer th,d the appellate courts have construed section,subdivision c to include an attorney fees award on appeal.citations.dove audio,rosenfeld,meyer susman th,d since section,subdivision c provides for an award of attorney fees and costs to a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike,and does not preclude recovery of appellate attorney fees by a prevailing,those fees are recoverable.
disposition 
the orders denying the special motions to strike under section are reversed.the cause is remanded to the trial court with directions to enter new orders granting the motions and to conduct further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.ferdin and are to recover their attorney fees and costs on appeal in an amount to be determined by the trial court.
i respectfully dissent.it appears to this dissenting justice that the majority opinion is founded on a misplaced premise.the analysis and conclusion set forth in the majority opinion is that the city of los angeles was in actuality entitled to proceed only under the workplace violence statute found in section of the code of civil procedure in filing its three petitions in the los angeles county superior court.the city of los angeles on the other hand has strenuously argued throughout that it was also proceeding on behalf of the people of los angeles county as a public prosecutor and was thereby entitled to the exemption contained in code of civil procedure section thus undercutting the probability that the animal defense league league would prevail on its slapp motion.i interpret the record as presenting a hybrid situation in which the city of los angeles city was acting in a dual capacity,employer and prosecutor on behalf of the people.the majority,on the other hand,rather than recognize the hybrid nature of this case,proceeds to employ an analysis which leads to the conclusion that the city two roles in this instance are mutually exclusive and in finality the majority eliminates the role of the city as prosecutor.i find this con
