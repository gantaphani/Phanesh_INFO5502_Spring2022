we have for review a decision of a district court of appeal on the following question,which the court certified to be of great public importance 
does the impact rule apply to prohibit the recovery of noneconomic damages in a legal malpractice claim when the negligence of a criminal defense attorney results in a loss of liberty and resulting emotional or psychological harm 
holt rowell,so d,dca.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.because we believe the instant case presents a unique factual scenario deserving of an equally tailored principle of law,we rephrase the certified question as follows 
in an action for legal malpractice,does the impact rule preclude recovery of noneconomic damages when the uncontroverted negligent failure to deliver a document that would have produced the immediate release of a pretrial detainee resulted in a protracted period of wrongful pretrial imprisonment with resultant emotional distress or psychological harm,but no physical impact 
for the following reasons,we answer the rephrased certified question in the negative.we therefore quash that portion of the district court decision reversing the jury award of damages for psychological injury,and remand the case for reinstatement of the award of noneconomic damages.
background and facts 
the facts underlying the instant action,exhaustively well detailed in the district court decision below,are as follows 
in may,john rowell sold two firearms to a pawnshop.based upon these sales,rowell was arrested on july,in marion county,florida,for two counts of felon in possession of a firearm.in fact,rowell was innocent of these charges.although rowell had been convicted of a felony in when he was years of age,he had received a restoration of his civil rights on june.rowell was unable to convince the arresting officers that he was innocent of the crimes charged.he was transported to the hillsborough county jail,where he remained overnight until his first appearance hearing scheduled for the following morning,july.
in the thirteenth judicial circuit,preliminary presentation hearings are often performed via closed circuit television.the defendants are physically located at the jail,and an assistant public defender is assigned to this location.a second assistant public defender is present in the courtroom with the presiding judge and the assistant state attorney.
at rowell preliminary presentation hearing on the morning of friday,july,an assistant public defender at the jail spoke with rowell,and rowell signed an affidavit of indigency and an invocation of rights,thus establishing an relationship with the office of the public defender.rowell had in his possession a document indicating that his civil rights had been restored.when the trial judge called rowell case,rowell told the trial judge directly that he had proof of the restoration of his civil rights and held up the document.because the trial judge could not see the contents of the document,the trial judge instructed the assistant public defender to obtain a copy of that document so that the case could be resolved if rowell was indeed permitted to possess a firearm.on the videotape of this event,rowell can be seen handing the document to the assistant public defender at the jail.it is not clear what the assistant public defender who received the document did with it after this hearing.at the time of trial,the assistant public defender could not remember following up on the judge instructions.
the first appearance judge,concerned that rowell might be wrongfully charged,ordered that rowell case be placed on the docket for review on tuesday,july,four days later.this hearing never occurred.according to the assistant public defenders involved in this case,they took no responsibility in keeping track of these types of hearings instead,they traditionally relied exclusively upon the clerk of the court to properly document and schedule them.it appears that the clerk in this case mistakenly noted that the hearing would be held on july,a saturday on which no hearings were held.although hearings presumably occurred before this judge with the participation of assistant public defenders on july,rowell case was not addressed.as a result,rowell remained in jail past july and july.
meanwhile,through the natural process of opening files,rowell case was assigned to a third assistant public defender.this attorney first reviewed the file on july.the file did not contain the document indicating rowell civil rights had been restored or any notation that a hearing had been scheduled.the assistant public defender therefore gave the case no particular priority,but scheduled his first visit with rowell at the jail on july.once this assistant public defender met with rowell on july,and rowell provided the attorney with yet another copy of the document restoring rowell civil rights,the assistant public defender was able to obtain rowell release from jail within two days.the charges against rowell were ultimately dismissed.
rowell filed a legal malpractice action against the office of the public defender.at trial,he contended that the assistant public defenders handling his case were negligent,because he presented them with a document that could have secured his immediate release,yet it took them over ten days to do so.as a result,he requested damages including his lost earning capacity and damages for his loss of liberty,including the mental anguish,inconvenience,and embarrassment caused by his unnecessarily extended incarceration.
throughout the trial,counsel for the office of the public defender sought to limit rowell recovery to his economic damages because rowell had not suffered any impact or physical injury as a result of his incarceration.the trial judge rejected this argument and held that the impact rule did not apply in this context 
the jury found that the assistant public defenders were negligent,and their negligence caused rowell to suffer certain damages.they awarded rowell for his loss of earning capacity and for his mental anguish,pain,and suffering.after the verdict,the office of the public defender filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,again challenging the award of noneconomic damages as a violation of the impact rule.the trial court denied this motion and entered a final judgment in favor of rowell in accordance with the jury verdict.
rowell,so d at.
based on the facts presented,the district court following existing precedent,as required,held that existing florida law pertaining to the impact rule precluded an award of damages for mental injury,and begrudgingly reversed that portion of the jury award.see id.at.the district court articulately expressed its misgivings and reservations with regard to applying the impact rule in the context of rowell action,but did so with the certification of a question to this court to determine whether the rule should preclude recovery for emotional harm in the instant case.see id.at.this review followed.
we begin our analysis of the question presented with a brief review of the impact rule as it has been applied by the courts in this state.the rule requires that before a plaintiff can recover damages for emotional distress caused by the negligence of another,the emotional distress suffered must flow from physical injuries sustained in an impact.humana of,so d,quoting reynolds state farm mut.auto.ins,so d,dca.the impact rule has been traditionally applied primarily as a limitation to assure a tangible validity of claims for emotional or psychological harm.see,so d at gonzalez metro.dade county pub.health trust,so d,kush lloyd,so d.florida jurisprudence has generally reasoned that such assurance is necessary because,unlike physical injury,emotional harm may not readily align with traditional tort law damage principles.our courts have explained that the existence of emotional harm is difficult to prove,resultant damages are not easily quantified,and the precise cause of such injury can be elusive.see,so d at.this court has also theorized that without the impact rule,florida courts may be inundated with litigation based solely on psychological injury.see gonzalez,so d at.
in recent years,this court has had occasion to review the continued vitality of the impact rule,and has consistently reaffirmed that the rule serves as an important safeguard when applied under certain proper circumstances in our judicial system.see,so d at gonzalez,so d at.the impact rule is not,however,an inflexible,unyielding rule of law,so sacred that it must be blindly followed without regard to context.if we were to ascribe such weight to the doctrine,the impact rule itself would exceed the parameters of its underlying justifications.exceptions to the rule have been narrowly created and defined in a certain very narrow class of cases in which the foreseeability and gravity of the emotional injury involved,and lack of countervailing policy concerns,have surmounted the policy rationale undergirding application of the impact rule.see tanner hartog,so d,kush,so d at 
in kush,the parents of a child born with a genetic impairment initiated an action for wrongful birth against the hospital and physicians who had informed them prior to the mother becoming pregnant that neither parent carried a genetic abnormality.see kush,so d at.the parents sought recovery for both the expenses incurred in caring for their child as well as damages for mental anguish.see id.this court held the impact rule inapplicable to wrongful birth actions,and in so doing,expressed doubt that the impact rule was ever intended to embrace the tort of wrongful birth where emotional damages are an additional parasitic consequence of conduct that itself is a freestanding tort apart from any emotional injury.id.at citing page keeton et,prosser and keeton on the law of torts,at ed.the court further reasoned that to the extent the impact rule does not apply to recognized torts such as defamation and invasion of privacy,which result in predominantly emotional damages,it should not preclude recovery for the mental anguish flowing from a wrongful birth,where such harm is equally foreseeable and certainly more grievous.see id.at citing miami herald publ g,so d at,and cason,so d at.in the words of the kush court 
there can be little doubt that emotional injury is more likely to occur when negligent medical advice leads parents to give birth to a severely impaired child than if someone wrongfully calls them liars,accuses them of unchastity,or subjects them to any other similar defamation.a defamation may have little effect,may not be believed,might be ignored,or could be reversed by trial publicity.but the fact of a child serious congenital deformity may have a profound effect,can not be ignored,and at least in this case is irreversible.
in tanner,this court again invoked the concept of foreseeability in holding that the impact rule should not preclude the parents of a child stillborn as a result of negligent medical care from recovering for the mental anguish sustained.see tanner,so d at.the court correctly reasoned that the impact rule should not be applied to produce the outright denial of a claim for the mental pain and anguish which is so likely to be experienced by parents as a result of the birth of a stillborn child caused by the negligence of another.id.emphasis added.the tanner court also carefully expressed its limited determination that the case constituted a natural evolution of the common law,which was not intended to degrade the impact rule.id.
considering and applying the reasoning employed in kush and tanner,we determine that the impact rule should not preclude recovery of noneconomic damages in the instant case.in rendering this decision,we approve the reasoning of the district court below that the special professional duty created by the relationship between rowell and his attorney,coupled with the clear foreseeability of emotional harm resulting from a protracted period of wrongful pretrial incarceration,render application of the impact rule unjust and without an underlying justification in the factual circumstances here.moreover,we are persuaded by the petitioner arguments that the facts presented in the instant action neither implicate nor call forth the legal and policy concerns that have been historically advanced as justification for the application of the impact rule.
there is no question that,as rowell attorney,the assistant public defender who participated in the preliminary presentation hearing had a special,professional,and independent duty to exercise the degree of reasonable knowledge and skill which lawyers of ordinary ability and skill possess and exercise.home furniture depot,entevor ab,so d,dca.it is also uncontroverted that clearly rowell had been wrongfully arrested and confined,proven by the videotape of the presentation he provided his attorney with the document necessary to secure his immediate release from his pretrial incarceration.there is also no dispute that,once in the possession of rowell attorney,the document apparently vanished,and,in any case,was not produced to the presiding judge as the judge had specifically instructed.rowell,in effect,laid in his attorney hands the very keys to the jailhouse door,which his attorney negligently failed to place in the lock.as a direct result of his attorney negligence,rowell was subjected to a protracted period of wrongful pretrial confinement,and concomitant loss of treasured liberty.
given the facts of this case,rowell sole concern should have been to facilitate rowell immediate release from pretrial doubtlessly foresee that his negligent failure to end his client wrongful incarceration would result in significant emotional distress.indeed,the citizens of a free society can conceive of no greater injury than the continued unjust deprivation of liberty.the special duty undertaken by rowell attorney,along with the foreseeability of the harm that would flow from his breach of that duty,lead us to conclude that the impact rule should have no application here to preclude rowell recovery of damages for psychological injury.
we are also persuaded that the facts of the instant case do not implicate the legal and policy concerns that are traditionally voiced as undergirding the impact rule.unlike some actions involving emotional harm,the issue of causation presented here is straightforward and beyond reasoned dispute.a direct causal link can be clearly and rationally drawn in the instant case from the attorney negligent failure to transmit the document showing the restoration of rowell civil rights to the extended period of continuing wrongful pretrial confinement and resultant emotional injury.
moreover,the damages suffered in the instant case are reasonably capable of measurement.this is not a case in which rowell simply experienced a few hours or one day of unjust pretrial imprisonment.here,the hours became days and the days extended beyond a week as he was confined within the walls of a small cell deprived of one most basic freedom of movement,the right to privacy,and the freedom to associate with persons of one own choosing.for the emotional trauma flowing from this deprivation of liberty,and corresponding injury,albeit mental in nature,a jury of his peers deemed to be proper compensation.while we are cognizant of precedent suggesting that the impact doctrine properly reflects the principle that t here must be some level of harm which one should absorb without recompense as the price he pays for living in an organized society,gonzalez,so d at quoting stewart gilliam,so d,dca reed,dissenting,quashed,so d,we believe that rowell paid too high a price with his pretrial liberty to be forced to forego compensation based upon rigid application of a limiting doctrine,and that the jury award reasonably represented the damages logically flowing from his injury.no man or woman should be forced to be wrongfully incarcerated on a continuing extended basis in a pretrial detention posture while his or her attorney holds the key in hand to simply open the door to freedom.under these circumstances,it is beyond reason to suggest that society or the law should insulate one causing such continuing confinement with application of harsh artificial doctrines of such extreme impact.
in rendering this decision,we reject the respo
