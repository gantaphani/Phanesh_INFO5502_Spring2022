in this appeal,we consider a copyright owner efforts to stop an internet search engine from facilitating access to infringing images.perfect,sued google,for infringing perfect copyrighted photographs of nude models,among other claims.perfect brought a similar action against and its subsidiary collectively.the district court preliminarily enjoined google from creating and publicly displaying thumbnail versions of perfect images,perfect google,d,but did not enjoin google from linking to websites that display infringing versions of perfect images.nor did the district court preliminarily enjoin from giving users access to information provided by google.perfect and google both appeal the district court order.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a 
the district court handled this complex case in a particularly thoughtful and skillful manner.nonetheless,the district court erred on certain issues,as we will further explain below.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.
background 
google computers,along with millions of others,are connected to networks known collectively as the internet.the internet is a network of networks all sharing a common communications technology.religious tech.ctr.netcom commc.computer owners can provide information stored on their computers to other users connected to the internet through a medium called a webpage.a webpage consists of text interspersed with instructions written in hypertext markup language html that is stored in a computer.no images are stored on a webpage rather,the html instructions on the webpage provide an address for where the images are stored,whether in the webpage publisher computer or some other computer.in general,webpages are publicly available and can be accessed by computers connected to the internet through the use of a web browser.
google operates a search engine,a software program that automatically accesses thousands of websites collections of webpages and indexes them within a database stored on google computers.when a google user accesses the google website and types in a search query,google software searches its database for websites responsive to that search query.google then sends relevant information from its index of websites to the user computer.google search engines can provide results in the form of text,images,or videos.
the google search engine that provides responses in the form of images is called google image search.in response to a search query,google image search identifies text in its database responsive to the query and then communicates to users the images associated with the relevant text.google software can not recognize and index the images themselves.google image search provides search results as a webpage of small images called thumbnails,which are stored in google servers.the thumbnail images are reduced,versions of images stored on computers.
when a user clicks on a thumbnail image,the user browser program interprets html instructions on google webpage.these html instructions direct the user browser to cause a rectangular area a window to appear on the user computer screen.the window has two separate areas of information.the browser fills the top section of the screen with information from the google webpage,including the thumbnail image and text.the html instructions also give the user browser the address of the website publisher computer that stores the version of the thumbnail by following the html instructions to access the webpage,the user browser connects to the website publisher computer,downloads the image,and makes the image appear at the bottom of the window on the user screen.google does not store the images that fill this lower part of the window and does not communicate the images to the user google simply provides html instructions directing a user browser to access a website.however,the top part of the window containing the information from the google webpage appears to frame and comment on the bottom part of the window.thus,the user window appears to be filled with a single integrated presentation of the image,but it is actually an image from a website framed by information from google website.the process by which the webpage directs a user browser to incorporate content from different computers into a single window is referred to as linking.kelly arriba soft,cir.the term framing refers to the process by which information from one computer appears to frame and annotate the linked content from another computer.perfect,d at.
google also stores webpage content in its cache for each cached webpage,google cache contains the text of the webpage as it appeared at the time google indexed the page,but does not store images from the webpage.id.at.google may provide a link to a cached webpage in response to a user search query.however,google cache version of the webpage is not automatically updated when the webpage is revised by its owner.so if the webpage owner updates its webpage to remove the html instructions for finding an infringing image,a browser communicating directly with the webpage would not be able to access that image.however,google cache copy of the webpage would still have the old html instructions for the infringing image.unless the owner of the computer changed the html address of the infringing image,or otherwise rendered the image unavailable,a browser accessing google cache copy of the website could still access the image where it is stored on the website publisher computer.in other words,google cache copy could provide a user browser with valid directions to an infringing image even though the updated webpage no longer includes that infringing image.
in addition to its search engine operations,google generates revenue through a business program called adsense.under this program,the owner of a website can register with google to become an adsense partner.the website owner then places html instructions on its webpages that signal google server to place advertising on the webpages that is relevant to the webpages content.google computer program selects the advertising automatically by means of an algorithm.adsense participants agree to share the revenues that flow from such advertising with google.
google also generated revenues through an agreement with that allowed to link to google search results.gave its users the impression that was providing search results,but google communicated the search results directly to users.routed users search queries to google and automatically transmitted google responses,html instructions for linking to google search results back to its users.
perfect markets and sells copyrighted images of nude models.among other enterprises,it operates a subscription website on the internet.subscribers pay a monthly fee to view perfect images in a members area of the site.subscribers must use a password to log into the members area.google does not include these images from the members area in google index or database.perfect has also licensed fonestarz media limited to sell and distribute perfect copyrighted images for download and use on cell phones.
some website publishers republish perfect images on the internet without authorization.once this occurs,google search engine may automatically index the webpages containing these images and provide thumbnail versions of images in response to user inquiries.when a user clicks on the thumbnail image returned by google search engine,the user browser accesses the webpage and links to the infringing image stored on the website publisher computer.this image appears,in its original context,on the lower portion of the window on the user computer screen framed by information from google webpage.
procedural history.in may,perfect began notifying google that its thumbnail images and linking to the images infringed perfect copyright.perfect continued to send these notices through.
on november,perfect filed an action against google that included copyright infringement claims.this was followed by a similar action against on june.on july,and august,perfect sought a preliminary injunction to prevent and google,respectively,from copying,reproducing,distributing,publicly displaying,adapting or otherwise infringing,or contributing to the infringement of perfect photographs linking to websites that provide infringing versions of perfect photographs and infringing perfect combinations.
the district court consolidated the two actions and heard both preliminary injunction motions on november.the district court issued orders granting in part and denying in part the preliminary injunction against google and denying the preliminary injunction against.perfect and google the partial grant and partial denial of the preliminary injunction motion,and perfect appealed the denial of the preliminary injunction against.on june,the district court temporarily stayed the preliminary injunction.
standard of review 
we review the district court grant or denial of a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.a m records,napster,cir.the district court must support a preliminary injunction with findings of fact,which we review for clear error.earth island inst.forest,cir.we review the district court conclusions of law de novo.napster,at.
section a of the copyright act authorizes a court to grant injunctive relief on such terms as it may deem reasonable to prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright.a.preliminary injunctive relief is available to a party who demonstrates either a combination of probable success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable harm or that serious questions are raised and the balance of hardships tips in its favor.these two formulations represent two points on a sliding scale in which the required degree of irreparable harm increases as the probability of success decreases.napster,at internal quotation and citation omitted.
because perfect has the burden of showing a likelihood of success on the merits,the district court held that perfect also had the burden of demonstrating a likelihood of overcoming google fair use defense under.perfect,d at.this ruling was erroneous.at trial,the defendant in an infringement action bears the burden of proving fair use.see campbell music,d.because the burdens at the preliminary injunction stage track the burdens at trial,once the moving party has carried its burden of showing a likelihood of success on the merits,the burden shifts to the party to show a likelihood that its affirmative defense will succeed.gonzales o centro espirita beneficente uniao do vegetal,d see also abbott labs.andrx,to defeat a motion for preliminary injunctive relief in a patent infringement case,the party must establish a likelihood of success in proving its defenses of invalidity or unenforceability phg,llc john.accordingly,once perfect has shown a likelihood of success on the merits,the burden shifts to google to show a likelihood that its affirmative defenses will succeed.
in addition to its fair use defense,google also raises an affirmative defense under title ii of the digital millennium copyright act dmca.congress enacted title ii of the dmca to provide greater certainty to service providers concerning their legal exposure for infringements that may occur in the course of their activities.ellison robertson,cir internal quotation omitted.sections a through d limit liability for respectively transitory digital network communications system caching information residing on systems or networks at the direction of users and information location tools.id.at.a service provider that qualifies for such protection is not liable for monetary relief and may be subject only to the narrow injunctive relief set forth in section j.a.if perfect demonstrates a likelihood of success on the merits,google must show a likelihood of succeeding in its claim that it qualifies for protection under title ii of the dmca 
direct infringement 
perfect claims that google search engine program directly infringes two exclusive rights granted to copyright holders its display rights and its distribution rights plaintiffs must satisfy two requirements to present a prima facie case of direct infringement they must show ownership of the allegedly infringed material and they must demonstrate that the alleged infringers violate at least one exclusive right granted to copyright holders under.napster,at see a.even if a plaintiff satisfies these two requirements and makes a prima facie case of direct infringement,the defendant may avoid liability if it can establish that its use of the images is a fair use as set forth in.see kelly,at.
perfect ownership of at least some of the images at issue is not disputed.see perfect,d at.
the district court held that perfect was likely to prevail in its claim that google violated perfect display right with respect to the infringing thumbnails.id.at.however,the district court concluded that perfect was not likely to prevail on its claim that google violated either perfect display or distribution right with respect to its infringing images.id.at.we review these rulings for an abuse of discretion.napster,at.
display right 
in considering whether perfect made a prima facie case of violation of its display right,the district court reasoned that a computer owner that stores an image as electronic information and serves that electronic information directly to the user,physically sending ones and zeroes over the i nternet to the user browser,perfect,d at is displaying the electronic information in violation of a copyright holder exclusive display right.id.at see.conversely,the owner of a computer that does not store and serve the electronic information to a user is not displaying that information,even if such owner links to or frames the electronic information.perfect,d at.the district court referred to this test as the server test.id.at.
applying the server test,the district court concluded that perfect was likely to succeed in its claim that google thumbnails constituted direct infringement but was unlikely to succeed in its claim that google linking to infringing images constituted a direct infringement.id.at.as explained below,because this analysis comports with the language of the copyright act,we agree with the district court resolution of both these issues.
we have not previously addressed the question when a computer displays a copyrighted work for purposes of section.section states that a copyright owner has the exclusive right to display the copyrighted work publicly.the copyright act explains that display means to show a copy of it,either directly or by means of a film,slide,television image,or any other device or process.section defines copies as material objects,other than phonorecords,in which a work is fixed by any method now known or later developed,and from which the work can be perceived,reproduced,or otherwise communicated,either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.id.finally,the copyright act provides that a work is fixed in a tangible medium of expression when its embodiment in a copy or phonorecord,by or under the authority of the author,is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived,reproduced,or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.id.
we must now apply these definitions to the facts of this case.a photographic image is a work that is fixed in a tangible medium of expression,for purposes of the copyright act,when embodied,stored in a computer server or hard disk,or other storage device.the image stored in the computer is the copy of the work for purposes of copyright law.see mai.peak computer,cir a computer makes a copy of a software program when it transfers the program from a third party computer or other storage device into its own memory,because the copy of the program recorded in the computer is fixed in a manner that is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived,reproduced,or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration quoting.the computer owner shows a copy by means of a device or process when the owner uses the computer to fill the computer screen with the photographic image stored on that computer,or by communicating the stored image electronically to another person computer.in sum,based on the plain language of the statute,a person displays a photographic image by using a computer to fill a computer screen with a copy of the photographic image fixed in the computer memory.there is no dispute that google computers store thumbnail versions of perfect copyrighted images and communicate copies of those thumbnails to google users therefore,perfect has made a prima facie case that google communication of its stored thumbnail images directly infringes perfect display right.
google does not,however,display a copy of infringing photographic images for purposes of the copyright act when google frames linked images that appear on a user computer screen.because google computers do not store the photographic images,google does not have a copy of the images for purposes of the copyright act.in other words,google does not have any material objects in which a work is fixed and from which the work can be perceived,reproduced,or otherwise communicated and thus can not communicate a copy.
instead of communicating a copy of the image,google provides html instructions that direct a user browser to a website publisher computer that stores the photographic image.providing these html instructions is not equivalent to showing a copy.first,the html instructions are lines of text,not a photographic image.second,html instructions do not themselves cause infringing images to appear on the user computer screen.the html merely gives the address of the image to the user browser.the browser then interacts with the computer that stores the infringing image.it is this interaction that causes an infringing image to appear on the user computer screen.google may facilitate the user access to infringing images.however,such assistance raises only contributory liability issues,see studios,grokster,d,napster,at,and does not constitute direct infringement of the copyright owner display rights.
perfect argues that google displays a copy of the images by framing the images,which gives the impression that google is showing the image within a single google webpage.while linking and framing may cause some computer users to believe they are viewing a single google webpage,the copyright act,unlike the trademark act,does not protect a copyright holder against acts that cause consumer confusion.providing that a person who uses a trademark in a manner likely to cause confusion shall be liable in a civil action to the trademark registrant 
nor does our ruling that a computer owner does not display a copy of an image when it communicates only the html address of the copy erroneously collapse the display right in section into the reproduction right set forth in section.nothing in the copyright act prevents the various rights protected in section from overlapping.indeed,under some circumstances,more than one right must be infringed in order for an infringement claim to arise.for example,a game genie device that allowed a player to alter features of a nintendo computer game did not infringe nintendo right to prepare derivative works because the game genie did not incorporate any portion of the game itself.see lewis galoob toys,nintendo of,cir.we held that a copyright holder right to create derivative works is not infringed unless the alleged derivative work incorporate s a protected work in some concrete or permanent form.id.in other words,in some contexts,the claimant must be able to claim infringement of its reproduction right in order to claim infringement of its right to prepare derivative works.
because google cache merely stores the text of webpages,our analysis of whether google search engine program potentially infringes perfect display and distribution rights is equally applicable to google cache.perfect is not likely to succeed in showing that a cached webpage that links to infringing images violates such rights.for purposes of this analysis,it is irrelevant whether cache copies direct a user browser to images that are no longer available on the third party website,because it is the website publisher computer,rather than google computer,that stores and displays the infringing image.
distribution right 
the district court also concluded that perfect would not likely prevail on its claim that google directly infringed perfect right to distribute its images.perfect,d at.the district court reasoned that distribution requires an actual dissemination of a copy.id.at.because google did not communicate the images to the user computer,google did not distribute these images.id.
again,the district court conclusion on this point is consistent with the language of the copyright act.section provides that the copyright owner has the exclusive right to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership,or by rental,lease,or lending.as noted,copies means material objects in which a work is fixed.the supreme court has indicated that in the electronic context,copies may be distributed electronically.see times tasini,d a computer database program distributed copies of newspaper articles stored in its computerized database by selling copies of those articles through its database service.google search engine communicates html instructions that tell a user browser where to find images on a website publisher computer,but google does not itself distribute copies of the infringing photographs.it is the website publisher computer that distributes copies of the images by transmitting the photographic image electronically to the user computer.as in tasini,the user can then obtain copies by downloading the photo or printing it.
perfect incorrectly relies on hotaling church of jesus christ of saints and napster for the proposition that merely making images available violates the copyright owner distribution right.hotaling church of jesus christ of saints,cir napster.hotaling held that the owner of a collection of works who makes them available to the public may be deemed to have distributed copies of the works.hotaling,at.similarly,the distribution rights of the plaintiff copyright owners were infringed by napster users private individuals with collections of music files stored on their home computers when they used the napster software to make their collections available to all other napster users.napster,at.
this deemed distribution rule does not apply to google.unlike the participants in the napster system or the library in hotaling,google does not own a collection of perfect images and does not communicate these images to the computers of people using google search engine.though google indexes these images,it does not have a collection of stored images it makes available to the public.google therefore can not be deemed to distribute copies of these images under the reasoning of napster or hotaling.accordingly,the district court correctly concluded that perfect does not have a likelihood of success in proving that google violates perfect distribution rights with respect to images.
fair use defense 
because perfect has succeeded in showing it would prevail in its prima facie case that google thumbnail images infringe perfect display rights,the burden shifts to google to show that it will likely succeed in establishing an affirmative defense.google contends that its use of thumbnails is a fair use of the images and therefore does not constitute an infringement of perfect copyright.see.
the fair use defense permits the use of copyrighted works without the copyright owner consent under certain situations.the defense encourages and allows the development of new ideas that build on earlier ones,thus providing a necessary counterbalance to the copyright law goal of protecting creators work product.from the infancy of copyright protection,some opportunity for fair use of copyrighted materials has been thought necessary to fulfill copyright very purpose campbell,at.the fair use doctrine thus permits and requires courts to avoid rigid application of the copyright statute when,on occasion,it would stifle the very creativity which that law is designed to foster.id.at.quoting stewart abend,d alteration in original.
congress codified the common law of fair use in,which provides 
notwithstanding the provisions of sections and,the fair use of a copyrighted work,including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section,for purposes such as criticism,comment,news reporting,teaching including multiple copies for classroom use,scholarship,or research,is not an infringement of copyright.in determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include 
the purpose and character of the use,including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes 
the nature of the copyrighted work 
the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole and 
the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
the fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.
we must be flexible in applying a fair use analysis it is not to be simplified with rules,for the statute,like the doctrine it recognizes,calls for analysis nor may the four statutory factors be treated in isolation,one from another.all are to be explored,and the results weighed together,in light of the purposes of copyright.campbell,at.see also kelly,at.the purpose of copyright law is t o promote the progress of science and useful arts,const.art.i,cl,and to serve the welfare of the public.sony of am.universal city studios,d quoting,sess.
in applying the fair use analysis in this case,we are guided by kelly arriba soft,which considered substantially the same use of copyrighted photographic images as is at issue here.see.in kelly,a photographer brought a direct infringement claim against arriba,the operator of an internet search engine.the search engine provided thumbnail versions of the photographer images in response to search queries.id.at.we held that arriba use of thumbnail images was a fair use primarily based on the transformative nature of a search engine and its benefit to the public.id.at.we also concluded that arriba use of the thumbnail images did not harm the photographer market for his image.id.at.
in this case,the district court determined that google use of thumbnails was not a fair use and distinguished kelly.perfect,d at.we consider these distinctions in the context of the fair use analysis.
purpose and character of the use.the first factor,requires a court to consider the purpose and character of the use,including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes.the central purpose of this inquiry is to determine whether and to what extent the new work is transformative.campbell,at.a work is transformative when the new work does not merely supersede the objects of the original creation but rather adds something new,with a further purpose or different character,altering the first with new expression,meaning,or message.id.internal quotation and alteration omitted.conversely,if the new work supersede s the use of the original,the use is likely not a fair use.harper row publishers,nation,d internal quotation omitted publishing the heart of an unpublished work and thus supplanting the copyright holder first publication right was not a fair use see also wall data county sheriff dep t,cir using a copy to save the cost of buying additional copies of a computer program was not a fair use 
as noted in campbell,a transformative work is one that alters the original work with new expression,meaning,or message.campbell,at.a use is considered transformative only where a defendant changes a plaintiff copyrighted work or uses the plaintiff copyrighted work in a different context such that the plaintiff work is transformed into a new creation.wall data,at.
google use of thumbnails is highly transformative.in kelly,we concluded that arriba use of thumbnails was transformative because arriba use of the images serve d a different function than kelly access to information on the i nternet versus artistic expression.kelly,at.although an image may have been created originally to serve an entertainment,aesthetic,or informative function,a search engine transforms the image into a pointer directing a user to a source of information.just as a parody has an obvious claim to transformative value because it can provide social benefit,by shedding light on an earlier work,and,in the process,creating a new one,campbell,at,a search engine provides social benefit by incorporating an original work into a new work,namely,an electronic reference tool.indeed,a search engine may be more transformative than a parody because a search engine provides an entirely new use for the original work,while a parody typically has the same entertainment purpose as the original work.see,id.at.holding that live crew parody of oh,pretty woman using the words hairy woman or bald headed woman was a transformative work,and thus constituted a fair use mattel,walking mountain,cir concluding that photos parodying barbie by depicting nude barbie dolls juxtaposed with vintage kitchen appliances was a fair use.in other words,a search engine puts images in a different context so that they are transformed into a new creation.wall data,at.
the fact that google incorporates the entire perfect image into the search engine results does not diminish the transformative nature of google use.as the district court correctly noted,perfect,d at,we determined in kelly that even making an exact copy of a work may be transformative so long as the copy serves a different function than the original work,kelly,at.for example,the first circuit has held that the republication of photos taken for a modeling portfolio in a newspaper was transformative because the photos served to inform,as well as entertain.see nunez caribbean int l news,cir.in contrast,duplicating a church religious book for use by a different church was not transformative.see worldwide church of god phila.church of god,cir.nor was a broadcaster simple retransmission of a radio broadcast over telephone lines transformative,where the original radio shows were given no new expression,meaning,or message.infinity broad.kirkwood,cir.here,google uses perfect images in a new context to serve a different purpose.
the district court nevertheless determined that google use of thumbnail images was less transformative than arriba use of thumbnails in kelly because google use of thumbnails superseded perfect right to sell its images for use on cell phones.see perfect,d at.the district court stated that mobile users can download and save the thumbnails displayed by google image search onto their phones,and concluded to the extent that users may choose to download free images to their phone rather than purchase perfect images,google use supersedes perfect.id.
additionally,the district court determined that the commercial nature of google use weighed against its transformative nature.id.although kelly held that the commercial use of the photographer images by arriba search engine was less exploitative than typical commercial use,and thus weighed only slightly against a finding of fair use,kelly,at,the district court here distinguished kelly on the ground that some website owners in the adsense program had infringing perfect images on their websites,perfect,d at.the district court held that because google thumbnails lead users to sites that directly benefit google bottom line,the adsense program increased the commercial nature of google use of perfect images.id.at.
in conducting our analysis of fair use in light of the purposes of copyright,campbell,at,we must weigh google superseding and commercial uses of thumbnail images against google significant transformative use,as well as the extent to which google search engine promotes the purposes of copyright and serves the interests of the public.although the district court acknowledged the truism that search engines such as google image search provide great value to the public,perfect,d at,the district court did not expressly consider whether this value outweighed the significance of google superseding use or the commercial nature of google use.id.at.the supreme court,however,has directed us to be mindful of the extent to which a use promotes the purposes of copyright and serves the interests of the public.see campbell,at.harper row,at.sony,at.
we note that the superseding use in this case is not significant at present the district court did not find that any downloads for mobile phone use had taken place.see perfect,d at.moreover,while google use of thumbnails to direct users to adsense partners containing infringing content adds a commercial dimension that did not exist in kelly,the district court did not determine that this commercial element was significant.see id.at.the district court stated that google adsense programs as a whole contributed million,or of total revenues to google bottom line,but noted that this figure did not break down the much smaller amount attributable to websites that contain infringing content.id.at internal quotation omitted.
we conclude that the significantly transformative nature of google search engine,particularly in light of its public benefit,outweighs google superseding and commercial uses of the thumbnails in this case.in reaching this conclusion,we note the importance of analyzing fair use flexibly in light of new circumstances.sony,at.id.at.section endorses the purpose and general scope of the judicial doctrine of fair use,but there is no disposition to freeze the doctrine in the statute,especially during a period of rapid technological change.quoting,cong.admin.news.we are also mindful of the supreme court direction that the more transformative the new work,the less will be the significance of other factors,like commercialism,that may weigh against a finding of fair use.campbell,at.
accordingly,we disagree with the district court conclusion that because google use of the thumbnails could supersede perfect cell phone download use and because the use was more commercial than arriba,this fair use factor weighed slightly in favor of perfect.perfect,d at.instead,we conclude that the transformative nature of google use is more significant than any incidental superseding use or the minor commercial aspects of google search engine and website.therefore,this factor weighs heavily in favor of google.
the nature of the copyrighted work.with respect to the second factor,the nature of the copyrighted work,our decision in kelly is directly on point.there we held that the photographer images were creative in nature and thus closer to the core of intended copyright protection than are more works.kelly,at internal quotation omitted.however,because the photos appeared on the internet before arriba used thumbnail versions in its search engine results,this factor weighed only slightly in favor of the photographer.id.
here,the district court found that perfect images were creative but also previously published.perfect,d at.the right of first publication is the author right to control the first public appearance of his expression.harper row,at.because this right encompasses the choices of when,where,and in what form first to publish a work,an author exercises and exhausts this right by publishing the work in any medium.see,batjac prods.goodtimes home video,cir noting,in the context of the common law right of first publication,that such a right does not entail multiple first publication rights in every available medium.once perfect has exploited this commercially valuable right of first publication by putting its images on the internet for paid subscribers,perfect is no longer entitled to the enhanced protection available for an unpublished work.accordingly the district court did not err in holding that this factor weighed only slightly in favor of perfect see perfect,d at.
the amount and substantiality of the portion used.the third factor asks whether the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole are reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying.campbell,at.internal quotation omitted see also.in kelly,we held arriba use of the entire photographic image was reasonable in light of the purpose of a search engine.kelly,at.specifically,we noted,i t was necessary for arriba to copy the entire image to allow users to recognize the image and decide whether to pursue more information about the image or the originating website.if arriba only copied part of the image,it would be more difficult to identify it,thereby reducing the usefulness of the visual search engine.id.accordingly,we concluded that this factor did not weigh in favor of either party.id.because the same analysis applies to google use of perfect image,the district court did not err in finding that this factor favored neither party.
effect of use on the market.the fourth factor is the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.in kelly,we concluded that arriba use of the thumbnail images did not harm the market for the photographer images.see kelly,at.we reasoned that because thumbnails were not a substitute for the images,they did not harm the photographer ability to sell or license his images.id.the district court here followed kelly reasoning,holding that google use of thumbnails did not hurt perfect market for images.see perfect,d at.we agree.
perfect argues that the district court erred because the likelihood of market harm may be presumed if the intended use of an image is for commercial gain.however,this presumption does not arise when a work is transformative because market substitution is at least less certain,and market harm may not be so readily inferred.campbell,at.as previously discussed,google use of thumbnails for search engine purposes is highly transformative,and so market harm can not be presumed.
perfect also has a market for images,an issue not considered in kelly.the district court held that google use of thumbnails likely does harm the potential market for the downloading of perfect images onto cell phones.perfect,d at emphasis omitted.the district court reasoned that persons who can obtain perfect images free of charge from google are less likely to pay for a download,and the availability of google thumbnail images would harm perfect market for cell phone downloads.id.as we discussed above,the district court did not make a finding that google users have downloaded thumbnail images for cell phone use.this potential harm to perfect market remains hypothetical.we conclude that this factor favors neither party.
having undertaken a analysis of all four factors,we now weigh these factors together in light of the purposes of copyright.campbell,at.see also kelly,at we must balance the section factors in light of the objectives of copyright law,rather than view them as definitive or determinative tests.in this case,google has put perfect thumbnail images along with millions of other thumbnail images to a use fundamentally different than the use intended by perfect.in doing so,google has provided a significant benefit to the public.weighing this significant transformative use against the unproven use of google thumbnails for cell phone downloads,and considering the other fair use factors,all in light of the purpose of copyright,we conclude that google use of perfect thumbnails is a fair use.because the district court here found facts sufficient to evaluate each of the statutory factors we need not remand for further factfinding.harper row,at.internal quotation omitted.we conclude that google is likely to succeed in proving its fair use defense and,accordingly,we vacate the preliminary injunction regarding google use of thumbnail images.
secondary liability for copyright infringement 
we now turn to the district court ruling that google is unlikely to be secondarily liable for its linking to infringing images under the doctrines of contributory and vicarious infringement the district court ruled that perfect did not have a likelihood of proving success on the merits of either its contributory infringement or vicarious infringement claims with respect to the images.see perfect,d at.in reviewing the district court conclusions,we are guided by the supreme court recent interpretation of secondary liability,namely o ne infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement,and infringes vicariously by profiting from direct infringement while declining to exercise a right to stop or limit it.grokster,at.internal citations omitted.
direct infringement by third parties.as a threshold matter,before we examine perfect claims that google is secondarily liable,perfect must establish that there has been direct infringement by third parties.see napster,at secondary liability for copyright infringement does not exist in the absence of direct infringement by a third party.
perfect alleges that third parties directly infringed its images in three ways.first,perfect claims that websites directly infringed its copyright by reproducing,displaying,and distributing unauthorized copies of perfect images.google does not dispute this claim on appeal.
second,perfect claims that individual users of google search engine directly infringed perfect copyrights by storing infringing images on their computers.we agree with the district court conclusion that perfect failed to provide sufficient evidence to support this claim.see perfect,d at.there is no evidence in the record directly establishing that users of google search engine have stored infringing images on their computers,and the district court did not err in declining to infer the existence of such evidence.
finally,perfect contends that users who link to infringing websites automatically make cache copies of images and thereby directly infringe perfect reproduction right.the district court rejected this argument,holding that any such reproduction was likely a fair use.id.at.the district court reasoned that l ocal caching by the browsers of individual users is noncommercial,transformative,and no more than necessary to achieve the objectives of decreasing network latency and minimizing unnecessary bandwidth usage essential to the i nternet.it has a minimal impact on the potential market for the original work id.we agree even assuming such automatic copying could constitute direct infringement,it is a fair use in this context.the copying function performed automatically by a user computer to assist in accessing the internet is a transformative use.moreover,as noted by the district court,a cache copies no more than is necessary to assist the user in internet use.it is designed to enhance an individual computer use,not to supersede the copyright holders exploitation of their works.such automatic background copying has no more than a minimal effect on perfect rights,but a considerable public benefit.because the four fair use factors weigh in favor of concluding that cache copying constitutes a fair use,google has established a likelihood of success on this issue.accordingly,perfect has not carried its burden of showing that users cache copies of perfect images constitute direct infringement.
therefore,we must assess perfect arguments that google is secondarily liable in light of the direct infringement that is undisputed by the parties websites reproducing,displaying,and distributing unauthorized copies of perfect images on the internet.id.at.
contributory infringement 
in order for perfect to show it will likely succeed in its contributory liability claim against google,it must establish that google activities meet the definition of contributory liability recently enunciated in grokster.within the general rule that o ne infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement,grokster,at,the court has defined two categories of contributory liability liability under our jurisprudence may be predicated on actively encouraging or inducing infringement through specific acts as the court opinion develops or on distributing a product distributees use to infringe copyrights,if the product is not capable of substantial or commercially significant noninfringing uses.id.at.ginsburg,concurring quoting sony,at.see also id.at.
looking at the second category of liability identified by the supreme court distributing products,google relies on sony,at,to argue that it can not be held liable for contributory infringement because liability does not arise from the mere sale of a product even with knowledge that consumers would use the product to infringe if the product is capable of substantial use.google argues that its search engine service is such a product.assuming the principle enunciated in sony is applicable to the operation of google search engine,then google can not be held liable for contributory infringement solely because the design of its search engine facilitates such infringement.grokster,at.discussing sony,d.nor can google be held liable solely because it did not develop technology that would enable its search engine to automatically avoid infringing images.see id.at.however,perfect has not based its claim of infringement on the design of google search engine and the sony rule does not immunize google from other sources of contributory liability.see id.at.
we must next consider whether google could be held liable under the first category of contributory liability identified by the supreme court,that is,the liability that may be imposed for intentionally encouraging infringement through specific acts grokster tells us that contribution to infringement must be intentional for liability to arise.grokster,at.however,grokster also directs us to analyze contributory liability in light of rules of liability derived from the common law,id.at,and common law principles establish that intent may be imputed.tort law ordinarily imputes to an actor the intention to cause the natural and probable consequences of his conduct.devoto pac.fid.life ins,cir restatement second of torts cmt.b if the actor knows that the consequences are certain,or substantially certain,to result from his act,and still goes ahead,he is treated by the law as if he had in fact desired to produce the result.when the supreme court imported patent law staple article of commerce doctrine into the copyright context,it also adopted these principles of imputed intent.grokster,at.the staple article of commerce doctrine was devised to identify instances in which it may be presumed from distribution of an article in commerce that the distributor intended the article to be used to infringe another patent,and so may justly be held liable for that infringement.therefore,under grokster,an actor may be contributorily liable for intentionally encouraging direct infringement if the actor knowingly takes steps that are substantially certain to result in such direct infringement.
our tests for contributory liability are consistent with the rule set forth in grokster.we have adopted the general rule set forth in gershwin publishing columbia artists management,namely one who,with knowledge of the infringing activity,induces,causes or materially contributes to the infringing conduct of another,may be held liable as a contributory infringer,cir.see ellison,at napster,at fonovisa,cherry auction,cir.
we have further refined this test in the context of cyberspace to determine when contributory liability can be imposed on a provider of internet access or services.see napster,at.in napster,we considered claims that the operator of an electronic file sharing system was contributorily liable for assisting individual users to swap copyrighted music files stored on their home computers with other users of the system.napster,at.we stated that if a computer system operator learns of specific infringing material available on his system and fails to purge such material from the system,the operator knows of and contributes to direct infringement.id.at.because napster knew of the availability of infringing music files,assisted users in accessing such files,and failed to block access to such files,we concluded that napster materially contributed to infringement.id.at.
the napster test for contributory liability was modeled on the influential district court decision in religious technology center netcom communication services,netcom.see napster,at.in netcom,a disgruntled former scientology minister posted allegedly infringing copies of scientological works on an electronic bulletin board service.netcom.at.the messages were stored on the bulletin board operator computer,then automatically copied onto netcom computer,and from there copied onto other computers comprising a worldwide community of electronic bulletin board systems.id.at internal quotation omitted.netcom held that if plaintiffs could prove that netcom knew or should have known that the minister infringed plaintiffs copyrights,netcom would be liable for contributory infringement since its failure to simply cancel the former minister infringing message and thereby stop an infringing copy from being distributed worldwide constitute d substantial participation in the former minister public distribution of the message.id.at.
although neither napster nor netcom expressly required a finding of intent,those cases are consistent with grokster because both decisions ruled that a service provider knowing failure to prevent infringing actions could be the basis for imposing contributory liability.under such circumstances,intent may be imputed.in addition,napster and netcom are consistent with the longstanding requirement that an actor contribution to infringement must be material to warrant the imposition of contributory liability.gershwin,at.both napster and netcom acknowledge that services or products that facilitate access to websites throughout the world can significantly magnify the effects of otherwise immaterial infringing activities.see napster,at netcom.at.the supreme court has acknowledged that t he argument for imposing indirect liability is particularly powerful when individuals using the defendant software could make a huge number of infringing downloads every day.grokster,at.moreover,copyright holders can not protect their rights in a meaningful way unless they can hold providers of such services or products accountable for their actions pursuant to a test such as that enunciated in napster.see id.at.when a widely shared service or product is used to commit infringement,it may be impossible to enforce rights in the protected work effectively against all direct infringers,the only practical alternative being to go against the distributor of the copying device for secondary liability on a theory of contributory or vicarious infringement.accordingly,we hold that a computer system operator can be held contributorily liable if it has actual knowledge that specific infringing material is available using its system,napster,at,and can take simple measures to prevent further damage to copyrighted works,netcom.at,yet continues to provide access to infringing works.
here,the district court held that even assuming google had actual knowledge of infringing material available on its system,google did not materially contribute to infringing conduct because it did not undertake any substantial promotional or advertising efforts to encourage visits to infringing websites,nor provide a significant revenue stream to the infringing websites.perfect,d at.this analysis is erroneous.there is no dispute that google substantially assists websites to distribute their infringing copies to a worldwide market and assists a worldwide audience of users to access infringing materials.we can not discount the effect of such a service on copyright owners,even though google assistance is available to all websites,not just infringing ones.applying our test,google could be held contributorily liable if it had knowledge that infringing perfect images were available using its search engine,could take simple measures to prevent further damage to perfect copyrighted works,and failed to take such steps.
the district court did not resolve the factual disputes over the adequacy of perfect notices to google and google responses to these notices.moreover,there are factual disputes over whether there are reasonable and feasible means for google to refrain from providing access to infringing images.therefore,we must remand this claim to the district court for further consideration whether perfect would likely succeed in establishing that google was contributorily liable for linking to infringing images under the test enunciated today 
vicarious infringement 
perfect also challenges the district court conclusion that it is not likely to prevail on a theory of vicarious liability against google.perfect,d at.grokster states that one infringes vicariously by profiting from direct infringement while declining to exercise a right to stop or limit it.grokster,at.as this formulation indicates,to succeed in imposing vicarious liability,a plaintiff must establish that the defendant exercises the requisite control over the direct infringer and that the defendant derives a direct financial benefit from the direct infringement.see id.grokster further explains the control element of the vicarious liability test as the defendant right and ability to supervise the direct infringer.id.at.thus,under grokster,a defendant exercises control over a direct infringer when he has both a legal right to stop or limit the directly infringing conduct,as well as the practical ability to do so.
we evaluate perfect arguments that google is vicariously liable in light of the direct infringement that is undisputed by the parties,namely,the websites reproduction,display,and distribution of unauthorized copies of perfect images on the internet.perfect,d at see supra section.in order to prevail at this preliminary injunction stage,perfect must demonstrate a likelihood of success in establishing that google has the right and ability to stop or limit the infringing activities of third party websites.in addition,perfect must establish a likelihood of proving that google derives a direct financial benefit from such activities.perfect has not met this burden.
with respect to the control element set forth in grokster,perfect has not demonstrated a likelihood of showing that google has the legal right to stop or limit the direct infringement of websites.see grokster,at.unlike fonovisa,where by virtue of a broad contract with its vendors the defendant swap meet operators had the right to stop the vendors from selling counterfeit recordings on its premises,fonovisa,at,perfect has not shown that google has contracts with websites that empower google to stop or limit them from reproducing,displaying,and distributing infringing copies of perfect images on the internet.perfect does point to google adsense agreement,which states that google reserves the right to monitor and terminate partnerships with entities that violate others copyright s.perfect,d at.however,google right to terminate an adsense partnership does not give google the right to stop direct infringement by websites.an infringing website can continue to reproduce,display,and distribute its infringing copies of perfect images after its participation in the adsense program has ended.
nor is google similarly situated to napster.napster users infringed the plaintiffs reproduction and distribution rights through their use of napster proprietary sharing system.napster,at.there,the infringing conduct was the use of napster service to download and upload copyrighted music.id.at internal quotation omitted.because napster had a closed system requiring user registration,and could terminate its users accounts and block their access to the napster system,napster had the right and ability to prevent its users from engaging in the infringing activity of uploading file names and downloading napster users music files through the napster system id.at.by contrast,google can not stop any of the websites from reproducing,displaying,and distributing unauthorized copies of perfect images because that infringing conduct takes place on the websites.google can not terminate those websites or block their ability to host and serve infringing images on the internet.perfect,d at.
moreover,the district court found that google lacks the practical ability to police the websites infringing conduct.id.at.specifically,the court found that google supervisory power is limited because google software lacks the ability to analyze every image on the i nternet,compare each image to all the other copyrighted images that exist in the world and determine whether a certain image on the web infringes someone copyright.id.at.the district court also concluded that perfect suggestions regarding measures google could implement to prevent its web crawler from indexing infringing websites and to block access to infringing images were not workable.id.at.rather,the suggestions suffered from both imprecision and overbreadth.id.we hold that these findings are not clearly erroneous.without technology,google lacks the practical ability to police the infringing activities of websites.this distinguishes google from the defendants held liable in napster and fonovisa.see napster,at napster had the ability to identify and police infringing conduct by searching its index for song titles fonovisa,at swap meet operator had the ability to identify and police infringing activity by patrolling its premises.
perfect argues that google could manage its own operations to avoid indexing websites with infringing content and linking to infringing sites.this is a claim of contributory liability,not vicarious liability.although the lines between direct infringement,contributory infringement,and vicarious liability are not clearly drawn,sony,at.internal quotation omitted,in general,contributory liability is based on the defendant failure to stop its own actions which facilitate infringement,while vicarious liability is based on the defendant failure to cause a third party to stop its directly infringing activities.see,ellison,at fonovisa,at.google failure to change its operations to avoid assisting websites to distribute their infringing content may constitute contributory liability,see supra section.however,this failure is not the same as declining to exercise a right and ability to make websites stop their direct infringement.we reject perfect efforts to blur this distinction.
because we conclude that perfect has not shown a likelihood of establishing google right and ability to stop or limit the directly infringing conduct of websites,we agree with the district court conclusion that perfect has not established a likelihood of proving the control prong necessary for vicarious liability.perfect,d at 
digital millennium copyright act 
google claims that it qualifies for the limitations on liability set forth in title ii of the dmca.in particular,section d limits the liability of a service provider for infringement of copyright by reason of the provider referring or linking users to an online location containing infringing material or infringing activity,by using information location tools,including a directory,index,reference,pointer,or hypertext link if the service provider meets certain criteria.we have held that the limitations on liability contained in protect secondary infringers as well as direct infringers.napster,at.
the parties dispute whether google meets the specified criteria.perfect claims that it sent qualifying notices to google and google did not act expeditiously to remove the infringing material.google claims that perfect notices did not comply with the notice provisions of section and were not adequate to inform google of the location of the infringing images on the internet or identify the underlying copyrighted work.google also claims that it responded to all notices it received by investigating the webpages identified by perfect and suppressing links to any webpages that google confirmed were infringing.
because the district court determined that perfect was unlikely to succeed on its contributory and vicarious liability claims,it did not reach google arguments under section.in revisiting the question of perfect likelihood of success on its contributory infringement claims,the district court should also consider whether google would likely succeed in showing that it was entitled to the limitations on injunctive relief provided by title ii of the dmca.
perfect claims that displays and distributes perfect copyrighted images and is also secondarily liable for the infringements of websites and users.the district court concluded that perfect was unlikely to succeed in proving that was a direct infringer,because it merely linked to the thumbnails on google servers and to the images on websites perfect amazon,consolidated with.february,order denying preliminary injunction.in addition,the district court concluded that perfect secondary infringement claims against were likely to fail because had no program analogous to adsense,and thus did not provide any revenues to infringing sites.id.finally,the district court determined that right and ability to control the infringing conduct of websites was substantially less than google.id.therefore,the district court denied perfect motion for a preliminary injunction against.id.
we agree that perfect has not shown a likelihood that it would prevail on the merits of its claim that directly infringed its images.communicates to its users only the html instructions that direct the users browsers to google computers for thumbnail images or to a third party computer for infringing images.therefore,does not display or distribute a copy of the thumbnails or images to its users.
we also agree with the district court conclusion that does not have the right and ability to supervise the infringing activity of google or third parties.the district court did not clearly err in concluding that lacked a direct financial interest in such activities.therefore,perfect claim that is vicariously liable for infringement is unlikely to succeed.
however,the district court did not consider whether had actual knowledge that specific infringing material is available using its system,napster,at emphasis in original,and could have take n simple measures to prevent further damage to copyrighted works,netcom.at,yet continued to provide access to infringing works.perfect has presented evidence that it notified that it was facilitating its users access to infringing material.it is disputed whether the notices gave actual knowledge of specific infringing activities available using its system,and whether could have taken reasonable and feasible steps to refrain from providing access to such images,but failed to do so.nor did the district court consider whether is entitled to limit its liability under title ii of the dmca.on remand,the district court should consider potential contributory liability,as well as possible limitations on the scope of injunctive relief,in light of our rulings today.
we conclude that google fair use defense is likely to succeed at trial,and therefore we reverse the district court determination that google thumbnail versions of perfect images likely constituted a direct infringement.the district court also erred in its secondary liability analysis because it failed to consider whether google and knew of infringing activities yet failed to take reasonable and feasible steps to refrain from providing access to infringing images.therefore we must also reverse the district court holding that perfect was unlikely to succeed on the merits of its secondary liability claims.due to this error,the district court did not consider whether google and are entitled to the limitations on liability set forth in title ii of the dmca.the question whether google and are secondarily liable,and whether they can limit that liability pursuant to title ii of the dmca,raise inquiries,potentially requiring further fact finding,and thus can best be resolved by the district court on remand.we therefore remand this matter to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this decision.
because the district court will need to reconsider the appropriate scope of injunctive relief after addressing these secondary liability issues,we do not address the parties arguments regarding the scope of the injunction issued by the district court.for the same reason,we do not address the parties dispute over whether the district court abused its discretion in determining that perfect satisfied the irreparable harm element of a preliminary injunction.
therefore,we reverse the district court ruling and vacate the preliminary injunction rega
