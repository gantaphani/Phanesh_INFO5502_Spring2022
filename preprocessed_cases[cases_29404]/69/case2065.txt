introduction 
people in an open society do not demand infallibility from their institutions,but it is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from observing richmond newspapers,virginia,d opn.of burger.
with few exceptions,the ralph brown act obligates government agencies to meet and act in public,et the brown act.richard mckee is president of the california first amendment coalition,a group dedicated to enforcing the brown act and the california public records act.et the public records act.this appeal arises from a suit filed by mckee and the los angeles times against the los angeles county board of supervisors for violating the brown act 
appellants petition sought a writ of mandate and declaratory and injunctive relief based on seven causes of action arising from various alleged brown act violations.the trial court granted appellants declaratory relief on three causes of action addressing three different board meetings,but found for the board on the other claims.neither side sought appellate review on the merits of the trial court decision.appellants posttrial motion for attorneys fees under the brown act was denied,prompting this appeal.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the trial court order and remand for a new hearing to determine the amount of the attorneys fee award.
facts and procedural history 
in december,county health care aides were backing a ballot measure to increase their pay the health care or ballot measure.on december,the board met in closed session with county counsel lloyd pellman to discuss whether the county should sue to keep that measure off the ballot.the matter had been placed on the agenda as a closed session item under the brown act exception for an agency decision whether to initiate litigation,subd.c.because the merits of the proposed suit were unclear,pellman floated the idea of provoking the health care aides to sue the county by refusing to submit the required ballot title and summary to the registrar of voters,subd.a,thereby keeping the measure off the ballot.four of the five supervisors present agreed and instructed pellman to send a letter to the ballot measure proponents stating that pellman would not place the measure on the ballot pellman changed his mind the next,and phoned three of the supervisors to let them know he had decided to comply with the law and place the measure on the ballot.
the board scheduled a closed session for january,under the brown act exceptions for employee evaluations and for conferences with legal counsel regarding exposure to litigation,subd.b.in advance of that session,which was apparently prompted by concerns over pellman december phone calls to three board members,supervisor gloria molina sent a letter to the other board members on january,regarding the violation of process that took place and pellman ability to represent our board and our respective constituents in a fair and unbiased manner.according to molina letter,pellman phone calls to the other board members on december,violated the brown act.another closed session was scheduled for january,based on the brown act employee evaluation exception.at both the january and january closed sessions,however,the board also instructed its administrative officers to develop new protocols for closed sessions.
based on molina concerns that pellman december phone calls violated the brown act,the board adopted new closed session protocols at a public board meeting on february.under those new protocols,any decision to consider a matter during a closed session had to be made by the board chairperson,who would approve or deny the request based upon the county counsel advice concerning the applicability of the brown act.the new protocols also directed that minutes of any closed session actions be kept,but that no minutes or sound recordings be made of the closed session discussions.
on february,times staff writer evelyn larrubia wrote letters to board members molina and yaroslavsky about these events.larrubia letter to molina was a request under the public records act seeking the release of all documents from molina office concerning the health care measure and pellman duties in regard to that measure.the letter to yaroslavsky accused the board of violating the brown act on december,january,and january and demanded that the board cure those violations within days by releasing all documents concerning the actions taken and by publicly disclosing the positions taken by each supervisor,along with their reasons for doing so,subd.b.in regard to the two january meetings,however,larrubia letter to yaroslavsky was not based on the board direction to develop new closed sessions protocols.instead,it was based on the board closed session receipt of a report by pellman and the county chief administrative officer about the duties of government lawyers in legal representation 
the board executive officer,violet,replied to the times public records act request on february.in a letter to larrubia,stated her refusal to release various documents that were responsive to larrubia request because they related to an employee performance evaluation and were therefore exempt from disclosure.however,those documents were inadvertently attached to letter to the times 
on march,the times published a story about the december,january,and january meetings.on march,pellman responded to the times brown act violation letter,contending that no such violations occurred during the december and january closed sessions.his letter did not mention the january session,however.mckee wrote the board on march,contending that the board had violated the brown act on december.the board did not respond to that letter.on march,the times published a story describing how many of the board decisions were made during private staff meetings.
on march,the board issued its agenda for its april public meeting,including further proposed changes to the board closed session protocols,along with various other measures designed to improve and ensure the board compliance with the brown act and the public records act.those changes were approved by the board on april.they included tape recording of all closed sessions requiring that all meetings by the supervisors deputies be held as if the brown act applied to them requiring that all written materials related to board agenda items be posted on the county web page an improved means of processing and responding to public records act requests brown act training sessions for various county employees and improved descriptions of closed session agenda items in easily understood lay terms.
appellants filed suit on march,one day after the agenda for the board april meeting was posted.relying in large part on the board documents inadvertently sent to the times,the petition alleged seven causes of action.the first alleged that the board violated the brown act on december,when it secretly directed pellman to violate the state elections code and keep the health care measure off the ballot.the second cause of action alleged that the board violated the brown act as a result of pellman december,phone calls to three supervisors to discuss his decision to instead change course and place that measure on the ballot.the third and fourth causes of action alleged that the board violated the brown act on january and,by discussing the events of december and.the other causes of action alleged that the board violated the brown act by failing to specify the department head supposedly being evaluated in closed session,by using the supervisors deputies as surrogates to hold private shadow board meetings to decide the board business,and by holding weekly serial meetings with the county administrative officer in order to secretly decide board business.based on those allegations,appellants sought injunctive and declaratory relief and a writ of mandate halting those practices.
both before and after the petition was filed,the county took various steps to obtain the return of the documents it inadvertently sent to the times and to prevent their use at trial.in early march,the county counsel office demanded the return of the documents.the board later sought to exclude those documents from the trial on the ground that they were protected by the brown act and were otherwise privileged,contending that based on the absence of those documents,appellants would then be unable to prove their claims.the board also contended on the merits that its actions were in full compliance with the brown act.to support its contentions,the board filed under seal numerous documents that it believed were privileged,asking the trial court to review them.
at trial,the court granted only part of the board motion to lodge certain documents under seal,ruling that portions of the minutes from the january and,closed sessions,along with certain letters to the district attorney transmitting various documents,should be sealed.the court read into evidence portions of those minutes which it believed established brown act violations,however,disclosing for the first time that during those closed sessions the board directed its administrative officer to develop new brown act protocols.
the court entered judgment for appellants on july,finding that the board violated the brown act on december,the guise of a closed session agenda description relating to the initiation of discussed and acted on pellman suggestion to provoke a lawsuit by proponents of the health care measure by violating his legal obligation to have that measure placed on the ballot.the court found that two other separate brown act violations occurred on january and,the guise of closed session agenda descriptions relating to employee evaluations and the prospect of pending board directed its administrative officer to develop new brown act protocols.although the court granted declaratory relief as to those three claims,it ruled for the board on all other causes of action.
appellants moved to recover their attorneys fees under the brown act fee provision.the trial court denied the motion,finding that special circumstances existed which would make a fee award unjust.appellants contend that the trial court abused its discretion by denying their attorneys fee motion.
discussion 
the board brown act violations 
the brown act requires that most meetings of a local agency legislative body be open to the public for attendance by all,subd.a.the legislature forcefully stated its intent when passing the brown act in enacting this chapter,the legislature finds and declares that the public commissions,boards and councils and the other public agencies in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the people business.it is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly.the people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them.the people,in delegating authority,do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know.the people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created.
among its provisions,the brown act requires that an agenda be posted at least hours before a regular meeting and forbids action on any items not on that agenda,subd.a.the brown act thus serves to facilitate public participation in all phases of local government decisionmaking and to curb misuse of the democratic process by secret legislation of public bodies.citation.epstein hollywood entertainment dist.ii bus.improvement dist.th,d.either the district attorney or any interested person may bring an action for mandamus or injunctive or declaratory relief in order to stop or prevent violations of the brown act or to determine the applicability of this chapter to actions or threatened future action of the legislative body,subd.a.
there are several exceptions to the brown act.at issue here is the one permitting a public agency to meet in closed session to discuss pending litigation.litigation is considered to be pending when it has been initiated against the agency,subd.a.litigation is also considered pending when,based on existing facts and circumstances,there is a significant exposure to litigation against the local agency,subd.b.for purposes of that exception,existing facts and circumstances include facts such as accidents,incidents or transactional occurrences and the receipt of claims or other threats to sue,subd.a d.the pending litigation exception also applies when,based on existing facts and circumstances,the agency has decided to initiate or is deciding whether to initiate litigation,subd.c.closed sessions are also permitted to perform employee evaluations.
the board met in closed session on december,pursuant to the brown act initiation of litigation exception,subd.c.there is no dispute that its initial discussions about the propriety of suing to challenge the health care measure fell within this exception.the board contended that when its focus shifted to having pellman keep that measure off the ballot by violating his duties under the elections code as a means of prompting a suit by those backing the measure,it was still acting within the scope of section,subdivision c.the trial court rejected that contention,declaring the practice illegal under the brown act because it was a topic that did not deal with initiation of litigation and because it was beyond the agenda.it was an action that should not have been taken,of course,in the closed meeting and finally,it should have been reported.
the board met in closed session on january and,pursuant to the brown act pending litigation,subd.b and employee evaluation exceptions.when the trial court unsealed the minutes of those meetings,it and appellants learned for the first time that the board ordered the development of new brown act protocols during those sessions.the board offered no defense to the consideration of brown act protocols in closed meetings,admitting to the court that a mistake was made.the board did not from the judgment and effectively concedes that it violated the brown act on december,and january and,
the common cause decisions 
the court may award court costs and reasonable attorney fees to a successful brown act plaintiff.the first two decisions to interpret this provision were common cause stirling d.common cause i and its later companion case,common cause stirling d.common cause ii.because they are also the only reported decisions to consider whether a trial court abused its discretion in denying attorneys fees to a successful brown act plaintiff,they provide the logical starting place for our analysis.
common cause i 
the common cause decisions arose after six members of the san diego city council sent a letter to the city manager directing him to stop trying to serve the summons and complaint in an eminent domain action the city had filed.the letter said the council planned to reopen the issue to consider whether it could avoid condemning the two properties targeted by its suit.after receiving the letter,the city manager placed on hold all efforts to serve the parties.a noticed public hearing on the issue was held four weeks later,with the council voting to formally instruct the city manager to abandon the eminent domain action.in response to complaints that the council earlier private letter violated the brown act,the san diego city attorney twice issued written opinions concluding that no such violation occurred.the public interest group common cause and one of its members then sued the council members for declaratory relief that the brown act had been violated.the trial court found that a violation occurred,but,applying the standards for awarding fees under the private attorney general statute code civ,denied plaintiffs request for attorneys fees because their action conferred an insignificant public benefit.
the common cause i court held that the trial court erred by relying on the standards for awarding fees established by code of civil procedure section because that statute was intended to provide specific guidelines for the exercise of a trial court inherent judicial power to award fees not expressly authorized by statute.common cause i,supra,d at.instead,the appellate court held that the brown act attorneys fee provision was analogous to a variety of federal public interest statutes,including civil rights,voting rights and water pollution control laws.those federal acts provide for payment of attorney fees without special qualification,because in the absence of such provision there would be little incentive to bring such lawsuits.id.at.
in looking to federal precedent,the common cause i court was guided by newman piggie park enterprises,d piggie park,which held that attorneys fees are presumptively appropriate to successful plaintiffs under the federal civil rights act unless the defendant comes forward to show special circumstances that would render a fee award unjust.common cause i,supra,d at.like all these federal cases,the brown act provides specific legislative authorization for attorney fees in actions brought to enforce a public policy in a context where actual recoverable damages are likely to be trivial.the damage is to the public integrity,and the fees are designed to make it economically feasible to rectify that damage by private legal means.id.at.
in holding that the trial court erred by denying fees based on the lack of statewide significance of the suit,the common cause i court acknowledged that brown act violations involving local agencies would rarely have statewide impact.nevertheless,regardless of the local nature of the agency,the legislature has declared the goals of the brown act to be vital and of statewide significance.section furthers the goal of public discussion and decision making in government which is inherent in a democratic political system and has been strongly supported in judicial and scholarly precedent.citations.common cause i,supra,d at,fn.omitted.according to the appellate court,the legislature clearly intended that fees be awarded where issues of only local significance were involved.id.at.
even so,the trial courts are not obliged to award fees in every brown act case and must thoughtfully exercise their discretion by examining all the circumstances to determine whether an award of fees would be unjust.the burden of showing such inequity rests on the defendant,however.id.at.as an example,the appellate court pointed to aho clark cir,aho,which affirmed the denial of attorneys fees under the federal civil rights act because the award of fees might have altered the consequences of the settlement reached by the parties,defendants were already in the process of remedying the program at issue and attorney fees were not essential to attract competent counsel.common cause i,supra,d at.the appellate court also relied,without discussion or analysis,on zarcone perry cir,zarcone.finally,the court held that,without limitation,other considerations which the trial court should consider included the necessity for the lawsuit,lack of injury to the public,the likelihood the problem would have been solved by other means and the likelihood of recurrence of the unlawful act in the absence of the lawsuit.the appellate court then remanded the matter back to the trial court to reconsider whether an award of fees would be appropriate under those standards.common cause i,supra,d at.
common cause ii 
on remand from common cause i,the trial court again denied plaintiffs their attorneys fees.based on the city council later public hearing on the matters discussed in its private letter to the city manager,the trial court found that the suit was unnecessary,that no public injury occurred,and that the problem created by the private letter had been solved by other means.because there were no allegations of a concerted effort to avoid the law generally,combined with the trial court earlier finding that the private letter was not part of the council normal procedure,the trial court found that the violation was not likely to recur.the trial court also found that the public benefit from the action was insubstantial even at the local level.the plaintiffs appealed again,and the appellate court held that the trial court abused its discretion by denying their fees motion.
the common cause ii court noted that the city attorney issued two written opinions concluding that no brown act violation occurred.in one of those letters,the city attorney wrote that it was not uncommon for council members to commence an action by way of a private letter,leading to an open and public discussion of the matter.the appellate court concluded that the latter statement rendered insupportable the trial court conclusion that the private letter did not represent the council normal procedure.from the view of common cause the necessity for filing this action was to preclude further brown act violations.the lawsuit could have been avoided had the city attorney responded to the common cause letter complaining of a brown act violation by agreeing to advise the city council members not to take future action by means of circulated letter acknowledging the previous action did violate the brown act.the city attorney refused to do either and,in fact,emphasized his belief the procedure was perfectly proper.thus,there was reason to believe there would be continuing use of circulated letter agreements without judicial intervention common cause ii,supra,d at.
according to the appellate court,the lawsuit was not brought to undo the council action but was instead brought in good faith to judicially determine the propriety of the council use of private,internal letters as a means of taking action and to ensure that the council illegal procedure was not followed again.the action was therefore intended to vindicate the brown act strong public policy favoring open meetings.as for the lack of a sufficient public benefit,the court held that absent the lawsuit,there was no assurance that the council would not repeat its brown act violation.finally,even if the trial court were correct that a repeat violation was unlikely,this does not support the conclusion that the public benefit from common cause action was not sufficient to support an award of attorney fees.the benefit obtained through the lawsuit was not exclusively for common cause.the action was filed for the public benefit and the conclusion that the use of the circulated letters constituted a brown act violation supports a grant of attorney fees.common cause ii,supra,d at.
the standard of review and the law of special circumstances 
common cause i is significant not just for its holding,but for its reliance on federal decisions interpreting attorneys fees provisions applicable to a variety of federal public interest statutes,which the appellate court believed were analogous to section of the brown act.because common cause i relied on analogous federal statutes and case law,and because our legislature amended section after both common cause i and ii were decided stats,ch,we will also look to decisions interpreting analogous federal law.marina point,wolfson cal d,when the legislature amends a statute without altering provisions that have already been judicially construed,the legislature is presumed to have known of and agreed to the previous judicial construction and the reenacted portions of the statute are construed as they were before the amendment accord,thirteen committee weinreb d.weinreb plaintiffs sued under state campaign finance reform law to obtain declaration that candidate financial disclosure statement should include certain items and sought to recover statutory attorneys fees fee provisions in analogous federal public interest statutes were properly applied to interpret state political reform enactment that depended on private litigation as a means of enforcement.as explained below,this has led to an altered abuse of discretion standard of review.
standard of review 
common cause i observed that the brown act attorneys fee provision was enacted in in order to encourage private enforcement of the brown act stated policies.the fee provision was needed to encourage private enforcement because lack of judicial interpretation hampered the act effectiveness and penalties for noncompliance would otherwise be inadequate.common cause i,supra,d at.according to the court,section provides for attorneys fees without special qualification because absent such a provision,there would be little incentive to bring such actions.accord,society of professional journalists briggs,briggs the legislative purpose in providing counsel fees to plaintiffs suing under public interest federal civil rights to vindicate those rights by private enforcement,which is best achieved by encouraging the public to act as private attorneys general the general rule therefore holds that successful plaintiffs in such actions ordinarily recover their fees unless special circumstances would make the fee award unjust weinreb,supra,d at.applying federal law to state political reform act claim,held that policy of encouraging vigorous enforcement through private litigation would be seriously eroded if attorney fees were to be denied to the prevailing party plaintiff in the absence of overriding special circumstances.
in order to carry out that purpose,the common cause i court endorsed the standard announced in piggie park,supra,at page.fees are presumptively appropriate and a successful plaintiff should ordinarily recover an attorney fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.see also common cause i,supra,d at.the trial court discretion under this standard has been interpreted very narrowly.to act as an effective incentive for injured parties to seek judicial relief for civil rights violations,fee awards should be the rule rather than the exception.ackerley communications city of salem,or cir,quoting teitelbaum sorenson cir,teitelbaum.an abuse of discretion exists where the trial court either misperceives the law or does not consider relevant factors and therefore misapplies the law.ackerley,at.
in short,the trial court has the discretion to deny successful brown act plaintiffs their attorneys fees,but only if the defendant shows that special circumstances exist that would make such an award unjust.
b.the law of special circumstances 
as one might imagine,given the variety of federal laws subject to private enforcement,the fact patterns justifying a denial of fees vary greatly.nevertheless,a few basic guidelines have emerged.in briggs,the district court gave the following examples 
instances in which special circumstances were found to justify a denial of a fee award include outrageous conduct on the part of plaintiff,and situations in which a defendant is powerless to provide the remedy sought by plaintiff.other instances where counsel fees were denied include circumstances wherein plaintiff claims were clothed as actions but clearly were state law claims,and where plaintiffs,with the barest standing,attacked an antiquated curfew statute without prior attempts to remedy the grievance without litigation.briggs,supra.at,fns.omitted federal civil rights claim.briggs itself involved a challenge to a utah practice of allowing government litigation settlement agreements to remain confidential.the court acknowledged that,if the public entity had released the settlement agreement in question to the public without court order,the government would have presumptively breached the settlement agreement confidentiality provision,thus exposing the government to substantial damages.this factor justified the denial of attorneys fees.ibid.
the fifth circuit has also recognized that denial of fees due to special circumstances arises only in unusual situations.for example,several cases upholding decisions to deny attorney fees involve situations in which the plaintiff filed under section to recover what was essentially a tort claim for private monetary damages.these suits did not require injunctive relief or confer significant civil rights to the public.citations.riddell national democratic party cir,riddell.among the decisions cited by riddell for this proposition were zarcone,supra,at pages courthouse coffee vendor sued for civil rights violation after judge ordered plaintiff brought to chambers in handcuffs,where judge berated plaintiff for brewing lousy coffee,and chastang flynn emrich cir,male employees successfully sued on their own behalf for sex discrimination in pension benefits fees properly denied because the plan was legal when first implemented,the defendant employer did not have unrestricted right to change the plan,the plan was amended to eliminate the discrimination before plaintiffs sued,and defendant had no financial interest in the plan and therefore lacked incentive to discriminate.
riddell also cited to cases where special circumstances existed justifying a denial of attorneys fees because plaintiffs efforts did not contribute to their litigation success.among the decisions cited were aho,supra,which was relied upon by both common cause i and the trial court here.
aho was a federal civil rights class action alleging that hawaiian school board officials violated federal guidelines by providing an inadequate school breakfast program.suit was filed within weeks after the school board implemented the program.seven months later,the parties settled and entered a consent agreement that obligated the school board to conduct a survey,tabulate the results,and implement the program in schools that desired to participate.the consent agreement expressly left undetermined whether the board existing program violated state or federal guidelines.it was also silent on the issue of the plaintiffs attorneys fees.when plaintiffs fee motion was denied,they appealed,prompting a from the school board in order to unwind the consent agreement.
the ninth circuit held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiffs their fees because special circumstances made such an award unjust.the aho court relied heavily on the absence of a fees provision in the consent agreement,concluding that plaintiffs must have compromised in order to avoid the risk and expense of further litigation.awarding fees in that circumstance would alter the consequences of that compromise and would thus be manifestly unfair to defendants.aho,supra,at.further,the statutory attorneys fee provision did not take effect until four months after the suit was filed and just two months before it was settled.under the law as it existed during much of the negotiations,the plaintiffs would not have been entitled to recover their fees unless the defendants were found to have acted in bad faith.because the defendants may well have believed that they were not liable for fees,and because they contended they would not have settled if they had known plaintiffs would seek to recover their fees,a fee award would be unduly harsh.ibid.
finally,the aho court considered the statutory purposes of the federal attorneys fee statute although the class of children who might benefit from the school breakfast program is a large one,we are not persuaded that an award of attorneys fees was essential to attract competent counsel.citation.defendants were already in the process of establishing a breakfast program at the time this suit was filed.nor can we conclude that appellants suit was essential in order to bring the existing program within federal standards,since that determination was expressly left unresolved by the consent agreement.furthermore,defendants did not manifest bad faith or obdurate conduct they were apparently quite willing to expand the breakfast program.in these circumstances,the policies underlying the civil rights fees act do not mandate an award of attorneys fees.aho,supra,at.
with these guiding principles in mind,we next conclude that there were no special circumstances to justify the trial court order denying appellants their fees.
the absence of special circumstances mandates a fee award 
tracking both common cause i and aho,the trial court denied appellants their fees for three reasons.first,their suit was unnecessary.second,there was insufficient public injury.third,attorneys fees were not needed to attract competent counsel because the times had plenty of incentive,other than attorneys fees,to bring this action.the first two findings are a blend of several factors the fact that the board corrected its december violation one day later when pellman changed his mind,followed by its january and closed sessions initiating a series of
