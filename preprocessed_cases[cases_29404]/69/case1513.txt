background 
the contract in question was awarded pursuant to the small business administration sba a program.a.this program is designed to help small,disadvantaged businesses.the program sets aside government contracts for businesses that are owned and controlled at least by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.to administer the program,the sba contracts with federal agencies to provide goods and services,and subcontracts the actual performance of the work to disadvantaged businesses that have been certified by sba as eligible for such contracts.although the sba has delegated the authority to negotiate with the contractor to the department of transportation,and by extension,the maritime administration marad,the sba is responsible for approving the resulting contract before award,and the formal contract is between the sba and the contractor.far c,id.b.in june,veridyne,then shepard patterson associates,was certified by the sba for participation in sba a program.veridyne admission to the a program was for the standard term,and it was scheduled to graduate from the program in june.
in march,marad awarded to the sba an indefinite delivery,indefinite quantity contract for services related to marad logistics program.later that month,the sba awarded a subcontract containing the same terms as its contract with marad to veridyne for one base year and up to four option years.the subcontract required veridyne to provide services to marad as needed in accordance with authorized written work orders.pl.app x.marad paid veridyne for the services performed under the initial contract period.
in late or early,veridyne approached marad about extending the contract.marad was satisfied with veridyne performance and preferred to work with veridyne rather than switch to another business.veridyne wanted to extend the contract before veridyne graduated from the a program in june.at the time,if the new contract award price exceeded million,it would be subject to open competition between businesses and could not be awarded as a contract.a d i ii.if marad opened the new contract to competition,the process would delay the award until after june,until after veridyne graduation from the program.
in march,veridyne submitted a proposal to marad for a new indefinite delivery,indefinite quantity,contract.correspondence between veridyne and marad before the submission specified that estimates for the new contract would not exceed in the aggregate.as a result,the proposed cost specified in the proposal,including the five additional option years,was.the proposal specified that a ll contract terms and conditions are the same,and the original scope and technical content remain intact as the original contract.veridyne representative certified in the proposal that to the best of his knowledge and belief,the cost or pricing data as defined in far,all the facts that can be reasonably expected to contribute to the soundness of estimates of future costs submitted in support of the new contract,are accurate,complete and current.citing far.these statements were inaccurate.veridyne well knew that the services to be provided under the extension would cost far in excess of,indeed,in excess of ten times that amount.veridyne even admitted that the costs established in the proposal were never intended to reflect marad actual needs,but were developed to meet sba million limit.
similarly,although some marad officials did not believe that the estimated cost represented the actual value of the services described in the proposal,other officials openly conceded that veridyne had explicitly written the proposal to remain within sba threshold.the claims court concluded that marad personnel knew that the million amount was merely a pretext to get around having to award the new contract subject to competition.see also marad contracting officials knowledgeable in approving the proposal vehicle and fully aware of the need to befog the sba in order to obtain its approval actively participated in securing that approval.
in april,marad officials approved the new contract and submitted a letter to sba proposing that sba approve the new contract without opening it to competition.although veridyne proposal was not sent to the sba,marad letter to the sba included veridyne misleading data and figures taken directly from the proposal and noted that t he statement of work is unchanged from the current contract and t he total estimated amount of this requirement is.resp.to panel request,attachment a at,may,ecf.in may,marad,veridyne,and the sba executed the new contract extending the service contract,known as modification mod,which had been drafted by marad to reflect veridyne proposal.
by,even though the stated cost of mod was about,marad projected internal logistics budget for the years covered by mod and the final year of the original contract was.the work orders issued to veridyne far exceeded the scope of mod.from to,marad issued additional work orders to veridyne,veridyne completed the work,and marad paid veridyne for this work.the government does not now seek to recover these payments.
in part due to marad cost overruns,the department of transportation office of inspector general began investigating the execution of mod in july.by september,the inspector general concluded that veridyne had obtained mod through fraud.in october,marad chief counsel instructed marad officials that,e ffective immediately,marad is to make no payments to veridyne on any contract,without express approval by me.marad did not notify veridyne until december,when marad issued a stop order suspending contract performance and informed veridyne of its view that mod was void ab initio.at the time of the december stop order,invoices numbered were outstanding to marad and had not been paid.after the stop order,veridyne continued to do work for marad and submitted three additional invoices,numbered.marad never paid veridyne the amounts invoiced in.
on june,veridyne submitted invoices as certified claims pursuant to the contract disputes act cda,recodified at.marad informed veridyne that it would not issue a final decision on these claims because the matter involved allegations of fraud,and veridyne treated this as a deemed denial.f.on february,veridyne filed a complaint in the claims court to recover on invoices,among other claims.
insofar as is pertinent to this appeal,the government entered a defense under the special plea in fraud statute,that veridyne had forfeited its contract claim.in addition,the government counterclaimed for a civil penalty under the false claims act fca,for each fraudulent claim presented and for a penalty under the antifraud provision of the cda,recodified at,for the unsupported portion of veridyne cda claims.
after a trial on the merits,the claims court rendered a somewhat confusing opinion.it concluded that because veridyne invoices contained false information,its direct contract claims were forfeited under the special plea in fraud statute.but the claims court also concluded that because veridyne had conferred a benefit on the government by performing the contract,it could recover in quantum meruit.the claims court determined that veridyne was owed in quantum meruit for the work performed before marad issued the stop order.
on the government fca counterclaim,the claims court concluded veridyne proposal for the mod extension was a false claim.because the claims court treated each invoice that veridyne submitted under mod as a separate false claim,each claim incurred an additional penalty under the fca.the claims court imposed the maximum penalty of per claim for each invoice submitted under mod,or false claims.thus,the government was awarded in fca penalties.the claims court also concluded that n o evidence of record suggests that the sba was aware that mod was a pretext aimed at avoiding sba competition requirements.finally,the claims court found that veridyne cda claims for invoices were unsupported and concluded that the government was entitled to cda damages in the amount of 
the government appealed the claims court quantum meruit award.veridyne did not appeal the claims court forfeiture finding on its direct contract claim.however,veridyne the claims court imposition of penalties under the fca and the cda.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.we review legal conclusions of the claims court de novo and its factual findings for clear error.daewoo eng g constr.united states.
discussion 
veridyne affirmative recovery in quantum meruit 
the special plea in fraud statute provides 
a claim against the united states shall be forfeited to the united states by any person who corruptly practices or attempts to practice any fraud against the united states in the proof,statement,establishment or allowance thereof.
in such cases the united states court of federal claims shall specifically find such fraud or attempt and render judgment of forfeiture.
to prevail under section,the government must establish by clear and convincing evidence that the contractor knew that its submitted claims were false,and that it intended to defraud the government by submitting those claims.daewoo,at quoting commercial contractors,united states.the claims court found that veridyne affirmative contract claim was forfeited under section.veridyne does not appeal the forfeiture finding.
even though the claims court found that veridyne had forfeited its affirmative contract claim,it awarded quantum meruit recovery to veridyne for the value of the services performed by veridyne before marad stop order.the claims court relied on united states amdahl,stating that binding federal circuit precedent permits a contractor to recover for services already rendered where the situation does not involve a bribe or conflict of interest.see also.on appeal,the government argues that it was improper for the claims court to allow veridyne to recover in quantum meruit when its claims have been forfeited under the special plea in fraud statute.we agree.
one of our predecessor courts,the court of claims,decided this issue in mervin contracting united states.there,the court found that the contractor claim was forfeited for fraud.id.at.the court held that quantum meruit recovery was unavailable to the contractor,finding that the contract claim and the quantum meruit claim were for the same services,and the claims for those services were forfeited,regardless of the theory or form in which the claims were asserted.the second causes of action in quantum meruit are therefore no more enforceable than the first causes of action based on the express contracts.id.at.the court of claims in little united states followed mervin,recognizing that,where,as in the present case,fraud was committed in regard to the very contract upon which the suit is brought,this court does not have the right to divide the contract and allow recovery on part of it.
the legislative history of the special plea in fraud statute confirms the correctness of the mervin decision.the special plea in fraud statute was originally enacted as part of the court of claims act in,which expanded the jurisdiction of the court of claims to include private claims against the government,founded upon any law of congress,or upon any regulation of an executive department,or upon any contract,express or implied,with the government and gave it the power to issue final judgments.court of claims act of,stat.one particular concern was that expanding the court of claims jurisdiction would enable litigants to perpetrate fraud on the government.vol.pt.cong.globe,sess.in the floor debate,bill sponsors explained that the special plea provision was intended to give the claimants to understand by formal provision of law,that any attempt at fraud upon their part shall so taint their claim,no matter whether there be equity in it or not,as to forever forfeit it to the government of the united states.id.at emphasis added.
neither the amdahl case,relied on by the claims court,nor miller united states,cited by veridyne,counsels an alternative result.in amdahl,pursuant to the brooks act.codified as amended at,the government procurement agency had delegated to the department of treasury the authority to procure computer equipment,and treasury contracted with the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac for this purpose.amdahl,at.but in doing so treasury had violated the statute and regulation in two respects it improperly paid for the equipment upon signing but before physical delivery and failed to determine whether suitable equipment was available from other sources.id.at.because treasury had acted beyond the scope of its authority,we held that the contract was void,and freddie mac could not recover under an illegal contract.id.at.however,we concluded that freddie mac could recover under quantum meruit for the services performed as an innocent contractor.id.at.there is no suggestion in amdahl that quantum meruit recovery is available where the contract claim has been forfeited under a special plea in fraud.to the contrary,amdahl contemplated that quantum meruit recovery may be different in a case involving fraud or the like,a matter not involved here.id.at.similarly,miller did not address whether quantum meruit recovery was available for forfeited claims,but concluded that a contractor could obtain quantum meruit recovery because there was no fraud and the contractor was only liable under the fca on a negligent misrepresentation theory.at.
therefore,we reverse the claims court award of for quantum meruit recovery to veridyne.
ii.the government false claims act counterclaim 
under the fca,a ny person who knowingly presents to the government a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval is liable to the united states government for a civil penalty of not less than and not more than,plus times the amount of damages which the government sustains.a,as adjusted by the federal civil penalties inflation adjustment act of,see also.to recover under the fca,the government must show the contractor presented or caused to be presented to an agent of the united states a claim for payment the claim was false or fraudulent the contractor knew the claim was false or fraudulent and the united states suffered damages as a result of the false or fraudulent claim.young montenay,united states.the government must establish a violation of the fca by a preponderance of the evidence.d daewoo,at.
the claims court found that veridyne proposal to marad for the extension of the contract,the mod proposal,was a false claim because it misrepresented the cost of the services that veridyne agreed to provide in the proposal.the claims court awarded the government the maximum penalty for each of the invoices submitted pursuant to mod for a total penalty of.
veridyne first argues that its proposal did not contain false statements because the costs established in modification were never intended to reflect marad actual needs.we disagree.the original contract had covered all of marad logistics needs and the language in the proposal indicated that mod would have the same scope that a ll contract terms and conditions are the same,and the original scope and technical content remain intact.in addition,veridyne representative had certified to the best of his knowledge and belief,the cost or pricing data in the proposal as defined in far,all the facts that can be reasonably expected to contribute to the soundness of estimates of future costs submitted in support of mod are accurate,complete and current.citing far far.the fact that this was an indefinite cost,indefinite qu
