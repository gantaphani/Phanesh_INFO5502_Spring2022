following a jury trial,anthony cuti was convicted on june,of one count of conspiracy to make false statements and four counts of securities fraud and was sentenced on august,to concurrent terms of months of imprisonment,to be followed by concurrent terms of three years of supervised release.in this appeal,cuti challenges whether the district court decision to award restitution,directly following its denial of cuti motion for a new trial and after initially declining to award restitution,evinced judicial vindictiveness in violation of his due process rights and whether the district court award of restitution constituted an abuse of discretion.
as set forth below,we clarify whether particular expenses incurred are necessary under the vwpa and extend the reasoning of our recent decision in united states maynard,a case construing the mandatory victims restitution act mvra,to cases under the vwpa.in short,we conclude that the restitution order improperly includes legal expenses incurred in connection with a civil arbitration that,while connected to the offense of conviction,was not undertaken or pursued in aid of the prosecution.we also clarify that are eligible for restitution only to the extent such payments were made on behalf of the victim.we therefore vacate the district court order of restitution for this limited purpose,and otherwise affirm the remainder of the court restitution order.
background 
underlying criminal proceedings 
anthony cuti was the chief executive officer ceo,and board chairman of duane reade until.the evidence introduced at cuti criminal trial showed that from to,cuti and his william tennant,duane reade former chief financial officer cfo and senior,executed two different fraudulent accounting schemes in order to inflate the company reported earnings.
following trial,the jury returned a verdict finding cuti guilty on all counts conspiracy under count and securities fraud in violation of b,b and count making false statements in two sec filings in violation of a,a and counts and and making false statements in another sec filing in violation of.d,d d,and count.tennant was acquitted on count and convicted on count.the district court denied both defendants motions for a new trial and sentenced cuti and tennant principally to imprisonment for three years and time served,respectively,and imposed fines of million on cuti and on tennant.cuti and tennant convictions were upheld in june.see generally united states cuti,cir united states cuti,app x cir.
ii.duane reade internal investigations 
oak hill,a private equity firm,acquired duane read in,and in terminated cuti employment without cause.duane reade and cuti were unable to resolve certain disagreements regarding benefits for cuti,and he filed an arbitration demand against duane reade on september.the law firm paul,weiss,rifkind,wharton garrison,llp paul,weiss,which has represented oak hill since,was retained to represent duane reade in the arbitration.
in late august,one week before cuti initiated the arbitration,duane reade general counsel michelle bergman was notified by duane reade former director of construction about several suspicious credit and rebilling transactions made at cuti instruction that improperly classified several million dollars as capital expenditures.bergman notified paul,weiss and the audit committee of duane reade board of directors retained cooley godward kronish llp cooley as independent counsel,along with forensic accounting firm alixpartners llp,to conduct an internal investigation.on november,paul,weiss filed counterclaims in the arbitration based on this credit rebilling fraud.cuti refused to be interviewed by cooley unless duane reade withdrew certain of these counterclaims.no interview with cuti was conducted,and on december,cooley issued a report to duane reade audit committee on this credit rebilling scheme.
in february,paul,weiss uncovered evidence of a real estate income concession transaction identified as the blue trophy transaction involving cuti that looked suspicious.once again,cooley and alixpartners were retained by the audit committee to investigate.in a report to the audit committee dated may,cooley concluded that between and cuti engaged in a fraudulent scheme designed to result in upfront recognition of real estate concession income to improve duane reade earnings.app x at quotation marks omitted.cooley also explained that 
the impetus for the investigation was information learned by attorneys at paul,weiss,duane reade outside counsel,in the course of their preparation for the arbitration commenced against duane reade by its former ceo,anthony cuti.the information was communicated by paul,weiss attorneys and related to a specific income item recognized by duane reade in the second quarter of.paul,weiss attorneys shared that information with members of the audit committee,and the audit committee determined that further investigation into items classified as real estate concession income during the period was warranted.
the results of these internal investigations led to the filing of amended counterclaims and affirmative defenses in the arbitration proceedings in april,which the arbitrator accepted on may.a few days later,on may,duane reade counsel met with representatives of the attorney office usao for the southern district of new york and with the regional office of the sec to disclose the internal investigations and their findings.
the government commenced its own investigation into duane reade finances.duane reade cooperated in the usao investigation,attending meetings with the prosecutors,participating in telephone calls,and responding to numerous requests for documents and information.in july,the arbitration proceeding was stayed at the request of the government.many duane reade employees,both former and current,were interviewed as part of the government investigation.duane reade provided independent counsel for each,pursuant to each employee individual contract,duane reade bylaws,or its certificate of incorporation.
throughout this time,oak hill and duane reade agreed to share the costs of legal representation by paul,weiss,with oak hill paying percent and duane reade paying of the fees from january through september.ultimately,the government investigation led to an indictment being returned against cuti on october,charging cuti in five counts.the sec also filed a parallel civil action against cuti arising out of the same conduct.
iii.postverdict proceedings in the district court 
cuti was found guilty on all counts on june.in october,oak hill and duane reade submitted a joint impact statement seeking an order of restitution of approximately million with the majority of the amount requested to compensate for the amount that oak hill claimed that it overpaid for its acquisition of duane reade as a result of cuti fraud.so that the government could present its theory of loss and restitution,the district court held a fatico hearing over seven days from november to june.
on july,cuti moved for a new trial,premised on newly acquired evidence that one of the government witnesses had given perjured testimony at trial.the following day,the district court issued an order and memorandum addressing oak hill and duane reade requests for restitution.united states cuti,dab,wl july,initial restitution order.the court concluded that oak hill was not entitled to restitution in the amount of oak hill alleged overpayment for duane reade because the government had not met its burden of showing that oak hill suffered a loss attributable to cuti offense conduct.id.at.next,though the court acknowledged that it could order discretionary restitution under the vwpa,id.at,it declined to order it,on account of complex issues of fact as to the amount of restitution that would unduly complicate and prolong the sentencing process i,the determination of just what are the types of costs oak hill and duane reade have incurred.id.at.while it was clear that oak hill and duane reade have expended staggering amounts of money,time,and effort in the investigation and prosecution of defendant cuti title offense,the court expressed concern that some costs could be imbedded in the restitution calculations,and that the net reimbursement of all costs can best be addressed in the context of oak hill,duane reade and defendant cuti arbitration proceedings.id.the initial restitution order did not address cuti motion for a new trial.sentencing was scheduled for august.
on august,duane reade and oak hill asked the court to reconsider its position regarding restitution,a request which the court summarily denied on august.however,on august,the court issued a subsequent order vacating its declination of oak hill and duane reade request for reconsideration.it also vacated its initial restitution order.the court order indicated that it would impose restitution and retain jurisdiction for the purpose of determining the appropriate amount at defendant cuti sentencing.app x at.the court also directed cuti to respond to oak hill august,letter.that same day,the court also denied cuti motion for a new trial.cuti was sentenced as scheduled on august.
a partial restitution order,issued october,ruled that expenses attributable to the proceedings are not appropriate for restitution,and that oak hill,separate and apart from issues relating to duane reade,is not a victim to whom restitution is owed based on the court finding that the government failed to establish a loss.special app x at.the court also concluded that oak hill in its capacity as successor to duane reade is compensable.special app x at.the court determined that certain fees and expenses for cooley and alixpartners were subject to restitution,as were certain fees and expenses of duane reade accountants and auditors,as well as costs of the kroll ontrack database.special app x at.the court then referred the remaining fees and expenses for an inquest before magistrate judge pitman.special app x at.
following the magistrate judge december,report and recommendation r r,the court conducted a de novo review and adopted the r r with some modifications.united states cuti,dab,wl may,cuti restitution order.the court determined that restitution was only available pursuant to the vwpa,not the mvra,and that oak hill was entitled to restitution not as a victim,but only as a that had been required to make payments to duane reade,the actual victim of cuti crime,under j.id.at.the court then concluded that certain legal fees and expenses paid to paul,weiss were necessary and related to duane reade participation in the investigation or prosecution of the criminal case against defendant cuti and subject to restitution,id.at as were certain other legal fees for the costs of counsel for current and former duane reade employees,id.at as well as the fees to cooley,forensic accountants and duane reade accountants,and the kroll ontrack database,id.at for a total award of.id.the court concluded that cuti had the ability to pay the full amount of restitution,and ordered a payment schedule of of his gross monthly income,beginning in the second month of his supervised release.id.at.given its conclusion that oak hill was only entitled to restitution as a,the court ordered cuti to make restitution payments in the amount of to duane reade first,prior to making any restitution payments to oak hill,in accordance with j.id.it is from this may,opinion that cuti appeals.
discussion 
cuti makes two challenges to the cuti restitution order.he asserts that the district court august,reversal of its july,order declining to award restitution and the timing of that reversal immediately after denying cuti motion for a new trial created the appearance of a vindictive sentencing increase under north carolina pearce,and that this requires vacatur.he also seeks vacatur because he argues that oak hill was not a victim duane reade employees legal fees should not have been included in the restitution order and because the restitution order improperly included expenses incurred prior to the government investigation and prosecution of cuti criminal case.
applicable legal standards 
vindictiveness 
in pearce,the supreme court held that d ue process of law requires that vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction must play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial.at.in so holding,the court noted that whenever a judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant after a new trial,the reasons for his doing so must affirmatively appear.id.at.otherwise,a presumption arises that a greater sentence has been imposed for a vindictive purpose a presumption that must be rebutted by objective information justifying the increased sentence.alabama smith,omission in original and internal quotation marks omitted.
the pearce presumption do es not apply in every case where a convicted defendant receives a higher sentence on retrial or at resentencing.texas mccullough.the presumption exists to prevent not enlarged sentences after a new trial but rather vindictiveness of a sentencing judge.united states singletary,cir internal quotation marks omitted.b efore a defendant may invoke the pearce presumption,there must be a reasonable likelihood that the increase in sentence is the product of actual vindictiveness on the part of the sentencing authority.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
restitution under the vwpa 
the vwpa provides that t he court,when sentencing a defendant convicted of an offense under this title,may order that the defendant make restitution to any victim of such offense.a a.the vwpa requires sentencing courts to consider the amount of the loss sustained by the victim as a result of the offense,the defendant financial resources,the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the defendant dependents,and other factors the court deems appropriate.see id.a b i.while the district court must review these statutory factors,detailed factual findings for each factor are not required.united states battista,cir.any dispute as to the proper amount or type of restitution shall be resolved by the court by the preponderance of the evidence.e.
we review a district court restitution order deferentially,reversing only if in our view the trial court abused its discretion.united states amato,cir.to identify such abuse,we must conclude that a challenged ruling rests on an error of law,a clearly erroneous finding of fact,or otherwise can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.united states boccagna,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
ii.analysis 
vindictiveness 
we first address cuti vindictiveness argument.cuti can point only to timing of the district court pivot regarding the feasibility of separating out the money spent in contemplation of arbitration from the funds spent on the investigation for his criminal case.as an initial matter,this is not the customary procedural posture for a claim of judicial vindictiveness,which usually involves a sentencing following an appeal from or collateral attack on a defendant conviction.with the particular procedural posture here,the district court had little reason or motivation to be vindictive.see,mcculloch,at u nlike the judge who has been reversed,the trial judge here had no motivation to engage in.alteration in original and internal quotation marks omitted.
moreover,the district court decision to award restitution was clearly within the court discretion under section a b ii the court apparently sua sponte decision to reconsider,and to undertake the significant task of considering a restitution award in this case was neither an error of law,nor was it based on a clearly erroneous finding of fact.emphasizing only the close temporal proximity between the court order denying his motion for a new trial and its decision to award restitution,cuti has not pointed to anything concrete in the record to support his theory of vindictiveness.thus,as we find no abuse of the district court discretion in its decision to award restitution under the vwpa,nor any reasonable likelihood that the decision was the product of actual vindictiveness,singletary,at,cuti is not entitled to a presumption of vindictiveness see mcculloch,at the presumption of pearce does not apply in situations where the possibility of vindictiveness is this speculative.in this instance,the claim of vindictiveness,unaided by the presumption,fails as clearly insufficient.
restitution 
cuti first two restitution arguments that oak hill should not have been deemed eligible for restitution because it was not a victim of cuti fraud,and that oak hill should not have been reimbursed for paying its employee legal fees lack merit and do not warrant vacatur.we find,however,that in awarding oak hill restitution the district court failed to properly clarify whether the restitution award to oak hill included work by paul,weiss that only addressed oak hill legal interests.as to cuti remaining argument,which challenges whether duane reade payment of legal fees were necessary as contemplated under section b,we find this too requires vacatur and remand.
oak hill as non victim entitled to restitution 
first,there was no abuse of discretion in the court decision to award oak hill restitution under j on the theory that oak hill paid expenses on duane reade behalf.we permit restitution in situations where a third party has directly paid an expense incurred by the victim,rather than having the victim pay and having the third party reimburse the victim afterward.see,united states douglas,cir the fact that third party brink paid for the headstone directly rather than having victim moran pay for it and reimbursing him does not relieve douglas of the obligation to make restitution for the cost incurred.united states malpeso,cir upholding award of restitution to the fbi under the vwpa even though fbi had paid the expense directly instead of reimbursing the victim,there being no significant functional or economic difference between the indemnitor prior payment of the victim expense and subsequent reimbursement.
the district court found that oak hill was not a victim and appropriately excluded fees paid to paul,weiss that reflected trial and work that advanced oak hill own legal interests.however,the district court did not discuss whether any of oak hill payments to paul,weiss reflected work performed solely on behalf of oak hill.as cuti points out,the record suggests that some of paul,weiss work may have been performed on behalf of oak hill.therefore,we vacate this aspect of the district court restitution award.on remand,the district court should exclude any payments made by oak hill to paul,weiss that reflected legal work performed solely on oak hill behalf,whether incurred before,during or after trial.
legal fees for duane reade employees as necessary expenses 
next,cuti asserts that duane reade did not incur legal fees on behalf of its employees because it was not required to reimburse these legal fees.this assertion is belied by the district court conclusion and factual finding that duane reade expenses for its employees counsel were necessary and related to its participation in the government investigation and prosecution of cuti.cuti restitution order,wl,at.the district court concluded further that these expenses were necessary and constituted an actual loss.id.at.this decision was soundly within the court exercise of discretion.these costs were incurred during and as a direct result of the government investigation into cuti fraud,and the district court reasonably concluded that duane reade was obligated to indemnify its employees independent legal representation for their participation in the government investigation.the district court,along with the magistrate judge,carefully parsed the legal fees paid for each individual employee,and only permitted fees related to the government investigation.such expenditures resulting from assistance provided to the government are appropriately included in a restitution order under the vwpa.see battista,at t he district court did not err in awarding the nba attorneys fees incurred as a result of the assistance it provided to the government in its investigation and prosecution of battista criminal offense.emphasis added.we therefore affirm this portion of the district court restitution order.
other legal expenses incurred by duane reade 
cuti final argument requires us to consider whether expenses incurred by paul,weiss on duane reade behalf in the course of its work on the arbitration that also contributed to discovering cuti fraud,in addition to the expenses incurred by cooley internal investigations into both frauds,properly constitute necessary other expenses related to participation in the investigation or prosecution related to the offense under b.to engage with this question we must further clarify the types of expenses that are necessary and related to the offense within the meaning of section b.
united states maynard and necessary expenses 
recently,in united states maynard,we considered what constitutes necessary expenses under the mandatory victims restitution act,b,reasoning that t he victim expenses that are recoverable as restitution under b are expenses the victim was required to incur to advance the investigation or prosecution of the offense.at emphasis added.
in so concluding,we surveyed our prior case law,acknowledging that our circuit takes a broad view of what expenses are necessary in the restitution context.see id.citing united states papagno,in reaching our conclusion,we recognize that several other courts of appeals have taken a broader view of the restitution provision at issue here.in particular,our analysis considered two relatively recent restitution opinions from our court amato and united states bahel.see amato,bahel,cir.
in amato,we affirmed a restitution award of attorney fees and accounting costs incurred as a result of an internal investigation that uncovered fraud notwithstanding that not all of the effort and expense was requested by the government,maynard,at.in bahel,a subsequent restitution case,we affirmed restitution for legal fees incurred when the united nations hired outside counsel to conduct an internal investigation rather than use lawyers.see see also bahel,at.we reasoned that 
in both amato and bahel,the internal investigations paid for by the victims unmasked fraud and led to investigations conducted by the authorities.the expense of the internal investigations was necessary because the entity had interests to protect the integrity of its ongoing operations and reputation,at the least as well as a duty to protect those interests when faced with evidence,indicia,or a grounded suspicion of internal misconduct,and the investigation was a means calculated to achieve the protection of those interests.
maynard,at emphasis added.
though maynard involved an award of mandatory restitution under the mvra,we have noted that the provisions of the vwpa and the mvra are nearly identical in authorizing an award of restitution.battista,at internal quotation marks omitted.in battista,we concluded that the holding in amato concededly decided in the mvra context applies to the almost verbatim statutory language in the vwpa the rationale that we provided in support of our conclusion that attorneys fees were recoverable as other expenses under the mvra applies with equal force to the vwpa.id.at.
with this in mind,we now extend maynard reasoning to the vwpa.thus,necessary expenses related to participation in the investigation as described in the vwpa,b,are expenses the victim was required to incur to advance the investigation or prosecution of the offense,maynard,at.this may include internal investigations undertaken in the face of evidence or grounded suspicion of internal misconduct which ultimately unmask fraud.id.
ii.duane reade expenses 
this extension of maynard to restitution under the vwpa does not end our inquiry.this is the case for two reasons.first,the internal investigation here was initially motivated by duane reade need to defend itself in cuti arbitration proceeding.second,duane reade retained two separate law firms over the course of the arbitration,one to handle its own internal investigation,the other to assist with the government investigation.as such,this case does not involve a straightforward internal investigation paid for by the victim that unmasks fraud as described in maynard.id.
in its final restitution or
