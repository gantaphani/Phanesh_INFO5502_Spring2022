no social purpose is served by having the defendant get free some aspect of the plaintiff that would have market value and for which he would normally pay.zacchini broadcasting,d.that is what happened in this case.nestlé usa,nestlé or appellant used russell christoff image on its taster choice instant coffee label without christoff consent and without remuneration.a jury awarded christoff in damages and over million dollars in profits.
nestlé argues that the jury verdict must be reversed because the cause of action was time barred.according to nestlé,if the trial court correctly had applied the rule and a statute of limitations,it would have concluded that the lawsuit filed six years after nestlé first used christoff image was barred.under the rule,with respect to the statute of limitations,publication generally is said to occur on the first general distribution of the publication to the public.shively bozanich cal th,d,shively.nestlé also argues that the profits award,which was based on civil code section,must be reversed because it did not knowingly use christoff image without his consent christoff was not a celebrity,and christoff did not show the profits were attributable to the use of his likeness 
we hold that the rule applies to a cause of action under section,and that a two year statute of limitations applies to a section cause of action.as a result,unless a reasonable person in christoff position had no meaningful ability to discover the publication,christoff must have filed a lawsuit within two years of when nestlé first published his image or republished his image.we also hold nestlé knowingly used christoff image without his consent section applies to christoff even though he is not a celebrity and christoff failed to provide substantial evidence showing that the million dollar profit award was attributable to the use of his image.
we reverse the judgment based on the jury verdict and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.
factual background 
in,russell christoff,who was then a professional model,posed gazing at a cup of coffee,as if he enjoyed the aroma.the photo shoot was arranged by nestlé canada christoff was paid for his time and received a contract governing the use of his image,which was signed by his agent and by nestlé canada contract.the contract provided that,if nestlé canada used the picture on a label it was designing for a brick of coffee,christoff would be paid plus an agency commission.the contract also provided that the price for any other use of christoff image would require further negotiations.without informing christoff,or paying him according to the terms of the contract,nestlé canada used christoff image on the coffee brick.
eleven years later,in,nestlé decided to redesign its label for taster choice instant coffee.for three decades,the taster choice label prominently featured a taster,that is a person peering into a cup of coffee.amanda steele,a nestlé employee,explained that one goal of the redesign was to maintain the taster in order to retain continuity.steele searched for high resolution artwork portraying the image of the original taster,but was unable to locate any artwork that met the necessary specifications.steele,however,found artwork portraying christoff and it satisfied the requirements.
a decision was made to use christoff image because of his distinguished look and because he could create continuity with the original taster to whom the parties refer as taster.steele believed that she had authority to use christoff image because she knew it had been widely used in canada.steele never investigated the scope of the consent and never asked christoff if he consented to the use of his image.steele explained that in talking to my colleague at nestlé canada,i believed that we had usage rights for the photo.so,i did think there was any need to contact christoff.christoff image was used in the redesigned taster choice label beginning in.only a portion of christoff face is visible and the picture is cropped just above the eyebrows.the redesigned label was used on several different taster choice jars,including regular coffee,decaffeinated,and various flavors.labels bearing christoff image also were produced in different languages to be sold internationally.for the label to be placed on jars sold in mexico,christoff image was altered to add sideburns and darken his complexion.jars of coffee bearing christoff image were included in nestlé multiple advertising campaigns for taster choice,including transit ads,coupons in newspapers,magazine advertisements,and internet advertisements.
on june,christoff discovered the use of his picture when he was shopping at a rite aid store and happened to see a can of taster choice instant coffee 
in,nestlé again redesigned its label using another model,james vaccaro,as the taster.vaccaro was paid for the use of his image for years.the new label started circulating in may,but jars of taster choice with christoff image were still in nestlé inventory and could have been shipped to retailers.
procedural background 
in,christoff sued nestlé,alleging causes of action for violation of section,common law appropriation of likeness,quantum meruit initially labeled,and unjust enrichment.the trial court denied nestlé motion for summary judgment based on the statute of limitations.the court applied a statute of limitations under code of civil procedure section.the court further concluded that the jury must determine whether christoff knew or should have known nestlé used his image prior to his discovery in june.the trial court also denied nestlé motion for summary adjudication,in which it asserted that there was no evidence it knowingly used christoff photograph without his consent.
at trial,nestlé vigorously objected to the testimony of christoff damage expert,peter sealy.sealy testimony detailed his opinion that the icon on the taster choice label was responsible for five to percent of nestlé profits from selling taster choice instant coffee.this testimony was the basis for christoff argument that he was entitled to percent of nestlé profits from the sale of taster choice instant coffee.christoff accounting expert testified that,during the period nestlé used christoff likeness,nestlé total profits from taster choice were and,based on sealy testimony,christoff was entitled to.
joseph hunter,a former partner at ford models,a prominent modeling agency,also testified as an expert for christoff.according to hunter,a model generally charges a day rate for a photo shoot and a usage fee for different uses such as packaging,billboards and transit.he valued the use of christoff photograph for a period at.in addition to the time period,hunter assumed that the photo was used in virtually all kinds of media that existed.he acknowledged that vaccaro received for the use of his image for a period but explained that is a very low fee.
at the close of christoff case,the court granted nestlé nonsuit motion on the issue of punitive damages.the court found no evidence of malice.
the jury concluded as follows nestlé knowingly used christoff photograph or likeness on the taster choice labels for commercial purposes without christoff consent prior to,christoff did not know and should not have known or reasonably suspected that his photograph was being used for commercial purposes christoff suffered in actual damages the profits attributable to the use of christoff photograph or likeness were the damages for the common law appropriation claim were and for the quantum meruit claim were.the trial court subsequently granted christoff motion for attorney fees.nestlé appealed from the judgment and the order awarding costs and attorney fees 
discussion 
this appeal raises four primary questions does the rule spr apply to a cause of action for appropriation what are the implications of applying the spr to an appropriation cause of action did christoff prove his cause of action under section and did christoff establish he was entitled to profits under section 
we begin,in part i,with a discussion of the development of the right of publicity.its historical roots are significant in the analysis of whether the right of publicity falls within the spr and which statute of limitations applies to a cause of action asserting a violation of the right of publicity.
in part ii,we consider the spr in the context of nestlé argument that christoff claims are barred by the statute of limitations.according to nestlé,by virtue of the spr,christoff was required to file a lawsuit one year after it first published his likeness,in.christoff did not file his lawsuit until.christoff argues that the spr does not apply to right of publicity claims instead a statute of limitation rule governs,and substantial evidence supported the jury finding that his claims did not accrue until when he first discovered the unlawful use of his likeness.
to resolve these issues,we first consider whether the spr applies to a cause of action for appropriation.we discuss the background of the spr,the language of the statute and conclude that based on the plain language of the statute and its uniform broad application to various tort causes of action,the spr is applicable to christoff causes of action for appropriation.although christoff identifies substantial competing policy considerations,his arguments are not persuasive,as we explain in part ii,subpart 
our conclusion that the spr is applicable takes us to the third key question and requires us to consider the following related issues,which we discuss in part iii is the spr compatible with the discovery rule were there republications of christoff image triggering additional causes of action,and what statute of limitations applies to christoff appropriation causes of action to resolve these issues,we review the spr in analogous areas of the law and consider its application to misappropriation of likeness claims.we then analyze whether the delayed discovery rule applies to this case and whether a or statute of limitations controls.
in part iv,we consider nestlé arguments that section does not apply.nestlé argues that it did not knowingly use christoff image and that christoff is not a celebrity.we reject nestlé statutory construction and hold that section is applicable.
given that section is applicable,we next consider whether christoff established the requirements of that statute to recover profits.nestlé argues that the damage award is not supported by substantial evidence.christoff argues that the testimony of his expert,peter sealy,amply supports the award.in part v,we summarize the testimony of sealy and conclude substantial evidence does not show the profits were attributable to the use of christoff likeness as required by section.
in part vi,we discuss the remaining issues raised by the parties including whether christoff was entitled to the quantum meruit recovery awarded by the jury and whether the attorney fee award must be reversed in light of our other holdings.lastly,in part vii,we give guidance to the trial court for remand.
i.the right of publicity derives from the right of privacy 
common law provided some protection from the unauthorized use of a person likeness.this appropriation was understood as a violation of a person right of privacy,just as the intrusion on a person solitude,the disclosure of private facts,and the placement of a person in a false light were considered invasions of privacy.rest d unfair competition,com.b,see also motschenbacher reynolds tobacco company cir.in,when the legislature complemented the common law tort of appropriation by adding a statutory cause of action,the invasion of privacy classification predominated.see lugosi,supra,cal d at,fn.the legislature recently enacted civil code section to provide a minimum amount of damages where an unauthorized commercial appropriation constitutes an invasion of privacy assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may,invasion of unauthorized commercial use of name,photo or likeness.
although the other invasions of privacy protected an individual peace and quiet,the appropriation tort protected an economic interest.lugosi,supra,cal d at,dis.opn.of bird,see also rest d unfair competition,com.b.when one makes an unauthorized use of another identity for his own commercial advantage,he is unjustly enriched,having usurped both profit and control of that individual public image.lugosi,supra,cal d at,dis.opn.of bird,see also rest d unfair competition,com.c.eventually,courts recognized anomalies created by lumping the appropriation tort in the invasion of privacy category.for example,the celebrity plaintiff could not recover from the use of his or her likeness because the celebrity did not suffer an injury to his or her solitude.see rest d unfair competition,com.b,gionfriddo major league baseball th,d.in addition,in california,the supreme court held that privacy rights were not descendible because the right is personal lugosi,supra,cal d at,see also rest d unfair competition,com.b.eventually,the appropriation tort became better known as the right of publicity.
in its earliest formulation,the right of publicity meant that a man has a right in the publicity value of his photograph.haelan laboratories topps chewing gum cir.for it is common knowledge that many prominent persons especially actors and,far from having their feelings bruised through public exposure of their likenesses,would feel sorely deprived if they no longer received money for authorizing advertisements,popularizing their countenances,displayed in newspapers,magazines,busses,trains and subways.ibid.our high court explained the right of publicity means in essence that the reaction of the public to name and likeness,which may be fortuitous or which may be managed or planned,endows the name and likeness of the person involved with commercially exploitable opportunities.lugosi,supra,cal d at.
the right of publicity protects the very identity or persona of the plaintiff as a human being,not the particular photograph of the plaintiff.downing abercrombie fitch cir,quoting mccarthy,rights of publicity and privacy c at see also knb enterprises matthews th,d.the protection of a person name or likeness has some parallels to federal copyright law.zacchini broadcasting,supra,at.but the copyright act protects pictorial,graphic,and sculptural works,including photographs,not the name,identity or persona of the plaintiff.downing abercrombie fitch,supra,at.both the copyright act and the right of publicity protect a form of intellectual property that society deems to have some social utility.comedy iii productions,gary saderup,cal th,d.
ii.the rule applies to christoff appropriation causes of action 
although we find no published california case that has squarely addressed this issue,we conclude that the spr applies to the right of publicity.this conclusion is supported by the broad language of section,the broad application of the statute in the case law,and the history of the right of publicity.the spr,adopted in california in and codified in section,provides no person shall have more than one cause of action for damages for libel or slander or invasion of privacy or any other tort founded upon any single publication or exhibition or utterance,such as any one issue of a newspaper or book or magazine or any one presentation to any audience or any one broadcast over radio or television or any one exhibition of a motion picture.recovery in any action shall include all damages for any such tort suffered by the plaintiff in all jurisdictions.
by enacting the spr,the legislature sought to resolve the potentially overwhelming number of lawsuits arising from a single defamatory statement and the potentially endless tolling of the statute of limitations.the definition of defamation permitted a separate cause of action for each publication of a statement which occurred each time the statement was communicated to a third person who understood its defamatory meaning.shively bozanich,supra,cal th at,d.to avoid unwieldy litigation requiring application of the laws of multiple jurisdictions based on each separate publication,the spr creates a legal fiction.it deems one issue of a publication to be one single publication regardless of whether an issue consists of one copy,one million,or more.shively,supra,cal th at,d.
a.the plain language of section 
although the tort of defamation provided the catalyst for the spr,the spr is broadly worded.by its plain language,the statute applies to causes of action for invasion of privacy and any other tort founded upon any single publication or exhibition or utterance.at the time the spr was adopted,the common law tort of appropriation was classified as an invasion of privacy.in fairfield american photocopy.d,the defendant improperly used the plaintiff name in an advertisement for a photocopy machine.the court explained that the exploitation of another personality for commercial purposes constitutes one of the most flagrant and common means of invasion of privacy.id.at.the desire of a business concern for publicity or advertising does not justify its invasion of the right of privacy.id.at.even though the tort of appropriation is now more commonly referred to as a right of publicity,its initial classification as a right of privacy places it squarely within the ambit of the spr,which was enacted in.
but even if the tort of appropriation were not understood as an invasion of privacy at the time the spr was enacted,it falls within the any other tort language of the spr.relying on this broad language,courts have held the spr applies to many different types of lawsuits,including personal injury,civil rights,fraud and deceit.time warner,th,d strick superior court d.pitts city of kankakee,cir.as explained in khaury playboy publications,a case applying a similar new york statute it would appear that the rule spr,then,is not aimed at the particular tort alleged,but rather at the manner in which the tort is executed.if the wrong arises out of a mass communication,then whether it sounds in defamation or statutory invasion of privacy,the same considerations should apply.id.at.when the legislature inserted the clause or any other tort it is presumed to have meant exactly what it said.baugh cbs.
use of the phrase any other tort signals the legislature intended broad application of the spr.section and the common law tort of appropriation necessarily include publications as each requires the use of another person name,likeness,voice,or signature.to violate section,the person name or likeness must be used for purposes of advertising or selling,or soliciting purchases of,products,merchandise,goods or services,subd.a.
the policies underlying the spr apply to this case.just as in a defamation case,the litigation would have become unwieldy and potentially endless with every coffee can,print,television,and electronic advertisement generating a separate cause of action.indeed,christoff alleges in his complaint,based upon the amount of product in the stream of commerce,the use of plaintiff picture is likely to continue indefinitely.with indefinite use,there could be indefinite litigation.that is exactly the scenario the spr was designed to avoid.
christoff arguments that the spr is inapplicable to his appropriation causes of action 
as explained above,the plain language of section indicates that it applies to christoff appropriation causes of action.christoff vigorously challenges this conclusion,but his arguments on the inapplicability of the spr are not persuasive.first,he argues his claim is not one based upon a communicative act,such as a publication,exhibition or utterance,as envisioned by the spr.this argument is easily disposed of given that christoff entire case is based on his claim that nestlé used his image for the purpose of advertising,selling soliciting purchases of nestlé products.the purpose of advertising is to persuade a consumer to purchase a particular product eastwood superior court d,which by definition is a communicative act.this is not a case where the alleged wrong constitutes a physical intrusion or some other noncommunication based tort.see baugh cbs,supra.at.
second,christoff attempts to distinguish the coffee can from the newspaper,book or magazine,radio,television,or movie specifically referred to in the spr.yet,he also argues that his image was used in television commercials,on the internet,and in newspaper and magazine advertisements.his expert testified that christoff was entitled to compensation for the use of his image in virtually all kinds of media that existed.
aside from the fact that this case does involve the use of christoff image in newspapers and magazines,the spr is not limited to newspapers,books,magazines,radio,television,and movies.for example,it has been applied to the internet.traditional cat,gilbreath th,d.t he need to protect web publishers from almost perpetual liability for statements they make available to the hundreds of millions of people who have access to the internet is greater even than the need to protect the publishers of conventional hard copy newspapers,magazines and books.id.at,d.the spr use of the phrase such as indicates that the enumerated list of mediums is not exclusive but exemplary.
third,christoff makes much of the distinction between the right of privacy and the right of publicity,emphasizing that each protects a distinct interest.the right of privacy protects from damage to a person feelings based on an unauthorized use,and,what is now referred to as the right of publicity protects the person commercial value in his or her identity.knb enterprises matthews,supra,th at,d.but,as explained above,at the time the spr was adopted,the legislature expressly stated the spr applied to the invasion of privacy,which included the tort of appropriation.
in any event,reliance on the type of damage for the application of the spr is misplaced as explained in long walt disney th,d.in that case,the plaintiffs argued that the use of their likeness on a television program was not subject to the spr because the claimed damages were based on emotional distress and not the loss of their reputation.long walt disney,supra,th at,d.the court instead focused on the manner the tort was committed plaintiffs do not,and can not,dispute that each of the claims before the court sounds in tort and arises from the broadcasts and related internet activity.id.at,d.the spr is not aimed at the particular tort alleged,but rather at the manner in which the tort is executed.strick superior court,supra,d at.here,the alleged wrong is the mass publication of christoff likeness.that manner of violating section falls within the ambit of the spr.
strick superior court,supra,d.is equally unhelpful to christoff.while the court found the harm alleged for causes of action for fraud and deceit was identical to the harm caused by libel,it did not hold that the spr applies only where the injury is to a person reputation.instead,it held the petitioners could not circumvent the spr by stylizing their claims as fraud and deceit when the loss was identical to that for libel.strick superior court,supra,d at.by stating that the spr applied to the causes of action for fraud and deceit because the harm was identical to that for libel,the court did not decide whether the spr could also apply when different damages were alleged.
next,christoff points out that when the legislature enacted section,it proposed but abandoned a modification to section to include expressly an advertisement,circular or solicitation within the spr.assem.bill reg.sess.as amended june.this observation does not advance christoff contentions.the ambiguity in the legislative history does not elucidate whether the legislature determined that the broad language of the spr did not require further enumeration or specifically rejected the notion that an advertisement,circular,and solicitation should be included within the ambit of the spr.the abandonment of this proposed legislation therefore does not assist in interpreting the language of the spr.the unpassed bill supports contrary inferences and therefore provides no guidance in interpreting the spr.the light shed by such unadopted proposals is too dim to pierce statutory obscurities.as evidence of legislative intent they have little value.citations.grupe development superior court cal th,d.
iii.the implications of applying the spr to christoff appropriation causes of action 
the trial court concluded that the spr was inapplicable to christoff appropriation causes of action.because we conclude the spr does apply,we must further consider whether the discovery rule is applicable the meaning of the term republication as it is used in the context of the spr,and what statute of limitations governs.
a.the discovery rule 
even though section does not make reference to the accrual date of a cause of action,where the spr applies,a cause of action has been held to accrue from the date of the first general distribution of the publication to the public.shively,supra,cal th at,d.the discovery rule is an equitable principle,which protects a plaintiff from an earlier accrual of a cause of action.moreno sanchez th,d.when the discovery rule applies,a cause of action accrues when the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered all the facts essential to his cause of action.ibid.once it found the spr inapplicable,there was no need for the trial court here to have considered the intersection of the spr and the discovery rule.the trial court simply applied the discovery rule and asked the jury to consider when christoff discovered the use of his likeness.
the joint jury instructions included the following instruction the court has determined that the statute of limitations for christoff claims under civil code section is two years.christoff filed his complaint on february,meaning that he may claim damages that took place at any time on or after february.in addition,if you find that the rule of delayed discovery applies,then christoff may also seek damages that took place from the time nestlé usa first used his image.in order to establish a delayed discovery christoff bears the burden of proving that a prior to his discovery of the facts he did not previously suspect,or should have suspected,that his photograph was on the taster choice label and b he had no notice or information of circumstances which would have put a reasonable person on inquiry despite the exercise of reasonable diligence that his photograph was on the taster choice label.
the jury concluded christoff did not know and he should not have known or suspected by exercising reasonable diligence,that his photograph or likeness was being used by defendant for commercial purposes before june.
shively bozanich cal th 
in shively,the supreme court considered the intersection of the spr and the discovery rule in the context of a defamation cause of action.where a defamation is made public,u niform authority establishes that the discovery rule does not apply to delay the accrual of a cause of action for a defamation contained in such a publication.shively,supra,cal th at,d.under the rule,with respect to the statute of limitations,publication generally is said to occur on the first general distribution of the publication to the public.id.at,d,see also cusano klein cir,applying the rule to a claim for infringement of the right of publicity.a pplication of the discovery rule would undermine the protection provided by the rule.shively,supra,cal th at,d.
however,that general rule is not absolute.i n certain circumstances it may be appropriate to apply the discovery rule to delay the accrual of a cause of action for defamation or to impose an equitable estoppel against defendants who assert the defense after the limitations period has expired.shively,supra,cal th at,d.the discovery rule has been applied when the defamatory statement is hidden from view as,for example,in a personnel file that generally can not be inspected by the plaintiff.the rationales offered in support of the application of the discovery rule to defamation cases are equitable in nature.the cases turn upon the circumstances in which the defamatory statement is made and frequently involve a defamatory writing that has been kept in a place to which the plaintiff has no access or cause to seek access.id.at,d.the plaintiff inability to discover the libel when it first was published and placed in a confidential file would render unjust any holding that the cause of action accrued and the period of limitations commenced when the writing was placed in the file.ibid.
shively cites manguso oceanside unified school dist.d.as an example of this principle.shively,supra,cal th at,d.in manguso oceanside unified school,supra,d at,the court held that the discovery rule applied to a defamation cause of action brought by a school teacher against a school principal for libel based on a letter he caused to have placed in her permanent personnel file.ibid.thus,the application of the discovery rule differs depending on whether the defamation was hidden from view or made in a public document.ibid see also long walt disney,supra,th at,d mcguiness motor trend magazine d,fn.although shively explains the general incompatibility of the rule and the discovery rule,it sanctions the application of the discovery rule under narrow circumstances.
ii.application of shively to a cause of action for appropriation 
the trial court application of the discovery rule flowed logically from its decision that the spr did not apply to christoff appropriation causes of action.however,because we conclude that the spr is applicable,as explained in shively,the discovery rule generally does not apply.nevertheless,just as in the defamation context,in certain circumstances it may be appropriate to apply the discovery rule to delay the accrual of a cause of action or to impose an equitable estoppel against defendants who assert the defense after the limitations period has expired.shively,supra,cal th at,d.
although generally an advertising or marketing campaign is not confidential,the record does not indicate the initial distribution or use of christoff likeness.the record does not show whether christoff lacked a meaningful ability to discover the use of his likeness.see shively,supra,cal th at,d,the plaintiff inability to discover the libel when it first was published and placed in a confidential file would render unjust any holding that the cause of action accrued and the period of limitations commenced when the writing was placed in the file.christoff did not argue that nestlé hindered his discovery of the use of his likeness.bernson industries cal th,d,under the discovery rule,however,the date of accrual may be delayed where the defendant actions hinder plaintiff discovery of the defamatory matter.but there was no basis for christoff to provide evidence of nestlé conduct,because the trial court concluded the discovery rule applied absent such evidence.
if a reasonable person in christoff position had a meaningful ability to discover the violation,applying the discovery rule would violate the principal policy that underlies the rule.long walt disney,supra,th at,d.in contrast,if a reasonable person in christoff position had no meaningful opportunity to discover the violation,it would be unfair to hold that the cause of action accrued when the covert publication occurred.see shively,supra,cal th at,d.we can not resolve this question on appeal because the jury was asked to apply an incorrect standard 
republication as used in connection with the spr 
the spr restricts to a single cause of action all damages founded upon a single publication.a single publication is distinguished from a republication.if a defendant republishes material,the protection under the spr does not apply.kanarek bugliosi d.a new edition or new issue constitutes a new publication giving rise to a separate cause of action.shively,supra,cal th at,fn,d.thus,the distinction between a single publication and a republication becomes critical in assessing the date of the accrual of a cause of action.the trial court dodged the republication quagmire by concluding the spr was inapplicable.
christoff argues that the following constitute republications labels on jars for eight different flavors and one variety pack labels on different size jars variation in label design showing different amounts of christoff face variation on other aspects of the label labels in each of foreign countries use in magazines,newspapers,distributed coupons,and ads by vendors television advertisements web site advertisements downloads as screen saver or post it note or recipe and bus,subway,and rapid transit advertisements in chicago,new york and san francisco.
definitions of republication 
the meaning of the term republication is critical to assessing whether christoff is limited to one cause of action or can assert multiple causes of action for the use of his likeness.application of the term republication occurs in various mediums and contexts.under california law,it is clear that the publication of a paperback edition of a book previously published in hardback constitutes a republication.kanarek bugliosi,supra,d.the paperback version was undoubtedly intended to and did reach a new group of readers.ibid.other courts also have held that publishing a book in paperback form constitutes a republication of a hardback book.rinaldi viking penguin,misc d.viking decision to release the abuse of power in paperback was a conscious attempt to reach an entirely new market of readers through a different format at a different price.ibid.in addition,viking made other alterations to the form including changing the name of the publisher,the date of publication and the copyright page.id.at.the books had been substantially modified when they were released at a subsequent date in paperback form.id.at.
in california,different editions of a newspaper constitute a single publication.belli roberts brothers furs d.in contrast,a federal district court in the district of columbia stated that subsequent publications of the same material,such as new editions of a newspaper or book,or rebroadcast of a television program,are new publications triggering a new cause of action and commencing a new limitations period.foretich glamour.another court has held that a syndicated column is a single integrated publication regardless of the number of newspapers that carry it.givens quinn.
with respect to television shows,courts have reached different conclusions regarding the meaning of a republication.a new york court has held the rebroadcast of a television show constitutes a republication,even where there are no changes to the content of the show.lehman discovery communications,d.the court reasoned as follows like a publication of the same defamatory statement in both a morning and evening editions of a newspaper,a rebroadcast of a television show is intended to reach a new audience and is therefore an additional communication.id.at.lehman conflicts with the holding of a federal court applying michigan law.that court concluded that a rerun of the oprah winfrey show did not constitute a republication.nichols moore d.nichols also held that the release of a film on dvd constitutes a republication.id.at.the dvd contained special features not included in the movie theatre run and was intended to reach a new audience.id.at.
courts consistently have applied the spr to the dissemination of libel over the internet and have considered the meaning of republication in that context.the modification to a web site does not constitute a republication.firth state of new york.the mere addition of unrelated information to a web site can not be equated with the repetition of defamatory matter in a separately published edition of a book or newspaper ibid.a modification that did not amount to a substantive change to a web site did not constitute a republication.atkinson mclaughlin d.accessing a comment on a subscription only web site does not constitute a republication.rare moshe zwiebel diamond misc d.updates to a web site do not constitute a republication where the updates do not alter the substance.churchill state.however,under the federal privacy act,the publication of the same information under a different url address constitutes a separate violation.oja army corps of engineers cir.
cases discussing advertising,more analogous to the present case,are fewer in number.in nelson working class,civ.hb,wl,the district court applied the spr and found that the plaintiffs suit,filed two years after a commercial first aired,was untimely regardless of the number of times the commercial played.in zoll jordache enterprises,civ.csh,wl,the court found the plaintiff lawsuit to be barred even though jordache repeatedly used her image,allegedly without her authorization,to advertise jordache jeans.the commercial first aired in and then was in.t he fact that a subsequent publication is the product of a conscious decision to republish and is intended to reach a new audience is but one of a number of factors considered in determining whether a subsequent publication constitutes a republication.zoll jordache enterprises,supra,wl at.because there was no modification to the original publication,the court found it did not constitute a republication.
blair nevada landing partnership d,is the case most similar to the present one.blair photograph was used as part of an advertising campaign by the buckingham steakhouse,his employer.his photo was used in brochures,on signs,billboards,menus,calendars and postcards.id.at.it also appeared on the steakhouse web site.ibid.when blair left his employment,he requested the restaurant stop using his photo in its promotional materials.
the court applied the spr to blair claim for common law and statutory appropriation of one likeness.the court found the multiple uses of the picture to constitute a single act.blair nevada landing partnership,supra,d at.the plaintiff picture,although it was displayed via several mediums over a period of time,was used for a single purpose,to advertise the buckingham steakhouse,and targeted a single audience,casino patrons.ibid.furthermore,during that time from to,the plaintiff image remained constant and was not significantly altered to reach a new audience.a single photograph was used from the photo shoot.although the selected photograph was displayed via several mediums,such as billboards,brochures,flyers,menus,calendars,and postcards,it was displayed predominately within the casino and to existing casino customers.id.at.
ii.analysis of republication in this case 
although the case law is not entirely consistent,the key factors in establishing a republication include that the republication was directed to a new,different audience and that the original publication was modified.here,to demonstrate a republication,christoff would have to show,for example,that there was some modification to the presentation of his likeness or that it was intended to reach a new audience.
upon remand,the trial court must determine whether there is sufficient evidence of republication to submit the issue to the jury.while christoff image was used in television advertisements,web site advertisements,newspaper coupons,and rapid transit advertisements,ultimately it is a factual issue whether these uses were part of an original mass marketing campaign or part of incremental publications designed to appeal to different audiences.if,for example,nestlé introduced christoff image simultaneously throughout the country and internationally,this case would be similar to blair,in which a single audience was targeted.on the other hand,if nestlé used christoff image only in one state,followed by another,there may be a describable difference in the audience sufficient to constitute a republication.the issue can not be resolved based on the record on appeal.the examples are illustrative,not exhaustive as the resolution of the issue will depend on evidence presented by the parties upon remand.
similarly,variations in the use of christoff image would be relevant to the republication.the record does reveal some modifications to the christoff image as used by nestle.a modification to the size of the jar is appears less likely to constitute a republication.more likely is the l atinized photograph used on cans of coffee sold in mexico differs from the original image of christoff used by nestlé.the l atinized image includes more of christoff face and alters his face by adding sideburns and darkening his complexion.however,because the parties did not have an opportunity to develop these issues in the trial court,we decline to address them at this stage of the proceedings.
statute of limitations 
both the spr and the republication issues implicate the statute of limitations.the parties dispute the applicable statutory period,an issue complicated by the initial understanding of the appropriation of one likeness as an invasion of privacy and the current understanding of that tort as the right to publicity.nestlé argues that the statute of limitations in code of civil procedure section is applicable.christoff and the trial court instead applied the statute in code of civil procedure section.
in johnson harcourt,brace,jovanovich,d.johnson,the court held the statute of limitations in former code of civil procedure section,subdivision applied to a section cause of action.specifically,johnson concluded the statute of limitations for injury to one caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another,was applicable to a section claim.former code civ.proc,subd.the rationale for this limitations period was that it has repeatedly been held that this clause was intended to embrace therein all infringements of personal rights as distinguished from property rights.citations.one right to privacy is patently such a personal right.cain state farm mut.auto.ins.d.the johnson court clearly understood that t he right of privacy is a purely personal one,fashioned to protect an individual solitude.johnson,supra,d at,fn.
however,section is now understood as securing a proprietary interest,rather than an invasion of privacy.knb enterprises matthews,supra,th at,d the right of publicity has come to be recognized as distinct from the right of privacy mccarthy,the right of publicity and privacy ed,the courts have uniformly held that the right of publicity is a property right.it is an economic right.winter dc comics cal th,d.
code of civil procedure section has been held to apply to torts protecting property rights.barton new united motor manufacturing th,d.therefore,the rationale of johnson made sense at the time it was decided.in keeping with the right of publicity as a protection of a property interest,not a personal interest,christoff is not seeking damages for injury to his personal dignity but instead for the commercial use of his likeness.we hold the limitations period in code of civil procedure section is applicable 
iv.section requires a knowing use of a plaintiff name,voice,signature,photograph,or likeness regardless whether the plaintiff is a celebrity 
nestlé argues that section is inapplicable to this case because it did not knowingly use christoff likeness and because christoff is not a celebrity.for reasons we explain,we reject both arguments.
section provides in pertinent part any person who knowingly uses another name,voice,signature,photograph,or likeness,in any manner,on or in products,merchandise,or goods,or for purposes of advertising or selling,or soliciting purchases of,products,merchandise,goods or services,without such person prior consent,or,in the case of a minor,the prior consent of his parent or legal guardian,shall be liable for any damages sustained by the person or persons injured as a result thereof,subd.a,italics added.nestlé incorrectly argues that christoff can not recover under this statute because he did not show nestlé knew it lacked his consent or that he was a celebrity.
knowing use 
at common law,a cause of action for appropriation of name or likeness consisted of the following elements the defendant use of the plaintiff identity the appropriation of plaintiff name or likeness to defendant advantage,commercially or otherwise lack of consent and resulting injury.eastwood superior court,supra,d at.the statutory cause of action under section has the additional elements of knowing use and for purposes of advertising or solicitation of purchases.eastwood superior court,supra,d at.see also downing abercrombie fitch,supra,at discussing.thus the modification from the common law cause of action was to add the requirement of a knowing use,not a knowing use without consent.
nestlé argues there was no violation because it did not knowingly use christoff likeness without his consent.nestlé construction is inconsistent with the plain language of section and would lead to an absurd result.a defendant would always benefit from a failure to investigate,as in this case,where nestlé counsel argued to the jury as follows steele said if i could do it again,sure,i would try a little harder.maybe i would look for a writing.maybe i would try to call somebody.in this case,nestlé knowingly used christoff image.they chose him because of his distinguished look and because he would provide continuity with taster.christoff was not required to also show that steele or nestlé had actual knowledge he did not consent to the use of his likeness.
celebrity status 
nestlé second misconstruction of section is its claim that the statute limits the remedy of profits to a celebrity plaintiff.section applies whenever any person knowingly uses another likeness,subd.a.although the injury to the celebrity and the noncelebrity might differ,section does not require the plaintiff to be a celebrity in order to recover damages,including actual damages and profits.knb enterprises matthews,supra,th at,d.t he appropriation of the identity of a relatively unknown person may result in economic injury or may itself create economic value in what was previously valueless.motschenbacher reynolds tobacco company,supra,at,fn.
to recover profits under section,christoff must show that the profits were attributable to the use of his likeness 
nestlé argues that the record lacks substantial evidence to support the over million dollar profits award.resolving this issue requires a close reading of the language of section.section allows the recovery of profits from the unauthorized use that are attributable to the use and are not taken into account in computing the actual damages,subd.a.nestlé argues that christoff failed to provide substantial evidence of profits attributable to him.christoff responds that the testimony of his expert,peter sealy,provides ample evidence to support the verdict.we first summarize sealy testimony and then discuss the parties arguments.
sealy testimony 
peter sealy,an adjunct professor of marketing at the university of california at berkeley haas school of business and visiting professor at stanford university,testified to the following.the icon of the taster on the taster choice instant coffee label is a visual cue that becomes a link back to the product,a way to further identify the product.the taster is a key visual that is a point of continuity for probably multiple variations of taster choice,decaffeinated,different flavors,et cetera.the icon constitutes a unique visual approximation of the promise of the brand.great taste.it a visualization of a taster making a choice and a validation that a taster would choose this particular instant coffee.
the picture of christoff is a handsome male who is distinctive.the use of a human face is important based on our history as,when we were looking for food in the plains of africa.our eye is attracted most immediately to two human face or the shape of an animal.
sealy attributed percent of the sales of taster choice to the logo taster choice,and five to percent to the icon.the remaining forty percent is the shape of the jar,the shape of the label,the predominant color red,the smoother taste richer flavor promise,the weight of the product,a hundred percent pure coffee.
sealy opinion was that the taster can be attributed to percent of the sales.that is what he would value that icon,were i the marketing manager for the taster choice unit of nestlé.i believe the icon,if you took that off,you would have lost ten percent of the sales of taster choice,whatever that might have been.
on sealy acknowledged that he was not testifying it is christoff,the human being,who is responsible for ten percent of any sales but instead that it is the image of the taster which has become the icon that is responsible for the percent of the sales.i f you took that icon off the package during the time he was on the package,i think you would lose ten percent of the sales of taster choice.sealy further acknowledged the icon was a functional illustration of a person enjoying a cup of coffee.
sufficiency of the evidence of profits 
sealy testimony indicates five to percent of profits were attributable to the icon.this testimony would constitute substantial evidence that the profits were attributable to christoff,as required by section,only if christoff was the icon as he argues.
cases distinguishing a violation of the copyright act from a section cause of action show the narrow,but critical,distinction between christoff the person and the icon that contained christoff picture.the copyright act protects the photograph and section protects the identity or persona of an individual.downing abercrombie fitch,supra,at.to argue that the photograph is identical with the person is to confuse illusion and illustration with reality.ibid.the value for purposes of a section claim that christoff gave is the value of his identity or persona.the right of publicity protects the intangible proprietary interest in the commercial value in one identity.lugosi,supra,cal d at,dis.opn.bird,guglielmi productions cal d,conc.opn.bird see also mccarthy,the rights of publicity and privacy,supra,rest d unfair competition,com.d,the right of publicity protects the commercial value of a person identity.the subject of a section claim is the person likeness,even where such likeness is embodied in a photograph.knb enterprises matthews,supra,th at,d.
it follows that the profits attributable to christoff flow from his ability based on his identity or persona to attract sales.the critical question is christoff ability to attract the attention and evoke a desired response in a particular consumer audience.that response is a kind of good will or recognition value generated by that person.citations.lugosi,supra,cal d at,dis.opn.of bird,eastwood superior court d.often considerable money,time and energy are needed to develop the ability in a person name or likeness to attract attention and evoke a desired response in a particular consumer market.in contrast,profits resulting solely from the strategic decision to place an icon of a taster on the taster choice label are not attributable to christoff.the icon with the image of a handsome man existed before and after christoff likeness was used.
this is not to say that christoff photograph did not improve nestlé profits during his tenure as the taster.even though images may be fungible,nestlé may still gain a commercial advantage from the use of christoff.ainsworth century supply d.it may be that the generic nature of christoff image helped nestlé appeal to the generic consumer and entice consumers to purchase taster choice.but,in order to recover profits on this basis,christoff must present such evidence.
sealy provided no evidence that christoff specific characteristics even if generic created a value in the icon of the taster.sealy acknowledgement,albeit on,that christoff,the person,was not responsible for percent of the profits shows sealy was relying on the illustration,not the identity or persona of christoff.it is the identity or persona that is the crux of an appropriation claim and that is the basis for the disgorgement of profits from the misappropriator.
however,if on retrial,christoff is able to carry the initial burden of demonstrating that some portion of nestlé profits was attributable to the use of his likeness,nestlé then would bear the burden of disentangling the contribution of the various other factors.lugosi,supra,cal d at,dis.opn.bird.t he resulting allocation must favor the plaintiffs in every reasonable chance of error.ibid.the profits provision of section is patterned after statutes governing copyright infringement that require defendants must be content to accept much of the embarrassment resulting from mingling the plaintiffs property with their own.sheldon pictures cir,see also sygma photo news,high society magazine cir.
vi.the million qunatum meruit award and the attorney fees must be reversed 
nestlé argues that the quantum meruit recovery of must be limited to the value of the services rendered and not the value of the benefit conferred.christoff does not dispute that the quantum meruit award must be reduced to,the amount of actual damages found by the jury.
as the parties agree,the recovery on a quantum meruit claim is based on the value of the services conferred,not the value of the benefit.maglica maglica th,d.for that reason it can not include the profits and must be reduced.however,contrary to christoff argument,the award also must be reversed.the basis of this award,which is part of each cause of action,is the multiple use of christoff image over a period,as that was the only evidence christoff presented.the jury was able to reach this conclusion because the trial court failed to recognize the applicability of the spr and gave incorrect instructions on the applicability of the discovery rule.
the attorney fees award,based on the entry of a judgment in christoff favor on the section cause of action,must also be reversed.if christoff prevails on remand,he is entitled to attorney fees under section,subdivision a.
vii.conclusion 
once the trial court found that the spr did not apply,the jury was not properly instructed on several issues it needed to decide.in a retrial,the trier of fact must consider whether a reasonable person in christoff position had a meaningful ability to discover the use of his likeness and whether any republications occurred within the limitations period.with respect to each republication prior to two years before the filing of the complaint,the trier of fact must consider whether a reasonable person in christoff position had a meaningful ability to discover the use of his likeness on that occasion.
christoff is not required to show that nestlé knew it lacked his consent when it used his image or that he was a celebrity.to recover profits under section,christoff is required to provide some evidence that the profits were attributable to the use of his identity or persona.if he does,the burden then shifts to nestlé to show that the percentage of its profits that are not attributable to the use of christoff persona.
disposition 
the judgment is reversed.the order awarding attorney fees is reversed.the case is remanded to the trial court for retrial.each party to bear his or its own costs on appeal.
civil code section provides in pertinent part any person who knowingly uses another name,voice,signature,photograph,or likeness,in any manner,on or in products,merchandise,or goods,or for purposes of advertising or selling,or soliciting purchases of,products,merchandise,goods,or services without such person prior consent shall be liable for any damages sustained by the person or persons injured as a result thereof.in addition,in any action brought under this section,the person who violated the section shall be liable to the injured party or parties in an amount equal to the greater of seven hundred fifty dollars or the actual damages suffered by him or her as a result of the unauthorized use,and any profits from the unauthorized use that are attributable to the use and are not taken into account in computing the actual damages.unless otherwise indicated,undesignated statutory citations are to the civil code.
nestle canada is a corporation affiliated with but separate from respondent and is not a party to this appeal.
nestlé challenged the date christoff knew or should have known of the use of his likeness.however,the jury found that he neither knew nor should have discovered it prior to finding the coffee jar in the rite aid store.
hunter further explained his figure as follows for eight different types of coffee over a period totaling for electronic media billboards at times six years for a total of one year of transit ads at kiosks at for six years totaling brochures at for six years totaling point of purchase advertisements at a year for six years totaling.hunter assumed each of these uses existed based on information from christoff counsel.the remainder is for advertisement in foreign countries which totaled and which is also based on a time frame.
the court reserved judgment on the
