stanley and patricia stark appeal the district court order vacating in part an arbitration award granting them punitive damages.we reverse.
stanley and patricia are husband and wife and live near kansas city,missouri.in,in hopes of shoring up a failing business,the starks borrowed against their home and secured the loan with a mortgage.despite the infusion of funds,the business failed and in april the starks petitioned for bankruptcy protection.at about the same time,the starks lender sold the note,which was in default,to emc mortgage corporation making emc a debt collector under the provisions of the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa.in anticipation of foreclosure,the starks vacated the home and moved into an apartment across the street.the starks,however,remained in possession of legal title and did not abandon the home.in june,emc motion to lift the automatic stay was granted and it proceeded with foreclosure.
the starks were represented throughout the foreclosure and bankruptcy proceedings by attorney roy true who notified emc attorney,scott greenberg of sandberg,phoenix von gontard,that his representation of the starks extended beyond the bankruptcy proceedings.between october and march,despite letters from true advising emc he represented the starks and not to contact them directly,emc tried several times to deal directly with the starks.in april,the starks filed suit against emc and its attorneys alleging violations of the fdcpa.
emc moved to compel arbitration as required by the parties loan agreement,and the district court ordered the dispute submitted to arbitration.the order compelling arbitration is not at issue in this appeal.during the pendency of the arbitration,emc agent,without the starks consent,forcibly entered the home and posted a sign in the front window indicating the property has been secured and winterized.not for sale or rent.in case of emergency call american.the agent then contacted stark at her apartment,and emc contacted stark at work regarding the matter.further,on november,and january,emc wrote to the starks directly regarding insurance coverage on the home.in total,the starks testified emc contacted them by mail,telephone or in person at least ten times after being advised they were represented by counsel.
after these incidents,the starks moved to amend their complaint to include claims alleging intentional torts against emc and seeking punitive damages.emc opposed the motion arguing the arbitration agreement expressly precluded an award of punitive damages.the starks contended the limitation on punitive damages was unconscionable and unenforceable.after extensive briefing,the arbitrator concluded the limitation was ambiguous and construed the language against emc.the arbitrator noted the agreement purported to grant him all powers provided by law and then purported to deny the power to award punitive damages as to which borrower and lender expressly waive any right to claim to the fullest extent permitted by law.the arbitrator concluded,
in at least three places the stark sic are promised that they can seek all damages allowed by law,and then that promise is taken away.this is the keystone of an ambiguous contract,and the agreement is to be interpreted in their favor.as a matter of law they are not prohibited from seeking punitive damages from emc.
appellee app.at.
the arbitrator found emc violated the fdcpa and awarded the starks each in statutory damages,each in actual damages,in attorneys fees,and for the cost of the arbitration.the arbitrator found emc forcible entry into the premises reprehensible and outrageous and in total disregard of plaintiff sic legal rights and awarded in punitive damages against emc.id.app.at 
the starks moved to confirm the award,and emc moved to vacate the punitive damages award arguing the arbitration agreement expressly prohibited punitive damages.no other aspect of the award was challenged.the district court vacated the award of punitive damages,holding the agreement was unambiguous and not susceptible to the arbitrator interpretation.
on appeal,the starks contend the arbitrator acted within his authority in construing the contract and his finding of an ambiguity was not irrational.emc argues the district court order vacating the award of punitive damages should be affirmed.
