in his written description dominic claimed that around march,he and fant met after work for drinks at a country club.while they were at the club fant tried to unzip dominic pants and grab his crotch area.about one week later dominic,fant,and other members of the accounting department met for drinks.at that outing,fant offered the group the use of her parents van and her brother pornographic movies for a team building trip.dominic reported that after the rest of the group left,she asked if he wanted to rent a hotel room so she could tie him up and attack him.he also stated that fant brought him coffee,did unrequested favors for him,stopped by his office,called him up even though she had no business to discuss,and acted jealous when he spoke to other women.
after chism reviewed dominic claims,he set up a meeting to discuss the charges.at the meeting larry hoover,the company human resources manager,and chism agreed to investigate the charges and dominic gave them a list of people who could substantiate his claims.the next day hoover and chism met with fant to discuss dominic allegations.she denied all his claims.she was nevertheless sent home on paid leave,instructed not to contact anyone at the office,and was to remain home while the company investigated the charges.
as part of the company investigation,chism and hoover questioned each person on dominic list of employees who could substantiate his claims as well as all other workers in the departments headed by fant and dominic.chism and hoover were particularly concerned about what they considered the most serious allegations,that fant had unzipped dominic pants and suggested that they get a hotel room.a list of questions was prepared by chism and hoover to be asked of each interviewee.these questions included how is your job going how would you describe the work climate in your department how is your relationship with patricia fant does the department socialize outside work did you attend an event at a bar with the group around march tell us about that experience.has the group been planning a team building trip have you ever observed any conduct that you thought was inappropriate in the department the employees who were interviewed did not confirm dominic allegations,except for his claims that fant stopped by his desk,brought him coffee,and sometimes acted jealous when he interacted with other women.on may chism and hoover again met with dominic at the plant and with fant offsite to ask some follow up questions.
later in the day on may,chism and hoover also contacted claude kelly,a vice president of pentair which was the corporate owner of the company.kelly oversaw the human resources area for pentair.after he heard about the results of the investigation by chism and hoover,he traveled to decatur from his office in jackson,tennessee to discuss the matter with chism,hoover,and dominic.chism,hoover,and kelly also consulted pentair attorney several times to ensure that their investigation met all legal requirements.management agreed that there were not grounds to terminate fant even though she had acted inappropriately by engaging in bar talk with employees she supervised.
kelly and hoover met again with dominic on may.they told him that their investigation had not substantiated the most serious allegations and that fant would be returning to work.although fant would remain in her position as dominic supervisor,they explained that the accounting department would be required to meet daily as a group to minimize one on one communication between fant and dominic.they encouraged dominic to report any incidents of retaliation and gave him the rest of the day off with pay.kelly then met with the employees who reported to fant and dominic and asked them to make it as easy as possible for the two to work together.
kelly and hoover also met with fant on may she again denied the allegations.kelly told fant she would be allowed to return to work,but that she had acted unprofessionally and should refrain from socializing with employees in bars after work.they warned her that she would be terminated if she retaliated against dominic.they also gave fant a letter explaining the conditions of her return and listing specific examples of what could be considered retaliation.these examples included dramatic changes to dominic work assignments,threats of termination,and inappropriate discipline of him.fant signed the letter and chism followed up with three members of the department on may to gauge the effectiveness of the daily meetings and to ask them if they had noticed any behavior by fant toward dominic that could have been retaliatory.none of the employees reported any inappropriate behavior.dominic did not complain of any further sexual harassment after the company investigation.
soon after dominic and fant began working together again,dominic sent management a series of emails alleging retaliation by fant.he claimed fant criticized his work publicly,gave him too much work,assigned him busywork,tried to sabotage his work,and gave him false instructions.he also alleged that fant had given him an order that would have caused him to violate the act he did not give any details about her request or explain why it would be illegal,however.dominic complained that someone had deleted work after he completed it,and he began asking for technical support to backup his work.chism and hoover met with dominic on may,the same day they received his first email alleging retaliation.they asked him for more details because of the conclusory nature of some of his claims.dominic refused to provide further details,claiming attorney client privilege.after this meeting,management spoke to fant about dominic complaints.she denied all allegations and submitted a written memorandum on may responding to each of dominic allegations.
on may dominic sent another email alleging that fant had been rude and obnoxious toward him,had visited him in his cubicle for minutes which had made him uncomfortable,and had interrupted one of his telephone calls.he claimed that fant embarrassed him in front of coworkers by publicly criticizing his work,harassed him about a trainee work,and told lies about him to other employees.he also complained that hoover had raised his voice in a recent meeting.chism and kelly interviewed other employees in the departments of fant and dominic to see if they had noticed any retaliation and reviewed fant written response denying dominic claims of retaliation.they concluded that dominic disagreed with fant management style,but that fant had not been retaliating against him.they reported their findings to dominic and asked him for more details about fant retaliation,but he did not provide them.dominic then wrote a letter of complaint to the chief financial officer of pentair,tom dewitt,alleging its subsidiary was using irregular accounting
