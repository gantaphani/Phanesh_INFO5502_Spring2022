summary and holding 
in this case,we must decide whether a plaintiff who has private health care insurance in a personal injury case may recover,under the collateral source rule,economic damages for the amount of past medical expenses that her health care providers have billed,but which neither the plaintiff nor her health care insurer is obligated to pay because the providers have agreed,under contracts into which they have entered with the insurer,to payment in in an amount that is less than the amount the providers have billed.stated differently,is the difference hereafter referred to as the negotiated rate differential between the full amount of the medical providers bills,and the lesser amount paid by the private health care insurer in cash payments to the medical providers that the providers have agreed to accept as payment in full pursuant to their agreements with the insurer,a benefit within the meaning of the collateral source rule such that the plaintiff is entitled under that rule to recover the amount of the negotiated rate differential as part of her economic damages award 
in this personal injury action,plaintiff rebecca howell private health care insurance policy provided indemnity coverage for medical expenses she incurred for treatment of injuries she sustained in a vehicle accident caused by the negligent driving of an employee of defendant hamilton meats provisions,hamilton.howell appeals an order granting hamilton posttrial motion to reduce by the jury special verdict award for her past medical expenses from,which was the full amount of her medical bills,to,the amount her medical providers scripps memorial hospital encinitas scripps and core orthopedic medical center core accepted as payment in full from howell health care insurer,pacificare ppo pacificare.howell contends the order should be reversed because the reduction of the jury award for her past medical expenses violates the collateral source rule,which as we shall discuss more fully,post generally bars at trial in a personal injury case evidence of compensation the plaintiff has received for her injuries from a source wholly independent of the defendant tortfeasor and hamilton motion was procedurally improper and lacked sufficient evidence to support the claimed reduction.
we hold that in a personal injury case in which the plaintiff has private health care insurance,the negotiated rate differential is a benefit within the meaning of the collateral source rule,and thus the plaintiff may recover the amount of that differential as part of her recovery of economic damages for the past medical expenses she incurred for care and treatment of her injuries.applying this holding to the instant case,we conclude the court erred by granting hamilton postverdict motion to reduce the jury special verdict award for the medical expenses howell incurred.accordingly,we reverse the order.
factual background 
howell private health care insurance 
howell was seriously injured when the vehicle she was driving was struck by a truck driven by one of hamilton employees,who had negligently made an illegal across the lane in which howell was traveling.
at the time of the accident,howell had private health care insurance through pacificare.according to howell,pacificare agreed to indemnify her for any medical charges covered by her health plan in exchange for her premium payments,subject to her responsibility for deductibles and copayments and pacificare,as a regular part of its business practice,entered into contractual agreements with hospitals and other health care providers,including scripps and core,to satisfy any bills incurred by pacificare plan members who obtained care from those providers.
howell underwent two fusion spinal surgeries,as well as surgical procedures that took bone from her hip in an attempt to repair her neck and repaired the graft site on her hip.
howell financial responsibility agreements with her medical providers 
before she received treatment from scripps and core,howell executed written agreements in which she agreed to be financially responsible for all charges for the medical services they provided to her.specifically,howell agreement with scripps provided that in consideration for all services she received at a scripps facility,she was obligated to pay the facility usual and customary charges for such services.she expressly acknowledged in that agreement that she may be asked to execute a separate financial agreement for all amounts deemed to be her responsibility not covered under an insurance policy,health care service plan,managed care program or any third party payer not a party to this agreement.an assignment of benefits clause in the agreement provided that howell authorize d direct payment to the facility of any insurance or reimbursement from third party payers otherwise payable to or on behalf of the patient for services obtained at the facility,at a rate not to exceed the facility usual and customary charges.howell also agreed that she remain ed financially responsible for charges due,but not paid,under this assignment of benefits.
howell agreement with core provided it was her responsibility to pay any,or any other balance not paid for by her insurance.the agreement contained an assignment of benefits clause,under which she assign ed all medical surgical benefits,to include major medical benefits to which she was entitled,including medi care,private insurance,and other health plans to the provider.italics added.
procedural background 
hamilton motion in limine 
hamilton filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude at trial any evidence of,or reference to,those portions of howell medical bills that were not paid either by pacificare,or by howell as a copayment.hamilton argued that the decision in hanif housing authority d.hanif preclude d howell from seeking to recover as medical expenses amounts billed,but not ultimately paid by pacificare.
howell opposed the motion,arguing that under the collateral source rule articulated in helfend southern california rapid transit dist.cal d,helfend,the gross amount of all medical bills,not any lesser amount,should be presented to the jury.
following oral argument,the court denied hamilton in limine motion,ruling that howell was entitled to present at trial evidence of the full amount of the medical bills.the court,however,on a defense motion under hanif,supra,d,deferred to a posttrial proceeding the determination of whether the jury award of damages for howell past medical expenses should be reduced by any amount her medical providers may have compromised their billing.
trial and special jury verdict 
in their joint trial readiness conference report,the parties stipulated that the only issue to be determined at trial was the amount of damages howell suffered as a result of the accident caused by the admitted negligence of hamilton driver.the report and howell trial exhibit list identified as exhibit howell summary of plaintiff past medical expenses,which itemized medical expenses and indicated that those expenses totaled.her trial exhibit list also indicated that copies of the billing records were attached to that exhibit.
during the trial,timothy peppers,who performed howell surgeries,testified on her behalf.after peppers testified about his qualifications,howell injuries,and the medical treatment she received for those injuries,howell counsel showed him exhibit and the attached billing records.peppers testified that to the best of his knowledge the summary and billing records were a fair and reasonable representation of the medical billings.
howell husband,james michael vallee,also testified on her behalf.he indicated he had been keeping track of her medical bills,which to date totaled,as shown in exhibit.
the jury returned a special verdict that awarded to howell compensatory damages in the total amount of,which included for p ast economic loss,including medical expenses,for f uture economic loss,including medical expenses,for p ast non economic loss including physical pain,mental suffering,loss of enjoyment of life,disfigurement,physical impairment,inconvenience,grief,anxiety,humiliation,and emotional distress,and for f uture non economic loss.
hamilton motion to reduce the special verdict for past medical expenses 
before the court entered judgment,hamilton filed a motion under hanif,supra,d.and nishihama city and county of san francisco th,d nishihama seeking an order reducing the jury special verdict for howell past medical expenses by,from to.
in its motion papers,hamilton argued it was entitled to the claimed reduction under hanif and its progeny because the amount was neither incurred nor expended for the medical services that scripps and core provided to howell in this matter.
in support of its motion,hamilton submitted the declarations of mourence burris,scripps supervisor of customer service and collections from third parties,and betsy engstrom,who was employed in the accounting department of chmb,a billing company that provided medical billing services for core.in his declaration,burris indicated that scripps billing records showed that scripps waived or wrote off the sum of related to howell surgeries and related treatment as a result of the agreement with pacificare,no outstanding balance remained on howell account,and no further collection would be pursued.in her declaration,engstrom indicated that the entries in core bill related to the services core provided to howell showed that core had waived or written off the sum of pursuant to its agreement with pacificare,and no collection from howell would be pursued by either core or chmb for the written off amount.the burris and engstrom declarations thus showed the total amount of the negotiated rate differential written off by scripps and core was 
howell opposition to hamilton motion 
howell filed written opposition to the motion,contending that as she was not a beneficiary and she was suing a private defendant,she was permitted under the collateral source rule and the applicable measure of damages to recover the full amount of the reasonable cost or value of the past medical expenses paid or incurred as a result of her injuries and not just what her private health care insurer paid to her medical providers and under the collateral source rule,the court should exclude evidence of the benefits pacificare paid to howell health care providers.howell did not submit any evidence in support of her opposition to hamilton motion,nor did she file any evidentiary objections to the burris and engstrom declarations filed in support of hamilton motion.
the court entered a judgment on the special verdict against hamilton,awarding howell economic damages in the amount of,including the sum of for past medical expenses.
oral arguments regarding hamilton motion 
at the hearing on hamilton motion,which the court referred to as the hanif motion,howell counsel argued that unlike the plaintiff in nishihama,supra,th,d,howell disputed the amount that her health care insurer paid to the medical providers and objected that hamilton presentation of evidence of what howell insurer paid to those providers violated the collateral source rule.counsel also asserted that under hanif and nishihama,howell was entitled to recover for her past medical expenses the amount paid or incurred that,under parnell adventist health cal th,d,parnell,the amount incurred is the total amount of debt the patient incurs when she is treated by her medical providers,and,under the contracts between the private health insurer and the medical providers,what the insurer pays the medical providers includes both cash payments and any other consideration given in the form of benefits.
in support of the motion,hamilton attorney argued that nishihama was controlling howell medical bills had been discounted and thus she did not owe the full billed amount of about charged in the medical bills she incurred no debt for the negotiated rate differential because her bills were extinguished and her accounts had a zero balance,and she was not entitled under nishihama to recover the amount of the negotiated rate differential because that was the portion of the bills her insurer did not pay to scripps and core and the collateral source rule did not apply to that unpaid portion of the bills.
in rebuttal,howell counsel claimed the declarations submitted by burris and engstrom in support of hamilton motion were not evidence because they hearsay and stated he doubted they had ever actually seen the contracts between pacificare and howell medical providers.thus,he asserted,there was no competent evidence of what pacificare paid.counsel repeated his claim that the word paid meant more than just the cash payment and included the benefits the insurer paid to the medical providers.howell attorney also argued that to determine what the insurer paid to the providers would require a finding of fact,and such a finding would violate the collateral source rule,which precludes evidence of the amount paid by a collateral source.
order and notice of ruling 
the court granted hamilton motion after taking the matter under submission.the court minute order stated 
the court grants hamilton motion to reduce howell past medical specials to reflect the amount the medical providers accepted as payment in full of the medical bills.contrary to howell assertions,reaching this amount does not violate the collateral source doctrine,as evidence of how or why an amount less than the full bill was accepted as payment in full is unnecessary to make this determination.further,the trier of fact relied on evidence of the gross amount billed to howell,and thus had an accurate understanding of the severity of her injuries when it rendered its verdict.thus a motion to reduce past medical specials to the amount that was actually paid and considered payment in full does not violate the collateral source doctrine rather it embodies the principle that a plaintiff is entitled to recover an amount that would make her whole,but not overcompensate her 
hamilton counsel served and filed a notice of the court ruling,which included a copy of the court minute order,and indicated that the amount of the judgment was reduced by from to.howell thereafter appealed the order.
discussion 
ithe court postverdict reduction of the jury economic damages award for howell past medical expenses violated the collateral source rule 
howell argues the order reducing the jury award of damages for her past medical expenses from the full amount of the medical charges billed by scripps and core to the amount of the cash payments her health care insurer,pacificare,paid to those medical providers pursuant to its agreements with them,should be reversed because the reduction violates the collateral source rule.in support of this argument,howell asserts that when she executed the written financial agreements with scripps and core before she received treatment from them,she became financially liable for,and thus suffered compensable detriment by incurring,the full combined charges these medical providers billed for the services they provided.she also asserts she received two collateral source benefits from pacificare the reduced alternative rate cash payments in the total amount of that pacificare paid to scripps and core on her behalf and the negotiated rate differential,which she calls other contractual consideration,valued at,the remaining balance of the combined medical bills that pacificare paid to scripps and core on her behalf in the form of benefits and services such as preferred provider listings that are endorsements of,and advertisements for,the medical providers a guaranteed flow of patients who are members of pacificare health care plan and timely payments from pooled premiums that reduces the number of collection actions the providers must bring to collect payments from their patients.
together,she maintains,these two collateral source benefits of her private health insurance resulted in the satisfaction or discharge of the medical services debt she incurred in the full billed amount of and thus,under the collateral source rule articulated in helfend,supra,cal d,and the restatement second of torts,section,comment b discussed,post,hamilton should not have received the benefit of her thrift and foresight in procuring health insurance through the court postverdict reduction of the damages award for the past medical expenses she incurred as a result of the negligent driving of its employee.thus,she argues,the court order reducing the jury award of damages for her past medical expenses by negotiated rate differential that she,hamilton,and the trial court refer to as the balance or portion of her medical the collateral source rule.
we conclude the court order granting hamilton postverdict motion to reduce the jury special verdict award for the medical expenses that howell incurred,violated the collateral source rule.
applicable legal principles 
we begin by reviewing applicable california law regarding both the measure of damages in a personal injury case such as this and the collateral source rule.
measure of damages 
civil code section provides that f or the breach of an obligation not arising from contract,the measure of damages,except where otherwise expressly provided by this code,is the amount which will compensate for all the detriment proximately caused thereby,whether it could have been anticipated or not.italics added.section provides that e very person who suffers detriment from the unlawful act or omission of another,may recover from the person in fault a compensation therefor in money,which is called damages.italics added.section defines the term detriment as a loss or harm suffered in person or property.section,subdivision b defines the term economic damages as objectively verifiable monetary losses including medical expenses,loss of earnings,burial costs,loss of use of property,costs of repair or replacement,costs of obtaining substitute domestic services,loss of employment and loss of business or employment opportunities.italics added.
in conformity with these statutory provisions,the courts in california have held that the economic damages a plaintiff may recover in a personal injury action for past medical expenses are limited to a reasonable amount that was paid or incurred,whether by the plaintiff or a collateral source such as the plaintiff health care insurer,for reasonably required medical care and services that the plaintiff received and were attributable to the defendant tortious conduct.malone sierra railway cal,the correct measure of damage is the necessary and reasonable value of such services as may have been rendered him s uch reasonable sum,in other words,as has been necessarily expended or incurred in treating the injury hanif,supra,d at.a person injured by another tortious conduct is entitled to recover the reasonable value of medical care and services reasonably required and attributable to the tort see also katiuzhinsky perry th,d an injured plaintiff in a tort action can not recover more than the amount of medical expenses he or she paid or incurred,even if the reasonable value of those services might be a greater sum.caci to recover damages for past medical expenses,plaintiff must prove the reasonable cost of reasonably necessary medical care that has received.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts,the plaintiff is entitled to recover the reasonable cost of necessary medical and hospital services flavahan et,cal.practice guide personal injury the rutter group,plaintiff is entitled to recover the reasonable cost of past medical care and services necessitated by defendant tortious conduct.
the collateral source rule 
california has adopted the collateral source rule.lund san joaquin valley railroad cal th,d,lund.the california supreme court explained the collateral source rule in helfend,supra,cal d at page,
i f an injured party receives some compensation for his injuries from a source wholly independent of the tortfeasor,such payment should not be deducted from the damages which the plaintiff would otherwise collect from the tortfeasor.
the helfend court also explained that the collateral source rule embodies the venerable concept that a person who has invested years of insurance premiums to assure his medical care should receive the benefits of his thrift,and the tortfeasor should not garner the benefits of his victim providence.helfend,supra,cal d at.
similarly,the restatement second of torts,section,comment b,states i t is the position of the law that a benefit that is directed to the injured party should not be shifted so as to become a windfall for the tortfeasor.if the plaintiff was himself responsible for the benefit,as by maintaining his own insurance or by making advantageous employment arrangements,the law allows him to keep it for himself.
california has also adopted the closely related principle that,as a general rule,jurors should not be told that the plaintiff can recover compensation from a collateral source.lund,supra,cal th at,d.
payments made to,or benefits conferred on,the injured party by a source other than the defendant,someone acting on the defendant behalf,or someone who is or believes he is subject to the same tort liability,are known as benefits.rest d torts,com.
howell argument that the court order violates the collateral source rule by limiting her recovery for past medical expenses to the amount she and pacificare actually paid through cash payments to her medical providers is premised on her claim which amicus curiae cac defends in its brief that the negotiated rate balance of the medical bills in the amount of that howell asserts pacificare paid to scripps and core in the form of benefits and services is a collateral source benefit that pacificare conferred upon her.this claim,in turn,is premised on howell and cac assertion that,as a matter of law,all patients other than the medically indigent incur detriment in the form of financial liability for the full billed amount of their medical providers usual and customary charges.
howell did incur detriment in the form of personal financial liability when she executed written agreements in which she agreed to be financially responsible for all charges for the medical services they provided to her.in her written contract with scripps,howell agreed that,in consideration for all services she received at a scripps facility,she was obligated to pay the facility usual and customary charges for such services.in her written contract with core,she agreed that it was her responsibility to pay any balance not paid for by her insurance.
howell personal liability for scripps and core usual and customary charges for the medical services they provided was a form of compensable pecuniary detriment or loss within the meaning of sections,and,subdivision b.as a result of the admitted negligent driving of hamilton employee,she entered into the financial responsibility agreements with scripps and core and became contractually obligated to pay those incurred charges by means of her own cash payments,a collateral source such as her health care insurance,or a combination of the two.
we reject hamilton contentions that howell incurred no liability,and thus no detriment,for what hamilton calls the waived portion of her medical bills.the record shows that the total amount of medical care debt she incurred in this matter was,the combined total of scripps and core usual and customary charges for the medical care and services they provided to her.the record also shows that scripps and core agreed to accept from pacificare,pursuant to their agreements with pacificare,cash payments in the amount of as payment in full for those medical charges,so that the portion of howell liability to those providers that we have called the negotiated rate differential was deemed satisfied and thus not payable by howell,pacificare,or any other payor.
we conclude that the extinguishment of a portion of howell debt to scripps and core in the amount of the negotiated rate differential was a benefit to howell because she was no longer personally liable for that portion of the debt she personally incurred in obtaining medical treatment for her injuries.
we also conclude that this benefit to howell was a collateral source benefit within the meaning of the collateral source rule because it was conferred upon her as a direct result of her own thrift and foresight in procuring private health care insurance through pacificare,a source wholly independent of hamilton as the defendant in this case.under california collateral source rule paraphrasing helfend,supra,cal d at,howell,as a person who has invested insurance premiums to assure her medical care,should receive the benefits of her thrift and hamilton,as the party liable for howell injuries,should not garner the benefits of howell providence.the law allows howell to keep this collateral source benefit for herself because paraphrasing the restatement second of torts she was responsible for the benefit by maintaining her own insurance.rest d torts,com.b.
hamilton relies principally on hanif,supra,d,and nishihama,supra,th,d,as support for its contention that the court did not violate the collateral source rule by reducing the jury award of damages for howell past medical expenses to the negotiated combined amount of cash payments that scripps and core agreed to accept from pacificare.hamilton reliance on hanif and nishihama is misplaced.
in hanif,a personal injury action brought on behalf of a minor who was struck by an automobile on the defendant public housing authority property,the trial court awarded as special damages to the minor,who was a beneficiary,the reasonable value of the past medical services he received in the amount of that the medical providers billed to,even though that award exceeded the amount actually paid for those services.hanif,supra,d at.the defendant appealed,arguing the trial court should have limited the minor recovery for past medical services to the amount actually paid.id.at.the court of appeal preliminarily noted it was undisputed the minor was entitled under the collateral source rule to recover from the defendant,as special damages,the sum of that paid.id.at.noting that there was no evidence the minor was or would become liable for the difference between the undisputed reasonable value of the medical services and the amount paid,and noting also that the hospital had written off the balance between the amount billed to and the amount paid,the hanif court nevertheless concluded that the minor was deemed to have personally paid or incurred liability italics added for those services,and thus was entitled to recompense accordingly,which it found was reasonable and fair in light of subrogation and judgment lien rights.id.at.
after reviewing california law pertaining to the measure of damages in personal injury actions,the hanif court stated that,when the evidence shows a sum certain to have been paid or incurred for past medical care and services,whether by the plaintiff or by an independent source,that sum certain is the most the plaintiff may recover for that care despite the fact it may have been less than the prevailing market rate.hanif,supra,d at,italics added.thus,it concluded,a plaintiff is entitled to recover up to,and no more than,the actual amount expended or incurred for past medical services so long as that amount is reasonable.id.at,second italics added.applying this measure of damages,the hanif court held that the trial court erred in awarding to the minor plaintiff,as special damages for past medical services,the reasonable value of those services in the amount of,rather than,the actual amount paid.id.at.apparently referring to the difference between the reasonable value of the medical services rendered and the amount paid for those services,the hanif court stated that the collateral source rule is not an issue in this case.hanif,supra,d at.
hamilton reliance on hanif is unavailing because that case is inapposite.as already discussed,howell,who was privately insured,incurred personal liability for her medical providers usual and customary charges.unlike howell,the minor in hanif did not have private health care insurance,and he incurred no personal liability for the medical charges billed to thus suffered no compensable pecuniary detriment or loss beyond his judicially deemed liability for the medical services he received in the amount that actually paid to the medical he was a beneficiary,and as a minor he also lacked the capacity to enter into financial responsibility agreements with his medical providers.as the hanif plaintiff neither paid,nor incurred personal liability,for the amount of the medical charges his health care providers billed to,the hanif court had no occasion to address the issue presented here of whether a plaintiff in a personal injury action who has private health care insurance may recover,under the collateral source rule,economic damages for the amount of reasonable charges her health care providers have billed,but which neither she nor her health care insurer is obligated to pay because the providers,under contracts into which they have entered with that insurer,have agreed to accept as payment in full payments from the plaintiff and her health care insurer in an amount that is less than the amount the providers have billed 
hamilton reliance on nishihama is also unavailing.in that case,the plaintiff nishihama was injured when she tripped and fell in a pothole in a crosswalk maintained by the defendant city.nishihama,supra,th at,d.the jury award of damages for nishihama past medical care expenses included the sum of for care she received from california pacific medical center cpmc.id.at,d.that amount was based on cpmc normal rates.ibid.under an agreement between cpmc and nishihama health care insurer blue cross,cpmc agreed that blue cross would pay reduced rates for specified services that cpmc rendered to blue cross members,and cpmc would accept those reduced payments as payment in full for its services.ibid.under the terms of that agreement,cpmc accepted from blue cross the sum of as payment in full for the services cpmc rendered to nishihama.id.at,d.
the defendant city appealed,complaining that the jury award for cpmc services was based on cpmc normal rates,rather than on the sum cpmc accepted under its agreement with blue cross.nishihama,supra,th at,d.nishihama responded by claiming that because cpmc had filed a lien against her recovery under the hla,she should not be placed in the position of having to accept the lesser amount that blue cross paid while risking the possibility that she would have to pay the greater billed amount to cpmc because of its lien.nishihama,supra,at,d.
addressing nishihama concerns first,the court of appeal concluded that cpmc lien rights under the hla did not extend beyond the amount it agreed to receive from blue cross as payment in full for the services cpmc provided to nishihama.nishihama,supra,th at,d.noting that the hla provides for third party liability to a lienholding health care provider for the amount of its lien claimed in the notice which the hospital was entitled to receive as payment for the medical care and services rendered to the injured person,italics added,the court of appeal stated that t he amount that a hospital is entitled to receive as payment necessarily turns on any agreement it has with the injured person or the injured person insurer.id.at,d.the nishihama court concluded that cpmc had no lien rights against nishihama because it had received,which was the amount it was entitled to receive as payment for the medical care and services it rendered to nishihama,as that was the payment amount it had agreed to receive from blue cross as payment in full for the medical services it provided to nishihama.id.at,d.
the nishihama court then addressed the defendant city contention that the trial court erred by permitting the jury to award nishihama damages for medical expenses based on cpmc normal rates,rather than on the negotiated sum cpmc actually accepted from blue cross.citing mercy hospital medical center farmers ins.group of companies cal th,d,for the proposition that a hospital lien rights under the hla derive from the rights of the injured person,nishihama held that because cpmc had no lien rights under the hla against nishihama recovery as it had been paid as payment in full for the medical services it provided to her,the trial court erred in permitting the jury to award her an amount in excess of for the services provided by cpmc.nishihama,supra,th at,d.
