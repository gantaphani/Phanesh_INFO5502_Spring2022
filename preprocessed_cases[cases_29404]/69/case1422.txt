background procedural history 
in february a federal grand jury indicted ramunno on mail and wire fraud charges.the indictment alleges that ramunno fraudulently induced his victims to invest in a fund based on forged audits and fictitious earnings statements.ramunno represented to potential investors that he was a successful commodity futures trader,that funds entrusted to him would be invested in commodity futures,and that investors should expect a significant rate of return.instead,ramunno perpetrated a ponzi scheme he used participant funds to give false profits to earlier investors and misappropriated funds to cover his personal expenses.though no evidentiary hearing was conducted,the district court appears to have accepted the government argument that ramunno defrauded approximately ninety victims of million through this scheme.at.he ultimately pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and one count of mail fraud.
martin invested approximately million with ramunno in january.on january,the united states seized ramunno assets,which were valued at between and million.at.the seized assets included a washington mutual bank account containing.martin alleges he can trace the million he invested with ramunno to this account.
ramunno agreed to forfeit the seized assets.the district court entered a preliminary order of forfeiture and initiated ancillary proceedings in which could contest the forfeiture pursuant to n.martin filed a petition to amend the preliminary order of forfeiture.he asserted that he was entitled to a return of the million he invested because it was subject to a constructive trust in his favor.the government moved to dismiss martin petition.the district court summarily granted the government motion and,without an evidentiary hearing,entered a final order and judgment of forfeiture in favor of the government.martin appeals.
ii.issues on appeal and contentions of the parties 
two questions are presented.one is an issue of state law the nature of martin interest in the forfeited funds.we must determine whether martin petition can establish his right to a constructive trust under georgia law.if not,the inquiry ends.see united states andrews,cir.but if,taking the allegations contained in the petition as true,we find that martin can establish his entitlement to a constructive trust in the forfeited funds,we must then decide the federal law issue.united states shefton,cir.the federal law issue is whether under n a the constructive trust constitutes an interest superior to ramunno.the answer to this question turns on whether martin constructive trust relates back to the time that the fraud occurred and therefore must be excluded from the forfeiture order.
martin contends that it was improper for the district court to consider traditional principles of equity and fairness in finding that he was not entitled to a constructive trust at because under this court holding in shefton a constructive trust arises automatically when a fraud occurs even if the court does consider principles of equity,martin argues that principles of fairness direct that he should receive a constructive trust because he has the ability to trace his investment to the funds at issue.in contrast,the government contends that shefton does not dictate that the trust arises automatically in response to fraud regardless of whether the district court,sitting as a court of equity,viewed the imposition of the trust as equitable and fair.appellee br.at.therefore,according to the government,the district court correctly declined to grant martin a constructive trust because doing so would elevate his interest in the limited funds above that of similarly situated victims,which would be inequitable.instead,the government asserts,martin appropriate remedy is the attorney general remission process,which allows the attorney general to restore forfeited property to victims as is in the interest of justice.i.
with respect to the federal issue,martin contends that this circuit precedent in shefton holds that a constructive trust may serve as a superior legal interest under the statute.the government argues that shefton was wrongly decided and contends that a constructive trust is only an inchoate interest until it is imposed by a court,and thus does not qualify as a interest in the property within the meaning of section n a.appellee br.at.
iii.standard of review 
in the context of claims to criminally forfeited property,we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.shefton,at quoting united states watkins,cir.however,because a constructive trust is an equitable remedy,we review the district court decision not to impose a constructive trust for an abuse of discretion.see preferred sites,llc troup county,cir.
iv.discussion 
under n,a asserting an interest in forfeited property may petition the court to have his or her interest excluded from the forfeiture.the statute recognizes two scenarios in which a court must amend the forfeiture order.only the first is at issue in this case a court must amend the order when the petitioner demonstrates,by a preponderance of the evidence,that 
the petitioner has a legal right,title,or interest in the property,and such right,title,or interest renders the order of forfeiture invalid in whole or in part because the right,title,or interest was vested in the petitioner rather than the defendant or was superior to any right,title,or interest of the defendant at the time of the commission of the acts which gave rise to the forfeiture of the property under this section.
a court preliminary forfeiture order does not consider interests.but the court must amend the final order of forfeiture to exempt the qualifying interests of.andrews,at.martin petition alleges he has a qualifying interest pursuant to n a.to prove he has a qualifying interest under this section,martin must show that he had a legal interest in the forfeited property his legal interest in the forfeited property was superior to ramunno interest and his legal interest was superior to ramunno interest at the time of ramunno fraud.shefton,at.while georgia law determines the nature of martin interest in the is,whether he is entitled to a constructive trust,id.citing united states fleet,cir we apply federal law to determine whether that interest is a legal interest under n a and whether it was superior to ramunno interest at the time of the fraud.
we first consider the state law question of whether martin has met the requirements of a constructive trust.the constructive trust,a creature of equity,is the formula through which the conscience of equity finds expression.mitsubishi int l cardinal textile sales,cir quoting austin scott,the law of trusts,at ed.in georgia,a constructive trust is a trust implied whenever the circumstances are such that the person holding legal title to the property,either from fraud or otherwise,can not enjoy the beneficial interest in the property without violating some established principle of equity.a lee lee,noting that under georgia law a constructive trust may be imposed where property has been acquired by fraud,or where,though not acquired by fraud it is against equity that it should be retained by the person who holds it.murray county pickering,a constructive trust is not created by any words,either expressly or impliedly evincing a direct intention to create a trust,but by the construction of equity in order to satisfy the demands of justice.internal quotations and citations omitted troutman troutman,a constructive trust is a remedy cr
