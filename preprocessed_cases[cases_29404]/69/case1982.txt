mechanic lien 
a mechanic lien is a procedural device for obtaining payment of a debt owed by a property owner for the performance of labor or the furnishing of materials used in construction.road sprinkler fitters local union g g fire sprinklers,th,fn,d.the statute implementing this procedure,civil code section et is derived from article,section of the california constitution,which provides that mechanics,persons furnishing materials,artisans,and laborers of every class,shall have a lien upon the property upon which they have bestowed labor or furnished material for the value of such labor done and material furnished and the legislature shall provide,by law,for the speedy and efficient enforcement of such liens.accordingly,section provides in relevant part,mechanics and all persons and laborers of every class performing labor upon a work of improvement shall have a lien upon the property upon which they have bestowed labor whether done or furnished at the instance of the owner or otherwise.section provides that e very work of improvement constructed upon any land with the knowledge of the owner shall be held to have been constructed at the instance of such owner and such interest shall be subject to any lien recorded under this chapter unless such owner shall give a notice of nonresponsibility pursuant to section.
section,added by the legislature in,expressly provides that the mechanics lien law does not apply to any public work.stats,ch.public work is defined as any work of improvement contracted for by a public entity.north bay argues that since the city did not contract for the performance of any of the work on the sports complex,the project is not a public work and section therefore has no application.since the work in question was contracted for by the,the argument continues,the mechanic lien statute applies and,the city as owner having failed to file a notice of nonresponsibility pursuant to section,a lien may be imposed on the property on which the improvements were performed.
while there is no dispute that the express exemption for public work provided by section does not apply,it does not necessarily follow that a mechanic lien may be impressed on property owned by the city.in,the california supreme court held that a mechanic lien could not be enforced against a schoolhouse owned by a local school district.mayrhofer board of education cal,mayrhofer.the court explained that because of principles of sovereign immunity,any right to impress a mechanic lien on public property must be expressly,not implicitly,provided for by statute.the court rejected the argument that public buildings are included both in the word property,used in the constitution,and in the phrase any building,used in the code,and therefore it must necessarily follow that mechanics and are,by these provisions,given a right to a lien upon such buildings.ibid.the court relied on the rule of statutory construction,that the state is not bound by general words in a statute,which would operate to trench upon its sovereign rights,injuriously affect its capacity to perform its functions,or establish a right of action against it.ibid.since mayrhofer,the general rule has been broadly stated,often without reference to section,that liens for labor or supplies on public property are not permitted.setting trustees of cal.state university colleges d,allied canon d.the mechanics lien laws,in general,do not apply to public improvements.while most of these cases did involve public work projects,the prohibition is frequently stated as applying to public property,not simply to public work projects.this is consistent with the rule in many other jurisdictions,john kennedy new york world fair,lien can not attach to the city interest in the real estate national fireproofing town of huntington,public buildings not subject to lien see also,a listing cases in which courts have applied principles of sovereign immunity in determining that municipal property could not be the subject of a mechanic lien bruner,construction law as a general rule,mechanics liens do not attach to public property.
the holding in mayrhofer remains good law.there is no right to impose a lien on property owned by a public entity unless such a right has been expressly conferred by statute.mayrhofer,supra,cal.at,one can not sue the state,unless expressly authorized by statute,and this principle is embodied in our constitution.general statutes creating new remedies for individuals have never been held to authorize such suits.this principle has been reconfirmed very recently by our supreme court a traditional rule of statutory construction is that,absent express words to the contrary,governmental agencies are not included within the general words of a statute.wells learning foundation cal th,d,wells state ex rel.harris pricewaterhousecoopers cal th,d.
while sovereign immunity against being sued has been waived by government code section a public entity may sue and be sued,government code section provides that n othing in this part imposes liability upon a public entity unless such liability otherwise exists.no statute imposes liability on a public entity for debts incurred by a lessee for improving property owned by and leased from the public entity.nor can section be construed to implicitly authorize a mechanic lien against public property for performing work that is not a public work.to the contrary,the legislation adopting section provided expressly that it was the intent of the legislature that t his act shall not be construed to constitute a change in,but shall be construed as declaratory of,the preexisting law.stats,ch.
north bay argues that a distinction must be drawn between property owned by a municipality that is used for governmental as opposed to proprietary purposes.it contends that property held in a proprietary it asserts is the case here is subject to a lien as is any other privately held property.although there is no california authority directly on point,some other jurisdictions have agreed that the purpose for which property is used determines whether the property is subject to a mechanic lien.comstock davis,city of eden prairie,mayor council recony sales engineering,american seating company city of philadelphia,american seating.
in american seating,supra,at pages,the court held that a municipality proprietary interest in a privately built sports complex was subject to a mechanic lien.the pennsylvania statute at issue in that case provided,much like section,that no lien shall be allowed for labor or materials furnished for a purely public purpose.american seating,supra,at.the court reasoned that this language did not preclude the possibility of imposing a mechanic lien on public property,and that the court must inquire and decide whether,apart from the act,the case law of pennsylvania precludes mechanics lien claims against municipalities.id.at.the court concluded,although our research has disclosed no case explicitly holding that in every instance liens against municipal properties are void,still the statement seems correct as a general proposition of pennsylvania law.however,it seems to us that a meaningful ground for distinction rests in the use to which the municipality puts the property.where,as here,the municipality acts as an absent landlord,entrusting the management and control of its premises to its tenant and where the building was constructed and paid for by the tenant and further,where the municipality in owning the building,discharges a function not governmental in nature,but rather proprietary and then an exception to the general rule that municipal property is exempt from mechanics liens seems proper.since an execution upon the lien would not disrupt an essential public service or function,no reason appears for striking the lien down.ibid.in reaching this conclusion,the pennsylvania court relied on cases upholding execution upon a judgment lien against public property held in a proprietary rather than governmental capacity.american seating,supra,at,fn,citing kerr city of new orleans cir city of bradenton fusillo,so.city of hazard duff.

california courts formerly drew a distinction between property held in a proprietary as distinguished from a governmental capacity for the purpose of permitting execution on a judgment lien.marin water.sausalito,property which a municipality holds merely as a proprietor,devoting it to no use of a public character,such as lands acquired or held for other than public purposes and not in trust for public use,are subject to execution unless some statutory or constitutional provision forbids it kubach city of long beach d.this distinction,however,has since been abolished by the legislature.
the rule permitting execution of a judgment lien against government property held in a proprietary capacity developed from the common law rule that tort claims could be asserted against a public entity acting in a proprietary rather than a governmental capacity.marin water.sausalito,supra.at,city of hazard duff,supra,at the municipality is not liable for torts committed in the exercise of its governmental functions neither is its property used in that capacity subject to execution.but it is liable for its torts committed in the exercise of its private capacity and its property used in its private capacity is subject to execution.the common law rule,however,has been superceded by the california tort claims act.today,government code section,subdivision a provides that a public entity is liable for injury proximately caused by an act or omission of an employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment if the act or omission would,apart from this section,have given rise to a cause of action against that employee or his personal representative.no distinction with regard to liability is drawn between the public and proprietary functions of the public entity.maxon industries,state compensation ins.fund th,d the significance of a distinction between proprietary and governmental activities with respect to tort liability was essentially abrogated in muskopf corning hospital dist.cal d,and by subsequent enactment of the california tort claims act.
more directly on point,the legislature has also enacted a separate comprehensive scheme prescribing the manner in which a judgment against a local public entity may be satisfied,and it does not include execution on public property.barkley city of blue lake th,d enforcement of judgment against local public entity governed by,et.government code section,subdivision b now provides,a judgment,whether or not final,is not enforceable under the provisions of the code of civil procedure commencing with section governing the enforcement of civil judgments but is enforceable under this article after it becomes final.the corresponding provisions of the code of civil procedure reiterate that a money judgment against a public entity is not enforceable under this division if the money judgment is subject to the provisions of the government code commencing with sections and section concerning the enforcement of judgments against the state and against local public entities.code civ.the law revision commission comment to government code section,which was amended in,notes that u nder prior law,property of a local public entity was not subject to execution under the code of civil procedure if the property was used or held for use for a public purpose.on the other hand,property held by a local public entity merely as a proprietor,devoted to no use of a public character,such as land acquired or held for other than public purposes and not held in trust for public use,was subject to execution unless some statutory or constitutional provision forbade it.cal.law revision com,pt.west ann.ed.foll.subdivision b of government code section,the comment explains,changes prior law to provide that execution and other remedies under the code of civil procedure for enforcement of money judgments do not apply to enforcement of a money judgment against a local public entity ibid.
accordingly,while execution of a judgment lien against private property is authorized by code of civil procedure sections through,no such procedure is now authorized in the relevant sections of the government code.rather,the government code provides that a writ of mandate is an appropriate remedy to compel a local public entity to perform any act required by this article,and imposes a duty upon local public entities to pay tort judgments in the manner provided in this article and gives the judgment creditor the right to obtain a writ of mandate to enforce this duty.depending upon the financial condition of the public entity,it can comply with the duty to pay a tort judgment by paying the judgment in the fiscal year in which it becomes final paying the judgment in the next fiscal year paying the judgment in not more than annual installments or paying the judgment with the proceeds of a bond issue as authorized by article commencing with section of this chapter.cal.law revision com,pt.west ann,supra,foll,at.the law revision commission explains further,in its recommendations relating to enforcement of claims and judgments against public entities,that the procedure recommended above for enforcing money judgments against public entities takes into account their special nature.making clear that execution is not available to enforce a judgment against a public entity will protect against the possibility of seizure and sale of public property to satisfy a judgment.litigation to determine the status of public proper
