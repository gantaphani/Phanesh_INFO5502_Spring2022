background 
titan hired quintak,incorporated to operate its warehouse and distribution center.christensen worked for quintak as a warehouse supervisor at titan.in june,christensen was years old and went on disability leave to have knee replacement surgery.craig warren,christensen manager and a quintak employee who had daily contact with titan management,considered christensen his most qualified and experienced supervisor and told christensen that he would have his job when he returned from the disability leave.when christensen went on leave,coy elswick,a lead man supervised by christensen,performed christensen duties.
in july,while christensen was still on disability leave,titan decided to cut costs by terminating quintak and hiring its own employees to perform the duties the quintak employees previously performed.william campbell,president of titan,announced that titan would be hiring some of quintak employees and met with warren to inform him of the reorganization.all quintak employees who wanted to work at titan were required to submit applications,interview for the desired positions and undergo qualifying physicals.nadis barucic and cheryl luthin oversaw the application process.campbell continued to meet with warren,who assumed the position of warehouse manager at titan,during the transition stage.
warren and elswick informed christensen of this development.warren told christensen that while everyone was required to fill out an application,christensen was on his list of people who were needed to run the operation.christensen submitted an application while he was still on disability leave and kept in contact with warren.he told warren that he applied for the supervisor position and that his doctor would not release him to work until august.warren assured christensen that he would have his job as supervisor whenever the doctor allowed him to return to work.
at the beginning of august,christensen contacted warren to check on the status of his application.warren first told christensen to call barucic,who told christensen that he was not conducting any more interviews and that christensen needed to have warren schedule him for an interview with luthin.christensen contacted warren two additional times before warren contacted luthin.after warren contacted luthin,he received an from luthin stating that titan would not be hiring christensen.christensen asked luthin about this decision on september,and luthin promptly told him that titan distribution was not hiring.titan did not interview or hire christensen,and no one at titan provided a reason to christensen for this decision.
christensen then filed a charge of disability and age discrimination with the iowa civil rights commission commission.when asked by the commission for its reason for not hiring christensen,titan responded that it did not hire all applicants.titan did not immediately fill christensen supervisor position,but it did hire elswick to fill the lead man position.elswick testified that his job duties as a titan employee were the same as those he performed as a quintak employee while filling in for christensen when he was on disability leave.one year after titan hired elswick,it promoted him to the supervisor position.elswick testified that christensen was more experienced and more qualified than elswick for the warehouse supervisor position and that both men had the same physical abilities.
when christensen was not hired by titan,he spent the next ten months searching for a job similar to his quintak supervisor position.he utilized career service counselors and sent resumes to potential employers.he received job interviews but no offers.in july,christensen hired him to handle purchasing and sales at a lumberyard he managed.christensen accepted this job even though it had less responsibility and lower compensation than his prior supervisor position.
christensen filed suit against titan for disability and age discrimination under the americans with disabilities act ada,et,and the age discrimination in employment act adea,et,respectively,and the parallel provisions of the iowa civil rights act,iowa code et.titan filed a motion for summary judgment,claiming that it did not hire christensen because it decided to eliminate the supervisor position for economic reasons.the district court denied titan motion for summary judgment.
at trial,titan employees provided conflicting evidence as to who made the decision not to hire christensen.campbell testified that he decided to eliminate the supervisor position by july,but he also claimed that warren made the decision not to hire christensen.warren,however,testified that no one told him that the supervisor position had been eliminated.warren claimed that he wanted to hire christensen and did not know that titan did not intend to hire him until receiving an from luthin on august.luthin and barucic,however,both testified that they did not make the decision not to hire christensen.
the jury also heard testimony concerning christensen physical capabilities.during august,christensen doctor told him that he had the following permanent restrictions no prolonged walking,frequent bending,or stooping with the knee,no jumping from heights of over one foot,and no standing more than two hours at a time.a vocational expert testified that christensen restrictions prevented him from performing positions that accounted for percent of the job market but that christensen could perform his job as supervisor at quintak and the same job he applied for with titan.
christensen and his wife testified about the emotional distress he experienced after titan refused to hire him.he was upset and distraught over titan decision and continued to be withdrawn and feel stress during his long job search.he also cried and was upset because he was not the breadwinner of the family.he continued to be withdrawn even after he began working at the lumberyard because this job did not provide the same fulfillment as his supervisor position.
the jury returned a verdict in favor of christensen on both the disability and age discrimination claims.the jury was instructed to determine both whether christensen had a physical impairment and whether christensen was regarded as having an impairment.the instructions,however,did not clearly inform the jury that these two definitions,actually disabled and regarded as disabled,were mutually exclusive and that a finding of disability under both definitions would be inconsistent therefore,on a special verdict form,the jury found both that christensen was actually disabled and that titan regarded him as disabled.the jury also found that titan willfully violated the adea.based on these findings,the jury awarded christensen in back pay,in punitive damages and in emotional distress damages.titan moved for judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,a new trial.christensen requested liquidated damages for the adea claim,front pay and attorneys fees and costs.
in response to these motions,the district court denied titan requests for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial,holding that the jury finding that titan regarded christensen as disabled was supported by substantial evidence.the district court addressed the jury finding that titan regarded christensen as disabled first because it believed that the evidence supporting the regarded as disabled finding was stronger than that for the actually disabled finding.once the district court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the regarded as finding,it concluded that it was unnecessary to address the jury finding of christensen actual disability and vacated that finding.
due to its decision to vacate the actual disability finding and assuming that the jury punitive damages award applied equally to both findings,the district court reduced the punitive damages award by half to.the district court also considered the jury back pay award and reduced it to because the jury considered the possibility of christensen receiving overtime pay which was not supported by the evidence.the district court then found that there was sufficient evidence supporting the jury emotional distress damages award.next,the district court awarded christensen in liquidated damages,finding the evidence sufficient to support the jury finding that titan violation of the adea was willful.finally,the district court awarded christensen in front pay and in attorneys fees and costs.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,titan argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,a new trial because the evidence was insufficient to support either the disability discrimination verdict or the age discrimination verdict as well as the awards for punitive,emotional distress and liquidated damages.titan also argues that the district court abused its discretion in awarding christensen front pay.
sufficiency of the evidence 
judgment as a matter of law 
we review a district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.chalfant titan distribution,cir.judgment as a matter of law is granted only if a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.id.quotation omitted.we apply the same standards as the district court,giving the nonmoving party all reasonable inferences and viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.id.if conflicting inferences reasonably can be drawn from evidence,the jury is in the best position to determine which inference is correct.canny bottling group,cir.
disability discrimination 
in order to make a prima facie case under the ada,a plaintiff must establish that he has a disability within the meaning of the ada that he is qualified to perform the essential functions of the job,with or without reasonable accommodation and that he suffered an adverse employment action due to a disability.chalfant,at internal quotations omitted titan argues only that there was insufficient evidence to prove the first element.with respect to this first element,t he ada defines a disability as a a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual b a record of such an impairment or c being regarded as having such an impairment.webner titan distribution,cir quoting.
an employer regards an employee as disabled if it mistakenly believes that the employee has an impairment which would substantially limit one or more major life activity,or it mistakenly believes that an actual impairment substantially limits one or more major life activity.chalfant,at quoting wenzel,at.the parties do not dispute that working is a major life activity.toyota motor,williams,d.an employee is substantially limited from working when he is significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes.chalfant,at quotation omitted.if an employer mistakenly believes that an employee is unable to perform a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs,then the employer regards the employee as disabled.see id.however,if an employer only mistakenly believes the employee is unable to perform a single job,then the employer does not regard the employee as disabled.id.
titan argues that the evidence was insufficient for the jury to find that it regarded christensen as unable to perform a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs.the district court relied on warren testimony that christensen,as a supervisor,was required to perform the duties of all of the workers who reported to him and christensen testimony that he occasionally assumed the duties of his absent subordinates.the district court held that the jury could infer from this testimony that titan did not interview or hire christensen for the supervisor position because titan believed he could not perform the supervisor job or the duties of all of the positions reporting to the supervisor in the organizational chart.as a result,the district court concluded that a jury could find that titan believed christensen was unable to perform a broad range of jobs.
we do not agree that such an inference would be appropriate because it does not logically follow from titan refusal to hire christensen that titan believed christensen was unable to perform all of the jobs of all employees reporting to the supervisor position.because the supervisor is required to perform the jobs of all of his subordinates,titan regarding christensen as being unable to perform any one of those jobs would disqualify him from the supervisor position.at most,a reasonable jury could only infer that titan did not believe christensen could perform the single most physically demanding job reporting to the supervisor.therefore,the evidence on which the district court relied does not support the conclusion that titan believed christensen was prevented from performing a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes.
while other evidence may sufficiently support the jury finding that titan regarded christensen as disabled,we need not make that determination because we find that christensen actually disabled claim is more straightforward than his regarded as disabled claim and that the evidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to find that christensen was actually disabled.see chronister bryco arms,cir stating that this court may affirm a district court decision to deny a motion for judgment as a matter of law on any basis supported by the record.
a person has an actual disability under the ada if he has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of the individual.nuzum ozark auto,cir quoting internal quotations omitted.a person is substantially limited from the major life activity of working when his impairment significantly restrict s the individual ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training,skills and abilities.webner,at citing j i internal quotations omitted.
in webner,we held that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that webner had a physical impairment that substantially limited his life activity of working based on the following evidence webner back injury limited his ability to walk,stand for long periods of time and twist and bend at the waist webner back caused an impairment rating of percent of his body as a whole webner was required to return to work incrementally subject to restrictions and physical therapy and webner was prevented from working in jobs that had heavy and very heavy industrial classifications classifications that required a lifting ability greater than webner restricted lifting ability of pounds.id.in the instant case,christensen presented similar evidence christensen could not engage in prolonged walking,standing more than two hours at a time,frequent bending or stooping,or jumping from heights over one foot christensen knee injury caused a percent impairment rating of his leg and a percent impairment of his body as a whole christensen was not permitted to return to work until august,and had to abide by his doctor restrictions concerning walking and bending his knee and christensen could only perform percent of the jobs in the job market and was prevented from performing jobs of medium and above strength demands that required lifting pounds or more.given the similarity of these facts to the webner facts,we find that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury finding that christensen was actually disabled.
titan next argues that it offered a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for not hiring christensen.in discrimination cases,once an employer offers a legitimate reason for th
