background 
anthony is the president,lone stockholder,and sole employee of macke,a company formed in to develop,manufacture,and market pet products.in early,and a developed a portable device for carrying and dispensing water for a pet,and filed a patent application on the device shortly thereafter.in late,macke began distributing this device under the name.
in,during the prosecution of his patent application on the device,learned of the patent,which had been issued to wechsler in.rather than securing an opinion of counsel regarding the validity of the patent,analyzed the patent,the prior art,and his own device himself and formed a belief that the patent was invalid and not infringed by the device.nonetheless,had counsel for macke enter into licensing negotiations with wechsler.these licensing negotiations broke down in august when wechsler filed suit against macke and for infringement of the patent.at that time,redesigned the device.however,macke kept the original device on the market until april.
on motions for summary judgment,the district court ruled that was not the alter ego of macke and was not liable for infringement under a.wechsler i,d at.however,the district court ruled that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to when learned of the patent and whether he possessed the personal culpability to be liable for inducing infringement under b.id.at.
after a jury trial,the jury returned special verdicts finding that macke and willfully infringed the patent based on their becoming aware of the patent in april and continuing to sell the original device until april special verdict,but that was not personally liable for inducing macke infringement special verdict.wechsler ii,at.nonetheless,the district court granted wechsler motion for jmol that was personally liable for inducing infringement of the patent,essentially reversing the jury special verdict to the contrary.id.at.
having found that macke and infringed the patent,the jury awarded wechsler approximately in lost profits and approximately in reasonable royalties for the infringement.macke and moved for jmol setting aside the lost profit damages since wechsler did not manufacture a product until after the device was off the market.that motion was denied by the district court.wechsler iii,d at.

ii.discussion 
grant of jmol that was personally liable for infringement 
appeals the district court grant of jmol that he was personally liable,despite the jury special verdict that he was not.in granting jmol,the district court determined that special verdict,that was not personally liable for inducing infringement,was inconsistent with special verdict,that the defendants willfully infringed the patent.however,in reconciling these two special verdicts,the district court essentially discarded special verdict.contends this was error.
this court applies the same standard of review as that applied by the trial court when reviewing a jmol motion following a jury verdict.ncube seachange int l.the grant or denial of jmol is reviewed under the law of the regional circuit in which an appeal from the district court would normally lie.union carbide chems.plastics tech.shell oil.the regional circuit in this case is the ninth circuit,which reviews de novo an order granting or denying jmol.see acosta city county of,cir grant rivero city county of,cir denial.under ninth circuit law,jmol requires that the evidence,construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,permits only one reasonable conclusion,and that conclusion is contrary to the jury verdict.pavao pagay,cir.
with regard to allegedly inconsistent jury verdicts,we also apply regional circuit law.emi group,cypress semiconductor.the ninth circuit review s de novo a claim that the jury verdict is inconsistent and decide s whether its responses can be harmonized.affordable hous.dev.city of fresno,cir.a trial court is rarely entitled to disregard jury verdicts that are supported by substantial evidence,duk mgm grand hotel,cir,and can not choose to ignore a legitimate finding that is part of the special verdict.floyd laws,cir.
here,the district court did not hold that special verdict was not supported by substantial evidence.instead,the district court held that two special verdicts returned by the jury were inconsistent.after the being instructed that t he defendants are macke international trade,a nd anthony,referred to respectively as macke and,the jury was asked 
do you find that wechsler has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that is personally liable for infringement of the patent 
yes is a finding for wechsler.no is a finding for.
do you find by clear and convincing evidence that defendants have willfully infringed based upon defendants becoming aware of the content of the patent in april and then continuing to sell the original 
yes is a finding for wechsler.no is a finding for.
emphases added.the jury answered no to the former question and yes to the latter.in light of these responses,the district court recognize d that an inconsistency may arguably exist in the special verdicts returned by the jury,and that the court has a duty to reconcile the jury special verdict responses on any reasonable theory consistent with the evidence.wechsler ii,at quoting pierce pac.transp,cir.
in attempting to reconcile the verdicts,the district court essentially reversed the jury finding on special verdict.however,the district court did not find that the verdict was not supported by substantial evidence.instead,the district court stated that the record fully supports and makes reasonable the conclusion that the jury intended to find personally liable for infringing the patent wechsler ii,at.were it to find macke liable for willful infringement yet exonerate,the only person through whom macke acted,the district court felt such a result would be inconsistent and unreasonable because the record does not support any finding that macke acted independently of.id.
however,the district court conclusion that the record fully supports that the jury intended to find personally liable is in direct conflict with the jury special verdict that wechsler had not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that was personally liable for infringement of the patent.furthermore,the district court statement that finding macke liable for willful infringement while exonerating would be inconsistent and unreasonable because the record does not support any finding that macke acted independently of is not only incorrect,it disregards the grant of summary judgment that macke was not the alter ego of.
under the district court logic,a person that incorporates him or herself to conduct business can never escape personal liability for willful infringement by the corporation.this is inconsistent with our case law.unless the corporate structure is a sham,we have held that personal liability for inducement must be supported by personal culpability.hoover group,custom metalcraft.this requires the officer to have possessed a specific intent to aid and abet the infringement.water techs.calco.a primary consideration for willful infringement,on the other hand,is whether the infringer had a good faith belief that the patent was invalid not infringed.sri,advanced tech.the two standards are not the same.for example,a corporate officer could negligently believe that a patent was invalid not infringed.this might support a finding of willful infringement by the corporation,see biotec biologische naturverpackungen gmbh.kg biocorp,but not a finding of personal liability for the officer.accordingly,the district court statement that finding macke liable for willful infringement while exonerating would be inconsistent and unreasonable because macke could not act independently of is clearly incorrect.
in fact,not only are the special verdicts not inconsistent,but giving meaning to both special verdicts and appears to be the most reasonable interpretation of them,given the instructions the district court gave to the jury.before submitting the issues to the jury,the district court described wechsler contentions to the jury as follows 
first,wechsler contends that is personally liable for indirect infringement of the patent by contributing to or encouraging others to directly infringe.
second,wechsler claims that he has suffered damages as a result of macke infringement.
third,wechsler claims that macke infringement of the patent is willful.
emphases added.none of the jury instructions referenced directly infringing the district court had already granted summary judgment that was not liable for direct infringement.wechsler i,d at.the instructions of willful infringement only referred to macke.in light of this,the most reasonable interpretation of the special verdicts is that the jury intended to find that macke had willfully infringed the patent,but that was not personally liable for macke infringement.
thus,rather than disregarding the jury explicit finding that was not personally liable for infringement of the patent in special verdict,the district court should have interpreted the finding of willful infringement in special verdict as extending only to macke.this would have resolved any apparent inconsistency between the two special verdicts and been consistent with both the jury instructions that referred to willful infringement by macke alone and the grant of summary judgment that macke was not the alter ego of.accordingly,the district court grant of jmol that was personally liable for infringement of the patent was in error.
denial of jmol precluding lost profits 
and macke also appeal the district court denial of jmol that the jury award of lost profit damages was not supported by substantial evidence.according to and macke,lost profits should be unavailable to wechsler as a matter of law since wechsler lacked the ability to produce a product while the handidrink device was on the market.
whether lost profits are legally compensable in a particular situation is a question of law that we review de novo,gse lining,citing kelley,en banc.to recover lost profits,the patent owner must show causation in fact,establishing that but for the infringement,he would have made additional profits.grain processing am,citing king instruments perego.
according to the district court,wechsler presented substantial evidence of such causation in the form of evidence of his development and sales of his product and the testimony of his expert,and that t he strength of that evidence was determined by the jury,and may not be reconsidered by the court.wechsler iii,d at.the district court,however,is incorrect.not only is the substantial evidence of this causation lacking,the availability of lost profits is a question of law for the court,not the jury,at.only after the court has decided,as a matter of law,that lost profits are available does the jury then get to determine the amount of those lost profits.ericsson,harris.
normally,if the patentee is not selling a product,by definition there can be no lost profits,at.the only exception is where the patentee has the ability to manufacture and market a product,but for some legitimate reason does not.even in these situations,though,the burden on a patentee who has not begun to manufacture the patented product is commensurately heavy.hebert lisle.
here,it is undisputed that wechsler did not produce a product until april,approximately one year after the period of infringement ended.nonetheless,wechsler asserts that he had the capability to do so earlier,as evidenced by his later sales and the testimony of his expert.the evidence of later manufacturing and marketing,however,is not dispositive to the determination of whether the patentee had the ability to do so during the period of infringement.only if it is indicative of the ability to manufacture and market the patented device during the period of infringement is it relevant.
in the present case,the record demonstrates that,despite his later success manufacturing and marketing a product,wechsler lacked the capability to manufacture his device during the period of infringement.in a letter dated april,wechsler wrote to his factory stating that he was disappointed to learn that a rough production sample of his device would not be available until early june.not until august,four months after the device was taken off the market,was wechsler finally successful in producing his own device.as such,wechsler clearly lacked the ability to manufacture his device during the period of infringement.
wechsler expert testimony to the contrary does not change this fact.wechsler expert opinion that wechsler had the capability to manufacture and market his device during the period of infringement was based solely on the fact that wechsler manufactured and marketed his product after the period of infringement.as stated by wechsler expert,w e know wechsler had the capacity to manufacture the product.as he described,he did manufacture the product at a later time.however,as discussed above,later success in manufacturing a product does not necessarily indicate the ability to manufacture it at an earlier date.here,the evidence clearly demonstrates that wechsler,due to delays at his factory,was unable to produce a product during the period of infringement.
contrary to and macke contention,however,this does not end our inquiry.wechsler could still receive lost profit damages if macke infringing sales preempted subsequent sales by wechsler eroded the market price wechsler was able to charge for his product.see lam.the record below,however,lacks substantial evidence to support either theory.instead,wechsler and his expert presented little more than conclusory evidence on these theories.for example,wechsler expert testified that wechsler could have sold his product to those people who were desirous of a product like that sold by macke.the issue,however,is not whether wechsler could have sold his product to those individuals the issue is whether wechsler would have sold his product to those individuals.nothing in the record indicates that that would have happened.similarly,with regard to price erosion,wechsler expert testified as to the difference between the price wechsler wanted to charge and the amount he actually charged for his product.however,nothing in the record links this price difference to macke earlier presence in the market.in fact,nothing in the record indicates that wechsler ever attempted to sell his product at his originally intended price.moreover,since macke and wechsler products were not on the market contemporaneously,there could not have been any direct price competition between the two.without some evidence tying the lower price wechsler received for his product to macke infringing sales or indicating that macke infringing sales preempted subsequent sales by wechsler,the jury award of lost profit damages was not supported by substantial evidence.the district court denial of jmol on the issue of lost profit damages was,therefore,in error.
