this case poses a puzzling question about when an affiliate is not an affiliate.william shakespeare,romeo and juliet,act ii,sc.ii what in a name t hat which we call a rose b y any other name would smell as sweet.the district court agreed with blinds to go,btg and its shareholders that harvard private capital holdings,holdings violated their right of first refusal when it transferred all of btg preferred shares to the putative affiliate,charlesbank equity fund ii,limited partnership the fund.accordingly,the court rescinded the transaction.
the district court decision pleased no one.holdings and the fund argue that they are in fact affiliates and assail the district court finding that the transfer inter sese violated the right of first refusal.for their part,btg and its shareholders excoriate the district court choice of remedy.reexamining the matter afresh,we conclude,as did the lower court,that a breach of the right of first refusal occurred.we therefore reject the appeal brought by holdings and the fund.we also conclude that the district court choice of remedy for that breach voiding the transfer rather than decreeing specific performance was consistent with the contract and with equitable remedial principles.we therefore reject the appeal taken by btg and its shareholders.
background 
btg is a closely held canadian corporation that manufactures,sells,and installs window treatments.its seven shareholders include six canadian corporations and nkere udofia,btg 
holdings is a massachusetts corporation.its sole member is the designee of the president and fellows of harvard college harvard.the fund is a limited partnership organized under massachusetts law.its general partner is charlesbank equity fund ii gp,limited partnership the general partner its limited partners are three charitable corporations wholly owned by harvard,namely,holdings,phemus,and shipping venture.structurally,the general partner is itself a massachusetts limited partnership its general partner is charlesbank capital partners,llc the llc,a massachusetts limited liability company owned by its individual members.the general partner has one class c limited partner,namely,harvard private capital properties,harprop,a delaware corporation wholly owned by harvard.
a venture capital transaction set in motion the events leading to this litigation.in,pursuant to the btg preferred share purchase agreement the purchase agreement,holdings injected in capital into btg in exchange for approximately shares of btg preferred stock.on december,the parties executed an amended and restated shareholders agreement the shareholders agreement which,along with the purchase agreement,governs their relationship.among other things,the shareholders agreement provides the btg shareholders with a right of first refusal the stock owned by holdings.the right of first refusal attaches to any transaction other than one involving an affiliate 
in or around,harvard began to restructure its investment portfolio for purposes of tax advantage and business convenience.in,as part of this restructuring,holdings counsel,without troubling to read the relevant document,informed btg that holdings planned to make a permitted transfer of its btg shares to an affiliate.holdings proceeded to convey those shares to the fund.the parties recorded the transfer at book value.in exchange,holdings received a ownership interest in the fund.because it transferred other assets as well,holdings total ownership interest in the fund reached.
on january,holdings and the fund sought to exercise a put right contained in the purchase agreement.that right allowed holdings or its lawful successor in interest to demand,at either of two specified times,that btg redeem all of the preferred shares.under the purchase agreement,the redemption price was to be established through a formula emphasizing btg earnings before interest,taxes,depreciation,and amortization ebitda for the preceding twelve months.
storm clouds began to gather when the redemption price,as tentatively calculated by btg,proved to be far less munificent than holdings and the fund expected.see charlesbank equity fund ii blinds to go,cir explicating more completely the factual background of the put and the attempted redemption.the storm broke when the fund,invoking diversity jurisdiction,see a,filed suit against btg in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.the fund asserted common law claims arising out of an alleged manipulation of btg finances with a view toward reducing the value of the put.holdings soon joined the fray as an additional plaintiff.btg denied the essential allegations of the complaint and posited,as an affirmative defense,that it owed nothing on the put because holdings had breached the shareholders agreement when it transferred the shares to the fund without honoring the right of first refusal 
on july,the btg shareholders filed a separate action in the district court seeking i a declaration as to whether the transfer between holdings and the fund was a transfer to an affiliate as that term is defined in the shareholders agreement and ii relief for holdings purported breach of the shareholders agreement.on october,the district court consolidated that action with the original action.
after much procedural maneuvering,see,charlesbank,at,btg and its shareholders moved for summary judgment on all claims and counterclaims.not to be outdone,holdings and the fund for partial summary judgment on the right of first refusal claim.following a hearing,the district court,in a bench decision,granted summary judgment in favor of the btg shareholders on the right of first refusal claim,denied the for partial summary judgment,and reserved decision on the remaining issues in the case.the court concluded i that the fund was not an affiliate of holdings within the contemplation of the shareholders agreement ii that compliance with the right of first refusal constituted a condition precedent to the proposed transfer iii that because holdings did not abide by the right of first refusal provision,the transfer was void ab initio and iv that the appropriate remedy was to unravel the transaction and require the fund to return the stock to holdings.the district court later entered a partial final judgment to this effect.see.b.these timely appeals ensued.
ii.analysis 
given the district court detailed findings,we do not doubt our appellate jurisdiction over these interlocutory appeals.see spiegel trs.of tufts,cir delineating the requirements for invocation of rule b.we therefore proceed to assess the district court conclusions.we divide our discussion into two segments.
operation of the right of first refusal.
holdings and the fund contest the district court construction of the right of first refusal provision.they contend that they are in fact affiliates as that term is defined in the shareholders agreement and that,therefore,the transaction between them never triggered,much less violated,the right of first refusal.this contention is the logical starting point for our analysis after all,if holdings and the fund are correct,then the share transfer was valid,the right of first refusal was not implicated,and there would be no need for us to address the remedial aspect of the district court decision.
in approaching this question,we replay a familiar standard of review.a district court may enter summary judgment upon a showing that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.houlton citizens coal.town of houlton,cir quoting.c.we review an entry of summary judgment de novo and,therefore,apply the same analytic framework here.see id.at.that framework is not affected by the existence of a for summary judgment.see blackie maine,cir.
on this issue,we are faced with a question of contract interpretation do holdings and the fund qualify as affiliates under the shareholders agreement section of that agreement creates the benchmark.it provides 
an affiliate of a person or entity shall mean another person or entity that is directly or indirectly controlling,controlled by or under common control with such person or entity.control shall mean the right to cast,directly or indirectly,more than of the voting interests in a person or entity.
the shareholders agreement recites that it is governed by massachusetts law and,thus,we look there for the substantive rules of decision.
under massachusetts law,an unambiguous contract must be interpreted according to its terms.see freelander realty,see also fairfield clarendon trust dwek,cir applying massachusetts law.in such a situation,contract construction presents an unadulterated question of law.see daley white contracting.
a contract is ambiguous only when its terms are inconsistent on their face or when the phraseology can support reasonable difference of opinion as to the meaning of the words employed.suffolk constr.lanco scaffolding,quoting fashion house,k mart,cir.there is no ambiguity simply because a dispute exists between the contracting parties,each lobbying for its own preferred interpretation.id.
we discern no ambiguity in the relevant text of section.that section defines the term a ffiliate with considerable precision and,in doing so,not only endows the word control with decretory significance but also assigns that word a specific meaning.we therefore rely on the plain language of the provision to resolve the legitimacy of the transfer.
holdings is fully controlled under any definition of the word by harvard.in determining who controls the fund,however,we can not rely on general usage but,rather,must apply the specific definition agreed upon by btg and holdings.see rogaris albert,stating that a contract terms will not be taken in their plain and ordinary sense if otherwise indicated by the contract see also charles hosmer,commonwealth,explaining that every phrase and clause must be presumed to have been designedly employed.because that definition turns on voting rights,we conclude,without serious question,that the fund is directly controlled by the general partner after all,pursuant to the fund organic limited partnership the general partner has the power to vote,give assent and otherwise exercise all rights,powers,privileges and other incidents of ownership or possession with respect to the fund assets.while holdings is a limited partner,the limited partnership agreement specifically declares that it shall take no part in the conduct or control of the partnership business.
the general partner itself is,of course,a limited partnership.this is scant solace to holdings and the fund,however,as its limited partnership agreement states unequivocally that t he partnership shall be managed exclusively by its general partner the llc.thus,the llc controls the general partner.in turn,the llc is controlled by a manager and various individual members a group that excludes both harvard and holdings.
given this hierarchy,it is readily evident that neither harvard nor holdings occupies a place in the fund chain of voting control.neither harvard nor holdings controls the fund directly a status reserved to the general partner.by the same token,neither harvard nor holdings controls the fund indirectly a status reserved to the llc and its members.holdings and the fund are,therefore,not affiliates within the narrow compass of the definition contained in the shareholders agreement.
in an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning,holdings and the fund make three points.first,they argue that because harvard through holdings,phemus,and shipping venture continues to own virtually all of the beneficial interest in the it,in effect,controls the fund.second,they posit that because holdings itself owns a majority interest in the it has the power under the partnership agreement to require the fund to reconvey its assets to the limited partners this power of reconveyance,they say,amounts to control.third,harvard,through harprop the only class c limited partner of the general partner,can direct the llc the general partner of the general partner to distribute the fund assets to its limited partners,so it controls the fund in that sense as well.
to be sure,these scenarios suggest control in a lay sense.this case,however,is not concerned with the ordinary meaning of control.where the parties to a contract take pains to define a key term specially,their dealings under the contract are governed by that definition.see sullivan commonwealth,recognizing that a contract is to be construed to give reasonable effect to each of its provisions.so it is here.the parties to the shareholders agreement crafted a specific definition of the word control.holdings and the fund can not now gloss over that can we.see charles hosmer,at explaining that all phraseology in a contract must be given meaning and effect,whenever practicable.the mere fact that the transaction,viewed without regard to the shareholders agreement,represented a transfer from one harvard pocket to another is not enough to override the explicit language that the parties chose to insert into the instrument.
holdings and the fund insist that the word indirect,used twice in section,expands voting control to include practical control of any kind.that word,however,can not carry the weight that holdings and the fund place upon it.in context,the word refers only to corporate structure,the llc indirectly controls the fund because it directly controls the general partner,which,in turn,directly controls the fund.it would be unreasonable to read the word as a fundamental alteration of the precise definition of control that accompanies it.at bottom,then,the arguments mounted by holdings and the fund represent thinly veiled attempts to redefine control to comport with economic realities rather than with voting rights.whatever the merits of this perspective in the abstract,we can not countenance so blatant an attempt to rewrite a clearly defined contract term.see freelander,at observing that when t here is nothing ambiguous in a contract language a court can not subvert its plain meaning.consequently,we conclude,as did the court below,that holdings and the fund are not affiliates as that term is defined in the shareholders agreement.
that ends this aspect of the matter.since it is undisputed that holdings did not afford the btg shareholders the specified opportunity to exercise their right of first refusal,the transfer violated the shareholders agreement 
choice of remedy.
the focus of the appeal taken by btg and its shareholders is the district court choice of remedy.citing town of sudbury scott,they insist that specific enforcement of a disregarded right of first refusal is the exclusive remedy permitted under massachusetts law.accordingly,their thesis runs,the district court should have ordered holdings to offer the preferred shares to the btg shareholders on the same terms as were made available to the fund.we think that this thesis takes too crabbed a view of a trial court equitable powers under massachusetts law.
to facilitate this phase of our inquiry,we assume for argument sake that the fund acquisition of the shares met the initial requirements set forth in section of the shareholders agreement,that there was an offer,which was bona fide and led to an arm length transaction.see supra note.this set of assumptions primes the pump and brings us directly to the question of remediation.
the anodyne that the btg shareholders seek specific performance and the anodyne that the district court decreed rescission are both equitable remedies.see,kenda pot money leagues,cir pritzker yari,cir.two abiding truths about equitable remedies are pertinent here.first,in choosing among equitable remedies,a nisi prius court has the,the weigh all the relevant facts and circumstances and to craft appropriate relief on a basis.see,cir en banc.second,in shaping an equitable remedy,a nisi prius court typically has a range of appropriate options.as long as the court ultimate choice falls within this range,it will withstand review even if it is not,in the appellate court opinion,the best option within the range.see id.at describing a district court choice of equitable remedies as quintessentially a judgment call and noting that,absent clear error,it does not matter whether the court of appeals mig
