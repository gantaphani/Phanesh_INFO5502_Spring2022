background 
mackby,who is neither a physician nor a physical therapist,managed and owned the asher clinic,a physical therapy clinic in larkspur,california.the clinic provided physical therapy services to medicare patients under medicare part medicare part a,not at issue here,provides hospital insurance benefits to the elderly and disabled.medicare part b is a voluntary insurance program that pays a portion of the costs of some services not covered by part.part b pays for physical therapy in two instances when rendered by a physician,a qualified employee of a physician,or a clinic or when rendered by a qualified physical therapist in independent practice ptip a superseded.during the relevant time period,medicare capped the amount it would pay a ptip on behalf of any one patient.id.c.no payment limit existed for physical therapy provided by or under the supervision of a physician.
prior to,mackby had a partner,michael leary,a licensed physical therapist.during their partnership,the asher clinic billed medicare part b for physical therapy provided to medicare patients by therapists at the clinic using leary medicare personal identification number pin.during this period,the clinic was subject to the cap applicable to a ptip.in june,mackby assumed sole control of the clinic and instructed the clinic billing service to use the pin of his father,judson mackby,in lieu of leary pin for the clinic medicare part b claims.because the government was led to believe that mackby was supervising physical therapy,it made payments to the clinic without regard to the cap.mackby,however,did not provide or direct any medical services at the clinic and did not know his son was using his pin.mackby himself is a layperson and did not provide physical therapy or other medical services to patients.
in september,mackby obtained certification for the asher clinic as a rehabilitation agency eligible to make claims under medicare part from that point forward the clinic no longer billed medicare part mackby sold the clinic in may for about million.
in,the united states brought a civil action against mackby under the false claims act,alleging that between and he caused false claims to be submitted to medicare,resulting in payments totaling.the district court conducted a bench trial and found that mackby had violated the false claims act by knowingly submitting false medicare claims using mackby pin.
although mackby submitted claims totaling,the government sought damages only for those claims that exceeded medicare annual payment limit per beneficiary for ptips between and the clinic submitted such claims totaling.based on those claims,the district court awarded treble damages under the fca,a,of.in addition to treble damages,the fca also provides for a fine of not less than and not more than per claim.id.the government sought and the district court awarded the minimum statutory fine of per claim for of the claims,representing one claim per beneficiary per year,for a total civil fine of.the total judgment against mackby equaled.
we affirmed mackby liability,holding that mackby had knowingly caused false medicare claims to be submitted.mackby i,at.we further held that both the treble damages and the civil monetary penalty provided for in the fca are,at least in part,punitive,and therefore subject to the eighth amendment excessive fines clause.id.at.we remanded to the district court to consider the constitutionality of the judgment against mackby.id.at.
following the supreme court decision in united states bajakajian,d,the district court considered whether the judgment is grossly disproportional to the gravity of a defendant offense.the court concluded that mackby was not involved in other illegal activities that taking into account all false medicare claims totaling caused by mackby and the maximum penalty per claim authorized by the fca,mackby faced a maximum civil penalty of nearly million and a maximum treble damage award of nearly million and that the government suffered significant harm as a result of mackby false claims.mackby ii,d at.weighing the gravity of the offense and the amount of the judgment,the court found the size of the judgment necessary and appropriate for purposes of deterrence,id.at,and held that it did not violate the excessive fines clause,id.at.
we review de novo whether a fine is unconstitutionally excessive.bajakajian,at.
ii.discussion 
in united states bajakajian,d,the supreme court established the standard for evaluating challenges under the excessive fines clause a punitive forfeiture violates the excessive fines clause if it is grossly disproportional to the gravity of a defendant offense.id.at.bajakajian had attempted to leave the country with in legally obtained currency.he pled guilty to failing to report that he was transporting more than outside the united states,as required by a a.id.at.the district court imposed three years of probation and a fine,and concluded that the full was subject to criminal forfeiture.the district court,however,found that full forfeiture would have been extraordinarily harsh and grossly disproportionate to the offense,and it ordered a forfeiture of in addition to the fine and probation.id.at.
the government appealed,and the supreme court held that forfeiture of the full amount violated the eighth amendment ban on excessive fines.the court first held that the forfeiture was punitive and constituted a fine subject to the eighth amendment.id.at.the court then considered the severity of bajakajian offense and its relation to other criminal activity,the maximum criminal penalty he faced,and the harm he caused.id.at.it used these considerations to weigh the gravity of the crime against the amount of the forfeiture and concluded that a forfeiture was grossly disproportional to the gravity of the offense and therefore unconstitutional.id.at.
bajakajian involved a criminal forfeiture,but the court had previously concluded that civil forfeitures fall within the scope of the eighth amendment.see hudson united states,d.in mackby i,we held that both the treble damages and the civil penalty assessed against mackby were,at least in part,punitive and therefore subject to the excessive fines clause.mackby i,at.
bajakajian does not mandate the consideration of any rigid set of factors in deciding whether a punitive fine is grossly disproportional to the gravity of a defendant offense.we have,nevertheless,looked to factors similar to those used by the court in bajakajian in our excessive fines clause cases.in united states nw thurman street,cir,we held unconstitutional a civil forfeiture of in connection with false statements made in a loan application.we noted that there was an absence of other related illegal activity,that the fine was far out of proportion with the criminal penalties available under the sentencing guidelines for violating the underlying criminal statutes,and that the harm caused was minimal because neither the creditors nor the government suffered any actual loss.id.at.in balice united states department of agriculture,cir,we upheld a civil fine for violations of a federal almond marketing order.our excessive fines clause inquiry focused on the maximum possible penalty authorized by congress and the fact that the defendant made an illegal profit from hi
