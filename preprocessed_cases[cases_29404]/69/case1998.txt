the general contractor and its counsel each filed code civ,motions,which were denied on the basis that the painter had established a prima facie case of malicious prosecution.we disagree,concluding the evidence presented on the motions fails to establish an absence of probable cause to bring the underlying against the painter.that painter counsel had represented to the general contractor counsel that the painter was not liable for the defects alleged is insufficient,as a matter of law,to establish a lack of probable cause to pursue the.similarly,the fact that the painter introduced his own declaration of in opposition to the motion is also insufficient.the general contractor and its counsel possessed evidence that painter was liable that painter may not,in fact,have been liable can not defeat probable cause.
