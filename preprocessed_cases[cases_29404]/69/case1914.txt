facts and procedural history 
brothers george and howard santillan allege that from through,they were the victims of childhood sexual abuse by monsignor anthony herdegen,the resident cleric at their hometown catholic parish in wasco,california that parish was operated by the predecessor of roman catholic bishop of fresno,a corporation sole the diocese.appellants sued the diocese in under the revival provision for previously claims against entities such as the diocese that allegedly failed to protect children from an employee unlawful sexual conduct when they had notice of such behavior.code civ,subds.b,c.the diocese brought a summary judgment motion on the ground that the action did not qualify for the revival period and was therefore barred by the statute of limitations because there was no evidence that the diocese had notice beforehand of any unlawful sexual conduct by herdegen.
the evidence was undisputed that appellants never told anyone,even each other,about the abuse until many years later.the first person george told about the abuse was his psychiatrist in.howard first told his parents about the alleged abuse in.during the years when the abuse occurred,each appellant followed herdegen instructions to conceal their activities.the parties agree on appeal,as they did below,that the only possible evidence of notice rested on deposition testimony that herdegen parish housekeeper knew or should have known that herdegen was sexually abusing appellants.
that housekeeper was barbara zeilman,who died some years before this action was filed.zeilman was an elderly woman who came six days a week to clean up herdegen living quarters in the parish rectory.she was hired by herdegen and paid with parish funds,but those funds ultimately belonged to the diocese.according to appellants,most of the abuse occurred in herdegen bedroom.although that part of the rectory was ordinarily to anyone but herdegen,zeilman let appellants in and knew they were often alone with herdegen behind his closed bedroom door.appellants mother claimed that when she first learned of the abuse in,she confronted zeilman about it.according to the mother,she asked zeilman,why did you tell me because i know you knew.instead of denying or otherwise responding to that accusation,however,zeilman just cried.mother operated a beauty shop and did zeilman hair,even after that initial confrontation.according to the mother,she and zeilman conversed during those sessions,and even though zeilman never said that she recalled what had happened,she did say i sorry,i sorry,i sorry.
cardinal roger mahony served in various administrative positions at the diocese from to.at his deposition,mahony testified that in and before,a parish priest practice of taking a child to his bedroom and closing the door could be grounds for suspicion of sexual misconduct.mahony was then asked to assume that zeilman was aware that unsupervised and unchaperoned children were in herdegen bedroom for any length of time.based on that assumption,mahony was asked whether he would have expected the housekeeper to have made some effort to report to a higher level official mahony replied,well,if there was a suspicion of some problem,i would expect she would have told somebody.
the trial court concluded that zeilman tearful but otherwise silent response to the accusation by appellants mother that zeilman knew about the abuse,and her later statements that she was sorry,raised a triable issue of fact that zeilman in fact knew what herdegen had done to appellants.however,because zeilman was a employee,the court ruled that absent evidence her job duties expressly included reporting her knowledge to diocese officials,notice to the diocese could not be inferred.the trial court found that mahony ambiguous testimony about his expectation that zeilman would have reported what she knew to somebody did not raise an inference that making such a report was in fact an express part of her job duties.because there was no evidence that zeilman had ever reported her presumed suspicions to the diocese,the trial court found there were no triable issues to show the diocese was ever on notice beforehand that herdegen was committing unlawful sexual conduct.judgment for the diocese was later entered,and appellants contend the trial court erred by granting summary judgment 
standard of review 
summary judgment is granted when a moving party establishes the right to the entry of judgment as a matter of law,subd.c.in reviewing an order granting summary judgment,we must assume the role of the trial court and the merits of the motion.in doing so,we must strictly scrutinize the moving party papers.the declarations of the party opposing summary judgment,however,are liberally construed to determine the existence of triable issues of fact.all doubts as to whether any material,triable issues of fact exist are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.while the appellate court must review a summary judgment motion by the same standards as the trial court,it must independently determine as a matter of law the construction and effect of the facts presented.barber marina sailing,th,d.
a defendant moving for summary judgment meets its burden of showing that there is no merit to a cause of action if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action,subds.o,p.if the defendant does so,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of fact exists as to that cause of action or defense.in doing so,the plaintiff can not rely on the mere allegations or denial of his pleadings,but,instead,shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists,subd.p.a triable issue of material fact exists if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.fn.omitted.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.
