ace constructors,entered into a contract with the united states army corps of engineers to build a structure designated the ammo facility,at biggs army airfield at fort bliss in el paso,texas.several disputes arose and,after a trial,the court of federal claims decided several issues in favor of ace,awarded an equitable adjustment to ace in the amount of with statutory interest,and ordered the return of liquidated delay damages in the amount of on this appeal by the united states,we affirm the judgment of the court of federal claims.
background 
the facts are fully set forth in the trial court opinion.in brief,the project included construction of a loading area for cargo planes,various roadways,buildings,a storage pad,a loading apron,and a taxiway for airplanes.the site contained hills and other terrain that needed to be excavated,leveled,and filled.the bid solicitation materials included architectural drawings and engineering specifications prepared for the government by the engineering firm of crawford,murphy tilly,which plans were incorporated into the contract.the court of federal claims found,and the government does not dispute,that certain drawings and specifications were incomplete and defective.
during performance ace encountered numerous difficulties.ace was required by the corps of engineers or by the actual conditions encountered to alter its construction procedures,and experienced significant additional costs.there were various contract modifications,delays,and changes to ace roster of subcontractors.the project was ultimately completed to the government satisfaction,and ace filed several claims for its additional costs based on the unforeseen conditions and defective specifications.the contracting officer granted some of ace claims and denied others.ace appealed to the court of federal claims,as provided by the contract disputes act.that court provided additional relief.the government argues that ace is not entitled to any additional recovery,and requests reversal of all of the relief granted by the court of federal claims.
standard of review 
decisions of the court of federal claims receive plenary review as to issues of law,and the court factual findings are reviewed for clear error,adams united states.the issues herein relate to contract interpretation,the role of the defective specifications,and the foreseeability of the problems encountered.in general the same contract law is applied when the government is party to a contract as applies to contracts between private parties.see mobil oil exploration producing southeast,united states,d when the united states enters into contract relations,its rights and duties therein are governed generally by the law applicable to contracts between private individuals.quoting united states winstar,d.
the profilograph claim 
the contract set forth two methods of measuring the smoothness of the concrete paving,viz.straightedge testing and profilograph testing,the latter being the more expensive method.ace testified to its belief that the use of profilographic testing was optional under the contract,and therefore that it used the straightedge method in calculating its bid.however,during contract performance the corps required profilographic testing,which ace performed under protest,until the corps eventually agreed with ace that the straightedge method was better suited to this project.the court of federal claims awarded ace its additional costs arising from use of the profilographic test method.the government presented three arguments as to why these costs should not be awarded first,that the court of federal claims lacked jurisdiction to review the contracting officer decision of this issue second,that the contract required profilographic testing and third,that ace had not shown that it based its bid on straightedge testing.the government renews these arguments on this appeal.
with respect to jurisdiction of this issue,the government argues that ace did not exhaust its administrative remedies before the contracting officer,and thus could not proceed in the court of federal claims.the contract disputes act,a,requires that the contractor must have submitted the claim to a contracting officer,and that the contracting officer issued a final decision concerning that claim.see,england swanson group,bath iron works united states.the government argues that the claim as presented to the court of federal claims was not identical to that before the contracting officer.
in scott timber united states,this court explained that the same claim must be presented to the court of federal claims as was decided by the contracting officer,but that this standard does not require rigid adherence to the exact language or structure of the original administrative cda claim when they arise from the same operative facts,claim essentially the same relief,and merely assert differing legal theories for that recovery.id.at.the court of federal claims found,and we agree,that the claims before the contracting officer and the court did not differ significantly,for the claim concerning the use of profilograph testing was presented to the contracting officer based on the same contract provisions,the same requirements made by the army corps of engineers,the same costs,the same requested relief,and the same legal theories.this claim was properly before the court.
as to the question of what the contract required,the court of federal claims analyzed this issue in terms of constructive change that is,whether the army constructively altered the contract,either expressly or implicitly,by requiring performance at variance with that set forth in the contract.in contract interpretation,the plain meaning of the contract text controls unless it is apparent that some other meaning was intended and mutually understood.see banknote of america,united states,in interpreting a solicitation,it is ambiguous only if its language is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation if the provisions of the solicitation are clear and unambiguous,they must be given their plain and ordinary meaning.
some portions of the contract treat profilographic testing as optional,and other portions can be read as making this test obligatory.the contract specification with respect to test method is either ambiguous or,when read as the government initially insisted,defective.the contract refers to various testing procedures at various points in the document,including both straightedge and profilographic testing.contract states 
the contractor shall use one of the following methods to test and evaluate surface smoothness of the pavement the profilograph method shall be used for all longitudinal and transverse testing,except where the runs would be less than m in length and at the end where the straightedge shall be used.
b discusses the concrete smoothness requirements and states 
profilographic testing the finished surfaces of the pavements shall have no abrupt change of mm or more,when tested with an approved profilograph 
the contractor shall furnish and maintain at the job site,in good condition,one m straightedge for each paving train for testing the hardened portland cement concrete surfaces 
the contractor may furnish a m profilograph for testing the finished pavement surface 
the government argued that these provisions show that the contract unambiguously required profilographic testing.the government acknowledged that this specification,if viewed as mandatory,was defective,because the straightedge method was better suited to the required measurements,and during performance the corps authorized use of the straightedge method alone.at the trial herrin,the army project manager who drafted the relevant portions of the solicitation,acknowledged the distinction between shall and may.he testified that profilographic testing was not suitable for this project,and that the requirement was eventually dropped in favor of straightedge testing.in construing the meaning of shall in and may in,the court of federal claims explained the need to honor the distinction between may and shall in a contract,and concluded that profilographic testing was permissive under the
