introduction 
subcontrator pacific caisson shoring,pacific sued its general contractor bernards.bernards seeking payment for work performed under pacific subcontract.the trial court granted bernards motion for judgment,ruling,because pacific did not maintain a class specialty license,that it was not a duly licensed contractor and was hence not entitled to bring its action.bus,subd.a.pacific appeals.
we hold that pacific was duly licensed because it held a class a general engineering contractor license when it commenced performance of the subcontract.however,pacific class a license lapsed for two and a half months during performance.where the trial court ruled pacific was never duly licensed,the court never reached the question whether pacific nonetheless was entitled to recover because it substantially complied with the contractor state licensing law the csll et,subd.e.accordingly,we reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
the evidence is not in dispute.bernards and pacific executed a subcontract the subcontract in for pacific to provide temporary excavation and support work on a project to construct a medical center for the county of ventura.under the subcontract documents,pacific agreed to excavate the site for footings,grade beams,plumbing and utility lines,and other requirements,backfill and grade,and provide temporary support.pacific also agreed to prepare and submit calculations of subsurface conditions and geotechnical design parameters,factors of safety,assumptions,design criteria,overstress values and tolerances.the subcontract price was.the prime contract required the bidder for the temporary excavation and support subcontract to maintain a class specialty earthwork and paving contractor license,tit,pacific held a class a general engineering contractor license and a class b general building contractor license but never obtained a class specialty license.
pacific commenced work under the subcontract at some point before july,and billed for work performed through october.meanwhile,the contractor state license board the board suspended pacific licenses on april,for nonpayment of a judgment.during the period the licenses were under suspension,they also expired.the licenses were reinstated on june.
eventually,pacific filed this lawsuit seeking owed it by bernards under the subcontract.in its answer to the complaint,bernards asserted as an affirmative defense that pacific was not at all times relevant to this action properly licensed to perform the work that is the subject of the subcontract.bernards also alleging pacific breached its subcontract and seeking reimbursement for monies owed.
following the presentation of pacific case,bernards moved for judgment code civ,on the ground that pacific was precluded by section,subdivision a from recovering on its complaint.bernards based this argument primarily on the fact that pacific lacked a class specialty earthwork and paving contractor license.secondarily,bernards argued that the license pacific held was suspended during the period that pacific was performing its subcontract work and so it was not duly licensed at all times during the performance of the subcontract.ibid.pacific countered that its class a and b licenses were sufficient and that it substantially complied with the csll.
the trial court reluctantly ruled in favor of bernards and dismissed the lawsuit for lack of a license.the court did not address any other arguments or decide any other issues involving pacific complaint.
pacific moved the trial court for reconsideration arguing that the class specialty license is subsumed in the class a license.in its opposition,bernards argued that pacific subcontract specified that pacific must have a class license not a class a license and in any event,during the time pacific was performing work under its subcontract,pacific class a license was suspended for nearly three months for failure to satisfy a judgment against it.the trial court granted the motion for reconsideration,reconsidered its prior ruling,and reconfirmed it.the court entered judgment against pacific pursuant to section,subdivision a and awarded bernards damages in the amount of on its representing disgorgement of money it paid to an unlicensed contactor.pacific filed its timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
overview of the csll 
the csll et,a comprehensive legislative scheme governing the construction business in california,is designed to protect the public from incompetent or dishonest providers of building and construction services.citation.citation.alatriste cesar exterior designs,th,alatriste.the purpose of section is to enforce the csll.asdourian araj cal d,superseded by statute on another point as stated in kashani tsann kuen china enterprise th.to accomplish that aim,section denies a contractor access to the courts to recover for the fruits of his labor when he violates the statute.citation.asdourian araj,supra,at.
section,subdivision a reads in relevant part except as provided in subdivision e,no person engaged in the business or acting in the capacity of a contractor,may bring or maintain any action,or recover in law or equity in any action,in any court of this state for the collection of compensation for the performance of any act or contract where a license is required by this chapter without alleging that he or she was a duly licensed contractor at all times during the performance of that act or contract,regardless of the merits of the cause of action brought by the person italics added.
if proper licensure is controverted,then the contractor must prove licensure by producing a verified certificate of licensure from the board establishing that the contractor bringing the action was duly licensed in the proper classification at all times during the performance of any relevant contract,subd.d.
our supreme court recently addressed the bar to recovery under section,subdivision a in mw erectors,niederhauser ornamental metal works,cal th mw erectors.there,mw erectors had no license when it began performance of two to perform structural steel work,and another to perform ornamental steel only obtained a structural steel contractor license after commencing work.id.at.referring to the language of section that no person may bring or maintain any action,or recover in law or equity in any action for the collection of compensation for the performance of any act or contract requiring a contractor license unless he or she alleges a,and can prove,subd.d,his or her due licensure at all times during such performance a the supreme court determined that t he words at all times convey the legislature obvious intent to impose a stiff penalty for unlicensed work by specifying that a contractor is barred from all recovery for such an act or contract if unlicensed at any time while performing it.mw erectors,supra,at,certain italics added.reading the companion subdivisions of section together,all of which contain similar at all times and act or contract language,the court explained,they make clear the general rule denying recovery of all compensation for work requiring a contractor license if a valid license was not in place when performance began,or if licensure lapsed at any time during the work.mw erectors,supra,at,italics omitted and added.
the threshold question thus is whether,by virtue of its class a license,pacific was a duly licensed contractor as required by section,subdivision a.
pacific class a license sufficed.
the licensing requirements provide minimal assurance that all persons offering such services in california have the requisite skill and character,understand applicable local laws and codes,and know the rudiments of administering a contracting business.citations.citation.alatriste,supra,th at.
the board is authorized to adopt reasonably necessary rules and regulations to effect the classification of contractors in a manner consistent with established usage and procedure as found in the construction business,and may limit the field and scope of the operations of a licensed contractor to those in which he or she is classified and qualified to engage,as defined by sections,and,subd.a.licenses include any or all of the following branches a general engineering contracting.b general building contracting.c specialty contracting.
a class a or general engineering contractor,is a contractor whose principal contracting business is in connection with fixed works requiring specialized engineering knowledge and skill,including the following divisions or subjects irrigation,drainage,water power,water supply,flood control,inland waterways,harbors,docks and wharves,shipyards and ports,dams and hydroelectric projects,levees,river control and reclamation works,railroads,highways,streets and roads,tunnels,airports and airways,sewers and sewage disposal plants and systems,waste reduction plants,bridges,overpasses,underpasses and other similar works,pipelines and other systems for the transmission of petroleum and other liquid or gaseous substances,parks,playgrounds and other recreational works,refineries,chemical plants and similar industrial plants requiring specialized engineering knowledge and skill,powerhouses,power plants and other utility plants and installations,mines and metallurgical plants,land leveling and earthmoving projects,excavating,grading,trenching,paving and surfacing work and cement and concrete works in connection with the above mentioned fixed works,italics added.the list of fixed works in section is not exhaustive.ron yates construction superior court d,yates.
in contrast to a general contractor,a specialty contractor is a contractor whose operations involve the performance of construction work requiring special skill and whose principal contracting business involves the use of specialized building trades or crafts,subd.a.the california code of regulations further subdivides specialty contracting work into subclassifications,tit.
as is pertinent here,a n earthwork and paving contractor digs,moves,and places material forming the surface of the earth,other than water,in such a manner that a cut,fill,excavation,grade,trench,backfill,or tunnel if incidental thereto can be executed,including the use of explosives for these purposes.this classification includes the mixing,fabricating and placing of paving and any other surfacing materials,tit.
pacific argues that its class a general engineering contactor license sufficed for this project and that the lesser or specialty license would have been superfluous as it is fully encompassed within the class a license requirements.bernards counters that the prime contract between the county and its engineers required that the subcontractor performing the temporary excavation and support works have a class specialty license,and where pacific did not hold a class license,it was not duly licensed irrespective of pacific class a license.we agree with pacific.
t he interpretation and application of a statutory scheme to an undisputed set of facts is a question of law which is subject to de novo review on appeal.citation.conditioning,auburn union school dist.th.a fundamental rule of statutory construction is that l egislative intent should be determined from the language of the statute.citations.significance should be given,in doing so,to the section as a whole and to every word,phrase or clause thereof,leaving no part or provision useless or deprived of meaning.citations.yates,supra,d at.moreover,a regulation can not restrict or enlarge the scope of a statute.citations.citation.although the board was authorized to adopt rules and regulations to effect the classification of contractors,it is the statute which defines a contractor and even an administrative ruling contrary to the terms thereof would be ineffective.citations.id.at.
this court addressed a very similar issue in yates and our opinion provides important guidance here.yates was a class a licensee,but did not hold a class b license for construction of residences yates contracted to build a septic tank,a seawall,and a foundation consisting of eight caissons for a residence along the shoreline in malibu.yates,supra,cal.app d at.after yates substantially completed the work,the owners refused to pay and sued him for breach of contract.id.at.at issue was whether yates could properly build a residence foundation with a class a,but not a class b license.yates argued that the work required specialized knowledge of a class a licensee because of the unstable nature of the land and the high water tables where the foundation must be anchored to the bedrock.id.at.we agreed with yates.id.at.
we based our reasoning on the statutory language of sections and concerning the class a and class b licenses and on the legislative history.yates,supra,d at.we concluded that while section,defining a general engineering contractor,did not contain a finite list of the categories of fixed works yates,supra,at,it modified the type of fixed works by specifying that such works requir e specialized engineering knowledge and skill.ibid.we also reviewed the test for class a licensees and discovered it included knowledge of foundation work whereas the test for a class b license did not.id.at.accordingly,we held that a general engineering contractor which possesses a class a license may contract to construct a foundation for a residence if it requires specialized engineering knowledge and skill and so the trial court erred in ruling that yates was not properly licensed to build the caisson foundation for the homeowners residence.id.at.according to yates,a fixed work requiring specialized engineering knowledge and skill falls within the scope of work of a class a licensee.id.at.
comparing a class a and class license,specialized engineering knowledge and skill is not required of the latter,tit,see people vis d,construction industry embraces numerous specialized crafts requiring certain arts and skills falling in specialty contractor classification.nowhere in the board definition of an earthmoving and paving contractor is specialized engineering knowledge or skill mentioned.reviewing the study guides for class a and class contractors state license examinations,and the board job descriptions for these licensees,as we did in yates yates,supra,d at,these publications indicate that although a class a contractor is required to have knowledge of basic engineering principles and seismic safety,shoring and sloping,a class licensee is not.
furthermore,class a licensees are permitted to engage in the same work as the class license.section includes in its list of activities of a class a licensee leveling and earthmoving projects,excavating,grading,trenching,paving and surfacing work and cement and concrete works when done in connection with fixed works requiring specialized engineering knowledge and skill.thus,although both the class a and class contractors may dig and pave,only class a licensee may engage in land leveling and earthmoving,excavation,grading,and trenching when it demands specialized engineering knowledge and skill.stated otherwise,a general engineering contractor who possess a class a license may contract to provide temporary excavation and support requiring specialized engineering knowledge and skill.yates,supra,d at.
comparing pacific subcontract to the words of section and title,california code of regulations,section,the subcontract required specialized engineering knowledge and skill.pacific was expected to provide calculations that clearly disclose such information as interpreted subsurface conditions and geotechnical design parameters,factors of safety,assumptions,design criteria,overstress values and tolerances.along with these calculations,pacific was also to provide temporary support,which is not within the expertise of a class contractor.the subcontract required of pacific activities that fall beyond the purview of the class contractor but within expertise of the class a licensee.therefore,pacific class a license enabled it to provide temporary excavation and support for the hospital project because it required pacific to utilize specialized engineering knowledge and skill and provide more than those activities falling under the definition of a class license.
bernards argues that yates and other cases pacific cites did not address
