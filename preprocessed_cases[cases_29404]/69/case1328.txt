peninsula communications,peninsula,owner of several alaska radio stations,appeals the district court orders denying its motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,denying its motions to stay,and issuing a preliminary injunction ordering it to cease operation of certain of its stations.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a,and we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
the united states sued peninsula below for an injunction requiring peninsula to comply with an order by the federal communications commission fcc that peninsula cease operating seven fm translator radio stations the government filed its suit under the authority of section of the communications act of,et,which permits the united states attorney general to apply to federal district courts for injunctions to enforce orders of the fcc.
peninsula is an alaskan broadcasting company that owns nine translators as well as the translators two primary fm stations until,peninsula ownership of both the translators and their primary stations was permitted by fcc licensing rules.in that year,however,the fcc revised d to provide that a n authorization for an fm translator whose coverage contour extends beyond the protected contour of the commercial primary station will not be granted to the licensee or permittee of a commercial fm radio broadcast station.fed.reg,december.the new rule was effective june,with previously licensed translators required to comply no later than june.see id.at and see fcc rcd,wl.
in november of,peninsula filed renewal license applications with the fcc for its nine translator stations and two primary stations.in september,the fcc determined that because peninsula owned both the translators and their primary stations,the licenses for the translator stations could not be renewed unless peninsula assigned them to another entity.the fcc also concluded at that time that peninsula had been operating the translators in violation of d since june,the date by which all translators were to be in compliance with the new rule 
peninsula then filed assignment applications so it could transfer the translators to a different owner and thereby bring them into compliance with section d.the fcc approved the proposed assignments.in november,the fcc granted the license renewal applications conditioned on consummation of the assignments,stating that failure to meet the divestiture condition would render the grants null and void.
thereafter,the proceedings before the fcc took a rather complex procedural turn,the details of which are not relevant here.in short,peninsula filed petitions with the fcc and an appeal to the united states circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit objecting to the conditions attached to renewal of peninsula translator licenses.the fcc denied peninsula petitions,and because of procedural complications,the circuit dismissed peninsula appeal.
ultimately,peninsula petitions to the fcc resulted in the fcc issuance in may of a memorandum opinion and order and order to show cause may decision.in re peninsula communications,rcd,wl.in the may decision,the fcc determined that it was unlikely that peninsula would ever consummate transfer of the translator licenses.based on this conclusion,it rescinded the conditional grants of peninsula renewal applications with respect to seven of the translators,and ordered that peninsula cease operating them by midnight on may,peninsula did not terminate operation of the seven translators as ordered and has continued to operate them to date.on june,peninsula filed an appeal of the may decision to the circuit as permitted by.
in july,pursuant to the procedure for enforcing fcc orders set forth in b the united states filed the action below in the united states district court for the district of alaska seeking an injunction to enforce the terms of the fcc may order.the district court denied peninsula motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,denied its motions to stay,and on october,issued a preliminary injunction ordering peninsula to immediately cease operating the seven fm translator stations 
peninsula argues the district court erred in denying its motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the existence of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law reviewed de novo.harden roadway package,cir.a district court findings of fact relevant to its determination of subject matter jurisdiction are reviewed for clear error.la reunion francaise sa barnes,cir.
peninsula submits two arguments in support of its contention that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this action.first,peninsula argues that a federal district court lacks jurisdiction over a complaint to enforce an order under where that same order has been appealed to the circuit under.
under section b,if any person fails to obey an order of the fcc,the united states attorney general may apply to the appropriate district court for an injunction to enforce the order.under section b,an aggrieved party may appeal an order of the fcc to the circuit.according to peninsula,we should understand these statutes to operate so that the fact of filing of an appeal of an fcc order to the circuit divests a district court of jurisdiction to enforce the same order.peninsula arguments are based almost entirely on its reading of the statutory language of and 
we reject peninsula interpretation of the interplay between sections and of the communications act of.nothing in the language of sections or suggests that concurrent suits such as the ones peninsula was involved with here were not envisioned by the act.rather than creating a system of conflicting jurisdiction,the two provisions operate to permit parallel concurrent suits in the district court and the circuit.we are persuaded in reaching this conclusion by the sixth circuit view that u nder the scheme envisioned by the act,the district court powers and the circuit powers are complementary rather than contradictory.united states szoka,cir.we also note that fcc orders are effective on the date of their release unless noted otherwise.see id.at,citing a,b.filing an appeal under section does not excuse a broadcaster from complying with the fcc order absent a decision by the circuit to stay the order.see c giving circuit power to enjoin enforcement of the fcc order if it finds such relief just and proper.it is consistent with the act scheme of complementary powers that a broadcaster choosing to disobey an fcc order,while the order is on appeal but has not been stayed,might simultaneously be subjected to an enforcement suit in a district court.peninsula offers no convincing reason why we should conclude that the appeal of an fcc order to the circuit under section divests a district court of jurisdiction to enforce the order under section.
peninsula second subject matter jurisdiction argument is,like the first one,based on the interaction between sections and.peninsula urges that even if the court below generally has subject matter jurisdiction over this enforcement action,it lacks subject matter jurisdiction to decide the specific issue of whether the order was regularly made under section b.because the finding that an fcc order was regularly made is necessary to issuance of an injunction under section b,if peninsula is correct,and the district court lacked jurisdiction to decide that specific issue,then it was error to issue the injunction against peninsula below.
peninsula contends that the language of section c supports its position.that provision reads,in relevant part,that upon filing a notice of appeal with the circuit,the circuit shall have jurisdiction of the proceedings and of the questions determined therein c emphasis added.peninsula argues that this statutory language should be interpreted to mean that once a question is raised before the circuit,a district court acting under section loses jurisdiction to consider that question.the overlapping question here,according to peninsula,is whether the fcc is,the may valid because it was issued without a hearing peninsula claims that once it brought this issue before the circuit,the district court lost juris
