teva pharmaceuticals usa,teva along with ranbaxy pharmaceuticals,and ranbaxy laboratories limited collectively,ranbaxy appeal from the order of the united states district court for the district of new jersey granting a motion for a preliminary injunction filed by pfizer,pfizer and company,to prevent teva and ranbaxy from infringing united states patent the patent.pfizer,teva pharms.usa,preliminary injunction order pfizer,teva pharms.usa,bench decision.at this preliminary stage in the proceedings,we neither find error in the district court claim construction,nor do we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in determining that infringement is likely and that the harm and public interest favors enjoining teva and ranbaxy.we therefore affirm the grant of the preliminary injunction.
background 
the patent relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors such as quinapril and their methods of manufacture.quinapril and other ace inhibitors can be used to treat hypertension,commonly known as high blood pressure.according to the patent,however,many ace inhibitors including quinapril are susceptible to degradation due to cyclization,hydrolysis,and oxidation.cyclization occurs when one part of an ace inhibitor compound reacts with a different part of the same compound to form a degraded,inactive cyclized compound.hydrolysis and oxidation involve reactions with water and oxygen,respectively.hydrolysis results in a degraded compound,and oxidation causes discoloration.
the patent discloses minimizing cyclization,hydrolysis,and discoloration by using formulations containing a stabilizer and a saccharide.according to the patent,the stabilizer prevents both cyclization and discoloration,while the saccharide prevents hydrolysis.a contemporaneous report,summarizing the research by the inventors eventually named on the patent,describes how the inventors came to these conclusions.the report explains that the inventors initially attempted to prevent quinapril drug formulations from decomposing due to cyclization and discoloration.the inventors first suspected that moisture caused these problems and so developed a dry formulation.they chose excipients known to have low moisture content,employing anhydrous lactose as a filler and microcrystalline cellulose as a dry binder.the formulation continued to degrade,however.eventually the inventors discovered that the two problems,cyclization and discoloration,could be prevented by including magnesium carbonate in the formulations.use of magnesium carbonate,however,resulted in a new,third problem hydrolysis.to reduce hydrolysis successfully,the inventors added various proportions of an inert diluent,lactose.the resulting composition thus eliminated all three problems cyclization,discoloration,and hydrolysis,which owns the patent,now markets the resulting quinapril formulation as accupril

on january,teva sought approval from the food and drug administration fda to market a generic version of accupril by filing an abbreviated new drug application anda pursuant to the amendments to the federal food,drug and cosmetic act because teva was the first company to file an anda for the generic version of accupril,teva was entitled to a generic market exclusivity period pursuant to j b iv.as this court recently explained 
the exclusivity period typically begins on the date of the first commercial marketing of the drug by the first applicant.j b iv.the original amendments provided that the commencement of the exclusivity period could also be triggered by the date of a decision of a court holding the patent which is the subject of the certification to be invalid or not infringed.id.
teva phteva pharms.usa,pfizer,along with the anda,teva simultaneously filed a paragraph iv certification pursuant to the requirements of j a vii iv,asserting that the patent is invalid under and.
on march,responded by suing teva in the district of new jersey for infringement of the patent under e a.during the course of those proceedings,teva and initially presented diverging claim construction arguments to the district court.in particular,with respect to the claim terms saccharide and saccharides,teva advocated a construction that would encompass carbohydrates,including polysaccharides and sugars,as well as compounds derived from carbohydrates.for its part,simply argued that a saccharide is a sugar later,however,teva and stipulated to the following claim construction 
the word saccharide in claims and of the patent means a sugar,and specifically includes only lower molecular weight carbohydrates,specifically,mono and disaccharides and their simple derivatives,including such substances as lactose,sucrose,mannitol and sorbitol.
the district court entered this stipulation in an order dated may.the ultimate resolution of that separate case is not at issue in this appeal 
on december,in what would eventually lead to the instant action,ranbaxy sought fda approval to market its own generic version of accupril by filing its own anda and certifying that its product would not infringe the patent.ranbaxy sent a paragraph iv certification letter on april,explaining why ranbaxy believed its product would not infringe the patent.ranbaxy letter indicated that it had adopted and relied upon the construction of saccharide had previously stipulated to in its case against teva.did not respond to ranbaxy letter or sue ranbaxy within days of receiving the letter,which would have triggered a stay of approval of ranbaxy anda.see j b iii.
ranbaxy eventually approached teva to solicit teva assistance in marketing ranbaxy product,and on august,the two entered into a distribution and supply agreement.later,on december,teva relinquished its potential generic market exclusivity period,resulting in final fda approval of ranbaxy anda.the next day,teva began marketing ranbaxy product.
in response,pfizer,the corporate parent of,and hereinafter,collectively sued ranbaxy and teva hereinafter,collectively ranbaxy on january,for infringement of the patent.shortly thereafter,filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.the district court granted the motion on march,and issued a detailed explanation of the reasons for granting the motion on march.see bench decision preliminary injunction order.
the court construed saccharide,as the term is used in claim,and saccharides,as the term is used in claim,to include mono,di,tri,and polysaccharides.in doing so,the court simultaneously rejected both the stipulated construction previously entered in the separate case and ranbaxy proposed construction of sugars,including the lower molecular carbohydrates,specifically disaccharides.the court found that is likely to prove that ranbaxy product literally infringes claims and under its construction given that the accused product includes microcrystalline cellulose,a polysaccharide.because the court rejected ranbaxy contention that claim requires to show that microcrystalline cellulose inhibits hydrolysis,it concluded that there could be little question that the ranbaxy formulation literally infringes claim.the court noted that,in contrast,claim does require the claimed saccharide to inhibit hydrolysis,but credited expert testimony presented by as providing a persuasive opinion that microcrystalline cellulose does in fact inhibit hydrolysis.the court went on to determine that even if saccharides were construed to mean sugars,would likely be able to prove infringement of both claims and under the doctrine of equivalents.
after concluding that is likely to prove infringement of valid and enforceable claims the court proceeded to address remaining issues necessary for injunctive relief.it found that would suffer irreparable harm due to infringement of the patent.next,it found that the harm suffered by ranbaxy in being subject to the injunction would not outweigh the harm would suffer in the absence of the injunction.finally,it determined that granting the injunction was in the public interest since the injunction would further public policy inherent in the patent laws.
the court denied ranbaxy motion for a stay of the preliminary injunction.on march,after posted a bond,the preliminary injunction went into effect.ranbaxy timely appeals the grant of the preliminary injunction.we have jurisdiction to consider the appeal under c.
discussion 
courts have the power to grant injunctions to prevent the violation of patent rights.see.in considering whether to grant a preliminary injunction,a court must consider whether the patent owner has shown a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits the prospect of irreparable harm to the patent owner in the absence of the injunction that this harm would exceed harm to the alleged infringer when subject to the injunction and that granting the injunction is in the public interest,dillon,nutrition united states.
we review the grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.novo nordisk of,genentech.to overturn the grant of a preliminary injunction,we must find that the district court made a clear error of judgment in weighing the relevant factors or based its exercise of discretion on an error of law or on clearly erroneous factual findings.id.
ranbaxy first challenges the district court conclusion that is likely to succeed on the merits.to win on its claim of patent infringement,must present proof that ranbaxy infringed a valid and enforceable patent.nutrition,at.ranbaxy does not appeal the district court conclusion that the patent is likely valid and enforceable,but instead the district court finding that infringement is likely.determining the likelihood of infringement requires two steps,first claim construction and second a comparison of the properly construed claims to the accused product.see,at.
we begin with claim construction,a question of law reviewed de novo.cybor fas,en banc.when interpreting claims,we inquire into how a person of ordinary skill in the art would have understood claim terms at the time of the invention.phillips awh,en banc.the inquiry into how a person of ordinary skill in the art understands a claim term provides an objective baseline from which to begin claim interpretation.id.importantly,the person of ordinary skill in the art is deemed to read the claim term not only in the context of the particular claim in which the disputed term appears,but in the context of the entire patent,including the specification.id.
ranbaxy contests the district court construction of saccharide and saccharides as those terms are used in independent claims and.according to ranbaxy,the district court should have construed saccharides to mean sugars.in ranbaxy view sugars would include polysaccharides with up to ten monosaccharide units but would not include polysaccharides,such as microcrystalline cellulose,with more than ten monosaccharide units.
the claim language itself does not support ranbaxy proposed construction.t he claims themselves provide substantial guidance as to the meaning of particular claim terms.id.at.claim includes a suitable amount of a saccharide to inhibit hydrolysis,and claim includes one or more saccharides.it is important to note that the claims do not include the terms sugar or sugars.neither do the claims distinguish between polysaccharides having ten or less monosaccharide units and polysaccharides having more than ten monosaccharide units.
ranbaxy argues,however,that the district court erred by not adopting an explicit,narrow definition of saccharides set forth in the patent.it points to the following language in the patent saccharides,sugars.patent,ll.this language is located in a part of the patent discussing what the invention deals with.id.at.
this court has previously construed a disputed claim term by referencing use of in a patent specification.see abbott labs.novopharm.in that case,however,the court did not identify any support in the intrinsic evidence for a construction of the disputed claim term other than the construction linked to id.at.indeed,the problem with ranbaxy argument is that it ignores the fact that the person of ordinary skill in the art is deemed to have read the claim term in the context of the entire patent.phillips,at.see also sandisk memorex,the court must always read the claims in view of the full specification.emphasis added.i t is necessary to consider the specification as a whole,and to read all portions of the written description,if possible,in a manner that renders the patent internally consistent.budde.
notably,the patent includes the following discussion in a section entitled saccharides 
the saccharide components to be used in the pharmaceutical products and methods of the invention are substances which are compatible with the alkali or alkaline earth stabilizers.generally,they are substances which do not contain groups which could significantly interfere with the function of either the component or the drug component.mannitol,lactose,and other sugars are preferred.mixtures are operable.
patent,ll.by using the label saccharides,the patentee clearly intended for this section to address the meaning of the same term.
as a preliminary matter,the first two sentences of this section indicate that a broad construction of saccharides may be appropriate.the first sentence explains that saccharides are substances which are compatible with the alkali or alkaline earth stabilizers.id.at,ll.the second explains that saccharides are substances which do not contain groups which could significantly interfere with the function of either the component or the drug component.id.at,ll.particularly when compared to the parallel section labeled excipients,it is clear that these sentences do not affirmatively define what saccharides are,but instead negatively define what saccharides are not.the section addressing excipients similarly states that excipients are substances which must be compatible with the alkali or alkaline earth stabilizers so that it sic does not interfere with its sic function in the composition.id.at,ll.properly understood,then,these sections do not define the exact meaning of saccharides and excipients.nevertheless,by only indicating what substances should not be considered saccharides or excipients,the patentee has left open a vast array of substances that may be considered to be saccharides and excipients.
moreover,the section labeled saccharides indicates that the term saccharides should not be limited to sugars.the third sentence in this section states that mannitol,lactose,and other sugars are preferred.id.at.since mannitol is a sugar derivative and not a sugar,were we to accept ranbaxy proposed construction of sugars,we would exclude mannitol from the scope of the patent use of saccharides.this would be improper.a claim construction that excludes a preferred embodiment is rarely,if ever,correct.sandisk,at quoting vitronics conceptronic.
ranbaxy admits that mannitol is not a sugar.it nevertheless argues that the patentee labeled mannitol as a sugar,and that we should respect the patentees decision to do so.thus,according to ranbaxy,mannitol,lactose,and other sugars are preferred is,for the purpose of the patent,a list of like ingredients,sugars.
we are not convinced that one of ordinary skill in the art would understand the patentee to have classified mannitol as a sugar in this sentence.as the district court found and ranbaxy does not dispute on appeal,mannitol is not actually a sugar.on the other hand,lactose is a sugar.the reference to other sugars therefore appears to relate to the disclosure of lactose only.in short,the reference to other sugars does not mean that mannitol is a sugar or should be considered to be a sugar for purposes of the patent.
even if we concluded that ranbaxy reading of mannitol,lactose,and other sugars are preferred is correct and that mannitol,a sugar derivative,should be considered to be a sugar for the purpose of the patent,this sentence would only identify sugars as being preferred embodiments of saccharides.we hesitate to adopt a construction of saccharides that would be limited to disclosed preferred embodiments.see playtex,procter gamble.indeed,identifying sugars as preferred saccharides seems to indicate that there is a broader,albeit less preferred class of substances that are still saccharides.
extrinsic evidence in the form of technical dictionaries,treatises,and expert testimony supports the conclusion drawn from the patent that one of skill in the art would understand saccharides to encompass more than sugars.the district court reviewed the extrinsic evidence presented by the parties and found that one of skill in the art would understand saccharides to include polysaccharides.ranbaxy,however,points to specific examples of references and testimony that allegedly support its view that saccharides means sugars.
based on our review of the preliminary record,we do not disagree with the district court conclusion that a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand saccharides to encompass polysaccharides.the district court weighed the disclosures of the competing references and testimony and concluded that the general view is that the saccharides include polysaccharides.contrary to ranbaxy assertions,the district court did not err by referencing dictionary definitions of saccharides.as this court has held,judges may rely on dictionary definitions when construing claim terms,so long as the dictionary definition does not contradict any definition found in or ascertained by a reading of the patent documents.phillips,at quoting vitronics,at.and as discussed above,when read in the context of the entire patent,the reference to saccharides,sugars does not constitute a definition of saccharides.
furthermore,the district court conclusion that the general view is that the group of substances called saccharides includes polysaccharides appears to be well supported.as notes,many of the references cited by ranbaxy do not actually address the scope of the term saccharides.rather,they clarify that sugars and polysaccharides are both subclasses of the larger class of substances called carbohydrates.for example,one reference submitted by ranbaxy states that carbohydrates include both sugars and polysaccharides.as the district court noted,however,even that reference stated that t he carbohydrates are sometimes referred to as the saccharides.edward staunton west et,textbook of biochemistry macmillan ed.
ranbaxy faults the district court for relying on this text in view of its use of the word sometimes.ranbaxy also alleges that to reach its conclusion the district court was forced to ignore the next sentence in the reference,which explains that saccharide comes from the greek word sakcharon,meaning sugar.id.
we do not believe that the district court erred in its analysis.first,evidence that saccharides is sometimes used to refer to carbohydrates does support the conclusion that the patent in particular may be understood to have used saccharides to mean carbohydrates.thus,reliance on this disclosure to support the district court construction is not improper.second,understanding the historical origin of the term saccharides does not exactly answer the question of how one of ordinary skill in the art would interpret the term on the filing date of the patent.t he ordinary and customary meaning of a claim term is the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention,as of the effective filing date of the patent application.phillips,at.we therefore do not fault the district court for not considering the historical origin of saccharides to be dispositive of the term meaning to those skilled in the art.
to support its proposed construction,ranbaxy also points us to the construction of saccharides previously agreed upon by two of the parties to this case in separate litigation 
the word saccharide in claims and of the patent means a sugar,and specifically includes only lower weight carbohydrates,specifically,mono and disaccharides and their simple derivatives,including such substances as lactose,sucrose,mannitol and sorbitol.
ranbaxy asks us to adopt this construction in this appeal.
ranbaxy has not identified any legal doctrines that would compel us to adopt the stipulated construction.and to the extent ranbaxy argument addresses issue preclusion,we conclude that issue preclusion does not apply in this case.the district court noted that the stipulation presented to the court in the earlier litigation specifically stated that it was for the purposes of that litigation only.bench decision,slip op.at.because ranbaxy does not dispute this finding,issue preclusion can not apply to this case.t he scope of a consent decree must be discerned within its four corners and the conditions upon which a party has consented to waive its right to litigate particular issues must be respected.united states armour,d.see also in re graham,cir noting that the third circuit defers to the intent of parties concerning the preclusive effect of agreed facts or claims in consent decrees and stipulations.while we do not fault ranbaxy to the extent it may have adopted or relied upon the stipulated construction of saccharide,that stipulation does not define the scope of the invention claimed in the patent for purposes of this case.
ranbaxy additionally contends that the district court claim construction would render the claims invalid for lack of enablement under.in phillips,this court stated 
while we have acknowledged the maxim that claims should be construed to preserve their validity,we have not applied that principle broadly,and we have certainly not endorsed a regime in which validity analysis is a regular component of claim construction.instead,we have limited the maxim to cases in which the court concludes,after applying all the available tools of claim construction,that the claim is still ambiguous.in such cases,we have looked to whether it is reasonable to infer that the pto would not have issued an invalid patent,and that the ambiguity in the claim language should therefore be resolved in a manner that would preserve the patent validity.
at citations and quotation marks omitted.both ranbaxy and were able to find at least some extrinsic evidence supporting their proposed constructions of saccharides.nevertheless,ranbaxy has not presented sufficient evidence for us reasonably to infer that,unless saccharides means sugars or at least does not encompass polysaccharides,claim and would have been considered by the patent and trademark office pto to be invalid.we therefore decline to apply the maxim in this case.
for the reasons discussed,we conclude that the district court did not err in construing saccharides to include polysaccharides.
we next consider whether the district court clearly erred in its comparison of the properly construed claims to the accused products and methods.to prove infringement,a patentee must show that an accused product or method meets every claim limitation either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.see dynacore holdings philips.
the district court did not clearly err in determining that is likely to prevail in its charge that ranbaxy literally infringes claim.ranbaxy conceded in the preliminary injunction hearing that its formulation absolutely literally infringes claim if saccharides is construed to include polysaccharides.given that concession and the fact that we have construed saccharides to include polysaccharides,we can not help but conclude that the district court was on solid ground in finding that it is likely that ranbaxy literally infringes claim.
the district court also did not clearly err in determining that is likely to prevail in its charge that ranbaxy literally infringes claim.in contrast to claim,claim specifically requires that a saccharide inhibit hydrolysis.in finding that the microcrystalline cellulose in ranbaxy formulation likely inhibits hydrolysis,the district court credited the testimony of one of experts,brenner,stating 
significantly,ranbaxy has offered no evidence countering brenner opinions concerning the manner in which hydrolysis is inhibited in its formulations.this is information peculiarly within ranbaxy possession.hydrolysis must be inhibited in its formulation otherwise it could not have submitted its anda to the fda.brenner gives a persuasive opinion that it is the saccharide microcrystalline cellulose that has this effect.ranbaxy offers nothing but speculation to counter his opinion.
bench decision,slip op.at.
ranbaxy challenges to the district court finding are easily rejected.ranbaxy first points out that brenner did not test ranbaxy product but instead relied upon tests conducted during previous cases involving two different products.but it is particularly appropriate at the preliminary injunction stage not to set a hard and fast rule that infringement can only be shown through quantitative testing of an accused product.water techs.calco,refusing to overturn a finding of infringement based on the lack of quantitative testing to determine the exact composition of the accused product.ranbaxy also contends that the district court improperly shifted to ranbaxy the burden of showing that microcrystalline cellulose does not inhibit hydrolysis.the district court,however,did no such thing.the district court weighed the evidence submitted by the parties.in doing so,the court was at least entitled,and probably even required,to consider the lack of evidence submitted by ranbaxy.
because we have held that the district court did not err in construing saccharides to include polysaccharides or abuse its discretion in concluding that literal infringement is likely,we need not respond to ranbaxy contention that the district court erred in its application of the doctrine of equivalents.we recognize,however,that the district court claim construction,as well as our claim construction,is based on a record developed at the preliminary injunction stage of this case.we also recognize that d istrict courts may engage in rolling claim construction,in which the court revisits and alters its interpretation of the claim terms as its understanding of the technology evolves.jack guttman,kopykake.indeed,a conclusion of law such as claim construction is subject to change upon the development of the record after a district court decision on a motion for preliminary injunction.id.citing purdue pharma boehringer ingelheim gmbh.thus,we find it prudent to address ranbaxy contention that the district court wrongly concluded that infringement under the doctrine of equivalents is likely.
the district court did not clearly err in holding in the alternative that,even if saccharides were construed to include sugars but not polysaccharides,ranbaxy likely infringes claims and under the doctrine of equivalents.ranbaxy argues that the district court erred in its analysis of claim by not assigning any function to saccharides for purposes of equivalency.it argues that the court should have assigned to saccharides the function of inhibiting hydrolysis.thus,in ranbaxy view the district court clearly erred in its analysis of both claim and claim because the evidence does not show that it is likely that microcrystalline cellulose inhibits hydrolysis.as discussed above with regard to literal infringement of claim,however,the district court did not clearly err in finding to the contrary.it was perfectly appropriate for the district court to credit the testimony of expert,brenner,explaining that microcrystalline cellulose does in fact inhibit hydrolysis.
ranbaxy also contends that as a matter of law microcrystalline cellulose can not be an equivalent of a saccharide because the patentee dedicated microcrystalline cellulose to the public by disclosing but not claiming its use in the patent.one alleged disclosure is a listing of modified cellulose derivatives as an example of a disintegrating agent.patent,ll.another is example c in the patent,which discloses a prior art composition containing microcrystalline cellulose.id.at,ll.the district court concluded that the patentee did not dedicate use of microcrystalline cellulose to the public because o nly those compounds or articles that are clearly identified as alternatives to what is actually claimed are subject to the bar against recapturing disclaimed subject matter using the doctrine of equivalents.bench decision,slip op.at.according to ranbaxy,however,our precedent is not so restrictive.ranbaxy argues we have not required that the patent expressly disclose the subject matter left unclaimed as an alternative to the claim limitation at issue.application of the rule is a question of law subject to de novo review.see toro white consol.
ranbaxy is correct to the extent it points out that our precedent addressing the rule appears to deal only with patents in which subject matter is disclosed as an alternative to the relevant claim limitation.see,johnson johnston assocs.serv,en banc psc computer,foxconn int l,toro,at.for example,in psc computer products this court answered the question of how specific a disclosure in a written description must be to dedicate matter to the public 
we hold that if one of ordinary skill in the art can understand the unclaimed disclosed teaching upon reading the written description,the alternative matter disclosed has been dedicated to the public.this rule does not mean that any generic reference in a written specification necessarily dedicates all members of that particular genus to the public.the disclosure must be of such specificity that one of ordinary skill in the art could identify the subject matter that had been disclosed and not claimed.
at.this court found that the generic disclosure of a class of unclaimed alternatives,other resilient materials,does not necessarily dedicate all members of that class to the public.on the other hand,the court did find specifically disclosed but unclaimed alternatives,molded plastic parts,to have been dedicated to the public when only metal parts were claimed.id.the court reasoned that a reader of ordinary skill in the art could reasonably conclude from language in the written description that plastic clip parts could be substituted for metal clip parts.id.
this case presents a slightly different scenario generic and specific disclosures of subject matter,but subject matter that is not specifically identified as being an alternative to a claim limitation.nevertheless,in psc computer products the driving force behind the court holding was the public notice function of patents.id.and in our view,the public notice function of patents suggests that before unclaimed subject matter is deemed to have been dedicated to the public,that unclaimed subject matter must have been identified by the patentee as an alternative to a claim limitation.
in this case,even if saccharides were construed to mean sugars,ranbaxy has not pointed to parts of the patent where the inventors identify microcrystalline cellulose as an unclaimed alternative that would function as a saccharide preventing hydrolysis.as the district court found,modified cellulose derivatives are only discussed as examples of a disintegrating agent,one of various optional excipients.patent.furthermore,while example c identifies microcrystalline cellulose as an ingredient in a particular formulation,we are not convinced that one of ordinary skill in the art would come to the conclusion that the inventors have identified microcrystalline cellulose in that formulation as an alternative to a saccharide that prevents hydrolysis.the patent states that example c discloses a standard,prior art formulation without the addition of a stabilizer of the present invention.id.at,ll.indeed,the ingredient list does not include magnesium carbonate,and the patent does not contend that example c prevents cyclization.see id.at,ll.instead,example c appears to correspond to the first,unsuccessful formulation devised by the inventors in an atte
