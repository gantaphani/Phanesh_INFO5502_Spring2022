this appeal presents the question of whether a punitive damages verdict,in a title vii sexual harassment case in which only nominal damages were awarded,comports with due process.given the statutory scheme that governs punitive damages in title vii cases and the circumstances of this case,we conclude that the award does not violate due process.we affirm the judgment of the district court.
asarco,llc asarco operates the mission mine complex in sahuarita,arizona,near tucson.mission mine includes a copper mine from which copper ore is extracted and a mill facility in which the ore is crushed,filtered,and refined.angela aguilar worked at the mission mine complex from december through november.she started as a mill laborer and became a car loader operator in march.a month later,she then became a filter operator in the filter plant and two months later,a rod and ball mill person.aguilar alleges that during her time at asarco,she was subjected to sexual harassment,retaliation,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and was constructively discharged from her employment.
the state of arizona filed suit against asarco under the arizona civil rights act in pima county superior court,alleging harassment,disparate treatment,and retaliation against aguilar.aguilar subsequently filed her own lawsuit against asarco,alleging harassment,constructive discharge,and retaliation under title vii.the proceedings were consolidated and removed to the united states district court for the district of arizona.
after an trial,the jury found asarco liable on aguilar sexual harassment claims,in violation of,but not on her constructive discharge or retaliation claims.the jury awarded no compensatory damages,but awarded in nominal and in punitive damages.the jury was instructed on the standard for granting punitive damages found in b.following the judgment,asarco filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law,contending,in part,that the punitive damages award was unconstitutionally excessive.in the alternative,it urged the court to grant a new trial because of evidentiary errors.
the district court rejected the motion for judgment as a matter of law.applying the due process analysis in bmw of north america,gore,it concluded the punitive damages award was not unconstitutional but,given the cap on compensatory and punitive damages found in b d,reduced the award to.the court also rejected asarco new trial motion,and granted aguilar request for injunctive relief,directing asarco to update its harassment policies.finally,the court granted aguilar motion for attorneys fees and costs,in the total amount of.
asarco timely appealed,arguing that the district court erred by refusing to reduce the punitive damages award further,by admitting evidence of other employees who witnessed pornographic graffiti,and by awarding aguilar attorneys fees.a panel of this court affirmed the district court as to the evidence and attorneys fees,but vacated the punitive damages award.applying the three factors found in gore,the panel majority concluded that while asarco conduct was reprehensible,the ratio of to between the punitive and nominal damages awards was excessive.arizona asarco llc,cir.citing to the highest ratio it could locate among discrimination cases,to in abner kansas city,cir,the majority reduced the award to.asarco,at.dissenting in part,judge hurwitz stated that he would affirm the entire judgment in light of the applicable statutory cap,which provides employers with notice of the penalties they could face for title vii violations.id.at hurwitz,concurring in part and dissenting in part.

applying gore,asarco argues that the district court erred in upholding the jury punitive damages award,which the court then reduced to because of the statutory cap on damages contained in.at oral argument,asarco argued the award should be reduced far below the awarded by the panel,an amount which it contends is still constitutionally excessive.asarco also argues the award should be reduced below the per offense punitive damages amount awarded in mendez county of san bernardino,cir.
in gore,the supreme court altered the legal punitive damages landscape,applying the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to a state court million punitive damages award accompanying a compensatory damages award arising from state common law claims,and concluding that the punitive damages amount was grossly excessive and therefore unconstitutional.at.to assess the constitutionality of a state common law punitive damages award,the court in gore employed three guideposts,which it later summarized in state farm mutual automobile insurance campbell,as follows the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant misconduct the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award and the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.id.citing gore,at.
under gore and state farm,the most important guidepost is reprehensibility.state farm articulated several factors courts could consider in assessing the egregiousness of a defendant conduct 
the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident and the harm was the result of intentional malice,trickery,or deceit,or mere accident.
as for the second factor the disparity between the harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award the court has repeatedly eschewed the adoption of a ratio which a punitive damages award can not exceed.id.at.nevertheless,the court has noted that,in practice,few awards exceeding a ratio between punitive and compensatory damages,to a significant degree,will satisfy due process.id.the court also cautioned,however,that a higher ratio may be appropriate where the conduct is especially egregious,but results in minimal economic damages.id.citing gore,u.at,for the proposition that economic awards may be small because the injury is hard to quantify or detect.
gore is undeniably of some relevance in this context.see,cooper,at applying gore to a due process challenge to punitive damages awarded in a federal lanham act suit payne jones,cir assessing a claim that a punitive damages award was excessive by,in part,looking to the gore factors.indeed,it is conceivable that even awards conferred under a carefully crafted statutory scheme governing punitive damages could fail to comport with due process.
still,this case presents a different question than the supreme court considered in gore.here,aguilar has asserted a claim under a statute,title vii,which includes a carefully crafted provision,that imposes a cap on punitive damages.the landscape of our review is different when we consider a punitive damages award arising from a statute that rigidly dictates the standard a jury must apply in awarding punitive damages and narrowly caps compensatory damages and punitive damages.see abner,at noting that,through,congress has effectively set the tolerable proportion in title vii cases and that,because the statutory cap does not offend due process,the gore analysis is irrelevant see generally joseph seiner,punitive damages,due process,and employment discrimination,iowa,arguing that,after exxon shipping baker,and in light of,courts need not reach the due process issues raised in gore and state farm when addressing employment discrimination claims brought under title vii.
in resolving asarco due process challenge in the title vii context,we start with the constitutional concerns underlying the court due process analysis in gore and state farm.first and foremost,the court developed the gore doctrine out of a concern that a defendant receive fair notice not only of the conduct that will subject him to punishment,but also the severity of the penalty that may be imposed.gore,at.the court was also interested in avoiding arbitrary,biased,or deprivation of property of defendants by juries when the statute or common law did not provide sufficient safeguards.state farm,at.the court sought to uphold the deterrence function of punitive damages awards,while policing awards that exceed an amount necessary to deter future wrongdoing.gore,at.
in gore,the court also discussed the reasoning underlying each of its three guideposts.the court noted that its reprehensibility guidepost attempts to align the punitive damages award with the severity of the wrongful act.id.at.as for the ratio guidepost,the court declined to apply a bright line rule,while acknowledging the general goal of making punitive damages proportional to the actual injury suffered.id.at.the court noted that the ratio could be higher if the injury is hard to detect or the monetary value of noneconomic harm might be difficult to determine,and that the general aim of the ratio guidepost is reasonableness.id.at internal quotation marks omitted see also state farm,at r atios greater than those we have previously upheld may comport with due process where a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages.quoting gore,at.finally,in articulating its third guidepost,directing courts to take into account analogous civil or criminal penalties for comparable misconduct,the court highlighted the importance of according substantial deference to legislative judgments concerning appropriate sanctions for the conduct at issue.gore,at internal quotation marks omitted.
an exacting gore review,applying the three guideposts rigorously,may be appropriate when reviewing a common law punitive damages award.however,when a punitive damages award arises from a robust statutory regime,the rigid application of the gore guideposts is less necessary or appropriate.thus,the more relevant first consideration is the statute itself,through which the legislature has spoken explicitly on the proper scope of punitive damages.
in some instances,a statute may leave gaps,or room,for the common law to shape the scope of punitive damages awards,within the boundaries of due process.see,exxon,at adopting,in the area of federal maritime law,a to ratio between compensatory and punitive damages.but here,the statutory scheme leaves little to the imagination.id.at stevens,concurring in part and dissenting in part arguing that,since federal maritime law is largely statutory,congress decision not to restrict the availability of a particular remedy favors adherence to a policy of judicial restraint,and implicitly stating that the role of the court is equally,if not more,limited when congress has reined in a remedy explicitly.
when we examine,it becomes readily apparent why awards under the statute comport with due process.first,the statute clearly sets forth the type of conduct,and,a defendant must have to be found liable for punitive damages.b a complaining party may recover punitive damages under this section against a respondent if the complaining party demonstrates that the respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice or discriminatory practices with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual.
second,the statute sets a cap on certain types of compensatory damages,combined with punitive damages.b capping the sum of the amount of compensatory damages awarded under this section for pecuniary losses,emotional pain,suffering,inconvenience,mental anguish,loss of enjoyment of life,and other nonpecuniary losses,along with punitive damages.the cap tops out at for employers having more than employees,like asarco.id.b d.the cap drops down to as low as for employers with more than,but fewer than,employees.id.b a.
these two aspects of the statute address gore concern that defendants be on notice of what conduct might make them liable for punitive damages and the extent to which they might be held liable.the punitive damages provision codified at was enacted in.since that time,employers have been on notice regarding the type of conduct that could subject them to liability,the level of mental culpability or intentionality required,and the dollar amount to which they could be subjected,if they violate the law.seiner,supra,at noting that the punitive damages award amendments to title vii have been in place for two decades and that e mployers are on notice,then,that if they intentionally discriminate they can be subjected to the punitive penalties set forth in.
moreover,the statute dramatically reduces the chance of random,arbitrary awards,because the statute articulates the degree of culpability that a defendant must have before being subject to liability and restricts damages awards to a range between and.cush crawford adchem,cir to the extent that courts worried about unleashing juries to award limitless punitive damages in cases where no harm had occurred,this concern is eliminated by the imposition of the statutory caps.similarly,the odds of are low,given the statute narrow circumscription of punitive damages awards.in sum,the general constitutional concerns underlying gore are addressed by the provisions of.
the same is true of gore guidelines.section satisfies gore concern that conduct must be reprehensible by imposing an intent requirement that ensures jurors understand that only certain negative conduct should be penalized.in addition,the statutory scheme provides that conduct in violation of the statute,which subjects the employer to compensatory damages,does not necessarily compel a punitive damages award.b establishing an explicit requirement that punitive damages be awarded only if the defendant acted with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual.
gore ratio analysis has little applicability in the title vii context because governs punitive damages.when a statute narrowly describes the type of conduct subject to punitive liability,and reasonably caps that liability,it makes little sense to formalistically apply a ratio analysis devised for unrestricted state common law damages awards.that logic applies with special force here because the statute provides a consolidated cap on both compensatory and punitive damages.see id.b applying the cap to the sum of punitive damages and certain compensatory damages.under a gore ratio analysis,the amount constitutionally available for a punitive damages award increases proportionately to the harm.but b produces the opposite result as the award for specified compensatory damages increases,the amount available for a punitive damages award decreases the greater the harm,the less the punitive damages award.by establishing a consolidated damages cap that includes both specified compensatory and punitive damages,congress supplanted traditional ratio theory and effectively obviated the need for a gore ratio examination.
in addition,as the fifth circuit noted in abner,at,title vii violations often result in injuries that are difficult to quantify in physical terms.when only nominal damages are awarded,application of a gore ratio analysis is not appropriate.id.at concluding that in punitive damages cases where quantifiable compensatory damages are so impossible to calculate that only nominal damages are awarded,a inquiry becomes irrelevant.
nominal damages are not intended to compensate a plaintiff for injuries,nor to act as a measure of the severity of a defendant wrongful conduct.cummings connell,cir.because nominal damages measure neither damage nor severity of conduct,it is not appropriate to examine the ratio of a nominal damages award to a punitive damages award saunders branch banking trust of,cir noting that when a jury only awards nominal damages a punitive damages award may e
