michael waddle appeals from the judgment of the district court granting injunctive and declaratory relief to heartland academy community church and cns international ministries,collectively,heartland.we affirm.
the facts leading up to this lawsuit are set forth in great detail in the district court memorandum and order,heartland academy community church waddle,d.briefly,in october,waddle,as chief juvenile officer for the second circuit of missouri,effected the removal of boarding students from heartland christian academy hca,an educational facility owned and operated by heartland.although waddle had obtained ex parte orders to remove some of the boarding students and also to remove some students who were no longer at hca and others who were not even within the jurisdiction of juvenile authorities because of their ages,there were no orders of any kind to remove many of the students who were taken from the school that day.the removal action was without notice to heartland,the students,or their parents and was taken because of several allegations of mistreatment and abuse of students at hca.
soon after the removal,heartland sought and received a temporary restraining order tro in the district court.after a hearing,the district court entered a final preliminary injunction enjoining waddle and others from seeking or participating in any removal of all boarding children from hca unless all boarding children at hca are directly involved in the underlying facts that serve as the basis for such removal.heartland acad.cmty.church waddle,cir heartland i quoting the district court order.on appeal,we affirmed.id.at.
in its third amended complaint,heartland sought declaratory and injunctive relief against waddle and others under for alleged violations of the first,fourth,and fourteenth amendments.the district court held a full trial on the merits of heartland claims.the court found that waddle appears ready and willing to once again remove the children from heartland,if the circumstances were the same as they were at the time of the mass removal on october.heartland,d at.because the court determined that waddle actions in october violated the constitutional rights of heartland and its students,the court granted heartland a permanent injunction and declaratory relief.the injunction,in its entirety,reads 
hereafter,mike waddle,or any juvenile officer acting at his direction,shall not cause or attempt to cause the or removal of or take into protective custody any child or children from heartland academy or cns international industries,without reasonable cause to believe that each child for whom protective custody or removal is sought is in imminent danger of suffering serious physical harm,threat to life from abuse or neglect,or has been sexually abused or is in imminent danger of sexual abuse.
waddle appeals.we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.to the extent that the issues raise mixed questions of fact and law,we review de novo.
initially,waddle makes a series of arguments challenging the jurisdiction of the federal courts and contending that he has immunity from suit.
in the first appeal of this case,we rejected the challenge waddle made to jurisdiction under the doctrine which prohibits review of a judgment.we held that the injunctive relief heartland was seeking would not interfere with a judgment and so the district court did not need to take on any issue actually litigated in the state courts or any claim inextricably intertwined with such an issue in deciding whether to grant the requested relief.heartland i,at.that remained true at the subsequent trial on heartland request for permanent prospective injunctive relief.in this appeal,waddle acknowledges our holding but suggests that this court retract its statement.brief of appellant at.nothing has occurred since the first appeal that would compel us to do so.we therefore reiterate our holding that the doctrine has no effect on jurisdiction in this case.
waddle argues that the district court should also have refused to hear this case on general principles of comity.id.at.he claims that the injunction interferes with his authority and thus with the authority given to the juvenile court.id.at.waddle then proceeds to make an abstention argument.neither comity nor abstention is discussed anywhere in the district court memorandum and order.
the comity doctrine teaches that one court should defer action on causes properly within its jurisdiction until the courts of another sovereignty with concurrent powers,and already cognizant of the litigation,have had an opportunity to pass upon the matter.rhines weber,d citations to quoted cases omitted.here,no one has sought to invoke the jurisdiction of the state court to address the federal constitutional questions presented.heartland does not challenge any state laws or rules,judgments or orders,or anything else that a state court should address in the first instance,so there are no issues of comity in this case.and as we said in our first opinion,to the extent waddle seeks abstention on some other ground,we see no abuse of discretion.heartland i,at see haw.hous.auth.midkiff,d standard of review.
waddle also seeks eleventh amendment sovereign immunity as a state official sued in his official capacity,citing ex parte young.but the ex parte young doctrine describes an exception to eleventh amendment immunity for a state official where the relief sought is prospective and not compensatory.pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d.a federal court may therefore issue an injunction to prevent state officials from violating the constitution without running afoul of the eleventh amendment.green mansour,d see also dalton,cir.although the juvenile officer may have limited immunity from liability for damages,there is no reason to extend that immunity to liability for equitable relief.citation omitted,cert.denied,d.an injunction to prevent a state officer from doing that which he has no legal right to do is not an interference with the discretion of an officer.ex parte young,at.we agree with the district court and hold,as we did summarily in our prior opinion,heartland i,at,that eleventh amendment sovereign immunity is not a bar to suit in this case.
in another claim not addressed by the district court,waddle contends that he is entitled to absolute immunity from civil suit because he is a child services worker.in support of this proposition,he cites a case from the ninth circuit where the court compared social workers with criminal prosecutors and held that social workers are entitled to absolute immunity in performing functions connected with the initiation and pursuit of child dependency proceedings.coverdell dep t of soc.health,cir quoting meyers contra costa county dep t of soc,cir,cert.denied,d.we are not certain that the immunity afforded prosecutors for their work in bringing criminals to justice should be available to juvenile officers in civil removal proceedings that are unrelated to detaining juveniles for reasons of delinquency or their caretakers on criminal charges related to the care of the juveniles.but we do not reach that issue because heartland is not challenging waddle commencement of court proceedings per se.heartland complaints are with the ex parte nature of the proceedings and the information presented to the state court to justify the removal orders and,of course,a number of children were removed without benefit of even an ex parte order.whisman rinehart,cir holding that absolute prosecutorial immunity was not available to state juvenile officers who failed to investigate neglect allegations,detained the allegedly abused child,and delayed in filing proceedings.in any event,we conclude that the ninth circuit opinion is inapposite here.in coverdell,the defense was raised in response to the plaintiff claim for damages,not in defense of the request for an injunction.the dismissal of the plaintiff claim for injunctive relief was affirmed because it was found to be moot,not because the state actors were entitled to prosecutorial immunity.here,heartland is not seeking damages from waddle nor to punish him for his past judgment in effecting the mass removal of students from hca without notice or hearing.instead,heartland has sought and received only declaratory and prospective injunctive relief prohibiting waddle,as juvenile officer,from acting in violation of the constitution when and if he removes or directs the removal of children from heartland facilities in the future.see supreme of consumers union of the united states,d noting that prosecutors,as state enforcement officers,are natural targets for injunctive suits.waddle is not entitled to the absolute immunity he seeks.
waddle further maintains that the district court had no power to issue an injunction against him under because he is a judicial officer.that waddle,as a juvenile officer,was appointed by,and may at times work at the behest of,the state circuit court does not mean he is entitled to judicial immunity from suit in this case.we do not decide whether waddle may be entitled to judicial immunity for enforcing a valid court order.id.determining that a state supreme court and its chief justice were acting in their enforcement capacities when initiating proceedings against attorneys pursuant to court rules and so were not entitled to judicial immunity.heartland is challenging the manner in which waddle obtained the orders and therefore the validity of those orders and his failure in some cases to obtain court orders of any kind.waddle was certainly not acting as the functional equivalent of a judge qua judge not enforcer when he used bad information to obtain ex parte orders and then removed all boarding children from hca,including those for whom he had no court orders.see whisman,at.we affirm the district court denial of judicial immunity.
waddle next asserts that the district court erred in concluding that waddle violated heartland constitutional rights.without question,some of heartland constitutional claims are stronger than others,but any single violation of heartland federal constitutional rights in this case would be sufficient to sustain heartland claim for injunctive relief under.heartland alleged violation of four constitutional rights.
before considering the merits of heartland claimed fourth amendment violation,the district court reiterated its earlier ruling which we did not address in the first appeal that heartland had organizational standing to bring such a claim.heartland,d at.waddle argues that the court was wrong and that heartland can not assert a claim for the alleged violation of its students fourth amendment rights.
waddle cites two cases in his briefs for the proposition that associational or organizational standing is not available to heartland.in the eighth circuit case waddle cites,we reiterated our earlier decision in the same criminal case that a search by law enforcement officers was constitutional and that the cocaine evidence seized would not be suppressed.united states washington,cir citing the law of the case doctrine,cert.denied,d.as an alternate holding,the court noted that the defendant had no standing to challenge the search in any event because he had disclaimed ownership of the bag in question,and we did say,fourth amendment rights are personal and may not be vicariously asserted.id.quoting alderman united states,d alteration in washington.that statement in the context of a case considering the applicability of the exclusionary rule,a remedy used for fourth amendment violations in criminal cases but not in civil cases,is not controlling in this case.the supreme court has never held and neither have we that associational standing is not available to plaintiffs alleging fourth amendment violations.united states salvucci,d noting that the court in had discarded reliance on concepts of standing in determining whether a defendant is entitled to claim the protections of the exclusionary rule.
as waddle points out in his reply brief,the ninth circuit in mabe san bernadino county,department of public social services noted in a case that a mother had no standing to claim damages for a violation of her child fourth amendment rights when the child was removed from the mother home,cir.but the mabe court cited a criminal opinion for support of its statement.for the reasons just stated,we do not find that court decision persuasive here.
we conclude that associational standing is legally available to heartland on its fourth amendment claim,but we still must determine if the facts of this case qualify heartland to assert the fourth amendment rights of its students.to do so,we apply a test to those facts.see hunt.state apple adver.comm n,d.
first,it is clear that the individuals in question,the removed children,have standing to sue in their own right.id.next,the interests heartland seeks to protect are germane to the organization purpose.id.indeed,the school very survival could depend upon its success in getting the injunction it seeks.as we noted in heartland i,on the face of the complaint,the corporate plaintiffs alleged injury to themselves the imminent shutdown of hca as a result of waddle conduct.at.additional mass roundups of students such as the one that took place in october could well result in a significant loss of students.without students,there is no school.this court is satisfied that heartland has a stake in the resolution of the dispute,and thus is in a position to serve as waddle natural adversary.united food commercial workers union local brown group,d.finally,because heartland seeks only declaratory and prospective injunctive relief,the participation of individual students who were affected by the mass removal of students in is not required.n either the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.hunt,at.to the extent the district court decision to grant associational standing depends upon findings of disputed fact,we see no clear error.and we conclude that heartland has demonstrated that it has associational standing to assert the fourth amendment claims of its students.
we turn now to the merits of the fourth amendment claim against waddle.as for the students seized with ex parte court orders,the district court found that those orders were obtained by waddle and at his request with stale information,misinformation,and material omissions,provided or omitted by waddle.because of the manner in which the removal orders were obtained,the court held that the seizures were unreasonable and that waddle violated the fourth amendment in removing the children referenced in the orders.as for the children taken without even ex parte court orders,the court held that those seizures were not reasonable because there was neither probable cause nor exigent circumstances to justify the taking of children without court orders.upon review of the record in this case,we conclude that the court factual findings regarding the process employed by waddle in obtaining the ex parte orders are not clearly erroneous.likewise,upon de novo review,we see no error in the legal conclusions on the reasonableness of the seizures and the fourth amendment violation.
waddle next challenges the district court conclusion that he violated heartland substantive due process right to family integrity under the fourteenth amendment.again,waddle questions whether heartland has standing to bring this claim in its name.
we have recognized a right to familial relations,which includes the liberty interest of parents in the custody,care,and management of their children.king olmsted county,cir.and the supreme court held in pierce society of sisters that a private school could assert such a claim on its own behalf.the private school plaintiffs in that case challenged a state law that compelled the attendance of nearly all the state children at public schools.the court noted that the plaintiffs had business and property for which they claim protection,id.at,as is true for heartland.and as with the private schools in pierce,heartland interest is clear and immediate,and the injunctions here sought are not against the exercise of any proper power by the state.id.at.moreover,in this case,the students in question not only attend c
