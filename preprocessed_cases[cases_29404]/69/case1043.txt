winthrop leases computer systems and other technology equipment to corporate customers.after winthrop customers select their equipment,winthrop then purchases and leases the equipment to the customers.in june,eaton and winthrop entered into a master lease agreement the agreement provided that winthrop would purchase almost million of computer equipment that eaton selected.the parties also signed nine lease schedules,and issued pursuant to the master lease agreement each lease schedule identified particular pieces of equipment leased by eaton,and each incorporated the terms of the master lease by reference.each lease schedule listed the monthly amount eaton agreed to pay for the use of winthrop equipment.by executing the lease,both winthrop and eaton expressly agreed that each provision was binding and enforceable 
winthrop sued eaton on april,alleging that eaton breached the lease.specifically,winthrop claimed that eaton failed to meet numerous payment obligations,failed to properly maintain the equipment during possession,failed to properly package the equipment upon return,and impermissibly sold pieces of equipment in violation of the lease terms.eaton counterclaimed that winthrop breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,committed fraud,breached the contract,and violated various provisions of minnesota law.

in its counterclaim,eaton asserted that i winthrop failed to give notice and opportunity to cure the payment defaults ii it had procured manufacturer maintenance agreements msmas on the equipment and that winthrop purchased the msmas iii winthrop breached first iv the clv was an unenforceable penalty v the clv did not apply to equipment on terminated lease schedules.applying minnesota law,the district court rejected eaton arguments as insufficient to avoid liability and damages under the plain terms of the lease.
on april,the district court granted winthrop motion for summary judgment.the district court found that eaton breached the lease and that the clv damages provision was enforceable.the district court noted that eaton did not dispute that it had breached the lease.the court also noted that eaton did not dispute winthrop damages calculation.
winthrop subsequently filed a motion pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure and e requesting clarification of the damages award in the summary judgment and dismissal order.the district court awarded judgment on april,in the amount of,which included winthrop costs and attorney fees,less mitigation,because eaton failed to challenge winthrop calculation of damages.

iii.analysis 
eaton challenged only the and damages orders despite the parties extensive arguments in the arguments raised in and in defense of eaton rule e review de novo only the evidence and arguments that were before the district court when it made its determination in the orders challenged on appeal.see hagerman yukon energy,cir failure to raise an argument when contesting motion for summary judgment,and raising it only in a rule e motion does not preserve issue for de novo review on appeal.as such,this appeal turns on two core issues whether eaton defaulted under the contract,and whether the damages award was proper.
default under the lease 
the district court determined that eaton defaulted under section a of the lease by failing to make required lease,and payments for the equipment in,failing to properly pack,ship,and return all of the equipment as required in section,and failing to properly maintain the equipment under the msmas required in section 
eaton argues that it did not default under section a of the lease because,although it now concedes that it made late payments of lease charges,it argues for the first time here that section a required winthrop to give eaton notice and twenty days to cure any potential default.section a of the lease provides in pertinent part 
the occurrence of any of the following events shall constitute an event of default under this lease agreement or any lease schedule 
a the nonpayment by lessee of any lease charges when due,or the nonpayment by lessee of any other sum required hereunder to be paid by lessee which nonpayment continues for a period of twenty days after written notice thereof from lessor.
the district court determined that this section unambiguously provides that default occurs if eaton failed to pay lease charges when due.eaton argues that the district court incorrectly interpreted the plain,unambiguous language of section a.
to interpret the terms of a contract under minnesota law,we must initially determine whether a contract term is ambiguous.porous media midland brake,cir citing green tree acceptance,wheeler,cir applying minnesota law.the determination that a contract is or is not ambiguous is a legal determination,and no deference is paid to the trial court decision on this issue.maurice sunderland architecture,simon,cir blattner forster.if the contract is unambiguous,the interpretation is a question of law and is reviewed de novo.lakeland tool eng g,cir applying minnesota law.
