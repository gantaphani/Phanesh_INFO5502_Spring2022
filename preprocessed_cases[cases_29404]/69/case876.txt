colleen kramer worked in boa chicago,illinois office from october until october.her responsibilities included heading a team responsible for the structuring of loans for middle market companies so that the loans could be syndicated to other financial institutions.in october,boa and nationsbank merged.as a result of this merger,kramer began reporting to a new supervisor,mary.
although moser was impressed by the performance of kramer team during early,moser was critical of kramer job performance,particularly kramer leadership skills and interpersonal skills.at the end of may,moser replaced kramer as team leader with another employee,although kramer retained her salary and title as managing director.moser also gave kramer a memorandum critiquing kramer performance and stating that kramer would need to improve her performance within the next days.
in june,kramer responded to the demotion and memorandum through a letter from her lawyer.the letter demanded that she be reinstated as team leader and also revealed that kramer suffered from multiple sclerosis.this was the first notice that boa had of kramer disease.
a few months later,on september,moser wrote another detailed memorandum that directed kramer to,within days,improve her performance in several specific areas or face termination of her employment.on september,kramer filed a charge of disability discrimination and retaliation with the united states equal employment opportunity commission the eeoc.four days later,kramer sent moser and moser supervisor an message notifying them of her charge.on september,the eeoc issued kramer a notice of right to sue.
on october,moser informed kramer that her employment with boa was terminated.a little more than a week later,on october,kramer filed suit in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois,alleging disability discrimination and retaliation under the ada and a state law claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.the complaint sought front pay,back pay,compensatory and punitive damages,reinstatement,and attorney fees and costs.
on may,kramer filed a second charge of discrimination with the eeoc.this charge included an allegation of retaliatory discharge.on june,the eeoc issued her a second notice of right to sue.kramer filed an amended complaint on may,in which she dropped her state law causes of action.both kramer complaint and amended complaint demanded a jury trial on all issues.boa answer and answer to the amended complaint also included demands for jury trial.
boa filed a motion for summary judgment on all of kramer claims.on december,the district court granted summary judgment in boa favor on kramer disability claims,but denied boa motion with respect to kramer claim of retaliatory discharge.trial on kramer remaining claim was scheduled for may.
on may,boa filed a motion to exclude compensatory and punitive damages and strike plaintiff jury demand.in its motion,boa asserted that compensatory and punitive damages are not recoverable on a claim of retaliation under the ada.in addition,boa argued that,because kramer was not entitled to recover compensatory and punitive damages under the ada,kramer had no statutory right to a jury trial.
the district court granted boa motion on may.the court found that compensatory and punitive damages were not available as a remedy and that kramer was not,therefore,entitled to a jury trial.the district court also refused to impanel an advisory jury.
the district court proceeded with a bench trial on kramer retaliation claim,at the conclusion of which the court ruled in favor of boa.the district court entered written findings of fact and conclusions of law on september.this appeal followed.
on appeal,kramer argues that the district court erred in ruling that the she was not entitled to seek compensatory and punitive damages for a claim of retaliation under the ada.in a related argument,kramer claims that,because she was entitled to seek compensatory and punitive damages,she was entitled to a jury trial and it was reversible error on the part of the district court to strike her jury demand.kramer also maintains that,independent of her claim for compensatory and punitive damages,she was entitled to a jury trial because boa consented to a jury

remedies available to a party making a retaliation claim against an employer under the ada are first determined by reference to.section,in turn,provides that the available remedies are those provided by the civil rights act,through,a.section g provides that a court may order certain equitable relief including,but not limited to,back pay,but it does not provide for compensatory or punitive damages.
however,the civil rights act,a,expands the remedies available under g in certain circumstances,to provide for compensatory and punitive damages.specifically,a provides,in pertinent part,that 
i n an action brought by a complaining party against a respondent who engaged in unlawful intentional discrimination under section of the ada or committed a violation of section b of the ada,against an individual,the complaining party may recover compensatory and punitive damages 
kramer argues that a permits a plaintiff making a claim of retaliation against an employer under the ada to recover compensatory damages.this question appears to be one of first impression for federal circuit courts.we have not found,and the parties have not cited,any federal circuit courts that have considered this question.kramer directs our attention to the decisions of three second,eighth and tenth have affirmed jury verdicts where compensatory and punitive damages had been awarded on ada retaliation claims.see,salitros chrysler,cir muller costello,cir stores,cir.these decisions focused on whether there was sufficient evidence to award compensatory and punitive damages,but none examined the legal question of whether such damages were authorized for an ada retaliation claim.the district courts that have addressed the question are split.compare sink stores,d,compensatory and punitive damages are not available for retaliatory discharge claim,boe alliedsignal,d,same,and brown city of lee summit,wl,same,with noco motor fuels,compensatory and punitive damages are available,rhoads fdic,wl,same,and ostrach regents of the university of california,same.
the district court analysis in brown city of lee summit is thorough and particularly persuasive.we agree with that court conclusion that a meticulous tracing of the language of this tangle of interrelated statutes reveals no basis for plaintiff claim of compensatory and punitive damages in his ada retaliation claim.wl,at.
we thus conclude that the civil rights act does not expand the remedies available to a party bringing an ada retaliation claim against an employer and therefore compensatory and punitive damages are not available.a close reading of the plain language of a makes it clear that the statute does not contemplate compensatory and punitive damages for a retaliation claim under the ada.section a permits recovery of compensatory and punitive damages and thus expands the remedies available under g only for those claims listed therein.with respect to the ada,a only lists claims brought under or b.because claims of retaliation under the ada are not listed,compensatory and punitive damages are not available for such cla
