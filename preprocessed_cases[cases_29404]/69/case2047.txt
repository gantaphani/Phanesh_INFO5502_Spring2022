government code section provides notwithstanding any other provision of law,a public entity is not liable for damages awarded under section of the civil code or other damages imposed primarily for the sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant.in this writ proceeding,we are asked to address the novel question of whether section precludes the award of the civil penalty specified in the unruh civil rights act,et.unruh act for the violation of certain of its provisions.
after the petitioner,los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority mta,was sued by the real party in interest,jerrold lyons lyons,for,among other things,a violation of the unruh act,it moved to strike lyons claim for recovery of the unruh act statutory civil penalty of.the mta argued that such civil penalty was barred by section.the trial court denied the motion and the mta then sought writ relief in this court.
after a review of the relevant statutory provisions including related legislative history and case law,we conclude that the trial court correctly determined that the civil penalty sought by lyons is not barred by section.we therefore will deny the mta petition for a writ of mandate.
factual and procedural background 
on august,lyons was riding an mta bus traveling down santa monica boulevard in west hollywood.the bus driver made a series of taunting,derogatory and homophobic remarks directed at lyons.the taunting continued until the bus reached lyons stop at la cienega boulevard.as lyons moved to leave,the driver gestured to blow him a kiss in a deliberately humiliating and demeaning fashion.lyons slapped the driver on his way out of the bus.the driver then grabbed lyons by the backpack,forcibly restrained him,and began beating him severely.the driver knocked lyons to the ground and continued to restrain,beat,and kick him and pull his hair.the driver was six feet four inches tall and weighed about pounds.lyons was five feet nine inches tall and weighed pounds.
eventually,after bus passengers and other bystanders helped to separate the driver from lyons,lyons gathered his belongings and escaped.after boarding the bus again and driving a short distance,the driver caught up with lyons,left the bus to chase him on foot,and resumed beating him.lyons resulting injuries included a broken rib,clumps of hair torn from his scalp,a laceration to his head,a knee,abrasions over much of his body,and other injuries.
on august,lyons filed this action against mta,the driver,and a number of doe defendants.he alleged causes of action for assault,battery,false imprisonment,intentional infliction of emotional distress,negligence,and violation of the unruh act against all defendants.in the allegations under the unruh act,lyons charged violations of civil code section in addition to other remedies,lyons requested the enforcement of a civil penalty for each offense alleged,as provided by civil code section b 
on october,the mta filed a motion to strike the allegations supporting lyons claim for a civil penalty under the unruh act,as well as the related portions of the prayer.it argued that the motion was made and based upon the grounds that statutory civil penalties under the unruh act can not be imposed against a public entity defendant.the mta also argued,that given the similarity of lyons complaint to a standard tort claim against a public entity,and given the absence of citation to any detailed regulatory statute,the provision regarding statutory civil penalties constituted punitive damages and,therefore,were not available against mta.
a hearing was held on the matter on january.following argument by the parties,the trial court indicated it believed that the civil penalty allowed by the unruh act was not really to penalize the county or set up the county as an example.but this is basically to somehow make whole the victim of this act that is prohibited.the court thus concluded that the primary purpose of the penalty was to make whole,not to punish.accordingly,the trial court denied the mta motion.the mta then filed this petition for writ of mandate.due to the novelty of the factual context in which this issue was raised by mta petition,we issued an order to show cause and set the matter on calendar.
contentions of the parties 
mta argues that it is a public entity and section precludes the imposition of any civil penalty under the unruh act because,in the context of this case,such penalty constitutes punitive or exemplary damages.mta contends that there is only a narrow exception to the operation of section.under that exception,mta argues,civil penalties may be imposed against public entities,only where the state has set up a comprehensive regulatory scheme and seeks to impose penalties for violations of those regulations against entities subject to the regulation,whether public or private.mta argues that the unruh act is not such a comprehensive regulatory scheme,but rather has broad application to prevent discrimination against california citizens and therefore,such narrow exception has no application in this case.
lyons disputes this argument and contends that,under the plain language of the unruh act,the civil penalty does not constitute punitive or exemplary damage,but rather was intended to and does serve other public purposes including the award of a minimum compensation to the victim of a defendant discriminatory conduct.thus,the civil penalty specified in civil code section,subdivision b,does not offend the provision in section declaring that,to be prohibited,a damage award must be imposed primarily for the sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant.italics added.this construction of the unruh act civil penalty,lyons argues,is fully consistent with the legislative history of section and prior relevant case law.
discussion 
standard of review.
the standard of review for the denial of a motion to strike punitive damages allegations is de novo.cryolife,superior court th,d.given that mta argument rests on the proposition that the unruh act civil penalty constitutes a prohibited punitive damage and should therefore be stricken,it is appropriate that we apply the same standard of review in this case.see also clauson superior court th,d.
the unruh act makes a clear distinction between punitive damages and a civil penalty.
in the unruh act,the legislature expressly provided that a successful plaintiff was entitled to recover his or her actual damages,subd.b exemplary damages to be determined by the jury or the court sitting without a jury,subd.b a civil penalty of to be awarded for a denial of the right specified in section,subd.b and attorney fees as may be determined by the court,subd.b.
the first thing that one notices about these statutory provisions is that the legislature has authorized both an award of punitive damages and an award of a civil penalty.plainly,the legislature regarded these as separate remedies.further,the civil penalty is to be awarded to the successful plaintiff in the sum of.the statute leaves the court or jury with no discretionary choice,contrary to the other three bases of recovery.the actual damages that plaintiff is entitled to recover depend upon proof of their existence and amount.the amount of punitive damages including the option to award zero is left to the discretion of the trier of fact whether court or jury and the award of attorney fees is left to the trial court discretion.the civil penalty,however,must be awarded in the sum of provided a plaintiff has proven a violation of section.put another way,if plaintiff establishes that he or she was a victim of the condemned discriminatory conduct,then his or her minimum recovery will be.
by separately providing for exemplary damages and a civil penalty,the legislature obviously intended for the two categories of relief to be distinct from one another.for section to apply to the civil penalty remedy specified in civil code section,subdivision b,its remedial purpose would need to be primarily for the sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant italics added in other words,substantially the same purpose as the remedy provided in section,subdivision b.
but a construction that these two subdivisions serve the same remedial purpose would be unacceptable for at least two reasons.first,it would render one or the other superfluous.under settled principles of statutory interpretation,however,a construction that renders a word surplusage should be avoided.delaney superior court cal d,city and county of san francisco farrell cal d.
second,it would tend to create double recoveries.so long as no double recovery results,a plaintiff may recover multiple remedies in tort for damages arising from the same conduct by the defendant.see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts.for example,in appropriate cases,punitive damages and statutory civil penalties may be awarded in the same action.greeneberg western turf ass cal,hassoldt patrick media group,th,d.multiple damage awards are authorized in various areas of the law,and they may reflect different social objectives.marshall brown d.but where the social objectives pursued by two categories of damages sought in one cause of action are the same,an award for both would create a double recovery.in troensegaard silvercrest industries,d,the court refused to allow punitive damages under section and a civil penalty for breach of warranty by a mobile home manufacturer provided for elsewhere in the civil code on the grounds that the two requested remedies each served to punish and make an example of the defendant.the court reasoned that if the legislature had intended to allow awards for punitive damages and a civil penalty in the same cause of action,it would in some appropriate manner have said so.id.at.in this case,of course,by expressly providing for both exemplary damages and a civil penalty in section,subdivision b,the legislature has said so.
we must presume the legislature intended neither to create an impermissible double recovery nor to include surplus language in the statute.therefore,we have no trouble concluding that section,subdivision b,establishes a separate remedial category that is distinct from the exemplary damages provided for in section,subdivision b.
the legislative history of the unruh act demonstrates a legislative emphasis on the element of the civil penalty provision 
some versions of section has been on the books since when it provided a specified monetary remedy for certain violations of california public accommodations law.for example,it stated that any person who denied another rights to full use and enjoyment of public accommodations in the state because of race or color would be liable in damages for an amount of not less than.over the years,the section has been amended to add types of public accommodations and amusements that were subject to the law,increase the statutory minimum recovery,add protected groups,differentiate the remedies for different types of violations,allow for enforcement by public prosecutors,and change the remedy from solely a statutory minimum recovery to a civil penalty awarded over and above actual damages.
for most of the last century,the code sections now known collectively as the unruh act were written so as to punish all denials of civil rights in public accommodations alike.in other words,the law provided civil enforcement to protect all citizens equal rights to full participation in society,and it made little difference how such rights might be denied.today,however,the law recognizes that when a violation is committed through violence or intimidation,different rights are violated and different remedies are required.the ralph civil rights act of specifies,in particular,that all persons in the state have a civil right to be free from violence and intimidation targeted against individuals because of their actual or perceived membership in a particular social group.the legislature simultaneously added section,subdivision b,to provide multiple special remedies for this very different class of violations.
section,subdivision b,took its current shape over the course of amendments in the and.until,section,subdivision b,provided that whoever violated another person civil rights under section would be liable for actual damages plus a civil penalty.in,the legislature amended the statute to make violators additionally liable for an amount determined by the fact finder not to exceed three times actual damages.the statute was amended again in to clarify that the civil penalty was payable directly to the plaintiff according to the senate judiciary committee report on the bill,the purpose of this amendment was to make it easier for ralph act victims to file civil law suites sic and for private attorneys to represent them.com.on judiciary,on bill,reg.sess.a senate judiciary committee fact sheet also stated current ralph act remedies are limited for ralph act victims,discouraging them from vindicating their rights.providing clearly in sb that the penalty goes to the victim will make it easier for ralph act victims to file civil law suits and for private attorneys to represent them.at present,very few ralph act cases are filed with either the department of fair employment and housing,the administrative agency which takes these cases,or in court.thus,the fiscal effects to the state of changing the penalty to go to the victim are anticipated to be negligible.com.on judiciary,on bill reg.sess.the assembly judiciary committee meanwhile produced its own analysis of the bill which stated b ecause the statutory language failed to specify to whom the civil penalty was to be awarded,some confusion has arisen as to whether the state rather than the victim should be given the penalty.it is argued that this bill is necessary to eliminate that confusion.assem.com.on judiciary,on bill reg.sess.this history clearly demonstrates that the legislature intended to provide increased compensation for plaintiffs and to encourage private parties to file lawsuits under the statute.
in response to an increase in hate crimes,the legislature again amended the bill in.in senate bill reg.sess,the cap on punitive damages to be awarded by the factfinder under section,subdivision a,was removed.the expectation apparently was that,in appropriate cases,large exemplary damage awards would contribute to shutting down or severely deterring the illegal activities of organized hate groups.in addition,the amendment increased the civil penalty under section,subdivision b,from to to reflect the increase in the cost of living index and deleted a provision which provided that the civil penalty be prorated among multiple offenders so as to punish each individually and to avoid rewarding those committing hate crimes in concert with others by permitting them to pay a lower monetary penalty than offenders acting alone.the bill also amended the penal code to increase the maximum criminal penalty for perpetrators of certain hate crimes 
according to the report the senate judiciary committee prepared at the time,the purpose of these amendments was to provide more effective remedies for victims of hate motivated crime and violence.com.on judiciary,on bill,reg.sess.the bill was expected to enable more victims of hate violence to pursue redress through the filing of civil rights actions.ibid.the senate rules committee report contained substantially the same analysis.finally,speaking on behalf of the bill before the assembly subcommittee on the administration of justice,a representative of the fair employment and housing commission stated,minority communities throughout the state are also clamoring for civil actions be brought sic against the perpetrator to obtain renumeration sic for victims injuries.passage of sb also sends a message that the legislature and the state view civil hate crimes cases as seriously or more seriously than any other tort.subcom.on admin.of justice,on bill reg.sess.
it is apparent from this legislative history that section has at least two important purposes.the first is simply to provide increased compensation to the plaintiff.the second purpose,and perhaps the more important one,is to encourage private parties to seek redress through the civil justice system by making it more economically attractive for them to sue.a concern had been raised repeatedly that the civil penalties were insufficient and that hate crime victims were not taking advantage of them,very likely owing to the fact that some victims suffered little actual damages.if not for the civil penalty,many such litigants would neither have the economic incentive,nor the means to retain counsel to pursue perpetrators under the statute.under the current wording of section,subdivision b,the civil penalty clearly provides a minimum compensatory recovery even in those cases where the plaintiff can show little or no actual damages.
although the only portion of the statute that is directly relevant to the case at hand is subdivision b which provides for the civil penalty,it is also appropriate to consider it in some context.when examined in the context of the other amendments,including the enhancement of criminal penalties,removal of the cap on punitive damages,and mandatory civil rights education for attorneys,it is clear that the current version of section,subdivision b,is part of a larger body of law designed to further a clear legislative intent to have the civil rights laws taken seriously and be vigorously enforced by encouraging private parties to litigate such claims.acceptance of mta argument that section grants it immunity in this area would defeat this important component of the crime legislation.
this history reinforces our conclusion that the civil penalty of section,subdivision b is not solely punitive.while it may have some punitive characteristics,it clearly serves to advance the legislature intent to encourage and aid private parties to help in enforcing the civil rights laws by bringing civil suits against perpetrators of hate crimes.the civil penalty also helps to ensure that plaintiffs receive ample compensation,irrespective of their actual damages.because of these important remedial functions,section,subdivision b,does not fall within the scope of government immunity under section.to hold otherwise would compromise private parties ability to litigate claims under section and thus undercut the legislative intent behind providing a statutory recovery to which plaintiffs are automatically entitled to upon proof of liability,regardless of actual damages.this conclusion is also fully supported by relevant case law dealing with the application of section in different factual contexts.
the unruh act civil penalty is not imposed primarily for punishment.
as already noted,section provides notwithstanding any other provision of law,a public entity is not liable for damages awarded under section of the civil code or other damages imposed primarily for the sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant.italics added.limiting government immunity to damages that are primarily punitive reflects the reality that a single damages category may serve multiple remedial purposes.most civil penalties are necessarily punitive to some extent in that they aim to deter misconduct and may lead to recoveries in excess of an otherwise available measure of compensation.given the language of the section,subdivision b,however,civil penalties are not punitive for section purposes if some other remedial aim predominates.indeed,a number of courts have concluded that to be condemned as punitive,a penalty,generally speaking,must simply and solely serve that purpose.while there are no cases directly on the issue of public entity immunity from civil penalties under the unruh act,there are several instructive decisions which discuss the immunity provided by section in other civil penalty contexts.
in helfend southern california rapid transit district cal d,the supreme court upheld application of the collateral source rule and refused to allow the rapid transit district,a public entity,to reduce a damages judgment by means of collateral payments to the injured party from an independent source on the grounds that the collateral source rule was not penal in its effect.the court reasoned that the rule expressed a policy of encouraging private investment in insurance for personal injuries and brought plaintiffs closer to full compensation.because of these compensatory functions,the court held that application of the rule should not be classified as punitive for section purposes.at.
in state department of corrections workmen comp.appeals board cal d,department of corrections,the department of corrections argued that section made it immune from enforcement of an increased worker compensation award for willful misconduct provided for in the labor code.though the award was concededly punitive in part in that the employer was required to pay a higher amount of compensation by reason of his serious and wilful misconduct than he would have been compelled to pay if his conduct were less culpable,the court upheld the award because it was not simply and solely punitive in that it also served to provide fuller compensation to an injured employee.id.at.although an employer against whom an increased award is made under section of the labor code is penalized in the sense that he is required to pay a higher amount of compensation by reason of his serious and wilful misconduct than he would have been compelled to pay if his conduct were less culpable,the employee does not receive more than full compensation for his injuries.thus,the increased award is not a penalty in the sense of being designed primarily to punish the defendant rather than to more adequately compensate the plaintiff.id.at.
the issue in people ex rel.younger superior court cal d,younger was whether section permitted civil penalties for oil spills provided for in the water code to be enforced against the port of oakland,a public entity.the court concluded that because the civil penalties were compensatory as well as punitive,they were not punitive for section purposes and therefore could be recovered from a public entity.at.the defendant port pointed to the fact that the water code section involved served in part to punish and make an example of wrongdoers.id.at.but the court chose to overlook the punitive aspect of the penalties,reasoning that t he liability imposed by that section is undoubtedly punitive in nature and indeed is conceded to be so by plaintiff.however,the critical question is whether it is simply,that is solely,punitive.id.at,fn,italics added.although civil liability imposed by the water code was admittedly punitive in that it sought to deter oil spills,the damages collected also served a compensatory purpose since they compensated for the unquantifiable damage caused by oil spills and defrayed some of the costs of cleaning up waste and abating further damages.thus,the court held that the penalties were not simply and solely punitive and thus did not constitute punitive or exemplary damages within the meaning of section.id.at.in the case immediately following younger,san francisco civil service association superior court cal d,the court applied the same reasoning and again framed the issue as whether the civil penalties for discharging pollutants are simply and solely punitive in nature or fulfill compensatory functions so as to remove them from the class of punitive damages covered by section of the government code.id.at,italics added.
in kizer county of san mateo cal d,kizer,the court considered whether section prevented the state from imposing statutory civil penalties under the health and safety code on a,health care facility.the court stated nowhere in the tort claims act does the legislature indicate an intention to immunize public entities from monetary sanctions authorized by the legislature and imposed for failure to observe minimum health and safety standards adopted to protect and prevent injury to patients.granting immunity to public entities from the penalties would be contrary to the intent of the legislature to provide a citation system for the imposition of prompt and effective civil sanctions against health care facilities in violation of the laws and regulations of this state.id.at.
similarly,nowhere in the tort claims act does it say that public entities should be immune from civil penalties that the legislature has deemed necessary for the effective enforcement of civil
