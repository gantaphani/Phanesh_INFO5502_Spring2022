after settling a toxic mold personal injury complaint against an apartment complex,plaintiff tamara slovensky filed a tort action against her attorneys,pleading two counts styled cause s of action.her first count,for legal malpractice,alleged defendants negligently failed to obtain an adequate recovery.her second count,for breach of fiduciary duty,alleged defendants misrepresented and concealed material facts in the course of the litigation.as to both counts,she sought damages and other and further relief.
defendants morton friedman,brooks cutter,the law firm of friedman,collard,cutter panneton,and cutter law firm moved for summary judgment,maintaining plaintiff could not prove damages,because the statute of limitations had run on plaintiff claims before she had consulted defendants.defendants did not move for summary adjudication in the alternative or adduce evidence to negate plaintiff allegations of breach of fiduciary duty.
the trial court granted summary judgment,agreeing with defendants that plaintiff inability to prove damages for malpractice defeated her entire action.the court also found plaintiff could not seek disgorgement of attorney fees for fiduciary breach because she had not pled entitlement to it.
we shall affirm.we agree with the trial court that the statute of limitations had run on plaintiff toxic tort claims before she consulted defendants.although disgorgement a remedy rather than an element of a cause of action need not be specifically pled,it is available only if the breacher misrepresentation or concealment damaged the plaintiff.plaintiff can not prove damages from any such misrepresentation or concealment because defendants obtained a recovery for her in the underlying action to which she was not legally entitled.for the same reason,her malpractice claim fails.therefore,summary judgment was properly granted.
standard of review 
a defendant moving for summary judgment must show that the plaintiff can not establish one or more elements of the cause of action or can not refute an affirmative defense established by the defendant.code civ,subd.o.from commencement to conclusion,the moving party bears the burden of persuasion that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.there is a genuine issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,fn.omitted.our review is de novo.merrill navegar,cal th,d.
factual and procedural background 
the complaint 
plaintiff alleged as to both counts 
in march,she retained defendants to prosecute her toxic mold personal injury action against sequoia fairway apartments the fairways defendants said they had about other plaintiffs with claims against the fairways and would accept no more after her in fact,they took on further clients and ultimately represented other plaintiffs in similar actions against the fairways.defendants did not obtain a waiver from plaintiff of the conflict inherent in the representation of multiple plaintiffs or advise her to consult independent counsel on this point before retaining them.
in august,defendants told plaintiff they had scheduled a mediation.she had not known of this or consented to it in advance.she objected that defendants had not adequately analyzed her case and only sought a quick settlement.she demanded that they evaluate and treat her case separately,not as part of a global pool.they assured her they were doing so.
on august,defendants faxed a letter protected by privilege to her treating physician office without plaintiff knowledge or consent.the letter contained privileged,private facts about plaintiff case unrelated to and unnecessary for her treatment.
on august,defendant cutter met with plaintiff and pressured her to sign an agreement to a proposed settlement in a specified sum.plaintiff gave cutter the agreement on the condition that he could not use it without further written consent from her.defendants did not advise plaintiff that she could or should obtain independent legal advice before signing the agreement.
during september,cutter harassed plaintiff with unannounced home visits and numerous telephone calls,exerting enormous pressure on her to agree to settle her case for the proposed amount.to stop cutter harassment,plaintiff agreed to come to his office on september.she told him she could not sign a settlement agreement and release because neither she nor defendants had adequate information about her medical condition and prognosis.
on september,plaintiff doctor told her that cutter had informed him plaintiff would be settling her case for the amount specified in defendants letter to the doctor,which was more than any of defendants other fairways clients would receive.this information was within the privilege,was not authorized for release to plaintiff doctor,and was not necessary for his treatment of plaintiff.
as part of defendants pressure campaign,defendants told plaintiff erroneously that her case was not being treated as part of a global settlement,but was being evaluated individually and independently that the medical information she had was not reliable and that she was not as sick from toxic mold exposure as she had been led to believe.
on september,at cutter insistence,plaintiff met again with him.he again attempted to pressure her into settling the case.she objected that they did not yet have adequate medical information.he made further erroneous statements to her about her condition and its future course.he also misstated to her that he had negotiated with defendants to win the stated amount for her and that it was a better settlement than those of younger and sicker plaintiffs.when she continued to resist,cutter brought defendant friedman into the meeting.comparing her case to the recent world trade center bombings,friedman told her she was fortunate to be alive and should settle.plaintiff ultimately signed the settlement agreement and release.
on november,cutter sent plaintiff a limited power of attorney to enable him to endorse the jointly payable settlement check and secure his fee.plaintiff did not sign the document.
on december,plaintiff received a letter from cutter stating that the fairways attorneys had reissued the check with the cutter law firm as sole payee,at cutter request defendants had cashed the check and taken out their fees and plaintiff proportionate share of costs.the rest was deposited into a separate account at wells fargo bank in plaintiff name,where it remains.these actions were done without plaintiff knowledge or consent.
defendants failed to exercise the care,skill,knowledge,competence,and diligence required of them by the relationship.their representation of plaintiff violated california rules of professional conduct,rule they breached their duty of confidentiality,in violation of business and professions code section they coerced plaintiff to settle the case and converted the settlement monies.but for defendants conduct,plaintiff would have obtained a recovery in her case greater than that obtained by defendants,free of the taint of conflict of interest and conversion 
plaintiff prayed for compensatory and punitive damages,costs of suit,and such other and further relief as the court may deem proper.
the summary judgment motion 
defendants moved for summary judgment,asserting plaintiff cause of action for legal malpractice lacked merit because plaintiff could not prove causation for damages she could not have obtained a better result absent the alleged malpractice because her underlying action was barred by the statute of limitations as of the date she retained defendants.plaintiff cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty had no existence apart from her malpractice cause of action and failed on the same ground.
defendants separate statement of undisputed facts adduced evidence that plaintiff had notice of toxic mold in her apartment and resulting physical ailments well over one year before she retained defendants she admitted her prior knowledge of the relevant facts to defendant cutter on july,and her case settled for.the separate statement did not adduce any evidence as to breach of fiduciary duty.
plaintiff opposition 
plaintiff asserted and offered evidence purporting to show that she did not realize she had suffered toxic mold exposure until shortly before she retained defendants and triable issues of fact existed as to whether she should have known earlier however,she did not dispute most of defendants evidence that during the period to she was aware of the facts that she later claimed as proof of toxic mold exposure and damage she also asserted defendants breaches of fiduciary duty entitled her to fee disgorgement even if she could not prove malpractice damages,and defendants failure to address her fiduciary breach cause of action was enough to defeat summary judgment.
defendants reply 
in a separate statement titled response to plaintiff separate statement of undisputed facts,defendants objected to all of plaintiff evidence as to actual or constructive notice of her injury in the underlying action.defendants further objected that plaintiff evidence as to breach of fiduciary duty was irrelevant and immaterial to the issues raised in the summary judgment motion however,defendants also for the first time offered evidence purporting to confute plaintiff evidence on this topic 
the trial court order and judgment 
the trial court issued an order granting summary judgment on the following grounds 
defendants had shown that the statute of limitations for personal injury actions then in effect code civ,former,subd,raised as an affirmative defense to plaintiff toxic mold complaint,had expired as of the date plaintiff first consulted defendants.defendants had also shown that from the fall of to march,when plaintiff moved out of her apartment,she had notice of the facts giving her a cause of action but failed to investigate them.since her complaint would have been found had it gone to trial,plaintiff could not have achieved a better outcome than defendants obtained for her thus she could not prove damages for malpractice.plaintiff had not raised a triable issue of material fact on this point.
plaintiff second cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty failed for the same reason.because it incorporated by reference the damages alleged in the first cause of action,plaintiff inability to show causation for damages was also fatal to the second cause of action.
plaintiff failed to request disgorgement of attorney fees in the complaint and had not sought leave to amend the complaint to include this request prior to the hearing on the motion.therefore,it was not properly before the court.
the trial court thereafter entered judgment dismissing plaintiff action.
discussion 
to prevail on a summary judgment motion that does not request summary adjudication in the alternative,the defendant must show conclusively that all of the plaintiff causes of action or legal theories fail as a matter of law.see jimenez protective life ins.th,d.
plaintiff contends defendants are not entitled to summary judgment because she has shown triable issues of fact as to legal malpractice and defendants failed to rebut her claim of fiduciary breach.we disagree.like the trial court,we conclude that to avoid summary judgment plaintiff must show at least the possibility of proving damages from defendants conduct and that she can not do so.because defendants won her a substantial recovery in a matter where she was not legally entitled to recover anything at all,plaintiff has no cognizable damage claim.similarly,although disgorgement of fees is a recognized remedy for breach of fiduciary duty,it is available only if the alleged misconduct caused damage thus plaintiff can not escape summary judgment by claiming entitlement to this remedy.
it is undisputed that when plaintiff filed her toxic mold complaint it was subject to a statute of limitations.code civ,former,subd.see now,added by stats,ch,extends personal injury limitations period to two years.defendants adduced much evidence that plaintiff was on actual or constructive notice of her cause of action well before the spring of,yet did not consult with defendants until march.plaintiff admits she was aware of those facts,but claims they were insufficient as a matter of law to put her on notice of her cause of action,or at least that triable issues of fact remain on this point.plaintiff is wrong.
because plaintiff claim was on the day she filed it,she was entitled to no recovery and would inevitably have lost the case had it not settled thus,the settlement defendants obtained for her was a windfall.as defendants alleged malpractice did not damage her,her malpractice claim fails.
the elements of a cause of action for legal malpractice are the relationship or other basis for duty a negligent act or omission causation and damages.kurinij hanna morton th,d kurinij italics added.summary judgment is appropriate if the defendant negates any of these elements.ibid.
causation here means that but for the attorneys negligence the client would have prevailed in the underlying action.kurinij,supra,th at,d.though normally a question of fact,causation may be decided as a question of law if the undisputed facts permit only one reasonable conclusion.ibid.
to win a legal malpractice action,the plaintiff must prove damages to a legal certainty,not to a mere probability.barnard langer th,d.thus,a plaintiff who alleges an inadequate settlement in the underlying action must prove that,if not for the malpractice,she would certainly have received more money in settlement or at trial.id.at,d.such claims are likely to be speculative,as even the most skillful attorneys can seldom know whether they obtained the best possible result thus they are held only to the standard of whether the settlement was within the realm of reasonableness.id.at,fn,d,citing mallen,legal malpractice ed.
here,though plaintiff won a substantial settlement,she contends defendants negligence barred her from proving greater damages at trial.but to recover damages at trial,she would have had to defeat the statute of limitations defense.the undisputed facts reveal she could not have done so.
a cause of action accrues when the claim is complete with all of its elements.norgart upjohn cal th,d.although this ordinarily occurs on the date of the plaintiff injury,accrual is postponed until the plaintiff either discovers or has reason to discover the existence of a claim,at least has reason to suspect a factual basis for its elements.id.at,d,jolly eli lilly cal d,jolly.p laintiffs are required to conduct a reasonable investigation after becoming aware of an injury,and are charged with knowledge of the information that would have been revealed by such an investigation.fox ethicon,cal th,d.so long as there is a reasonable ground for suspicion,the plaintiff must go out and find the facts she can not wait for the facts to find her.jolly,supra,cal d at.
defendants separate statement 
defendants alleged the following facts were undisputed 
beginning no later than the fall of,plaintiff experienced water intrusion into her apartment that was never resolved,making the apartment uninhabitable from around november.
a bulletin from the fairways management went out to tenants on may,stating in part we are aware that you have all received a letter from an attorney suggesting that harmful mold may be present in some apartments at the fairways if you see any evidence of mold,of any kind,in your apartment,please contact the management office some effect sic from these two molds are in nature we need to hear from you immediately if you are presently experiencing any water intrusion problem or see any evidence of damage,of any kind,from a prior event.
plaintiff admits she wrote and sent a letter dated may,which stated in part in response to your letter dated,left on my door on,i spoke with your business office and advised them that i do have a mold problem.plaintiff refused to authorize entry into her apartment in her absence,allegedly because she kept firearms there.
on or about june,the fairways management issued a document to residents citing t he fairways mold abatement program,stating that water intrusion leads to mold,and requesting entry and inspection.a telephone message slip in the fairways business records indicates plaintiff called,acknowledged the notice,and said she did not have a mold problem.plaintiff neither recalls nor denies leaving this message.
plaintiff and the fairways did not agree on a mutually acceptable inspection date.
plaintiff did not take air samples or samples from her walls or carpet for testing.
before moving out,plaintiff photographed wall stains where water had leaked in the apartment.she believed that these brownish or black stains which she described as looking like mascara were from leaking roofing paper or mud.
before moving her furnishings out of the apartment no later than march,plaintiff threw out clothing,shoes,boxes,and bedding.at times the carpet was also soaked.
plaintiff applied to rent an apartment elsewhere on september,and leased an apartment beginning november.
plaintiff contends she was extremely sick from exposure to toxic mold which grew in her apartment because her landlord did not stop water intrusion into the apartment.
plaintiff has suffered from headaches,sinus infections,nosebleeds,hearing loss,dental infections,skin irritations,difficulty in concentrating,chronic fatigue,respiratory distress,and respiratory ailments.between october and the date plaintiff moved out of the fairways,she experienced headaches,shortness of breath,fatigue,and dizziness.
although she does not recall when it started,plaintiff had a constant cough such a bad cough that it was embarrassing.she attributed it to vicodin,which she began taking in.a recalled that plaintiff coughed during the period to and had sought medical treatment for the cough.
plaintiff began suffering from head and neck pain in and her other maladies around.plaintiff contends that as a result of toxic mold exposure,she suffers from headaches,sinus infections,ear infections,hearing loss,dental infections,skin irritations,difficulty in concentration,and respiratory distress.
plaintiff first sought representation from defendants for a mold claim on march.
on or about july,plaintiff told defendant cutter in a recorded conversation that the water intrusion problems in her apartment had begun in or.asked if she noticed mold then,she responded,i did notice that there was mold,what i noticed is what looked like soot,brown soot,dark stuff that was seeping through the ceiling.
plaintiff response 
in her separate statement opposing summary judgment,plaintiff admitted most of these alleged facts were undisputed.
plaintiff purported to dispute statement by asserting defendants cite no evidence to support their assertion that plaintiff claims her apartment was uninhabitable beginning approximately november.however,she did not dispute that she had experienced unresolved water intrusion into the apartment beginning in the fall of.
plaintiff also purported to dispute statements and.as to statement,she admitted she had contended in the underlying lawsuit that she was sick from toxic mold exposure,but added as shown below in plaintiff additional disputed facts,plaintiff was not so aware and did not so contend until.as to statement listing her symptoms,she called it,u ndisputed but misleading because p rior to,plaintiff believed her health problems related to her auto accident 
plaintiff further alleged as undisputed 
she first learned of her toxic mold exposure in january or february.in february or march,plaintiff realized from watching a news program about toxic mold at the fairways that her apartment had looked worse than the one shown in the program.although plaintiff had photographed the conditions in her apartment before moving out,she did not know she was photographing evidence of mold.after watching the program,plaintiff met with a city official who examined her photographs and advised her to see a doctor and an attorney right away.until seeing the program,plaintiff thought what she had observed was leaking or staining of black roofing paper looking like runny mascara she did not know it was mold,which she believed to be fuzzy stuff.plaintiff believes she conveyed that understanding of her wall stains to the fairways business office.it took plaintiff six months to move from the fairways to another complex she spent time in the fairways up until she handed in her keys on march,and did not fully vacate the apartment until then.until early,plaintiff thought her health problems had been caused by her february automobile accident,and she had so advised the attorney she consulted on march.as of then she did not know which,if any,of her health problems were attributable to toxic mold therefore she asked defendants to let her drop her case if medical testing was negative.plaintiff did not consider or discuss filing an action against the fairways at any time before march.
we conclude as a matter of law as did the trial court that plaintiff should have realized she had a cause of action long before march.beginning in fall she knew of unresolved water intrusion into her apartment that left black and brown stains on her walls around the same time she developed a violent and persistent cough.in may,she received notice from the fairways management that apartments could have a mold problem related to water intrusion,that it could cause effects,and that tenants should notify management immediately of any evidence of damage,of any kind,from a prior event.in june,she received further notice to the same effect,along with a request to enter and inspect her apartment.in response to both notices she denied a mold problem and refused to permit inspection,even as she experienced a battery of physical of including headaches,sinus infections,chronic fatigue,and respiratory ailments,all reasonably describable as along with the continuing water intrusion.she refused to believe the stains on her walls could be mold because she clung to the fixed she did nothing to mold is fuzzy,not runny.she refused to investigate whether her physical problems could be because of her fixed idea that they stemmed from other causes.
when a person knows or believes she is suffering harm and a plausible explanation appears,she can not reasonably refuse to investigate it merely because other explanations occur to her.a reasonable person in plaintiff position would not have waited to learn from television news,long after vacating an apartment rendered uninhabitable by water intrusion,that what appeared on her walls could have been mold and could have caused her ailments.she would have put two and two together as soon as she got notice of mold problems from the fairways and permitted a prompt inspection of her apartment she also would have discussed the situation with her doctor.having done those things,she would have discovered she had a cause of action before the statute of limitations expired.
plaintiff asserts it was reasonable to believe her symptoms not all of which were stemmed from her automobile accident or the medications prescribed for her afterward.she asserts the fairways ambiguously worded letter was too vague and general to give notice that she might have toxic mold in her apartment or that toxic mold could explain any of her health problems finally,she quotes dictionary definitions of mold and fungi to show she could reasonably have believed her wall stains were not mold because they were not fuzzy.in other words,plaintiff still believes she was entitled to put her head in the sand and ignore all warning signals for years merely because she thought she could explain the facts in some other way.when it comes to statutes of limitations,the law disagrees.
plaintiff relies vainly on clark baxter healthcare th,d and ward westinghouse canada,cir.in both cases the plaintiffs got the benefit of the rule on summary judgment because it was unclear whether they reasonably could have known the negligent causes of their injuries before the statute of limitations expired.clark,supra,th at,d ward,supra,at see jolly,supra,cal d at.but here plaintiff knew from the fall of on that the fairways had wrongfully failed to prevent or remediate
