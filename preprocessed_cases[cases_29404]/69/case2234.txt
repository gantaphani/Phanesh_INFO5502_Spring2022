we have for review a decision of the second district court of appeal in which that court certified the following question as one of great public importance 
is it appropriate to set off against the damages portion of an award against one tortfeasor in a medical malpractice action the amount recovered from settlement from another for the same incident causing the injury where the settling alleged tortfeasor was not included on the verdict form 
fitzmaurice,so d,dca.for the reasons set forth below,we answer the certified question in the affirmative as to economic damages.we hold that it is appropriate to set off against the economic damages portion of an award against one tortfeasor in a medical malpractice action the economic damages portion of any settlement recovered from a settling tortfeasor for the same incident causing the injury where the settling tortfeasor was not included on the verdict form.however,there should be no setoff for noneconomic damages.
we also review for certified conflict with spruce creek development drew,so d dca,and flight express,robinson,so d dca,on an attorney fees and cost question under section,florida statutes.we accept jurisdiction in this case and approve the second district holding on the attorney fees issue 
factual and procedural background 
john and carole fitzmaurice the fitzmaurices filed a medical malpractice action against phillip,and phillip,collectively referred to as.the fitzmaurices alleged that a laparotomy pad was left inside john fitzmaurice abdominal cavity during an appendectomy performed by on august,at charlotte regional medical center.the fitzmaurices reached a presuit settlement with charlotte regional that included both a cash settlement and the forgiveness of an outstanding hospital bill.under the terms of the settlement,the fitzmaurices received an undifferentiated lump sum payment of,and the hospital discharge d any further obligations for payment of any outstanding bills which are due or owing to the hospital for services rendered as a result of the procedure.
the case proceeded to trial against.defended the medical malpractice action on the theory that the hospital negligence alone had caused the pad to remain in fitzmaurice abdomen and that the plaintiffs had sued the wrong party.however,did not request that the hospital appear on the verdict form for apportionment of liability purposes 
the jury returned a verdict finding negligent was the only defendant on the verdict form therefore,the jury did not apportion fault.the jury awarded fitzmaurice in past medical expenses and for past noneconomic damages.additionally,the jury awarded fitzmaurice in past damages for loss of consortium.
filed a motion asking the trial court to set off against this damage award the entire amount of the hospital settlement.the trial court granted the motion as to economic damages and reduced the economic damages portion of the verdict by the trial court denied any setoff as to noneconomic damages.as a result,an amended final judgment was entered against awarding fitzmaurice and fitzmaurice.
appealed this setoff determination,and the fitzmaurices.the district court of appeal rejected arguments on appeal.it reversed the trial court setoff order,holding that was not entitled to a setoff because the hospital was not included on the verdict form for apportionment of fault purposes.the court certified the question as being of great public importance.
prior to trial,the fitzmaurices served an offer of settlement upon.the offer was for in settlement of both and fitzmaurice claims.the offer did not specify the amount each spouse was willing to accept to settle his or her individual claims.rejected the offer.after trial,the fitzmaurices requested an award of attorney fees pursuant to section,florida statutes.after setting off the jury verdict with the hospital settlement,the trial court did not have to consider the motion for attorney fees because the new verdict was less than of the settlement offer.
the fitzmaurices filed another motion for attorney fees with the district court of appeal,which the court considered after reversing the setoff.argued that the proposal for settlement was invalid because it contained a joint offer and did not specify the amount each spouse was willing to accept to settle his or her individual claims,in violation of florida rule of civil procedure c.the district court of appeal denied the motion for attorney fees and certified conflict with spruce creek development drew,so d dca,and flight express,robinson,so d dca.
ii.certified question of great public importance 
the district court failed to note in its opinion and certified question the distinction between noneconomic and economic damages setoffs.in our analysis,we address each type of setoff separately.we begin our discussion by referencing the relevant statutory scheme established by the three setoff statutes and the separate apportionment provisions of section,florida statutes.we then review the critical difference between noneconomic and economic damages under this scheme by discussing each separately.finally,we apply this distinction to the case before us.
applicable law 
the standard of review for the pure questions of law before us is de novo.see armstrong harris,so d.therefore,no deference is given to the judgment of the lower courts.
applicability of section,florida statutes 
florida law regarding setoffs is found in sections and florida statutes.each of these statutes presupposes the existence of multiple defendants jointly and severally liable for the same damages.see wells tallahassee mem l reg l med,so d.after these statutes were first enacted,the legislature enacted section,florida statutes.section eliminates joint and several liability for noneconomic damages and limits joint and several liability for economic damages.the pertinent part of the statute provides 
apportionment of cases to which this section applies,the court shall enter judgment against each party liable on the basis of such party percentage of fault and not on the basis of the doctrine of joint and several liability provided that with respect to any party whose percentage of fault equals or exceeds that of a particular claimant,the court shall enter judgment with respect to economic damages against that party on the basis of the doctrine of joint and several liability.
stat.section expressly provides that the statute applies to negligence cases,including professional malpractice cases.
noneconomic damages 
in wells,the court considered the interrelationship between the three setoff statutes and the apportionment provisions of section.we highlighted the critical difference this interrelationship makes between economic and noneconomic damages.wells filed suit against tallahassee memorial regional medical center tmrmc and two other defendants.wells settled with all the defendants except tmrmc.wells,so d at.the jury was instructed to apportion fault,if any,among all the defendants.id.the jury returned a verdict for economic and noneconomic damages,finding tmrmc at fault and the other two defendants each at fault.id.tmrmc requested a setoff,arguing that the judgment should be reduced by the total amount paid by the settling defendants.id.this court concluded that the setoff statutes do not apply to noneconomic damages for which defendants are only severally liable pursuant to section,but held that the setoff statutes continue to apply to economic damages for which parties continue to be subject to joint and several liability.wells,so d at.
to facilitate the pretrial application of this differentiation,the court adopted a rule for determining the amount of the economic damages setoff in an undifferentiated economic and noneconomic damages settlement.see id.at.the court held that each defendant is solely responsible for its share of the noneconomic damages and that only that portion of the settlement which represents a recovery for economic damages is available to offset a defendant liability for economic damages.the portion of the settlement which represents economic damages is then based on the percentage of economic to noneconomic damages as determ
