this appeal is one of many in the long line of contract disputes arising from the government failure to accept and dispose of radioactive waste from the nation nuclear utilities.this is the first in a trio of concurrent opinions addressing the categories and amount of damages due to the utilities because of the government breach.see pac.gas united states,sacramento mun.util,et,wl 
yankee atomic electric company yankee atomic,maine yankee atomic power company maine yankee,and connecticut yankee atomic power company connecticut yankee collectively the yankees originally brought this action seeking damages to compensate for the cost of storing spent nuclear fuel snf and radioactive waste hlw beyond the time that the government promised by contract to begin storing that waste in a permanent and secure repository.because the court of federal claims did not assess damages according to the rate at which the government was contractually obligated to accept the utilities waste,this court reverses and remands.
the general factual background of the contracts and circumstances surrounding the snf cases appears in the trial court opinion and earlier opinions by this court.see yankee atomic united states,yankee i see also me.yankee atomic power united states.accordingly,this opinion will only discuss the facts necessary for an understanding of the issues in this appeal.
the yankees are three electric companies located in the northeastern united states.maine yankee produced nuclear power at its facility from until,and elected to cease operations permanently in.connecticut yankee produced nuclear power at its facility beginning in and shut down in.yankee atomic,located in massachusetts,generated nuclear power from until.
under the nuclear waste policy act of.codified at nwpa,the yankees and the remainder of the nation nuclear utilities entered into a contract with the department of energy the department or doe in.that contract the standard contract,discussed in greater detail below,obligated the department to take title to and dispose of the yankees snf and hlw.in exchange,the contract obligated the yankees to pay removal and disposal fees into the nuclear waste fund nwf.the contract bound the department to begin acceptance and disposal of nuclear waste by january.yet,even though the yankees have paid nearly million in fees to the government,the department has not removed any of their radioactive waste.
the department failure to perform beginning on january,constituted a partial breach of the contract.see me.yankee,at.power united states.the parties in this appeal dispute only the amount of damages owed to the yankees for that breach.
this damages inquiry focuses on whether the department breach was a substantial factor in the yankees decision to construct a dry storage facility to more safely and securely store their snf.another important inquiry involves the government breach alleged causal link to maine and connecticut yankees election to rerack their wet pool storage facilities to accommodate additional waste.the court of federal claims found in favor of the yankees on these counts as well as several others,and awarded them a combined total of in damages.yankee i.at.
the government appeals because the trial court did not construct and refer to a world in calculating damages.specifically,the government complains that the trial court did not use the contractual acceptance rate to develop a scenario.thus,according to the government,the trial court did not evaluate whether the yankees would have pursued dry storage even if the department had timely performed.the government likewise appeals the award of mitigation damages for the reracks performed by maine yankee and connecticut yankee.in addition,the government appeals the court of federal claims rulings that the disposal of greater than gtcc waste is covered by the standard contract,and that the government is not entitled to an offset for the more than million in contract fees that maine yankee and connecticut yankee have not yet paid.in their counter appeal,the yankees raise just one issue,requesting entry of partial rather than final judgment under court of federal claims rule b and retention of jurisdiction over the yankees claims for future damages from the government continued failure to perform.
this court reviews contract interpretation as a question of law without deference.winstar united states,en banc,aff,d.evidentiary rulings receive review for an abuse of discretion,llc steelcase,citing joiner,d.a trial court selection of a causation standard likewise depends upon the facts of the particular case and lies largely within the trial court discretion.citizens fed.bank united states.
the government primary challenge relates to the court of federal claims choice and application of the substantial factor causation standard.citing to indiana michigan,the trial court elected to apply the substantial factor causation test rather than the more traditional but for test.yankee i.at.use of that standard,which requires determination of whether the government breach of contract was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff damages,was within the trial court discretion in this case.although the substantial factor test is not preferred,this court has refrained from reversing trial courts that have applied the substantial factor test in winstar and snf cases.see,citizens,at,at.
while enjoying discretion to use the substantial factor test,the trial court must apply that test correctly.specifically,damages for breach of contract require a showing of causation.the trial court erred in overlooking the yankees burden to prove causation.in this case,the yankees can only sustain their damages claim if the damages were reasonably foreseeable by the breaching party at the time of contracting the breach is a substantial causal factor in the damages and the damages are shown with reasonable certainty,at emphasis supplied.
the fundamental causation difficulty in this contract is the absence of an explicit snf or hlw acceptance rate or time table.without an express timetable for removal of the yankees waste in the event the government had kept its bargain,the yankees can not show the expenses they might have avoided.the court of federal claims attempted to avoid this complexity by simply decreeing that any reasonable acceptance rate would have enabled the yankees to avoid their incurred costs.thus,without accounting for any acceptance rate at all,the trial court determined that the department breach substantially caused the yankees costs 
regardless of rate,these plaintiffs are faced with at least a delay in commencement of performance.with due regard to the long lead time required for these mitigation decisions,the evidence establishes that the mitigating decisions and resulting expenditures were commercially reasonable and substantially caused by doe impending partial breach es and delay s.
yankee i.at emphasis supplied.such a simple direct approach to causation has a superficial appeal,but this intricate case demands more than estimates or assumptions as proof of causation.thus,the yankees had the burden to prove the contractual acceptance rate and apply that rate before suggesting that the government breach was a substantial factor in causing the yankees claimed expenses.the trial court had the obligation to hold the yankees to that burden.
the remedy for breach of contract is damages sufficient to place the injured party in as good a position as it would have been had the breaching party fully performed,at.without record evidence about the yankees condition with full government performance,the court of federal claims could not perform the necessary comparison between the breach and worlds and thus could not accurately assess the yankees damages.see glendale fed.bank,fsb united states,instructing that plaintiffs bear the burden of demonstrating what might have been bluebonnet sav.bank fsb united states,b ecause plaintiffs in this case are seeking expectancy damages,it is incumbent upon them to establish a plausible world.
the court of federal claims erroneous contract rate analysis highlights the necessity of identifying the contractual acceptance rate before assessing causation.for example,although not setting a rate,the trial court augmented several candidate acceptance rates to determine that the department would likely have accepted the yankees waste early in the acceptance process.
applying any of the reasonable rates plus some augmentation also shows that in the nonbreach world,performance by doe would have rather promptly removed substantial amounts of snf such that,with demonstrated doe performance,it would have been highly unlikely that the plaintiffs would have then proceeded to incur the substantial expense of building dry storage facilities.
yankee i.at.indeed,the trial court analysis is replete with examples where it a ppl ied several different acceptance rates,but augment ed the rates by various percentages to determine causation.id.at.this conclusion established the time when the yankees would have been freed from their snf and hlw storage obligations,thus setting a de facto minimum acceptance rate.consequently,even in the trial court analysis,some acceptance rate emerged as a necessary step.nonetheless,the trial court did not acknowledge that the causation for the yankees storage expenditures depended on some comparison of the hypothetical world to the expenses actually incurred.
as part of its analysis,the court of federal claims assumed,without formally interpreting the standard contract,that the department would ignore the oldest waste first provision,at art.iv b a,and instead would have approved exchanges the yankees would have brokered with other utilities to speed up removal of the snf and hlw.see yankee i.at having heard the evidence over a trial,and upon due consideration,the court concludes that exchanges would have occurred in the nonbreach world.these assumptions include further assumptions about the contractual acceptance rate.for example,the exchanges model adopted by the court of federal claims assumes an acceptance rate of metric tons of uranium.
these estimates and assumptions undercut the logic of the trial court reasoning.without setting forth an explicit acceptance rate for the snf and hlw,the court of federal claims apparently had in mind an approximate contract rate or range of rates and relied on that rate for some of its reasoning.in the absence of an express acceptance rate,this court lacks any means to evaluate the soundness of the court of federal claims contract interpretation.in any event,an acceptance rate based on assumption and approximation is not enough to support a finding of causation under the substantial factor test.in sum,the trial court had an obligation to determine the snf and hlw acceptance rate under the standard contract and apply that rate in determining the substantial cause of the yankees costs.
in this appeal companion case,pacific gas electric united states,the court of federal claims did conduct an analysis to set an acceptance rate,id.at.in reviewing that case,this court interprets the standard contract as requiring the department to accept snf and hlw in accordance with the annual capacity report process.accordingly,this court vacates and remands with instructions that the court of federal claims apply the standard contract acceptance rate identified in pacific gas to assess causation.
in addition to awarding damages for costs incurred after the government breach,the court of federal claims also awarded the yankees damages for mitigation costs.yankee i.at.the trial court granted maine yankee and connecticut yankee to compensate for reracking expenses undertaken to mitigate the effects of the government then impending breach of contract.id.yankee did not claim any mitigation expenses.
reracking is a process that the nuclear utilities undertook to increase snf storage capacity in spent fuel pools.in addition to reserving space to accommodate snf in pools,utilities ideally maintain sufficient pool capacity to permit discharge of all fuel assemblies from the reactor core into the pool to accommodate maintenance and repair operations.though the nuclear regulatory commission nrc does not require utilities to maintain such a full core reserve,it encourages them to do so.
maine yankee filed an application with the nrc on january,to rerack its wet pool and increase storage capacity from to assemblies.maine yankee undertook this plan to increase the pool storage space while maintaining a full core reserve through the remainder of its licensed operating period.upon receipt of approval from the nrc,maine yankee commenced its reracking plan.although maine yankee was licensed to operate through,the facility shut down in august of.at that time,of racks had been installed pursuant to the rerack request.
connecticut yankee likewise applied to the nrc for authority to rerack its wet pool.the nrc approved connecticut yankees march application for a rerack designed to maintain full core reserve through the plant licensed operating period in.connecticut yankee commenced reracking in but closed later that year.
the government challenges the court of federal claims mitigation award based on its misapprehension of this court ruling in indiana michigan.the government asserts that the indiana michigan court held that the duty to mitigate damages for the imminent breach arose in for all snf plaintiffs.to the contrary,this court did not impose that timing on all snf cases in its indiana michigan decision.
in indiana michigan,this court acknowledged the propriety of mitigation damages for plaintiffs who can prove foreseeability,causation,and reasonableness.at.faced with this additional ground for liability,the government seeks to minimize its exposure by clinging to individual words and phrases in the indiana michigan opinion.in particular,the government urges this court to enforce the statement it is beyond debate that because the government unequivocally announced in that it would not meet its contractual obligations beginning in,the utilities were in fact obligated to take mitigatory steps.id.at.this statement,however,does not set as the earliest possible date for any duty to mitigate.rather,this passage reveals that this court in indiana michigan viewed as the latest possible date for the utilities duty to mitigate,not the earliest.the full context of the statement shows this meaning.in the introductory clause it is beyond debate,this court recognizes that no one could reasonably dispute that a duty to mitigate existed in.this statement,however,is not a ruling that the duty to mitigate did not arise until,but instead suggests that the duty could have arisen earlier.
the yankees in this case relied on some of the same documents as the indiana michigan power company to demonstrate the reasonableness of their belief that the government would not timely perform.the confluence of some evidence in the records of indiana michigan and this case,however,does not mean that both cases spring from the same fountain.this court in indiana michigan ultimately affirmed the trial court denial of the plaintiff mitigation request based on the facts of that case.at.this case has a different record.the indiana michigan court based its affirmance of the trial court on the trial court specific factual findings.in particular,the court noted that indiana michigan authorized the expenditure for its reracking projects in,in the normal course of business.id.emphasis supplied.this court also cited the trial court findings that indiana michigan rerack schedule was not affected by the and doe announcements projecting delays in the scheduled january acceptance start date.id.this court also noted that the utility decision to perform a full rerack rather than a partial one was purely a business judgment,unrelated to the government partial breach.id.
those indiana michigan findings stand in stark contrast to the record that this court confronts in this case.for example,the trial court found that maine yankee was m indful of storage limitations and implementation lead time,and well aware of significant delays to the government performance from at least the.yankee i.at.the trial court also found persuasive the yankees testimonial and documentary evidence that the utilities rerack decisions were based on a reasonable belief that the government would not timely perform.id.at.this court will not overturn the trial court thorough and well reasoned findings simply because its findings differ from those in indiana michigan.
this court also assesses the reasonableness of the yankees reracks in light of the record evidence that these mitigation efforts allegedly began years before necessary and allegedly proved completely unnecessary because the reactors shut down early.the record shows that the reracks were not premature.rather,the record shows that the government placed the yankees in a position requiring immediate steps to find alternate storage and to accept responsibility to guard against the environmental impact of and maintained snf,a situation which the nwpa was enacted to avoid,at.in that position,i t would have been improvident for the yankees to have waited until january before deciding what to do with their nuclear waste.id.accordingly,the trial court found,and this court affirms,that in light of the amount of time required to engineer,fabricate,and install new racks,the yankees rerack schedule was reasonable.
the record also shows that the reracks were reasonable even though early closure of some facilities rendered some of the efforts unnecessary.the yankees are not precluded from recovery to the extent that they have made reasonable but unsuccessful efforts to avoid loss.id.quoting restatement second of contracts comment b.because the rerack efforts were reasonable,foreseeable,and caused by the government partial breach,their ultimate success and usage is irrelevant.accordingly,this court affirms the trial court findings that the yankees rerack decisions were commercially reasonable and foreseeable to doe at the time of contracting.yankee i.at.
causation,the remaining mitigation factor,presents more difficulty for the yankees.as explained in section ii above,the trial court must apply the contract rate when assessing causation under the substantial factor test.thus,although this court affirms the court of federal claims findings with respect to the foreseeability and reasonableness prongs of the mitigation damages test,it must nevertheless remand as to causation.in particular,the court of federal claims must apply the standard contract acceptance rate in evaluating whether the government partial breach of contract was a substantial factor in causing the yankees to rerack.
the court of federal claims determined that the standard contract requires the government to accept gtcc radioactive waste concurrently with snf and other hlw.yankee i.at.in particular,this determination affects the amount of damages because gtcc waste storage costs,purportedly reaching potentially into the hundreds of millions of dollars,appellant br,may well not have occurred in a world.
gtcc waste is one of the radioactive byproducts of nuclear power generation.see a.nuclear power generation creates gtcc when the metal components of a reactor,including the inside of the core shroud surrounding the nuclear core,control rods,and support plates that hold the reactor together,absorb neutrons during operation and become irradiated.utilities must dispose of gtcc waste before they can decommission reactor sites.
the standard contract applies to the delivery by purchaser to doe of snf hlw,acceptance of title by doe to such snf hlw,subsequent transportation,and disposal of such snf hlw id.at art.ii.gtcc does not qualify as snf.the trial court,however,fit the gtcc within the standard contract definition of hlw.pursuant to the contract,the term radioactive waste means 
a the highly radioactive material resulting from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel,including liquid waste produced directly in reprocessing and any solid material derived from such liquid waste that contains fission products in sufficient concentrations and 
b other highly radioactive material that the nrc,consistent with existing law,determines by rule requires permanent isolation.
id.at art.i b emphasis supplied see also b.because gtcc must be disposed of in a geologic repository,the court of federal claims reasoned,the nrc has in fact promulgated a rule requiring permanent isolation of these radioactive byproducts.yankee i.at.the nrc rule in question,passed in,provides 
waste that is not generally acceptable for disposal is waste for which form and disposal methods must be different,and in general more stringent,than those specified for class c waste.in the absence of specific requirements in this part,such waste must be disposed of in a geologic repository as defined in part or of this chapter unless proposals for disposal of such waste in a disposal site licensed pursuant to this part are approved by the commission.
a iv emphasis supplied.with no alternative proposals for disposal of gtcc waste,the rule in effect mandated that gtcc fall within the disposal options in the standard contract.indeed,the trial court pointed out,the record contains ample documents demonstrating the government intent to pursue of gtcc in a geologic repository with snf.see,terry plummer,department of energy,office of environmental management,c radioactive waste management presentation june.on another occasion,the government recognized that such waste should be stored in a geologic repository licensed under one regulation for high level waste hlw disposal.letter from robert bernero,director,office of nuclear material safety and safeguards,nuclear regulatory commission,to john bartlett,office of civilian radioactive waste management,department of energy july.finally,the government sent yankee atomic a letter announcing its intent to accept and store gtcc with snf 
in january,we began a reassessment of the gtcc waste program strategy.the reassessment was completed in september,and strongly suggested that the department should consider of gtcc waste in the geologic repository being developed by the department for disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel.
letter from thomas grumby,assistant secretary for environmental management,department of energy,to jay thayer,vice president and manager of operations,yankee atomic electric company.the letter supports the trial court determination that the government agreed to accept gtcc with snf and other hlw.the letter further endorsed yankee atomic plan to load gtcc waste into canisters for disposal with snf we note in your letter that you have assumed that such waste will be loaded into multipurpose canisters for disposal along with spent fuel.id.the parties intentions and actions,as revealed by these documents and numerous others in the record,provide firm footing for the trial court conclusion that it is very unlikely that doe would remove all snf without also taking plaintiffs gtcc waste.yankee i.at.
the nrc regulations defining hlw do not compel a different result.similarly,a amendment to the radioactive waste policy amendments act of.llrwpa that mandated a study of gtcc waste disposal does not preclude reading the standard contract to include gtcc within the hlw definition.in particular,provides 
radioactive waste or hlw means irradiated reactor fuel,liquid wastes resulting from the operation of the first cycle solvent extraction system,or equivalent,and the concentrated wastes from subsequent extraction cycles,or equivalent,in a facility for reprocessing irradiated reactor fuel,and solids into which such liquid wastes have been converted.
notably this definition does not include gtcc waste.the definition of hlw waste in an nrc regulation,while a factor considered by this court and the trial court,does not control the parties understanding of hlw as set forth in the standard contract.as the trial court properly pointed out,the standard contract treats and defines gtcc waste in manner that satisfies the definition of hlw.id.thus,the standard contract,not the nrc regulations,controls the parties contractual obligations.the nrc can not change the contract by regulation.moreover,as noted by the trial court,the technical regulatory definition of hlw does not overcome a rule that unambiguously requires perm
