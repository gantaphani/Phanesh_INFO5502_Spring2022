these consolidated cases present the following question when a worker suffers an industrial injury that results in permanent disability,how should the compensation owed based on the current level of permanent disability be discounted for either previous industrial injury or nonindustrial disabilities the issue was originally settled by this court in fuentes workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,fuentes,but the omnibus reform of california workers compensation scheme created doubt as to whether the apportionment formula we adopted in fuentes had been superseded and a different formula should now be employed.we conclude it has not been superseded and the fuentes formula remains the correct one to apply in apportioning compensation between causes of disability.
factual and procedural background 
these cases arise from five workers compensation proceedings with widely differing facts but two unifying aspects.first,in each the injured worker current permanent disability level could be attributed in part to one or more previous industrial injuries or to nonindustrial causes.second,in each the workers compensation judge wcj applied the fuentes apportionment method,under compulsion of the workers compensation appeals board board divided en banc decision holding that notwithstanding the legislation,the fuentes method of calculating apportionment was still correct.see nabors piedmont lumber mill,en banc nabors i.
stan brodie,a firefighter for the contra costa county fire protection district,sustained an industrial injury to his back,spine,and right knee in december and subsequent cumulative trauma to his back and spine that resulted in percent permanent disability.over the previous years of his career as a firefighter,brodie had sustained several industrial injuries to the same body parts for which he was awarded compensation based on a percent permanent disability rating the wcj awarded him in compensation based on the difference between these ratings,percent,and the board denied reconsideration.

we granted review to resolve the split of authority.
discussion 
we take as a given that each injured worker in these cases has a level of permanent disability and that some but not all of that current level of permanent disability is properly apportioned to the most recent industrial injury.the common question we must answer is how should compensation for that portion be computed 
i.the apportionment problem 
california workers compensation system was established to provide for the health,safety,and welfare of workers in the event of industrial injury by relieving them from the consequences of any injury incurred by employees in the course of their employment.mathews workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,fn,quoting stats,ch,see also claxton waters cal th,d.
the panoply of benefits the system provides includes compensation for permanent disability.p ermanent disability is understood as the irreversible residual of an injury.kopping workers comp.appeals bd.th,d,quoting cal.workers compensation practice ed,italics omitted.a permanent disability is one which causes impairment of earning capacity,impairment of the normal use of a member,or a competitive handicap in the open labor market.state compensation ins.fund industrial acc.com.cal d.thus,permanent disability payments are intended to compensate workers for both physical loss and the loss of some or all of their future earning capacity,subd.a livitsanos superior court cal th,d.
permanent disability payments are calculated by first expressing the degree of permanent disability as a percentage and then converting that percentage into an award based on a table.until april,the table was straightforward an injured worker received four weeks of benefits for each percentage point of disability.former,added by stats,ch,fuentes,supra,cal d at.thus,for example,a worker determined to have suffered percent permanent disability would receive weeks of benefits,while one with a percent disability would receive weeks of benefits.
employers must compensate injured workers only for that portion of their permanent disability attributable to a current industrial injury,not for that portion attributable to previous injuries or to nonindustrial factors.apportionment is the process employed by the board to segregate the residuals of an industrial injury from those attributable to other industrial injuries,or to nonindustrial factors,in order to fairly allocate the legal responsibility.ashley workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.under the table,apportionment to previous injuries was relatively straightforward.because the additional compensation for each additional percentage point of disability was linear,it mattered not whether one focused on the difference in percent between the current level of disability and the previous level of disability,or the difference in dollars between the payout at the current level of disability and the payout at the previous level of disability either method of subtraction would lead to the same current award.
however,in the legislature amended the table to create a sliding scale of benefits and more generously compensate for more severe disabilities.under the new table,benefits rose not linearly but exponentially.thus,for example,under the revised table a worker with a percent disability would receive approximately three weeks of benefits for each percent of disability for an award of weeks,while a worker with a percent disability would receive approximately six weeks of benefits for each percent of disability for an award of weeks.former,stats,ch,fuentes,supra,cal d at.
this amendment created a new apportionment problem in situations where a previously disabled worker suffered a new injury.consider again the worker who was already percent disabled,but after the new injury was percent disabled.under the new tables,the difference between the award for a percent disability and the award for a percent disability was no longer equal to the award for an percent disability,the difference between these two disability levels thus,it mattered whether one either calculated the percentage of disability attributable to the new injury by subtracting the old rating from the new rating,then consulted the table for the award due this difference an approach dubbed formula a fuentes,supra,cal d at,or consulted the table for the award due at the new disability rating,then subtracted from that the amount that would have been awarded under the old disability rating an approach dubbed formula c ibid.
ii.fuentes workers compensation appeals board 
this court resolved the apportionment problem in fuentes,concluding based on statutory interpretation that the formula a approach was correct.fuentes,the injured worker,was percent permanently disabled,with percent of this due to industrial causes and the rest attributable to a nonindustrial disability.in deciding how to determine compensation,we interpreted former section,which provided an employee who is suffering from a previous permanent disability or physical impairment and sustains permanent injury thereafter shall not receive from the employer compensation for the later injury in excess of the compensation allowed for such injury when considered by itself and not in conjunction with or in relation to the previous disability.the employer shall not be liable for compensation to such an employee for the combined disability,but only for that portion due to the later injury as though no prior disability or impairment had existed.former,added by stats,ch,italics added.this language,we reasoned,required the current industrial portion of the disability to be considered in isolation,wholly independent of any nonindustrial or previous industrial disability.fuentes,supra,cal d at.thus,a worker with a percent industrial disability,percent current and percent preexisting,and a worker with a percent current disability,percent industrial and percent nonindustrial,should each be treated the same as a worker with a percent industrial disability.we described the policy behind this section and rule as encourag ing employers to hire the handicapped id.at,because an employer who did so would not have to fear greater compensation costs if a worker with a preexisting disability were to be injured.accordingly,we adopted formula a,which alone among the proposed formulas apportioned to every current industrial disability of a given level the same compensation,irrespective of previous or nonindustrial disabilities.fuentes,at.
fuentes argued that this rule was inconsistent with the revised section adoption of progressive payments.we disagreed,explaining that section should be read as a general provision establishing the amount of compensation benefits for a permanent disability,and section as a specific rule limiting the benefits available in those cases where the employee has a preexisting permanent disability and thereafter sustains a further permanent injury.fuentes,supra,cal d at.we also rejected the argument that section,which requires that the workers compensation statutes be read liberally in favor of extending benefits to injured workers see claxton waters,supra,cal th at,d,required a different result where the legislature intent in enacting a particular statute is clear,section general rule of liberal construction will not compel a contrary result.fuentes,at.
fuentes involved apportionment between industrial and nonindustrial disabilities,but nothing in the majority opinion suggested former section might be read differently when apportioning between a current industrial disability and a previous one.thereafter,the courts and the board routinely applied formula a in apportioning between industrial disabilities as well,department of education workers comp.appeals bd.th,d ramirez workers comp.appeals bd,wl.
iii.senate bill and its application to the apportionment problem 
so the law stood,settled,for years.then in,the legislature enacted omnibus reform of the workers compensation system.of significance here,senate bill reg.sess.overhauled the statutes governing apportionment,repealing both section and section statute we relied on in fuentes,supra,cal d,as compelling adoption of formula enacting a revised section and new section.stats,ch,repealing former,revising,adding new,repealing former.these changes raised the question is the fuentes formula a approach still valid 
the board and various courts of appeal have reached three different conclusions.some,like the court of appeal in welcher and the board majority,hold that formula a is still correct.nabors i,supra,at en banc.others reason that by repealing section,senate bill reg.sess.effectively superseded fuentes,and formula c is now correct.dykes,supra,th at,d nabors ii,supra,th at,d following dykes nabors i,supra,at dis.opn.of comr.caplane.the court of appeal in brodie adopted a third approach,holding that while fuentes has been superseded,the correct formula is a modification of formula c in which one subtracts not the actual award previously paid out in old dollars,but the award for that previous percentage disability that would be due today in current dollars 
having reviewed both the language of senate bill reg.sess.and its legislative history,we conclude formula a,the formula approved by fuentes,remains the law.
in interpreting the new provisions enacted by senate bill reg.sess,our goal is to divine and give effect to the legislature intent.elsner uveges cal th,d.we begin with a comparison and analysis of the language of the old and new statutes.see dubois workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d.former section provided only limited apportionment where an industrial injury aggravated a preexisting disease or condition in case of aggravation of any disease existing prior to a compensable injury,compensation shall be allowed only for the proportion of the disability due to the aggravation of such prior disease which is reasonably attributed to the injury.former,added by stats,ch,and repealed by stats,ch.in contrast,revised section,subdivision a provides apportionment of permanent disability shall be based on causation.subdivision b requires physicians preparing permanent disability reports to address causation.subdivision c requires in relevant part that permanent disability reports include an apportionment determination.a physician shall make an apportionment determination by finding what approximate percentage of the permanent disability was caused by the direct result of injury arising out of and occurring in the course of employment and what approximate percentage of the permanent disability was caused by other factors both before and subsequent to the industrial injury,including prior industrial injuries,subd.c.
building on this principle of apportionment according to cause,section,subdivision a provides the employer shall only be liable for the percentage of permanent disability directly caused by the injury arising out of and occurring in the course of employment.further,i f the applicant has received a prior award of permanent disability,it shall be conclusively presumed that the prior permanent disability exists at the time of any subsequent industrial industry.this presumption is a presumption affecting the burden of proof,subd.b.the remainder of section sets limits on cumulative permanent disability awards.
while section,subdivision a authorizes apportionment by causation,and section,subdivision a confines an employer liability to the percentage of disability directly caused by the current industrial injury,neither provision specifies how they are to be used in conjunction with section,the table that converts a disability percentage into an actual award.certainly nothing in current section or section expressly requires formula a,b,c,modified c,or any other approach to calculating compensation.nor does anything in the language implicitly do so.we thus agree with the courts of appeal in brodie and dykes insofar as they recognized that i n adopting sen ate bill,the legislature did not outline any particular method for apportioning either a permanent disability award or a life pension.dykes,supra,th at,d.contrary to the arguments of both sides,the plain language of these provisions considered in isolation does not resolve the problem.however,as we shall explain,neither does the repeal of section which did implicitly compel application of formula a now require rejection of that formula.
the answer to the problem is more readily apparent when we reframe the question and ask by adopting new and different language governing apportionment,did the legislature intend to adopt a new and different formula as we have explained,w e do not presume that the legislature intends,when it enacts a statute,to overthrow principles of law unless such intention is clearly expressed or necessarily implied.people superior court zamudio cal th,d,accord,regency outdoor advertising,city of los angeles cal th,d.we conclude the answer is no and the formula we approved in fuentes still applies.to explain why this is so,we explore the nature of apportionment and the problem the legislature was trying to solve.
until,former section and case law interpreting the workers compensation scheme closely circumscribed the bases for apportionment.apportionment based on causation was prohibited.pullman kellogg workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,it is disability resulting from,rather than a cause of,a disease which is the proper subject of apportionment pathology may not be apportioned.instead,a disability resulting from industrial and nonindustrial causes was apportionable only if the b oard finds that part of the disability would have resulted from the normal progress of the underlying nonindustrial disease.ibid.this rule left employers liable for any portion of a disability that would not have occurred but for the current industrial cause if the disability arose in part from an interaction between an industrial cause and a nonindustrial cause,but the nonindustrial cause would not alone have given rise to a disability,no apportionment was to be allowed.ballard workmen.bd.cal d,where an industrial injury lights up or aggravates a previously existing nonindustrial condition resulting in disability,liability for the full disability without proration is imposed upon the employer gay workers comp.appeals bd.d.in apportioning under former labor code section it must be shown that the apportioned percentage of nonindustrial permanent disability would have resulted even in the absence of the industrial injury.
under these rules,in case after case courts properly rejected apportionment of a single disability with multiple causes.see,pullman kellogg workers comp.appeals,supra,cal d at,no apportionment of lung injury between industrial inhalation of toxic fumes and nonindustrial smoking habit zemke workmen.bd.cal d,no apportionment of back disability between industrial back injury and nonindustrial arthritis berry workmen.bd.cal d,no apportionment of knee disability where industrial knee injury triggered advancement of previously dormant nonindustrial fungal disease idaho maryland.acc.com.d,no apportionment between industrial exposure to mine gas and nonindustrial latent heart disease.in short,so long as the industrial cause was a proximate cause of the disability,the employer would be liable for the entire disability,without apportionment.
while former section was interpreted as constraining employers in their ability to show apportionment based on nonindustrial causes,former section was interpreted as granting employees wide latitude to disprove apportionment based on prior permanent disability awards by demonstrating that they had substantially rehabilitated the injury.see,national auto.cas.ins.industrial acc.com.d.in national,the employee sustained a back injury and was rated percent permanently disabled.he later sustained a second back injury and was rated percent permanently disabled,but introduced medical testimony,accepted by the board predecessor,the industrial accident commission,that he had rehabilitated his injury to the point that he was only percent disabled immediately before the second injury.the court of appeal affirmed an award of percent disability,not the percent the insurer argued for,concluding that former section permitted proof of rehabilitation.national,at.see also mercier workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,fn,approving rehabilitation principle in dicta robinson workers comp.appeals bd.d.rejecting any apportionment under former,despite prior permanent disability award,where evidence showed full rehabilitation between first and second injury.
the plain language of new sections and demonstrates they were intended to reverse these features of former sections and.kleemann workers comp.appeals bd.th,d fns.thus,new sections,subdivision a and,subdivision a eliminate the bar against apportionment based on pathology and asymptomatic causes yeager construction workers comp.appeals bd.th,d escobedo marshalls,en banc,while section,subdivision b was intended to reverse the rule based on former section that permitted an injured employee to show rehabilitation of an injury for which a permanent disability award had already been issued kopping workers comp.appeals,supra,th at,d sanchez county of los angeles,en banc.
this explains the legislature purpose in adopting a revised section and a new section.further,one can see why it was necessary to repeal former sections and.these provisions,as interpreted by the courts,were inconsistent with the new regime of apportionment based on causation,as well as the conclusive presumption that previous permanent disability still existed for apportionment purposes,subd.a,subds.a,b.former section required consideration of the new injury by itself and not in conjunction with or in relation to the previous disability or impairment and further called for compensation for the later injury to be determined as though no prior disability or impairment had existed.but under senate bill reg.sess,the new approach to apportionment is to look at the current disability and parcel out its causative,prior industrial,current decide the amount directly caused by the current industrial source.this approach requires thorough consideration of past injuries,not disregard of them.thus,repeal of section was necessary to effect the legislature purposes in adopting a causation regime.
given that repeal of section was necessary to carry out the legislature intended switch to apportionment by causation,and that intended switch alone provides a sufficient explanation for the repeal,it is unnecessary to impute to the legislature a further intent to also change the method for computing compensation awards in order to explain its actions.occam hypothesizing complicated explanations when a simpler one is here 
however,because the plain language of the current sections and and the repeal of section do not alone conclusively repudiate any intent to change how disability percentages are converted to compensation awards,we consider as well the legislative history.if the legislature had intended a departure from formula a,one would expect to find some trace of this intent in the legislative history,just as the legislative history explicitly identifies more than two dozen other intended reforms enacted by senate bill reg.sess,including numerous intended changes to the apportionment scheme.as the facts of these five consolidated cases demonstrate,a change from formula a to formula b or either version of
