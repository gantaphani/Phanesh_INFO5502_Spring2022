we granted review in this matter and in the companion case,degrassi cook cal th,d,degrassi,to consider whether an individual may bring an action for money damages on the basis of an alleged violation of a provision of the california constitution,in the absence of a statutory provision or an established common law tort authorizing such a damage remedy for the constitutional violation.in the present case,plaintiff seeks,among other relief,monetary damages based upon defendant alleged violation of his due process liberty interest under article i,section,subdivision a,of the california constitution hereafter article i,section a,by failing to provide him with a timely hearing after his removal as department chairman at a university medical center.we conclude that an action for damages is not available 
in,plaintiff richard katzberg was appointed professor of medicine at the university of california at davis medical school and chairperson of the department of radiology at the university of california davis medical center.in july,the university commenced an investigation concerning alleged mishandling of funds by the department of radiology.in february,the university issued a press release regarding the investigation,and the sacramento district attorney office thereafter announced that it would initiate a criminal investigation.
the investigation concerned approximately that allegedly had been placed inappropriately in radiology accounts to be used for payment of department expenses.most of this money came from rebates provided by medical equipment vendors.there never has been any allegation that plaintiff made any personal use of the challenged funds.instead,the alleged improprieties related to placement of funds in the department account rather than in the medical center general funds.
in march,the university announced that appropriate personnel actions had been initiated,but did not name any specific employee.later that month,plaintiff was removed as chairperson of the department.he remained a tenured professor at the medical school and a staff physician at the medical center.
in february,plaintiff sued various defendants on numerous grounds,and the resulting litigation has moved back and forth between state and federal courts for present purposes,it is sufficient to note that plaintiff third amended one here at as defendants the regents of the university of california the regents and the chancellor of the university of california at davis,larry vanderhoef hereafter collectively,defendants.the complaint alleged that by making stigmatizing statements about plaintiff in the course of removing him from his position as department chairperson,defendants violated the liberty interest of plaintiff protected under article i,section a.
although the department chairmanship was an position,terminable without cause at the discretion of the chancellor of the davis campus and hence plaintiff concedes that he had no due process property right to that position,it is well established that an public employee liberty interests are deprived when his discharge is accompanied by charges that might seriously damage his standing and associations in his community or impose on him a stigma or other disability that foreclose s his freedom to take advantage of other employment opportunities.holmes hallinan th,d,quoting board of regents roth,d roth.when such a liberty deprivation occurs,a party has a right to a hearing.codd velger,d.
the third amended complaint alleged that plaintiff had not been provided with such a hearing at which he could defend himself,either prior to,or since,his removal.the complaint also sought a variety of relief,including an injunction,damages,attorney fees,and costs.
the trial court granted defendants motion to strike the prayer for relief.later,in october and a half years after plaintiff offered plaintiff a hearing.for the next few months,the parties negotiated unsuccessfully concerning the parameters of such a hearing.in february,defendants revised and renewed the proposal for a hearing,but plaintiff rejected that offer,and no such hearing has been held.
defendants thereafter moved for summary judgment on plaintiff claim on the grounds that i a liberty interest violation could not be proved,because the alleged false statements are not stigmatizing as a matter of law,and ii even if a liberty interest violation could be proved,the remedy would be limited to a hearing,which plaintiff previously had rejected.plaintiff opposed the motion on the ground,among others,that defendants had not offered him an adequate hearing.
in april,following a court hearing,the trial judge granted summary judgment to defendants,finding they had offered plaintiff an adequate hearing,and that such a postremoval hearing was the sole remedy for the asserted liberty interest violation under the due process clause of article i,section a.the court found that money damages were not available under california law to remedy infringement of liberty interests,or to remedy any alleged undue delay in the offer of a hearing.the trial court confined its ruling on the summary judgment motion to the damages issue,and did not rule on defendants claim that plaintiff allegations were insufficient to demonstrate a violation.
upon review,the court of appeal began by noting that the state constitutional due process liberty interest alleged to have been violated in this case has been recognized under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment of the federal constitution in roth,supra,d.in that decision the high court observed that w here a person good name,reputation,honor,or integrity is at stake because of what the government is doing to him,notice and an opportunity to be heard are essential.citations.in such a case,due process would accord an opportunity to refute the charge before university officials.ibid.the court of appeal stated that it would assume for purposes of analysis that a similar liberty interest exists under article i,section a of the state constitution,and it further assumed that the facts alleged in this case state a violation of plaintiff due process liberty interest under this provision of the state constitution.focusing solely upon the damages question,the court of appeal affirmed the trial court grant of summary judgment for defendants,holding that money damages are not available to remedy such a violation of the liberty interest under article i,section a.
in this court,plaintiff contends that article i,section a affords him a right to damages for the asserted violation of his due process liberty interest.by contrast,defendants assert that a hearing is the sole remedy that a court should impose for the alleged constitutional violation.for purposes of analyzing the damages issue upon which we granted review,we shall assume,as did the court of appeal,that the facts alleged in the third amended complaint are sufficient to establish a violation of the due process liberty interest under the state constitution due process clause.
article i,section of the california constitution states the provisions of this constitution are mandatory and prohibitory,unless by express words they are declared to be otherwise.under this provision,all branches of government are required to comply with constitutional directives mosk superior court cal d,fn.malting city and county of san francisco cal d,or prohibitions sail er inn,kirby cal d.leger stockton unified school dist.d.leger.as we observed more than a century ago,e very constitutional provision is to this extent,that everything done in violation of it is void.oakland paving hilton cal.
accordingly,the question posed in this case is not whether article i,section a is.it is clear that the due process clause of article i,section a is,and that even without any effectuating legislation,all branches of government are required to comply with its terms.furthermore,it also is clear that,like many other constitutional provisions,this section supports an action,brought by a private plaintiff against a proper defendant,for declaratory relief or for injunction.see generally skelly state personnel board cal d,friesen,state constitutional law litigating individual rights,claims,and defenses ed.a,pp.friesen.the question presented here is whether,assuming the complaint states a violation of plaintiff due process liberty interest,plaintiff may maintain an action for monetary damages to remedy the asserted violation of his due process liberty interests under article i,section a,on the facts alleged 
more than years ago in bivens six unknown fed.narcotics agents,d bivens,the united states supreme court recognized the right of a party to recover damages for the violation of a constitutional right in an action against federal agents.in bivens,a citizen fourth amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure was violated by federal law enforcement officers.the court in bivens did not approach the issue as posing a question whether the fourth amendment was intended to provide an action for damages,or whether such an intent could be inferred from that provision instead,the court viewed the matter as posing a question whether the court should create a cause of action for effect,a constitutional remedy a fourth amendment violation,even though congress had not specifically provided such a remedy and even though the fourth amendment does not provide for enforcement by an award of damages,at.see also,at.conc.opn.by harlan.the high court reasoned that as a general proposition federal courts may use any available remedy to make good the wrong done,at.in support of its conclusion that a damages remedy was warranted,the court emphasized that i there existed no special factors counseling hesitation to recognize such a right ibid.ii there was no equally effective alternative remedy,at.see also,at.conc.opn.of harlan,and iii there was no explicit congressional declaration that persons injured by a federal officer violation of the fourth amendment may not recover money damages from the agents,at.
subsequent to bivens,the united states supreme court has considered numerous cases in which plaintiffs have sought money damages under a constitutional cause of action premised upon the asserted violation of various federal constitutional provisions.after twice following the lead of bivens,and recognizing the availability of a constitutional tort action for damages on the strength of the considerations set out above davis passman,d davis damages allowed to remedy violation by former congressman of equal protection component of fifth amendment due process clause carlson green,d carlson damages allowed to remedy eighth amendment violations by prison officials,the high court for the past two decades repeatedly has refused to recognize a federal constitutional tort action for money damages in cases presenting that issue.chappell wallace,d chappell alleged equal protection violations by superior officer in united states military bush lucas,d bush alleged first amendment violation against federal agency employee by superiors united states stanley,d alleged due process violations by military personnel during the course of active military service schweiker chilicky,d schweiker alleged due process violation by government officials,resulting in deprivation of social security benefits fdic meyer,d meyer alleged due process violation concerning employment termination by federal agency correctional services malesko,d,malesko alleged eighth amendment violation by private operator of federal prison halfway house.
in each of these more recent cases,the high court found that the first bivens consideration mentioned above special factors that counsel hesitation by a court in recognizing a constitutional tort damages against recognition of that remedy.bivens,supra.and in these recent cases,the court also substantially retreated from,and reformulated,the other bivens considerations mentioned above.the court has found that the absence of a complete alternative remedy will not support an action for damages,so long as a meaningful alternative remedy in state or federal law is available bush,supra,at.schweiker,supra,at,and it has implicitly discarded the proposition,mentioned in bivens,supra,at,d,and emphasized in davis,supra,d,and carlson,supra,d,that money damages are presumptively available unless congress prohibits that remedy,chappell,supra,at.bush,supra,at.schweiker,supra,at.meyer,supra,at.
the experience in other jurisdictions has been similar.some decisions,often relying upon a combination of i the jurisdiction indigenous common law antecedents,ii special legislative history,and iii the restatement second of torts section have recognized a constitutional tort cause of action and corresponding right to be awarded money damages for various state constitutional violations a greater number of cases,however,often tracking the reasoning of the most recent united states supreme court decisions or pointing to the absence of any historical basis for implying a damages action,have declined to recognize such a constitutional tort or implied damages remedy in a variety of circumstances 
california decisions have followed a similar trend.putting aside cases recognizing an inverse condemnation action for damages to remedy a violation of the state just compensation clause a constitutional provision that clearly contemplates an award of damages determined in a judicial proceeding,see cal,art.i,only two decisions,each filed two decades ago,have recognized an action for damages to remedy a violation of the state constitution.all subsequent decisions addressing the issue have declined to find such an action for damages.we proceed to review,in chronological order,the relevant california cases.
in gay law students pacific.cal d,gay law students,this court addressed an action by employees who claimed they were discriminated against by their employer,a telephone company,on the basis of their sexual orientation.our opinion observed that the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief,and also prayed for monetary damages,at.without expressly addressing the question of availability of damages in addition to the requested equitable relief,we held that the plaintiffs could maintain a direct court action under the california equal protection clause,article i,section a gay law students,at fn.in the process of announcing this holding we added a signal and citation to bivens,supra,d.gay law students,supra,at.
plaintiff suggests that our citation in gay law students,supra,cal d,to those pages of bivens implies approval of a damages remedy for the equal protection violation asserted in gay law students.only the last few of the pages cited from bivens spoke to the question of damages,however,and given the circumstance that in gay law students,we did not explicitly address the question of damages,it would be an overstatement to interpret that decision,or its citation to bivens,as directly endorsing such a remedy.
plaintiff does,however,find support for his position in the court of appeal opinion in laguna publishing golden rain foundation d.laguna publishing.in that case the court of appeal,in a decision,held that the owners of a private gated retirement community violated a newspaper publisher state free speech and press rights cal,art.i,subd.a by enforcing a rule barring the distribution of unsolicited free newspapers within the community,and the court remanded the case for a new trial at which the plaintiff would have an opportunity to prove damages.laguna publishing,at.in reaching this conclusion and expressly finding that money damages were available,the majority stressed the special dignity of the rights of free speech and free press,at,italics in original,thereby suggesting that violation of such rights may be remedied by equitable relief damages but that violation of other constitutional rights of lesser dignity may not warrant relief in damages.the majority did not consider whether article i,section,subdivision a was intended to afford a damages remedy,and,instead,appears to have found a right to damages based upon a constitutional tort theory similar to that employed in bivens and its progeny.
shortly after laguna publishing was filed,the court of appeal in fenton groveland community services dist.d.fenton considered a suit in which it was claimed that various county officials denied the plaintiffs their right to vote in a general election.the plaintiffs filed an action for damages to remedy the asserted violation of voting rights under california constitution,article ii,section.in the process of addressing various claims of immunity,and without focusing upon the propriety of damages as a remedy for the asserted violation,the court impliedly endorsed,in passing,the notion that there exists a right to seek damages to remedy a violation of the state constitutional right to vote.as in laguna publishing,supra,d,the court in fenton did not consider whether our constitution provision was intended to afford such a remedy instead,it simply relied upon laguna publishing and the asserted special dignity of the right to vote fenton,at,and upon inverse condemnation case law.ibid.
most subsequent california cases that have addressed the availability of decided by the court of taken an approach different from the constitutional tort analysis of bivens and its progeny.whereas bivens and many of the federal and state decisions that have applied its principles have focused upon the circumstances in which a court should create or recognize a tort action premised upon violation of a constitutional provision,most california decisions issued during the past two decades,by contrast,have viewed the determinative question as whether an action for damages exists in or can be inferred from the constitutional provision at issue.accordingly,most of the recent california decisions expressly focus their analysis upon whether the provision at issue was intended,either expressly or impliedly,to afford relief in damages.
in leger,supra,d.leger,a high school student who was assaulted in a restroom sued the school district for damages under the safe schools clause of california constitution,article i,section,subdivision c article i,section c the court of appeal reviewed the history of that provision,which was added to the constitution as part of a broad criminal justice initiative in,and found no indication to suggest it was intended to support an action for damages in the absence of enabling and defining legislation.leger,at.the court also observed that the plaintiff had not advanced a constitutional tort theory of recovery,and declined to address such a theory,at,fn.the court held that the plaintiff could not maintain an action for damages.
in clausing san francisco unified school district d.clausing,the court of appeal considered an action for damages to remedy asserted violations of both the safe schools clause art.i,c and the privacy clause art.i,of the california constitution,based upon a school district alleged physical and emotional mistreatment of a handicapped student.on the first point,the court agreed with leger,supra,d,finding nothing in the legislative history of section,subdivision c,to suggest that it was intended to create a civil action for damages.clausing,supra,d at.on the second point,the court summarily concluded that the privacy provision affords only a right to injunctive relief and does not afford a right to damages,at.accordingly,the court declined to allow either action for damages.
the plaintiffs in gates superior court,supra,th,d gates sought damages to remedy an asserted violation of their rights under the state equal protection clause cal,art.i,based upon the allegedly discriminatory deployment of police protection during a riot.the court found that neither the language of the provision,nor the court extensive review of the historical documents underlying the provision,revealed any intent to afford a damages remedy th at,d,and declined to allow such an action 
in bonner city of santa ana th,d bonner,a homeless man stored his bag of possessions under a bush near the santa ana city hall.city employees found the bag and discarded it.the plaintiff sued for damages,asserting violations of his due process right to property and of his equal protection rights.art.i,a.relying upon gates,supra,th,d,the court found no intent by the electorate to provide a damages remedy for violations of the state equal protection clause,and declined to allow such an action.bonner,supra,th at,d.
the court in bonner also undertook an analysis of the voters intent with regard to affording a damages action to remedy the asserted due process clause violation.bonner,supra,th,d.the court concluded from its review of bivens,supra,d,and its,davis,supra,d the due process clause of the federal constitution supports an action for damages,in the absence of an alternative or equally effective remedy.the court in bonner hypothesized that the voters intent in enacting the due process right set out in article i,section a,was to mirror the due process right recognized in its federal counterpart,and accordingly the court in bonner reasoned that in the absence of an alternative or equally effective remedy,the state due process clause similarly provided a right to damages.the court in bonner ultimately concluded that damages were not available,however,on the ground that the plaintiff had an effective alternative common law action for conversion.bonner,supra,th at,d.
thereafter the plaintiff in bradley medical board th,d bradley asserted a due process violation under article i,section a,relating to his surrender of a medical license while disciplinary charges were pending against him.he sought damages for the alleged violation.relying upon bonner,supra,th,d,and gates,supra,th,d,the court in bradley summarily and categorically concluded there is no right to sue for monetary damages under this constitutional provision.bradley,supra,th at,d.
apart from the present case and the companion matter,degrassi,the most recent court of appeal decision addressing the general issue of money damages to remedy a state constitutional violation is carlsbad aquafarm,state of health services th,d carlsbad aquafarm.in that case,a shellfish producer sued a state agency for damages allegedly resulting from the agency refusal to process a form that was required to permit the producer to sell its products outside california,a refusal that the producer claimed violated its procedural due process rights under article i,section a.the court in carlsbad aquafarm held that no such action for damages could be maintained.
the court began by taking note of bivens,supra,d,and most of the subsequent united states supreme court and california decisions discussed above.carlsbad aquafarm,supra,th,d.having discerned no single rationale underlying those decisions ibid,the court proposed an analysis that essentially combines i some of the factors that have been considered in the constitutional tort cases,and ii the analysis adopted by recent california court of appeal decisions on reviewing these decisions,we believe the issue of whether to recognize a state constitutional tort is essentially one of policy and is dependent on numerous factors,including the voters intent in permitting monetary damages for a violation of the particular constitutional provision the availability of another remedy the extent to which the provision is and the judicial manageability of the tort and the importance of the constitutional right,at,d.after a pplying appropriate weight to each of these factors ibid,the court concluded that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover damages for the state alleged violation of its procedural due process rights.
as we shall explain,we conclude it is appropriate to employ the following framework for determining the existence of a damages action to remedy an asserted constitutional violation.first,we shall inquire whether there is evidence from which we may find or infer,within the constitutional provision at issue,an affirmative intent either to authorize or to withhold a damages action to remedy a violation.in undertaking this inquiry we shall consider the language and history of the constitutional provision at issue,including whether it contains guidelines,mechanisms,or procedures implying a monetary remedy,as well as any pertinent common law history.if we find any such intent,we shall give it effect.
second,if no affirmative intent either to authorize or to withhold a damages remedy is found,we shall undertake the constitutional tort analysis adopted by bivens and its progeny.among the relevant factors in this analysis are whether an adequate remedy exists,the extent to which a constitutional tort action would change established tort law,and the nature and significance of the constitutional provision.if we find that these factors militate against recognizing the constitutional tort,our inquiry ends.if,however,we find that these factors favor recognizing a constitutional tort,we also shall consider the existence of any special factors counseling hesitation in recognizing a damages action,including deference to legislative judgment,avoidance of adverse policy consequences,considerations of government fiscal policy,practical issues of proof,and the competence of courts to assess particular types of damages.
we begin our inquiry by asking whether,when the constitutional provision at issue was adopted,the enactors intended that it include a damages remedy for its violation.carlsbad aquafarm,supra,th,d gates,supra,th,d,and cases cited see generally white davis,supra,cal d.
such an intent may be quite clear on the face of a particular example,it is plain that california constitution article i,section,which provides that p rivate property may be taken or damaged for public use only when just compensation,ascertained by a jury unless waived,has first been paid to,or into court for,the owner,supports an action for money damages,and our cases consistently have so held.see cases cited ante,fn.but with regard to most constitutional provisions,the words of the provision do not on their own manifest any such intent.
the due process clause of article i,section a,falls within this latter category.it states in relevant part a person may not be deprived of life,liberty,or property without due process of law these words do not explicitly disclose an intent either to authorize or to withhold damages as a remedy for a violation of the provision.accordingly,we must look further in our attempt to discern whether article i,section a was intended to include a damages remedy.
in considering evidence of an implied right to seek damages,we shall review the available drafting history of the provision at issue and materials that were before the voters when they adopted the measure.
article i,section a was added to the state constitution by the adoption of proposition on the november ballot.see gates,supra,th at,d.the ballot pamphlet provided to all voters prior to the general election in explained that the measure was designed to revise article i,the california constitution declaration of rights,in a number of respects,one of which was to set out some basic rights that were then presently contained in the federal constitution but not listed in the state charter.ballot,analysis of.among such rights,the legislative analyst explained,was the following right b a person may not be deprived of life,liberty,or property without due process of the law,italics added.
although the state constitution long had contained a similarly worded due process provision prior to see cal,former art.i,no person shall be deprived of life,liberty,or property without due process of law cal.const.of,art.i,same,the previous incarnations of the state constitutional due process right were contained within broad provisions setting forth the rights of criminal defendants.the amendment,placing the clause in article i,section a,was designed to make it clear that the due process guarantee applied not only in criminal prosecutions,but afforded a general civil right as well 
we have reviewed the relevant passages of the debates that preceded adoption of the and constitutions.see browne,of the debates in convention of cal.on formation of state const,adopting the due process language without debate,address to the people of california,introducing the proposed constitution willis stockton,debates and proceedings,cal.const.convention,adopting the due process language without debate,address to the people of the state of california,introducing the proposed constitution.the parties have not cited,nor have we discovered,any indication in these materials suggesting that the drafters considered the question whether the predecessors to article i,section a would provide a remedy in damages for violation of the liberty interest of the due process clause.walinski,supra,d,drafters of the illinois constitution antidiscrimination clause intended to create a right to enforce that provision through action for damages brown,supra,drafters of the new york constitution assumed that damages would be allowed to remedy state search and seizure violations,and implicitly approved allowing that remedy.nor have we discovered any evidence that the drafters of the revision,which as noted broadened the due process guarantee so as to afford both criminal and civil rights,considered the issue or had any such intent.see cal.const.revision,art.i declaration of rights background study concerning proposed revision of former article i,section,background study concerning proposed revision of former article i,section cal.const.revision,article i declaration of rights ii concerning proposed revision of former article i,section,iv concerning proposed revision of former article i,section cal.const.revision,proposed revision,supra,concerning the right to due process in criminal proceedings,at concerning extension of civil rights of due process and equal protection see generally cal.const.revision,materials relating to provisions in cal.const.recommended or endorsed by com.
we also have examined the materials that were placed before the voters when the provision last was amended in.ballot.like the court of appeal in gates,supra,th,d,which examined these same materials in order to consider the voters implied intent to create a damages remedy with respect to the equal protection clause of article i,section a gates,at,d,we find nothing in the ballot materials to suggest that the voters affirmatively intended to create,within article i,section a,a damages remedy with respect to the due process clause set forth in this constitutional provision indeed,there is nothing to suggest that the issue was considered at all.
as noted above,one recent decision,bonner,supra,th,d,concluded otherwise,finding that the voters in intended to permit an action for damages to remedy a state due process violation if there is no alternative remedy.the court in bonner reasoned that because the voters pamphlet in advised that proposition would add rights presently contained in the federal charter,and because in davis,supra,d,the united states supreme court construed the equal protection component of the federal due process clause to permit a damages remedy for a violation in circumstances in which no other remedy was available,the voters who adopted proposition must have intended to provide a damages remedy for a state constitutional due process violation whenever a plaintiff has no alternative or effective remedy.
we find bonner voter intent analysis to be unpersuasive,and adopt the critique of that conclusion set out in carlsbad aquafarm,supra,th,d.as the court of appeal in carlsbad aquafarm pointed out first,davis passman,supra,d,and the subsequent united states supreme court authority relied upon by bonner were decided after proposition adoption by the voters.it is not reasonable to infer from the single statement in the voter pamphlet that the voters would have predicted the united states supreme court extension of bivens to a procedural due process claim.second,the language in the voter pamphlet relied upon by the bonner court states only that proposition puts rights into the state constitution that presently are contained in the federal constitution.bonner,supra,th at,d,italics omitted.this statement does not necessarily mean the voters would have understood they were adopting the analysis of the united states supreme court with respect to the existence of a damages remedy pertaining to those rights.carlsbad aquafarm,supra,th at,d.
plaintiff concedes that bonner analysis of voter intent is unpersuasive,but insists nevertheless that the voters must have intended to provide a damages remedy because without such a remedy the provision adoption would be a vain and meaningless act and any other construction of the provision would make its language a mere mockery we are unpersuaded.even if the due process right embodied in article i,section a is enforceable only through an action for injunctive or declaratory relief,and not by an action for damages,this constitutional provision is hardly rendered innocuous or empty.
we conclude that the materials that were before the voters when they adopted the current version of article i,section a in november,provide no basis upon which to infer an intent that the provision itself permit an action for damages to remedy a violation of that clause.
we next consider the extent to which the provision,even if not setting forth an explicit indication of a right to damages,nevertheless contains guidelines,mechanisms,or procedures from which a damages remedy could be inferred.leger,supra,d at.carlsbad aquafarm,supra,th,d.the presence of such express or implied guidelines,mechanisms,or procedures may support an inference that the provision was intended to afford such a remedy.
again,we agree with the court in carlsbad aquafarm,supra,th,d,which,addressing this consideration in the context of alleged violations of the right to procedural due process,observed that article i,section a neither includes nor suggests any such guidelines,mechanisms,or procedures,but instead reflects general principles without laying down rules by means of which those principles may be given the force of law.see leger,supra,d at.carlsbad aquafarm,supra th at,d.although plaintiff asserts that california courts are capable of fashioning procedures to govern damage claims in this context,and this may be so,it is not relevant to the point here at issue.the question at this stage of the analysis is whether there are guidelines,mechanisms,or procedures set out in or reasonably inferable from the provision itself from which we may infer that the voters,in adopting article i,section a,affirmatively intended that the provision permit an action for damages to remedy a violation of that clause.article i,section a contains no such guidelines,mechanisms,or procedures.
in considering evidence of an implied right to seek damages,we also believe it appropriate to examine,as have sister state jurisdictions that have permitted damage suits to remedy search and seizure violations,common law history from which we might infer,within the provision at issue,an intent to provide an action for damages to remedy a violation of that provision.see brown,supra,widgeon,supra,moresi,supra,so d.
for example,in recognizing a right to damages to remedy a violation of the state search and seizure and equal protection provisions,the new york court of appeals observed that the courts have looked to the antecedents of the constitutional provision to discover whether a damage remedy may be implied.new york first constitution in recognized and adopted the existing common law of england and each succeeding constitution has continued that practice.thus,in some cases,there exist grounds for implying a damage remedy based upon preexisting duties and rights.brown,supra.
the court in brown found such grounds for implying a right of action.first,the court observed,t he prohibition against unlawful searches and seizures originated in the magna carta and has been part of our statutory law since.the civil cause of action was fully developed in england and provided a damage remedy for the victims of unlawful searches at common law see,huckle money,wils,eng.wilkes wood,lofft,eng.entick carrington,state tr,all er.brown,supra,brackets in brown.second,the court in brown observed that this english common law rule had been endorsed and accepted by the new york court and by the drafters of the most recent state constitution ibid.and hence found historical support for an implied remedy in damages.similar reasoning supporting an action for damages to remedy a search and seizure violation has been embraced by the high courts of maryland and louisiana 
the parties have not cited,nor have we found,any similar history with respect to the liberty interest set out in article i,section a,or its predecessors,former article i,section,and article i,section,of the constitution of 
we conclude that there is no indication in the language of article i,section a,nor any evidence in the history of that section,from which we may find,within that provision,an implied right to seek damages for a violation of the due process liberty interest.
this determination,however,does not end our inquiry.just as we have not discovered any basis for concluding that a damages remedy was contemplated or reasonably might be inferred within article i,section a for violation of that provision,we also have not discovered any basis for concluding that a damages remedy was intended to be foreclosed.in such circumstances,we,like the united states supreme court and the courts of numerous other jurisdictions that have faced similar circumstances,shall proceed to consider whether a constitutional tort action for damages to remedy the asserted constitutional violation should be recognized.
as observed by friesen,bivens,supra,d,and its progeny actually illustrate a body of precedent established by state courts,and expressed in section of the second restatement of torts.friesen,supra,c,at.
the cited restatement section provides when a legislative or constitutional provision protects a class of persons by proscribing or requiring certain conduct but does not provide a civil remedy for the violation,the court may,if it determines that the remedy is appropriate in furtherance of the purpose of the legislation and needed to assure the effectiveness of the provision,accord to an injured member of the class a right of action,using a suitable existing tort action or a new cause of action analogous to an existing tort action.rest d torts,bracketed material and italics added see also,com.a,legislative provision includes constitutional provisions.
in determining whether to recognize such a constitutional tort,courts have look ed for the policy behind the legislative or constitutional provision,attempting to perceive the purpose for which it was enacted,and then,having ascertained that policy or purpose,have determine ed the most appropriate way to carry it out and identif ied the remedy needed to accomplish that result.rest d torts,com.d.
we join the jurisdictions that have endorsed,implicitly or explicitly,the view set out in the restatement,that courts,exercising their authority over the common law,may,in appropriate circumstances,recognize a tort action for damages to remedy a constitutional violation.see rest d torts,com.g,friesen,supra,at c.we proceed to determine whether a tort action for damages is appropriate here.
we first consider the adequacy of existing remedies.see,rest d torts,com.h,carlson,supra,d davis,supra,d bush,supra,d schweiker,supra,d malesko,supra,d carlsbad aquafarm,supra,th,d dick fischer,supra,kelley,supra,sundheim,supra,rockhouse,supra,provens,supra,ohio,shields,supra,spackman,supra.
we conclude that this consideration does not support recognition of a constitutional tort cause of action for damages to remedy an asserted violation of the due process liberty interest under article i,section a.in addressing a similar issue in carlsbad aquafarm,supra,th,d,the court of appeal reasoned under code of civil procedure section,aquafarm could have immediately petitioned the superior court for a writ of mandate ordering the department to provide it with due process before it refused to reissue a required form.citations.the essence of aquafarm due process claim was that it wanted a hearing to permit a neutral decision maker to determine whether the department was correct in its determination that it had not complied with national shellfish safety standards.if aquafarm had promptly filed for a writ of mandate,rather than waiting months to file a civil complaint seeking compensatory damages,it could have achieved this desired objective,at,d,fn.omitted.
the same can be said here.as the court of appeal below observed,instead of attempting to proceed against defendants by asserting an action for damages,plaintiff could have sought to remedy the alleged violation of his due process liberty interest and his concomitant right to a hearing by seeking a writ of mandate under code of civil procedure section,compelling defendants to provide a hearing indeed,it seems ironic that,whereas in his pleadings below and in his briefs before this court plaintiff frames the issue whether he is entitled to damages to remedy defendants failure to provide him with a timely fact,plaintiff himself did not timely seek to compel such a hearing through an action under section moreover,plaintiff also could have sought to establish a violation of his due process liberty interest by seeking declaratory or injunctive relief.see ante,pt.ii.
in addition,plaintiff had an adequate remedy for the alleged delay in offering an adequate hearing,by way of a defamation action.as the regents observe,because a plaintiff who timely sues for defamation may obtain damages for reputational injury,such damages are an adequate remedy for any actionable delay in providing a sole purpose is to protect the plaintiff reputation.
the availability of these adequate alternative remedies militates against judicial creation of a tort cause of action for damages in the circumstances presented 
we next consider the extent to which a constitutional tort action would change established tort law.see rest d torts,com.h.
plaintiff suggests that a damages action to remedy an asserted violation of his due process liberty interest is contemplated by tort law as codified by civil code sections and.the former section provides that e very person is bound,without contract,to abstain from injuring the person or property of another,or infringing upon any of his rights,italics added.the latter statute provides,for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract,the measure of damages,except where otherwise expressly provided by this code,is the amount which will compensate for all the detriment proximately caused thereby,whether it could be anticipated or not.echoing the majority in laguna publishing,supra,d,which placed some reliance upon these statutes,plaintiff suggests that the asserted due process violation in this case falls within the ambit of section,and that the violation imports by reason of section a correlative right to recover any damages proximately resulting from the violation of such right laguna publishing,at.
as justice kaufman observed in his concurring and dissenting opinion in laguna publishing,however,civil code section is not a substantive statute it merely prescribes the general measure of damages in tort cases.civil code section,which provides that every person is bound to abstain from injuring the person or property of another or infringing any of his rights,states a general principle of law,but it hardly provides support for the adoption of the novel legal proposition that a violation of subdivision a of section of article i of the california constitution gives rise to a direct cause of action for damages outside the parameters of recognized tort law laguna publishing,supra,d.conc.dis.opn.of kaufman.we reject plaintiff contention that a damages action to remedy an asserted violation of his due process liberty interest is contemplated by tort law as codified by civil code sections and.
we also consider the nature of the provision and the significance of the purpose that it seeks to effectuate.rest d torts,com.h.as a general matter,the due process liberty interest of article i,section a is both important and fundamental.
plaintiff relies upon laguna publishing,supra,d,in which the court of appeal majority stressed the special dignity of the rights of free speech and free press,while finding a right to seek damages to remedy a violation of the state free speech and free press clause,article i,section a.laguna publishing,supra,d at,italics in original.subsequently,the court in fenton,supra,d,reached a similar conclusion concerning a violation of the right to vote cal,art.ii,relying upon laguna publishing,and the asserted special dignity of the right to vote.plaintiff asserts that a similar conclusion applies here.
although we may agree that this factor,in the abstract,is a consideration that favors recognition of a constitutional tort action for damages,we also find persuasive the cautionary view set out in carlsbad aquafarm,supra,th,d while this factor may be a proper consideration in the overall analysis,it is not one upon which we place great significance.how does one rank the importance of different constitutional provisions c an we say a procedural due process right should be accorded more or less dignity than free speech or voting rights we agree that the due process right is fundamental.but absent the applicability of the other relevant factors discussed here,the relative importance of the constitutional right is of little help in determining the availability of a damages remedy for a violation of that right,at,d,italics added.
the same can be said here.the availability of meaningful alternative remedies leads us to decline to recognize a constitutional tort to remedy the asserted violation of article i,section a in the case before us.
because we conclude that the foregoing factors militate against recognition of a constitutional tort to remedy the asserted violation of due process liberty interests in this case,we need not consider,in addition,whether any special factors would counsel hesitation in recognizing such a damages action.if we had found,however,that the considerations discussed above favored recognition of a constitutional tort,we would,before actually recognizing the tort,also consider the existence of any special factors counseling hesitation in recognizing a damages action,including deference to legislative judgment avoidance of adverse policy consequences considerations of governmental fiscal policy practical issues of proof and competence of courts to assess particular types of damages 
in sum,we discern no evidence from which to infer within article i,section a,an intent to afford a right to seek damages to remedy the asserted violation of the due process liberty interest alleged in this case.we also find no basis upon which to recognize a constitutional tort action for such damages.
the judgment of the court of appeal is affirmed.
i concur in the majority affirmance of the court of appeal judgment barring plaintiff from seeking damages for any violation of his state constitutional right to due process.in my view,however,it is not only unnecessary but entirely inappropriate to go beyond the short,clear answer to the question presented or to consider anything other than the constitutional history and drafters intent in determining whether a constitutional provision is enforceable by an action in tort.the majority cites no authority and offers no rationale for applying the constitutional tort analysis adopted by the united states supreme court in bivens six unknown fed.narcotics agents,d to a provision of the california constitution.
i t is well established that the california constitution is,and always has been,a document of independent force citation,and that the rights embodied in and protected by the state constitution are not invariably identical to the rights contained in the federal constitution.citation.california cases long have recognized the independence of the california constitution citation,and article i,section,of the california constitution expressly confirms that the rights guaranteed by this constitution are not dependent on those guaranteed by the united states constitution.past cases make clear that even when the terms of the california constitution are textually identical to those of the federal constitution,the proper interpretation of the state constitutional provision is not invariably identical to the federal courts interpretation of the corresponding provision contained in the federal constitution.citations.american academy of pediatrics lungren cal th,d,see people frazer cal th,d,dis.opn.of brown,warden state bar cal th,d,dis.opn.of brown.
when a part of our state constitution has been adopted by initiative,one of our core interpretive principles is that the courts must measure its scope according to the intentions of the voters.gates superior court th,d,and cases cited therein see,white davis cal d,ballot statements indicated state constitutional right of privacy was intended to be and supported injunctive relief holtz superior court cal d,language of article i,section,allows monetary damages for inverse condemnation.this is because the constitution owes its whole force and authority to its ratification by the people citations.gates,at,d.
the majority correctly concludes there is no evidence the voters intended to create a right to monetary damages in adopting the due process clause set forth in article i,section,subdivision a of our constitution.nevertheless,it declines to end its inquiry with that determination because it finds no basis for concluding that a damages remedy was intended to be foreclosed,ante,d at,at.the majority fails to explain this non sequitur,however,and to identify any principle of constitutional interpretation that translates the absence of an express or implied bar to monetary damages into an authorization for a court to determine whether to provide for such a remedy on its own initiative.by its very nature,a constitution orders the relationships of the government and its citizens and serves as a bulwark against encroachment on their rights.the fact that the judicial branch interprets the constitution does not give license to augment its provisions as any shifting majority of judges sees fit.until now,this court has jealously guarded its role in effectuating legislative intent,particularly with respect to the initiative process.see,legislature eu cal d,raven deukmejian cal d,amador valley joint union high sch.dist.state bd.of equalization cal d,see also in re lance cal d.in this case,however,the majority abandons that vigilance.
moreover,the majority applies an analytical framework based not on our own jurisprudence but a derivation of united states supreme court decisions.the california constitution is the supreme law of our seminal document of independent force that establishes governmental powers and safeguards individual rights and liberties.citations.as the supreme court of california,we are the final arbiters of the meaning of state constitutional provisions.citation.our authority and responsibility in this regard is part of the basic structure of california government it can not be delegated to the united states supreme court or any other person or body.citation.when we construe provisions of the california constitution,we necessarily do so in light of their unique language,purposes,and histories,in accordance with general principles of constitutional interpretation established in our case law.nor do we act differently when the state constitutional provision in issue contains the same language as a federal constitutional provision.in such a case,we are not bound by a decision of the united states supreme court or any other court.we must consider and decide the matter independently.sands morongo unified school dist.cal d,conc.opn.of lucas.
the majority lapse of analytical apparent assumption that any supreme court doctrine is generic constitutional law linde,are state constitutions common law,betrays our obligation as final arbiter of state constitutional law in two interrelated ways.first,the majority approach compounds and perpetuates the misperception that state constitutions are part of common law and that meaningful analysis can be borrowed wholesale from federal constitutional discourse,as though the language of federal constitutional law were some sort of lingua franca of constitutional argument generally.gardner,the failed discourse of state constitutionalism.unlike the common law,however,constitutional interpretation is bound by text as well as by principles of construction and is decidedly not a majority of the court judicial extension and innovation in the interest of public policy or national consensus or similar justification.see linde,at.although in this context t he pull toward a common law of judicial review,toward a vortex of clichés lifted from united states supreme court decisions,is strong id.at,this court must resist if it is to remain faithful to its role as the final arbiter of the meaning of our state constitution and to respect the demarcations between the respective branches of concern equally of constitutional dimension.see,schweiker chilicky,d.
second,the majority approach creates a lacuna in our constitutional jurisprudence,adopting without meaningful consideration the united states supreme court interpolation of an unrelated federal constitutional provision in lieu of rigorous substantive analysis of the unique language,purpose and history of our own due process guarantee.defaulting to the high court fundamentally disserves the independent force and effect of our constitution.rather than enrich the texture of our law,this reliance on federal precedent shortchanges future generations.
we do not here consider the propriety of actions such as those based upon grounds established under common law tort example,actions for false arrest,false imprisonment,wrongful termination based upon violation of public policy,or the like.in such actions,a breach of duty or violation of public policy may be established by demonstrating a violation of a constitutional provision,and damages properly may be awarded to remedy the tort.we consider here only whether an action for damages is available to remedy a constitutional violation that is not tied to an established common law or statutory action.
defendants filed an unopposed motion for judicial notice,submitting for our consideration various filings in the earlier related litigation in this case.we granted the motion in an order filed prior to oral argument.

as observed in friesen,supra,section,at page occasionally the argument over damages is cast in terms of whether the clause is.however,the issue truly concerns the question whether a clause is judicially enforceable at all,and does not automatically answer the question whether damages are available for enforceable clauses.some cases,recognizing this,have characterized the inquiry concerning whether a damages remedy is allowed as presenting a question whether the provision under review is in a different sense and as calling for examination as to whether the provision provides for rules or procedures by which its declaration of rights is to be enforced,and,in particular,whether it provides citizens with a specific remedy by way of damages for its violation in the absence of legislation granting such a remedy.leger,supra,d at.first italics added.as explained post,part.we agree that these considerations are relevant in determining the availability of a damages remedy,but we believe it potentially confusing to employ the terminology in this context accordingly,we shall not do so.
the court asserted the question is merely whether petitioner,if he can demonstrate injury consequent upon the violation by federal agents of his fourth amendment rights,is entitled to redress his injury through a particular remedial mechanism normally available in federal courts.citations.the very essence of civil liberty certainly consists of the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws,whenever he receives an injury.marbury madison,cranch.bivens,supra,d.
in so holding,bivens,supra,d,allowed suits against federal agents comparable to the suits that congress expressly permitted against state agents through the enactment of united states code section.
although the high court has declined to extend bivens,it has not abandoned the core holding of that case,and has recognized the continuing validity of that decision and its progeny.see mccarthy madigan,d plaintiff,federal prisoner,not required to exhaust administrative remedies prior to pursuing an eighth amendment action under bivens malesko,supra,d holding that a bivens claim may not be asserted against an agency,but noting that such a claim may be asserted against an individual officer.

five other decisions relied upon by plaintiff are distinguishable.we held in white davis cal d,that california constitution article i,section,was intended to be,that the constitutional provision,in itself,creates a legal and enforceable right of privacy for every californian,and hence supported an action for an injunction.but we did not consider or address any claim for damages.in payton city of santa clara d,the court of appeal reversed a judgment of dismissal that was entered following the granting of a summary judgment motion in an action for violation of privacy rights under california constitution,article i,section.the claimed violation arose from an employer act of posting a notice of the plaintiff termination and the reasons therefor in a public workroom.although noting that the plaintiff had prayed for damages payton,at,the court did not address the availability of such damages,but held only that the complaint stated a prima facie violation of the right of privacy.porten university of san francisco d.porten is similarly distinguishable.there the plaintiff sued for damages under the state constitutional right of privacy,claiming that the university improperly disclosed the grades he had earned at an school.the court of appeal concluded that the action could be brought,despite the absence of enabling legislation.in the process of reaching this conclusion,the court appears to have assumed that damages would be available for such a violation,but it did not analyze or discuss that question.in any event,each of the foregoing decisions was rendered under the privacy provision of article i,section provision with a relatively rich legislative is not directly on point here.we have no occasion to consider in the present case the circumstances under which the privacy clause of the state constitution may support a cause of action for decisions cited by city of placentia d.and lubey city and county of san francisco d.are closer on point,because they involve due process claims arising in the employment context,but they too are distinguishable from the case before us.those decisions approved an action for reinstatement with backpay,following a due process violation in the termination of probationary employees for misconduct.as defendants observe,however,the facts in both cases suggest that the plaintiffs possessed a due process property interest as well as a due process liberty interest.in the present case,plaintiff concedes he had no due process property interest in his position.moreover,neither wilkerson nor lubey explicitly analyzed the question whether damages are available in an action based directly and solely upon the due process provisions of article i,section a,or any other constitutional provision.
article i,section c states in full right to safe schools.all students and staff of public primary,elementary,junior high and senior high schools have the inalienable right to attend campuses which are safe,secure and peaceful.
the court stated the right proclaimed by the constitutional provision,although inalienable and mandatory,simply establishes the parameters of the principle enunciated the specific means by which it is to be achieved for the people of california are left to the legislature.clausing,supra,d at.the court further observed in a footnote in this respect section,subdivision c,is closely analogous to article i,section,of the california constitution,which states all people are by nature free and independent and have inalienable rights.among these are enjoying and defending life and liberty,acquiring,possessing,and protecting property,and pursuing and obtaining safety,happiness,and privacy.clearly,although safety and happiness are inalienable rights,this provision of the constitution does not establish the means whereby they may be enjoyed.no case ever has held that this provision enunciating the inalienable right to obtain safety and happiness is in the sense that it gives rise,in and of itself,to a private right of action for damages or an affirmative duty on the part of the state to take particular steps to guarantee the enjoyment of safety or happiness by all citizens.langdon sayre d,id.at,fn.
in so concluding,the court relied upon white davis,supra,cal d,in which we held that the privacy clause of article i,section,supported an action for injunction,but the court in clausing overlooked porten,supra,d,in which,as observed ante,footnote,the court suggested that money damages are available in an action based upon a violation of that same clause.

the court in brown observed that in people defore,judge cardozo,speaking for the court,cited the same english authority in concluding that evidence obtained in violation of the search and seizure clause could be used against the defendant in a criminal trial and that the defendant remedy for the wrong consisted of a civil suit for damages.brown,supra.the court in brown also stated the availability of a civil suit for damages sustained as the result of a constitutional violation was contemplated by the delegates to new york constitutional convention of.they did not consider whether such a suit was assumed a civil remedy already existed.at least that is so with respect to section the search and seizure provision.the debates over the proposed exclusion of evidence unlawfully obtained in criminal proceedings make that abundantly clear.based upon judge cardozo opinion in people defore,the convention delegates assumed that damages were available to the victim of unconstitutional action and they used that argument to help persuade the convention that exclusion was unnecessary to deter official misconduct see,record of constitutional convention,at.these debates reveal that the concept of damages for constitutional violations was neither foreign to the delegates nor rejected by them.that the convention adopted the equal protection provision without similarly discussing the damage remedy does not establish that the delegates disfavored it nor does it foreclose our consideration of that relief,fn.omitted.

plaintiff argues that the court in melvin reid,melvin permitted a cause of action for damages to remedy a constitutional violation,and that hence,by analogy,such an action should be recognized in the present case as well.plaintiff,however,misreads melvin.in that case,the court of appeal,citing article i,section which provides that all people have inalienable rights among which are pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness,recognized a common law tort action based upon allegations that the defendants had made a motion picture depicting the plaintiff earlier shameful life,using her real name.in allowing the action,the court in melvin found in article i,section guarantee of pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness,a policy supporting a common law tort action for invasion of privacy.melvin,supra,see also,at,citing warren brandeis,the right to privacy.advocating recognition of common law right.as subsequent cases make clear,however,melvin can not properly be read as authorizing an action directly under article i,section,for damages to remedy a violation of that provision.instead,melvin represents the foundation,in california,of the common law invasion of privacy tort.see,briscoe reader digest association,cal d.
