thomas evans thomas,a deputy sheriff,sued his former wife,linda evans linda,and linda mother,alleging numerous causes of action,including harassment,defamation,and breach of privacy.the court then granted thomas motion for preliminary injunction,and entered an order enjoining linda and her mother from publishing false and defamatory statements about thomas on the internet publishing confidential personal information about thomas on the internet and contacting thomas employer the san diego county sheriff department regarding thomas except to call to report criminal conduct.
linda appeals from the order,raising numerous contentions.we conclude the preliminary injunction was overbroad and constituted an invalid prior restraint before trial.we thus reverse the order and remand for further hearing.
our reversal should not be interpreted to mean that a court lacks authority to enjoin certain speech conduct.before trial and upon a proper showing,a court may prohibit a party from having contact with certain persons or from disclosing certain specified private information under narrowly drawn circumstances.the order here,however,was not sufficiently tailored to satisfy constitutional standards.likewise,after a trial,a court may continue these prohibitions and may additionally prohibit a party from repeating statements determined at trial to be defamatory.we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural summary 
thomas is a law enforcement officer with the san diego county sheriff department.he and linda were married in,and separated in.in,the court entered a judgment dissolving the marriage.during the next five years,the parties had substantial ongoing conflict over custody,child support and other issues.the family court has held numerous hearings,and those hearings continue through the present time.
in march,thomas filed a complaint against linda,alleging harassment code civ.proc,slander and defamation,various common law torts,breach of privacy claims,and breach of contract.the gist of the allegations was that linda has engaged in a series of acts intended to harass thomas and cause him severe emotional stress and injury to his reputation and career.the complaint sought damages and equitable relief.
shortly after,thomas moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction,seeking an order enjoining linda from engaging in the slanderous and harassing conduct against him.in support,thomas relied primarily on his own declarations in which he asserted linda had filed false internal affairs complaints against him with the sheriff department and other government agencies and linda and her mother preddy had placed defamatory information about him on the internet.
with respect to the internal affairs complaints,thomas said that in april,linda filed a complaint with the sheriff department,alleging a number of departmental and state law violations,including child abuse,lying,falsifying departmental reports,and abuse of position after a criminal and internal investigation,these allegations were found to be unsubstantiated unfounded.twenty months later,in december,thomas was informed by his superiors that the district attorney and sheriff had both received letters about thomas that were very defaming in nature.thomas did not say who wrote these letters,but in a supplemental declaration,thomas said information about these letters would be fleshed out through discovery in the action.thomas also stated that in march,linda filed another harassing request to the sheriff department.in support of this latter claim,thomas submitted information reflecting that he had told linda that a three time convicted felon has been allowed to view the evans family court file,and that linda had written to the court and to the sheriff department expressing a concern as to the source of this information.bold typeface omitted.
thomas said he believe d these prior communications with the sheriff department were a major factor in his inability to be promote d within the department.thomas also asserted that the embarrassment resulting from linda conduct caused him to decide to seek a less prominent job within the department,and that linda complaints will hinder my ability to conduct my duties and may bring negative light to the department and assignment.
with respect to the internet postings,thomas stated that in december,i was informed that there were internet websites posted by linda and preddy with numerous defaming comments and statements about me as a sworn law enforcement officer,and the lawyers,judges,and counselors involved in our family court case.thomas also said he discovered in december and january that preddy had apparently inappropriately gained access to both my family court medical records and financial records,and had published information from them on the internet.thomas attached a copy of web site pages showing statements that appeared to have been made by preddy in a family court declaration,accusing thomas of physical abuse and harassment against linda.thomas did not submit any evidence that any private medical or financial information or identifying informational facts had been published on the internet.
thomas also submitted copies of web site pages in which it appeared that linda posted statements accusing thomas of physical abuse against her and her son,and statements suggesting that several san diego superior court judges were biased incompetent.thomas further proffered a series of emails between linda and a web site host,in which linda was requesting that the host remove her declaration from the site,but the host was refusing to do so.thomas also stated a s recently as february,a google search of my name on generated a blurb posted by linda stating the following our eldest son was returned to my primary care after his father,san diego county sheriff sergeant,thomas evans,struck him with a belt repeatedly this statement is entirely false and reflective of the defamatory and harassing comments published by the defendants.
based on these submissions,thomas declared i strongly believe that the actions of linda and preddy have affected,and will continue to affect,my reputation,career,and general.the actions have caused me,and continue to cause me,substantial emotional distress as i fear for my reputation,my relationships with friends and family,and my career with the san diego sheriff department.thomas argued a preliminary injunction was necessary to prevent further wrongful conduct that would only serve to negatively impact my personal and professional life and subject the defendants to civil and perhaps criminal liability.
linda who was not represented by counsel filed a responsive pleading,denying each of thomas allegations,and asserting numerous affirmative defenses.but she did not present any evidence to counter thomas evidence.one week later,on april,the court held a hearing on thomas preliminary injunction motion.thomas was represented by counsel.linda appeared in pro.per.
at the hearing,the court stated it believed the preliminary injunction was more than warranted and confirmed a tentative ruling granting thomas motion.the court written ruling stated t he court finds,for the purpose of this motion,that there is a reasonable probability that thomas will prevail on the merits of this action.thomas has provided the court sufficient evidence to establish the ongoing harassment activities by linda and preddy.moreover,the court finds that thomas may suffer irreparable harm if linda and preddy are not enjoined from publishing false and defamatory statements confidential personal information about him on the internet and enjoined from contacting thomas employer via email or otherwise regarding thomas.
on the same day,linda filed a against thomas and his current spouse.in the complaint,linda alleged causes of action,including harassment,defamation and slander,common law torts,breach of privacy claims,and breach of contract.
five days later,on april,the court issued the preliminary injunction challenged in this appeal.the preliminary injunction stated.linda and preddy are enjoined from publishing false and defamatory statements confidential personal information about thomas on the internet and.linda and preddy are enjoined from contacting thomas employer via or otherwise regarding thomas.since thomas is employed by the san diego sheriff department,this injunction should not be construed to prohibit defendants from calling to report criminal conduct.
linda then moved for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction order.in support,linda submitted a lengthy declaration and numerous exhibits.the declaration stated in part that preddy had no involvement with any emails or other communications made regarding thomas linda internet communications pertaining to the family law case were done to obtain recommendations as to how she should proceed in future family court proceedings and to obtain free legal representation and assistance from parenting organizations and advocates throughout the country all of linda communications have been truthful and correct and corroborated with supporting evidence and facts and all of linda communications discussed in thomas complaint and declaration were privileged because they constituted a communication made in the course of a judicial or proceeding,by a participant in the proceeding,for the purpose of achieving the object of litigation.linda also submitted portions of reports and other documents,which she stated showed that thomas had struck their son on or about november,the evans children have had a difficult relationship with thomas that has caused problems for the children and thomas had threatened improper use of his law enforcement position against her.
based on these and other facts,linda argued that thomas failed to present sufficient evidence to support his harassment and defamation claims.linda also argued the preliminary injunction was improper on various additional grounds,including equitable estoppel principles,statute of limitations and laches,the statute,the litigation privilege,and constitutional principles prohibiting prior restraint.
the court granted linda reconsideration motion based on its finding that linda had provided different facts to support her opposition.however,after considering those new facts and holding a hearing,the court reaffirmed its prior order.the court stated that t he preliminary injunction issued on april,shall remain in full force and effect.
linda appeals from the april preliminary injunction order.
discussion 
in challenging the preliminary injunction,linda raises numerous arguments.in part i,we conclude the order must be reversed because it is overbroad,vague,and an unconstitutional prior restraint before trial.in part ii,we briefly address two of linda additional challenges to the preliminary injunction and find them to be without merit.
in reaching these conclusions,we apply law applicable to preliminary injunctions.to show entitlement to a preliminary injunction,a plaintiff must prove a likelihood of prevailing on the merits,and that the harm to the plaintiff from not granting the injunction outweighs the harm to the defendant if the injunction is issued pending trial.butt state of california cal th,d.the trial court determination must be guided by a mix of the and factors the greater the plaintiff showing on one,the less must be shown on the other to support an injunction.ibid.
we are governed by an abuse of discretion standard in determining whether the trial court properly evaluated these factors.to the extent the analysis depends on a determination of the constitutionality of the injunction,we independently review the question whether the trial court correctly interpreted and applied the applicable constitutional principles.see huong que,luu th,d.facts relevant to the constitutional analysis must be reviewed de novo,independent of the trial court findings.dvd copy control bunner cal th,d,dvd copy.
constitutional analysis 
generally applicable principles 
the right to free speech is one of the cornerstones of our society,and is protected under the first amendment of the united states constitution and under an even broader provision of the california constitution.hurvitz hoefflin th,d see cal,art.i,subd.a.an injunction that forbids a citizen from speaking in advance of the time the communication is to occur is known as a prior restraint.dvd copy,supra,cal th at,d,hurvitz hoefflin,supra,th at,d.a prior restraint is the most serious and the least tolerable infringement on first amendment rights.dvd copy,supra,cal th at,d,near minnesota.prior restraints are highly disfavored and presumptively violate the first amendment.maggi superior court th,d hurvitz hoefflin,supra,th at,d.this is true even when the speech is expected to be of the type that is not constitutionally protected.see near minnesota,supra,at.rejecting restraint on publication of any periodical containing malicious,scandalous and defamatory matter.
to establish a valid prior restraint under the federal constitution,a proponent has a heavy burden to show the countervailing interest is compelling,the prior restraint is necessary and would be effective in promoting this interest,and less extreme measures are unavailable.see hobbs county of westchester cir,see also nebraska press stuart,d.further,any permissible order must be couched in the narrowest terms that will accomplish the objective permitted by constitutional mandate and the essential needs of the public order carroll princess anne,d.
even if an injunction does not impermissibly constitute a prior restraint,the injunction must be sufficiently precise to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden.united states harriss.see also people ex rel.gallo acuna cal th,d.an injunction is unconstitutionally vague if it does not clearly define the persons protected and the conduct prohibited.
under these constitutional principles,we examine three separate parts of the court april preliminary injunction the prohibition against publishing false and defamatory statements about thomas on the internet the prohibition against publishing personal confidential information about thomas on the internet and the prohibition against contacting the san diego county sheriff department about thomas except to call in an emergency to report criminal conduct.
prohibition against publishing false and defamatory statements 
an order prohibiting a party from making or publishing false statements is a classic type of an unconstitutional prior restraint.see metropolitan opera,local cir.while a party may be held responsible for abusing his right to speak freely in a subsequent tort action,he has the initial right to speak freely without censorship.gilbert national enquirer,th,d.
the california supreme court recently recognized this fundamental principle,but held the rule does not apply to an order issued after a trial prohibiting the defendant from repeating specific statements found at trial to be defamatory.balboa island village inn,lemen cal th,d,balboa island.in balboa island,the court,sitting without a jury,made factual findings that the defendant had repeatedly defamed a business entity a restaurant,and issued a permanent injunction prohibiting the defendant from making certain specified defamatory statements about the restaurant.id.at,d.each of the prohibited statements was determined at trial to be false.ibid.
the california supreme court held that although other aspects of the injunction were overbroad,the defendant right to free speech would not be infringed by a properly limited injunction prohibiting defendant from repeating statements about plaintiff that were determined at trial to be defamatory.balboa island,supra,cal th at,d.the court explained once specific expressional acts are properly determined to be unprotected by the first amendment,there can be no objection to their subsequent suppression or prosecution.id.at,d.thus,an injunction issued following a trial that determined that the defendant defamed the plaintiff that does no more than prohibit the defendant from repeating the defamation,is not a prior restraint and does not offend the first amendment.id.at,d,italics added.the court emphasized that in
