this case presents two issues concerning damages under the family medical leave act of fmla.in an issue of first impression,we consider whether the court,rather than the jury,determines the amount of the front pay award and whether the district court calculation of that award was clearly erroneous.second,we address whether the district court erred in denying liquidated damages without making specific findings as to the employer good faith conduct and reasonable belief that it was not violating the statute.we conclude that under the fmla,front pay is an equitable remedy to be determined by the court.we affirm the district court determination and calculation of the front pay award.we reverse and remand the district court decision not to award liquidated damages.absent an articulated rationale to support this conclusion,we can not meaningfully review the challenge to liquidated damages.
background 
jill traxler began working in the multnomah county sheriff office the county in and was promoted to the human resources unit in.by she had become the interim personnel unit manager and later was promoted to human resources manager 
the fmla entitles certain employees to workweeks of leave during any period if the employee has a serious health condition,gives birth or adopts a son or daughter,or needs to care for a spouse,or a son,daughter,or parent who has a serious health condition.a.beginning in,traxler took medical leave under the fmla,and again in,she took leave due to a serious physical health condition.during her employment,traxler never took more than the leave permitted under the fmla.
on june,the county notified traxler that her position would be eliminated effective july,and it had a uniformed officer escort traxler out of the office.she was placed on paid administrative leave,and then transferred to a lower paying position.traxler continued to take leave under the fmla,and in september,she received an unfavorable performance review in her new position.traxler filed a written response to the performance review,but to no avail.the county terminated traxler in late september.
traxler filed suit under the fmla and the oregon counterpart.after a trial,the jury found that the county had taken adverse employment actions against traxler in response to her legitimate use of protected leave under the fmla.the jury awarded traxler in damages back pay up to the time of trial and in front pay.the court declined to enter a judgment for liquidated damages.
the county filed a motion requesting judgment as a matter of law or a new trial pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and,arguing that the district court erred in submitting the calculation of front pay to the jury and requesting that the district court limit the amount of front pay awarded to traxler.the district court agreed it had erred in allowing the jury to consider the amount of front pay because front pay is an equitable remedy that must be determined by the court.the district court thus vacated the jury award of front pay,made findings of fact as to the basis for front pay,and awarded traxler in front pay.the district court also ruled in the alternative that if it was proper for the jury to calculate front pay,the jury award of was grossly excessive the court denied the county motion for a new trial,conditioned on traxler acceptance of a remittitur of.traxler timely appealed the district court finding that front pay is an equitable remedy to be decided by the court,the calculation of the front pay award,and the denial of liquidated damages.
front paya.front pay is an equitable remedy appropriately determined by courts 
the central question in this appeal is the characterization of front pay under the is,whether it is a legal or an equitable remedy.and,more precisely,even if it is an equitable remedy,should the amount be determined by the court or a jury 
on this issue of first impression in this circuit,we hold that under the fmla,front pay is an equitable remedy that must be determined by the court,both as to the availability of the remedy and the amount of any award.our view accords with the fourth,fifth and the tenth circuits,which have addressed this issue under the fmla.downey strain,cir noting that front pay can only be calculated through intelligent guesswork,and we recognize its speculative character by according wide latitude in its determination to the district courts.internal quotation marks omitted smith diffee,cir holding that the court decides propriety and amount of front pay award,but in making the award,the court must accept the jury factual findings cline stores,cir holding that the district court erred in submitting the issue of front pay to the jury on remand,the district court should determine whether front pay should be awarded and,if so,in what amount.the approach in these cases follows the general recognition that front pay is best understood as a substitute for the equitable remedy of reinstatement,and thus,is appropriately determined by the court.cline,at f ront pay,as an alternative or complement to reinstatement,is an equitable remedy best determined by the district court rather than the jury.only the sixth circuit differs,holding that the district court determines the propriety of awarding front pay,but that the jury decides the actual amount of the award.arban west publ g,cir.
our analysis begins with the statute itself.the fmla does not explicitly grant plaintiffs the right to front pay any front pay awards must fall within the section on equitable relief.see.the fmla provision governing an employee remedy against an employer is divided into two subsections.the first subsection allows damages for past costs including,among other things,wages,salary,employment benefits,or other compensation denied or lost.id.a a i i.that same subsection also covers actual monetary losses,interest,and liquidated damages.the second subsection addresses prospective relief,allowing for such equitable relief as may be appropriate,including employment,reinstatement,and promotion.id.a b.
front pay is not included in the enumerated damages under the first subsection.a a.thus,the court power under the fmla to award front pay,as an alternative to reinstatement,is derived solely from the statutory provision permitting the court to award such equitable relief as may be appropriate.a b.
the characterization of front pay as an equitable remedy is consistent with the general nature of front pay in the context of other statutes.although pure money damages are the traditional form of relief offered in the courts of law,smith barton,cir quoting curtis loether,d,an award of monetary damages may constitute equitable relief if it is incidental to or intertwined with injunctive relief.chauffeurs local terry,d quoting tull united states,d.the leading employment case on this point is pollard du pont de nemours,a title vii case in which the supreme court distinguished front pay from compensatory damages,d.the court held that i n cases in which reinstatement is not viable courts have ordered front pay as a substitute for reinstatement.id.at.in other words,a front pay award is the monetary equivalent of the equitable remedy of reinstatement.id.at.quoting blum witco chem,cir.as a practical matter,front pay is awarded at the court discretion only if the court determines that reinstatement is inappropriate,such as where no position is available or the relationship has been so damaged by animosity that reinstatement is impracticable.whittlesey union carbide,cir.
recognizing that front pay is an equitable remedy,it makes little sense to say that the availability of front pay is a judicial determination and the amount a jury determination.the statute does not support such a result.splitting the remedy into an equitable and a legal component is a false dichotomy.this is a classic case where a monetary award is inextricably linked with the equitable determination regarding reinstatement.as a proxy for reinstatement,front pay is an equitable award within the purview of the court,not the jury.
to begin,the determination whether reinstatement is feasible,either immediately or in the future,is a balance o
