this case arises from the termination of a commercial relationship between plaintiff counter defendant appellant process america,process america and defendant counter claimant appellee cynergy holdings,llc cynergy.process america is an independent sales organization iso that,prior to the termination of their relationship,solicited and referred merchants to cynergy,a bankcard processor.following the termination of the relationship between process america and cynergy,process america sued cynergy for breach of contract.cynergy counterclaimed,contending,among other things,that process america improperly solicited cynergy clients.following a series of interim decisions and a bench trial limited to the issue of damages on cynergy counterclaims,the district court held that although both parties had breached the contract,cynergy liability was capped by the contract.the district court awarded cynergy a net total of in damages.process america appeals.
background 
merchant services generally 
the parties are involved in the merchant services industry,which provides credit and debit card transaction processing services to merchants.the basic mechanics of the process by which bankcard transactions are conducted may be summarized as follows 
t he customer presents a credit card to pay for goods or services to the merchant the merchant relays the transaction information to the acquiring bank the acquiring bank processes the information and relays it to the network,visa or mastercard the network relays the information to the issuing bank if the issuing bank approves the transaction,that approval is relayed to the acquiring bank,which then relays it to the merchant.if the transaction is approved,the merchant receives the purchase price minus two fees the interchange fee that the issuing bank charged the acquiring bank and the merchant discount fee that the acquiring bank charged the merchant.
in re payment card interchange fee merch.disc.antitrust,cir.
acquiring banks which are also known as sponsor banks are financial institutions that are members of the visa or mastercard network.generally,the acquiring banks delegate merchant solicitation,processing,underwriting,and customer service obligations to processors,who manage card transaction processing,iso recruitment,merchant customer services,liability for merchant losses,and fraud monitoring,and to isos,who solicit merchants to offer them the services of an acquiring bank and access to a processor.an iso primary role is to solicit new merchants and then provide first line customer support.isos are paid a portion of the discount fee paid by merchants to the acquiring bank.
ii.the relationship between cynergy and process america 
cynergy provides back end processing services for credit and debit card transactions through its relationship with its acquiring bank,harris bank moneris moneris.after receiving funds from the issuing bank,moneris receives,and holds,merchant funds for one to three days before remitting any portion to the merchant.cynergy calculates the money due to merchants through its proprietary platform called vimas.
in,process america signed a standard iso agreement the iso agreement with cynergy predecessor,cynergy data hereinafter old cynergy pursuant to the iso agrement,process america sold cynergy bankcard processing services to merchants and received as compensation a portion of the discount fee charged to merchants,known as residuals.
as relevant to this appeal,the iso agreement states that cynergy owns the merchant agreements solicited by process america,but that,upon satisfaction of certain benchmarks,ownership of those agreements will vest in process america.that contract provision also describes the mechanism by which process america may transfer the merchant accounts to a third party processor.additionally,the contract contains a non solicitation clause that bars process america from soliciting any merchant with whom cynergy has a contract for a period of five years following the termination of the iso agreement and also contains a damages cap limiting cynergy liability.the contract further provides that cynergy must continue to make residual payments to process america unless cynergy terminated the contract due to a material breach by process america.
the iso agreement also incorporates by reference the rules created and enforced by the credit card networks,visa and mastercard the rules.the rules prohibit isos like process america from directly accessing or holding merchant funds,which must instead be held by acquiring banks.
under the terms of the iso agreement,process america is fully liable for merchant chargebacks,which are consumer reversals of transactions,typically due to fraud.in order to reduce chargeback losses,process america developed the chargeback reduction incentive program,known as crip.process america characterizes crip as a rewards program funded by process america own residuals wherein merchants who followed a list of best practices were rebated a portion of their fees.cynergy,by contrast,characterizes crip as a merchant reserve in which,in clear contravention of the rules,process america retained funds owned by merchants to offset the cost of chargebacks.
iii.termination of the relationship 
in january,moneris sent cynergy a letter stating,in relevant part,that 
o ne of cynergy isos,process america,appears to be retaining funds from merchants as security against merchant liabilities.because this would clearly fall within the definition of merchant reserves in cynergy attestations and make those attestations inaccurate,we wanted to formally register our concerns regarding process america practices and demand that the following actions be taken immediately 
terminate process america as an iso 
until these steps have been taken,moneris considers cynergy to be in breach of its obligations 
in response,cynergy informed moneris that it was taking steps to identify merchant funds held by process america,but would not immediately terminate process america processing agreement,and would instead not renew the agreement upon its expiration in may.moneris responded that,i f the funds in this reserve have been returned in full as you indicate below,then it would appear that that particular breach has now been cured,but also requested a full audit of process america accounts.
shortly after receiving the letter from moneris,cynergy ceased making residual payments to process america.approximately one month later,cynergy sent process america a letter stating in part 
we hereby notify you that we find you in material breach of the iso agreement.among other provisions,we find that you have breached your representations and warranties under sections f no violation and g compliance.these breaches stem from your withholding and maintaining merchant funds in reserve in violation of the rules.naming a reserve an insurance program merely obfuscates the facts but does not lessen the violation or the breach.further,we find that you are in material default pursuant to sections c false representation,d breach and e goodwill also in relation to your withholding and maintaining merchant funds as a reserve.as a result of the section c and e events,we hereby terminate the agreement immediately and intend to fully enforce ramifications upon termination.
despite the events of default that we believe to be irrefutable,pursuant to section b of the agreement by providing notice ninety days prior to the renewal date,either party may choose not to renew the agreement and as such we hereby provide notice of non renewal.to be clear,this notice is not relief from your events of default but clear notice that we shall ensure your contract will not continue.
this letter is provided in accordance with the notice provisions of section of the agreement.
process america then contracted with approximately of the merchants in its portfolio of merchant agreements the portfolio on behalf of another processor and subsequently sold that portion of the portfolio for approximately million.in attempting to get merchants to change processors,process america referenced old cynergy earlier bankruptcy and,in some instances,suggested that funds held in the merchant account could be at risk.following the period in which process america sought to induce merchants to switch processors,a number of merchants canceled their contracts with cynergy.
in total,the rate of post termination attrition was.the attrition rate for the six month period preceding termination was.
iv.procedural history 
process america sued cynergy,alleging breach of contract and other causes of action.cynergy counterclaimed,alleging,inter alia,that process america had breached the contract by soliciting merchants and selling the portfolio and,in the process of soliciting merchants,had also defamed cynergy.following cross motions for summary judgment,the district court held that under the terms of the iso agreement,which the parties stipulated were unambiguous,cynergy,not process america,owned the portfolio at the time of process america solicitation,and entered summary judgment in cynergy favor.the court also determined that there was a material issue of fact as to whether crip was a merchant reserve in violation of the rules,but that if it was,it would be a material breach of the iso agreement.
both parties moved for reconsideration.the district court declined to disturb its holding with respect to the issue of who owned the portfolio.with respect to crip,however,the district court concluded that the prior denial of summary judgment had been premature held that,in light of the contracts used by process america to enroll merchants in crip,crip was a merchant reserve in violation of the rules and entered judgment in favor of cynergy.the district court nevertheless concluded that,despite the material breach,cynergy was not entitled to withhold residuals under the terms of the contract without giving process america notice and an opportunity to cure.the district court therefore entered summary judgment in favor of process america with respect to its breach of contract claim based on the improper withholding of residuals,but dismissed all of its remaining claims.in the same opinion,the district court further held that cynergy was entitled to summary judgment on its counterclaim based on breach of the non solicitation clause in the agreement and its defamation counterclaim.
in a separate opinion,following a motion in limine,the district court held that the damages cap in the contract limited process america recovery to fees derived as a result of the iso agreement during the last four months of the agreement,which the parties stipulated was approximately.having dismissed or granted summary judgment on the issue of liability with respect to all of the parties claims and counterclaims,the district court held a bench trial limited solely to the issue of cynergy damages.measuring damages based on the rate of attrition of merchant accounts in the portfolio after process america solicitation,and rejecting process america arguments that the increased attrition rate could be attributable to something other than solicitation,the district court awarded cynergy million in damages,offset only by the awarded to process america for cynergy breach of contract.
process america challenges only some of the district court rulings.process america argues that the district court erred in holding that cynergy owned the portfolio,that crip violated the rules,that process america statements to merchants constituted per se defamation,that process america damages were limited to,and that cynergy damages should not be offset by the full value of the withheld residuals.process america also argues that cynergy withholding of residuals allowed it to treat the contract as void.process america further challenges the district court finding at trial that cynergy met its burden in proving damages.process america does not appeal the district court dismissal of its other claims.cynergy did not file a cross appeal,and does not challenge the district court conclusion that the withholding of residuals constituted a breach of the iso agreement.
discussion 
on appeal,process america challenges the district court interim decisions concluding that it breached the iso agreement and that cynergy liability for its own breach of contract was limited by the damages cap.process america also challenges the district court post trial findings regarding cynergy damages.we address these issues in turn

a.the portfolio 
the parties both contend that under the unambiguous terms of the iso agreement,they owned the portfolio at the time that process america solicited merchants to switch to another processor,to whom process america ultimately sold approximately of the portfolio.section of the iso agreement,entitled ownership of merchant agreements,governs the process of transferring and selling the merchant accounts.section provides 
ownership.the parties agree that upon execution of this agreement,throughout the initial term,and until the ownership trigger date,cynergy data shall own and have all rights to the merchant agreements.on the ownership trigger date,ownership of the merchant agreements will vest in process america.the ownership trigger date means anytime after the initial term,and the first day of the month following the month in which all of the ownership trigger events are satisfied.an ownership trigger event will be deemed satisfied immediately upon its occurrence.ownership trigger events will occur when process america meets certain benchmarks.upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in section.b,both parties shall execute an asset transfer agreement reasonably satisfactory to both parties pursuant to which ownership rights in merchants will be transferred from cynergy data to process america for nominal consideration.
transfer of merchants.at any time while this agreement is in effect and after the ownership trigger date,process america may move all or any portion of the merchants to a third party credit card processor,subject to all of the following i process america grants to cynergy data a right of first refusal on the merchant portfolio.ii process america shall pay to cynergy data an exit fee equal to the average monthly revenue derived by cynergy data over the most recent month period,excluding the month of december,attributable to the merchant agreements to be transferred multiplied by the greater of either a the multiple figure offered by the third party,or b.iii the execution of an assignment agreement between cynergy data,moneris,and the new credit card processor containing terms typical of such a transaction and satisfactory to moneris and cynergy data.upon satisfaction of i and ii and iii,cynergy data will cooperate in transferring the merchant agreements to the third party designated by process america.
emphasis added.the non solicitation clause in section of the iso agreement additionally provides that 
except as otherwise provided in section.b,during the term of this agreement and for years after termination of this agreement,process america will not directly or indirectly solicit or endeavor to obtain as a customer for credit or debit card processing services,or contract with,any merchant who has entered into a merchant agreement with cynergy for credit or debit card processing services.
emphasis added.section of the iso agreement further provides that both section and section survive termination of the agreement.
it is undisputed that process america met the benchmarks required for an ownership trigger event,but did not comply with section.b requirements for transfer of the merchant accounts.pointing to the language in section.a stating that ownership of the portfolio will vest in process america o n the ownership trigger date,which occurs after an ownership trigger event is satisfied,process america argues that ownership of the portfolio transferred as soon as it met as the benchmarks required for an ownership trigger event.cynergy,in turn,references the last sentence of section.a which states that,upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in section.b,ownership rights will be transferred from cynergy to process america.id.
the parties frame the dispute over those provisions as a question of ownership,with the implication being that if process america owned the merchant agreements,the sale of the portfolio would not constitute a breach of contract and cynergy seizure of the portfolio would be a breach.the district court resolved the apparently contradictory language by interpreting the term ownership to mean the right to exercise ownership and transfer ownership rights from cynergy,rather than full ownership.
we may resolve the instant appeal,however,by addressing a narrower question than the generalized claim of ownership whether the solicitation of merchants,and transfer of a portion of the portfolio to a third party,violate the iso agreement which permits transfer only pursuant to section.b,such that cynergy is entitled to damages based on the increased rate of attrition of merchant accounts in the portfolio.we conclude that it does.
notwithstanding the iso agreement opaque treatment of the word ownership,the agreement contemplates only one method for transferring the merchant agreements contained in the portfolio to process america and then to a third party compliance with section.process america has not identified,nor have we found,any other contract provision that would allow for the transfer of merchant agreements.
section.b enumerates three conditions that must be satisfied before any transfer may take place,including providing notice and the right of first refusal to cynergy,paying a substantial fee to cynergy,and executing a new processing agreement that satisfies both cynergy and moneris.those requirements serve both to provide cynergy with substantial rights in the portfolio,even after the ownership trigger date has passed,and to ensure continuity of service in processing bankcard transactions.given process america role in the processing transaction generally as a salesman and customer service provider,but not as a processor of bankcard transactions it is unsurprising that the contract includes requirements intended to ensure continuity of service.the only real benefit that process america can derive from its claimed ownership of the portfolio is the right to sell it to a third party.section.b describes that sale procedure,and further provides cynergy with substantial rights,including the right of first refusal and the right to an exit fee,until the accounts are actually transferred.
process america does not dispute that it did not comply,or attempt to comply,with section.b prior to soliciting merchants with the intention of selling those accounts to a third party.rather,it contends that,because section.a survives termination of the agreement,it possessed an ownership interest that also survived and therefore cynergy purported seizure of the portfolio was wrongful.that argument suffers from two flaws.first,it ignores the fact that,even assuming that process america owned the portfolio,it was nevertheless a breach of contract to transfer the portfolio to a different processor without complying with section.second,it fails to acknowledge that section flatly prohibits any solicitation of merchants who have contracts with cynergy.as it is undisputed that the merchant accounts had not been transferred to a third party prior to process america solicitation,cynergy still had contracts with all of the solicited merchants and any contact with those merchants was in breach of the iso agreement.
our interpretation of section comports with the other provisions of the iso agreement.section prohibits solicitation of merchants e xcept as otherwise provided in section.emphasis added.and,as process america itself argues,section survival clause would allow it to transfer the accounts post termination.see appellant br.we thus conclude that process america solicitation of merchants,and sale of a portion of the portfolio without compliance with section.b,constitutes a breach of contract,and that process america may be liable for the resulting increased attrition of merchants in the portfolio.
excusal of performance 
process america next argues that,even if the solicitation of merchants would ordinarily be a breach of the non solicitation clause,it is excused from performing its obligations under that provision as a result of cynergy failure to pay process america residuals.we reject that argument 
under new york law,a party performance under a contract is excused where the other party has substantially failed to perform its side of the bargain or,synonymously,where that party has committed a material breach.see hadden consol.edison of.whether a failure to perform constitutes a material breach turns on several factors,such as the absolute and relative magnitude of default,its effect on the contract purpose,willfulness,and the degree to which the injured party has benefitted under the contract.id.for a breach to be material,it must go to the root of the agreement between the parties.septembertide publ g,stein day,cir.see also callanan powers,rescission is not permitted for a slight,casual,or technical breach,but,as a general rule,only for such as are material and willful,or,if not willful,so substantial and fundamental as to strongly tend to defeat the object of the parties in making the contract.frank felix,austin drugs,cir.
a partial breach may entitle the non breaching party to damages for the breach,but does not entitle the party to simply to treat the contract as at an end.see,lovink guilford mills,cir.a partial breach by one party does not justify the other party subsequent failure to perform both parties may be guilty of breaches,each having a right to damages.new windsor volunteer ambulance corps,meyers,cir,quoting corbin on contracts,at.
process america argues that cynergy failure to pay residuals constitutes a material breach that excuses it from its obligation not to solicit merchants.the non solicitation clause,however,survives for a period of five years post termination,regardless of how the contract was terminated.moreover,although the failure to pay an agent may go to the root of the contract and could excuse the agent from continuing to work for the principal,cynergy breach occurred after a lengthy period of performance and the non solicitation clause is a prohibition rather than an affirmative obligation on process america.under those circumstances,cynergy failure to pay residuals is not so significant as to constitute a material breach.furthermore,section of the iso agreement explicitly states that process america is not entitled to residuals if cynergy terminates the iso agreement due to process america material breach.thus,the iso agreement explicitly contemplates the situation that occurred here cynergy unilateral withholding of residual payments.it is true that,as the district court found,cynergy was not entitled to do so under the particular circumstances.nonetheless,cynergy attempt to exercise an express contractual right does not constitute a material breach of the contract that would excuse non performance of a separate obligation.
process america attempts to connect the non solicitation and continued compensation provisions by arguing that the obligation to pay residuals and the obligation not to solicit merchants are the only duties that survive termination and therefore necessarily show mutuality.but the agreement to perform certain duties post termination is part of the bargained for exchange embodied in the contract as a whole and can not be viewed in isolation.the mere fact that both provisions survive termination does not make them contingent on each other.
damages cap 
process america also contends that the district court erred both in interpreting the limitation on cynergy damages contained in the iso agreement and in concluding,at the summary judgment stage,that the carve out for willful misconduct did not apply.section of the iso agreement provides that 
except for the liability arising from gross negligence,recklessness,or willful misconduct,the total cumulative liability of cynergy data in the aggregate for damages arising from any breach of this agreement or for any other claims under this agreement,shall not exceed fees derived by cynergy data during the last months of this agreement which equals.
the district court found,and we agree,that the plain language of section limits damages for cynergy breach of contract to.
process america argues that reading section to limit cynergy liability would render section of the iso agreement superfluous.that argument fails.section simply provides that termination of the iso agreement will not affect process america right to receive residuals,unless cynergy terminates the iso agreement due to a material breach of the agreement by process america.but,as the district court observed,section says nothing about damages it merely establishes a substantive right to continue receiving residuals for process america.there is no contradiction between the two provisions and thus no need to harmonize them,which,in process america view,would require us to simply ignore section.we note that the interplay between those two provisions does give cynergy an incentive to stop paying residuals where the payments owed would exceed the damages cap.but that is the contract that the parties bargained for,and to the extent that cynergy decision to withhold residuals constituted willful misconduct,the damages cap would not apply.
process america also contends that the district court erred in determining,following a motion in limine,that cynergy withholding of residuals was not gross negligence,recklessness,or willful misconduct,such that the damages cap does not apply.process america argues that it set forth sufficient evidence of willful misconduct as to require a trial on that issue.
new york courts have routinely enforced liability limitation provisions when contracted by sophisticated parties,recognizing such clauses as a means of allocating economic risk in the event that a contract is not fully performed see,biotronik conor medsystems ireland,peluso tauscher cronacher prof l eng rs,app.div.dep t scott palermo,app.div.dep t.in interpreting an exculpatory clause similar to section,the new york court of appeals stated 
in excepting willful acts from defendant general immunity from liability we think the parties intended to narrowly exclude from protection truly culpable,harmful conduct,not merely intentional nonperformance of the agreement motivated by financial self interest.we,therefore,conclude that the term willful acts as used in this contract was intended by the parties to subsume conduct which is tortious in nature,wrongful conduct in which defendant willfully intends to inflict harm on plaintiff at least in part through the means of breaching the contract between the parties.

at least one appellate court in new york has since clarified that economic self interest is not an excuse for all manner of misconduct,as e conomic self interest is the motivation for fraud,self dealing and breach of fiduciary duty.banc of am.sec.llc solow.ii,app.div.dep t citations omitted.applying that principle to a case where a landlord refused to review proposed modifications in order to extort a million payment from the plaintiff,the court indicated that misconduct that extends well beyond a simple breach of contract may be excluded from an exculpatory provision.id.at 
even applying the more lenient definition of willful misconduct from solow,the district court did not err in holding that process america failed to submit sufficient evidence as to whether cynergy breach was willful.because the iso agreement permitted cynergy to terminate the iso agreement and withhold residuals for certain breaches,to show that cynergy conduct was anything more than a right specifically reserved to it under the contract,process america must set forth some evidence that cynergy did not believe it was justified in terminating the agreement,rendering cynergy conduct even if falling below the level of tortious wrongful.before turning to process america evidence of willfulness,we discuss briefly the evidence relevant to cynergy assessment of whether process america had,in fact,breached the contract by maintaining a merchant reserve in violation of the rules.
the district court concluded that crip,as a merchant reserve,was a material breach of contract,but did not justify cynergy termination of the contract without notice.the court therefore concluded that cynergy breach resulted solely from its failure to give notice and an opportunity to cure,which the district court described as technical in nature.we do not reach the question of whether crip was a material breach of contract in this opinion.but,even assuming that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because there was a question of fact as to whether crip was funded out of process america own residuals,cynergy would certainly be entitled to believe that crip involved a merchant reserve.the form process america used to sign merchants up for crip is entitled merchant reserve acknowledgment and describes the money used to fund crip as a reserve,moreover,it is clear that moneris considered crip to be a merchant reserve.therefore,whether or not there was a material breach,the undisputed facts show that cynergy would have been justified in believing one had occurred.
process america identifies the following as the principal evidence of willfulness evidence that old cynergy was aware of crip and cynergy later denied knowledge of crip in its communications with moneris the delay between cynergy receipt of the letter from moneris regarding crip and when cynergy informed process america that crip was a material breach an email exchange in which cynergy executives sought to intercept merchants severing their contracts with cynergy,and a sworn statement from alyssa klausner,process america attorney,that cynergy general counsel stated that the reason for withholding residuals was to break process america.
none of this evidence is sufficient to raise a triable question of fact as to whether cynergy conduct extend ed well beyond a simple breach of the contract,solow,at emphasis added,let alone evidence that cynergy willfully intend ed to inflict harm on process america at least in part through the means of breaching the contract between the parties.noble lowndes,at.evidence that cynergy knew about crip prior to termination,and later concealed its knowledge from moneris,does not suggest that cynergy did not believe it was justified in terminating the contract because of crip,particularly as the event precipitating the termination was a letter from moneris to cynergy describing crip as a merchant reserve and requesting that cynergy terminate process america as an iso.the fact that cynergy waited a month after receiving the letter before informing process america of the termination is similarly irrelevant.
the internal email in which cynergy sought to intercept merchants canceling their contract,sent just weeks after cynergy terminated the contract,also fails to support process america position.in that email,cynergy chief operating officer instructed cynergy personnel in the retention department 
take a look at all process america cancels for the last months and see if any good ones got away.we cancelled process america contract and are holding their residuals so it likely they will move a lot of accounts.let try to intercept them if we can.once they cancel it open game.
but that email was in response to a message from a cynergy employee stating that process america had told a merchant that cynergy was bankrupt and stealing money from the merchant reserves.in that context,no misfeasance can be inferred from the coo instruction to cynergy personnel to intercept merchants canceling accounts with cynergy who may have been told false things about cynergy business practices and financial stability.
the only evidence that process america set forth that would suggest that cynergy did not believe it was entitled to cancel the contract is an oral statement,relayed in a sworn affidavit by klausner,that cynergy was withholding reserves to break process america.with respect to that statement,the affidavit states in full 
i continued to negotiate with corvino cynergy general counsel in the months after termination to resolve the dispute between cynergy and process america regarding whether crip was a breach and under what circumstances cynergy would pay the residuals that it was improperly withholding from process america.it became clear that cynergy was intent on permanently disrupting process america ability to do business and corvino went as far as to admit to me that she and cynergy were withholding the residuals from process america in order to break process america.
the affidavit fails to describe the context in which the statement was made,and quotes only a single word from the original statement.the only indication that cynergy was withholding residuals for any improper reason is klausner speculation as to cynergy motives,which is insufficient to raise a triable issue of fact.see,res.developers,statue of liberty ellis island,cir.we have not hesitated to affirm a summary judgment when the only proof proffered in opposition amounts to nothing more than speculation and conjecture.
because process america failed to provide any evidence that would raise a genuine issue of material fact as to cynergy basis for terminating the contract,we agree with the district court that the carve out in section for willful misconduct does not apply.

the district court held a bench trial limited solely to the issue of damages.when reviewing a judgment following a bench trial,we review a district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.merck eprova ag gnosis,cir.under the clearly erroneous standard,the reviewing court must give due regard to the trial court opportunity to judge the witnesses credibility.fed.civ.a.we are not allowed to second guess the court credibility assessments,and w here there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.diesel props greystone bus.credit ii llc,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.
process america challenges the district court damages award principally on two separate grounds.first,it contends that cynergy failed to meet its burden at trial to provide a stable foundation for its damages claim.second,it argues that the district court failed to reduce the award by the improperly withheld residuals.we consider each argument in turn.
proof of damages 
proof of damages is an essential element of a claim for breach of contract under new york law.see harsco segui,cir.a non breaching party is entitled,as a matter of law,to recover market value damages to the extent that they can be proven with reasonable certainty.schonfeld hilliard,cir.where,however,the non breaching party has proven the fact of damages by a preponderance of the evidence,the burden of uncertainty as to the amount of damage is upon the wrongdoer.contemporary mission,famous music,cir.see also tractebel energy,aep power,cir.doubts are generally resolved against the party in breach.sir speedy,l p graphics,cir.therefore,a plaintiff need only show a stable foundation for a reasonable estimate of the damages incurred as a result of the breach.freund washington square press.at that point,the burden of any uncertainty as to the amount of damages is on the breaching party.see boyce soundview tech,cir.
process america argues that cynergy failed to meet this burden at trial because cynergy expert relied on flawed methodology and cynergy failed to prove that process america solicitation caused merchants to terminate their contracts with cynergy.crediting the testimony of cynergy expert,the district court rejected these arguments.the district court calculated damages by comparing a normal attrition rate the rate at which merchants ceased using cynergy services to the post solicitation attrition rate,and revenue generated by the portfolio before and after process america solicitation.the district court found that process america solicited at least of the merchants in the portfolio that solicitation was the cause of the increased attrition rate and that cynergy was entitled to damages calculated by comparing the attrition rate pre and post solicitation.we can find no clear error in the district court factual findings.
with respect to methodological errors,process america primarily argues that the testimony of cynergy expert,raymond sobzcyk,was flawed because it relied on a six month period for determining a normal attrition rate for cynergy rather than a twelve month period.sobzcyk,however,testified that six months was the relevant period,and process america identifies no evidence,as distinguished from its own briefing,that would indicate that reliance on a twelve month is required to calculate a normalized attrition rate 
process america also contends that cynergy failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that solicitation caused the increased rate of attrition.at trial,both sobczyk and process america expert testified regarding causation.sobcyzk testified that,although it is very difficult to isolate cause of attrition without a first level kind of inquiry to the merchant,he knew of no other factors that would cause abnormal attrition in the p ortfolio following termination.cynergy coo testified that there was no increase in customer service calls following termination.the district court credited that testimony,and found,in light of that testimony and the high attrition rate,that cynergy had met its burden in showing the fact of damages,as a result of process america solicitation.giving appropriate deference to the district court credibility findings and weighing of the evidence,that finding was not clearly erroneous.
having concluded that cynergy met its burden in showing the fact of damages,doubts as to the amount of damages are resolved against the breaching party.acknowledging that it was unlikely that the entire increase in attrition was,as a practical matter,due to process america actions,the district court nonetheless found that process america had failed to show that any attrition was caused by some other factor.that finding is also not clearly erroneous.
process america expert,adam atlas,identified a number of other factors that could have resulted in increased attrition.for example,he suggested that if cynergy had rebranded the statements going out to merchants,merchants could have chosen to switch processors.atlas conceded,however,that he did not know if cynergy had actually changed its branding and was not aware of any merchant that canceled its contract with cynergy for that reason.he also testified that that attrition may have occurred because t he service to the merchants very likely declined in quality because cynergy data acquired the portfolio for free and therefore did need to work hard to earn it or keep it.atlas conceded again,howe
