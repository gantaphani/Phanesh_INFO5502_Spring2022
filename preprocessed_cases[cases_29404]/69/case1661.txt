conoco,conoco appeals a decision of the united states district court for the district of kansas in which the court summary judgment decision granted conoco claim against huber corporation huber for reimbursement of amounts conoco paid for overcharges arising from the sale of petroleum products at prices during.see conoco huber,d.although it granted conoco claim for the principal overcharge amount,in the remedy portion of its decision,the district court exercised its equitable powers and denied conoco request for reimbursement from huber of prejudgment interest on such principal amount.because such denial was not an abuse of discretion,we affirm.
background 
for nine months in,from may through january the stripper period,conoco operated a crude oil field the north east cherokee unit or necu located in oklahoma in which huber owned the rights to approximately three percent of the crude oil production.conoco,at.conoco owned the rights to approximately percent of the production and third parties owned the rights to the remainder of the production.during the stripper period,sun oil company sun purchased all the crude oil from necu,paying third parties such as huber directly.id.
during the and into the early,and at all times during the stripper period,the federal government mandated price controls on petroleum production.see generally chevron mobil producing,conoco,at.under a federal regulation promulgated in,the price controls did not apply to stripper wells,wells with an average daily production of less than ten barrels per well however,injection wells could not be counted when certifying a property as stripper property.chevron,at conoco,at.unbeknownst to huber,conoco incorrectly classified necu as stripper property by including injection wells in the total well count.as a result,and also unbeknownst to huber,sun paid market prices to all sometimes called working interest owners of necu production,including conoco and third parties such as huber,rather than paying lower,regulated prices.this provided a windfall to the group from the overcharges.id.at.
the rule that injection wells could not be counted in evaluating a stripper property was subject to a lengthy challenge before it was eventually upheld.see chevron,at conoco,at.litigation in federal courts involving the department of energy doe and concerning the injection well ruling and the resulting liability from overcharges began in,and,in conoco case,ended in november.id.at.the injection well ruling was first challenged in the district of kansas by a third party suit against the doe in.id.at.for a time,the doe was enjoined from enforcing the injection well ruling.see murfin drilling united states dep t of energy.during the stripper well litigation,oil producers were required to escrow with the district court the difference between the unregulated stripper well price and the regulated price the overcharge.conoco,at.eventually,in,similar suits from around the united states were consolidated into multidistrict litigation mdl in the kansas district court,which upheld the injection well ruling.in,the parties to the mdl,including conoco,entered into a final settlement agreement fsa,under which several billion escrowed dollars were distributed.id.
however,the fsa did not finalize all aspects of the dispute because it did not resolve the issue of whether certain underpaid into the escrow fund.thus,the doe audited all parties,including conoco.in december,the doe advised conoco that it failed to contribute approximately million dollars in overcharges.conoco responded that because it operated many properties that it did not actually own,approximately eighty percent of the million was attributable to third parties,such as huber,who owned an interest in the properties.id.at.
beginning in,conoco made supplemental payments into the escrow fund but stated that the payments were only for its twenty percent,so the doe sued conoco for the remaining eighty percent under the operator liability theory id.the doe won at the district court in late and over the next two years there were two appeals to the federal circuit id.at.then,after a settlement agreement,conoco paid the remaining eighty percent,thus repaying those overcharges that sun paid to third parties.the amounts conoco paid included interest.id.then conoco sought reimbursement from third party in necu production such as huber.id.at.thus,in,it sued huber for reimbursement under a theory of restitution.
the district court held that huber must pay conoco the principal amount for the overcharges,approximately.however,in the remedy phase of its ruling,it declined to order huber to pay conoco for much of the prejudgment interest because the district court concluded,based on equitable principles,that the lack of any notice by conoco to huber of the potential and growing via interest liability should limit conoco recovery.id.at.
first,the district court held that conoco established the necessary elements of restitution,and then evaluated huber two affirmative defenses.id.at.huber argued that a consent decree between it and the doe settled any liability huber had for federal petroleum price regulations,including stripper well liability.the court denied the defense,finding that the consent decree did not cover necu because it was for unrelated natural gas producing properties,not crude petroleum production.id.at.huber also asserted a notice defense,alleging that conoco had a fiduciary or similar duty to keep huber informed of the potential for judgment against it.id.at.the court found that any such duty was not a defense because under the law of the state of oklahoma any fiduciary status that was established by operating properties for a third party did not extend to the circumstances of this case.id.at.
next,the district court analyzed the issue appealed to this huber should pay conoco prejudgment interest.the court found that conoco was entitled to prejudgment interest as part of its restitutionary claim,but that due to equitable considerations it would award interest for a length of time significantly less than what is argued by conoco.id.at.the court noted that conoco litigation with the doe extended from to november.id.then,on july,conoco sent huber a demand letter.the parties stipulated that this letter was the first time conoco informed huber that huber was alleged to have received overcharges for necu production.id.at.
huber did not dispute the fact that conoco had to pay interest on overcharges huber received from sun.huber relied on its amalgamated notice defense,claiming equitable factors preclude awarding prejudgment interest,at least to the extent requested.id.at.huber argued to the district court that a lengthy period of prejudgment interest would allow conoco to benefit from keeping huber in the dark.id.while noting that some cases from the temporary emergency court of appeals had rejected variations of this argument in related legal contexts,the court concluded that equitable principles and a sense of fairness required huber to pay prejudgment interest only during the time period beginning on july,the date of conoco demand letter.the district court found this to be the fair solution because conoco never explained its failure to at least offer huber the ability to satisfy its obligation at an earlier point in time.id.
conoco argued that the amount of huber liability was not known until later in the stripper well litigation,but the district court rejected this contention based on undisputed evidence in the record that huber liability was established with certainty at least as early as.id.at.in addition,although huber generally was aware that price regulation lawsuits were ongoing across the nation,conoco argument that huber should have asked about potential necu liability was unpersuasive because conoco,as the holder of such information,was in a far superior position to inform huber of the potential liability.id.at.
conoco timely appealed only the prejudgment interest issue from the district court grant of summary judgment.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
ii.standard of review 
in reviewing cases resulting from price controls for crude oil pursuant to the economic stabilization act of esa,stat.codified at note,and the emergency petroleum allocation act of epaa,stat.codified at,we have adopted the precedent established by the temporary emergency court of appeals teca.see murphy exploration prod.oryx energy.in accordance with the generally applicable federal rule that in the absence of a statutory provision,the award of prejudgment interest is in the discretion of the trial court,kern oil refining tenneco oil,internal citations omitted,we review the district court determination to limit the award of prejudgment interest under an abuse of discretion standard,mapco int l fed.energy regulatory comm n,noting that in an oil price overcharge restitution case t he trial judge has some discretion in determining the prejudgment interest award,and the appellate court reviews that decision for an abuse of discretion.citing lea exploration,dep t of energy.see also milwaukee cement,gypsum,d noting that in contexts beyond the admiralty issue in the appeal,courts have recognized that despite the compensatory nature of an award of prejudgment interest,such interest is not recovered according to a rigid theory of compensation for money withheld,but in response to considerations of fairness internal quotations omitted electro scientific,scanning,specifying in patent infringement action that the prejudgment interest determination of the district court is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.
conoco argues that the issue on appeal is such that it deserves a de novo standard of review.quoting in re department of energy stripper well exemption litigation,it characterizes the issue as the scope of the federal common law right of reimbursement arising out of the esa and epaa.id.at.huber that the only question is whether the district court abused its discretion in determining not to award prejudgment interest the issue on appeal is not whether this court would have handled the interest question differently,but whether it was an abuse of discretion.we agree with huber that the appropriate standard of review is abuse of discretion.conoco has not appealed the district court decision to require huber to pay the principal overcharge amount,presumably because the district court decided this issue in conoco favor while it is true,as conoco points out,that our review of the restitutionary claim on a summary judgment posture would be de novo,what conoco has appealed is an issue from the remedy portion of the district court decision.kern oil refining,at noting that determination of interest awards are within the equitable powers of the courts see also in re dep t of energy stripper well exemption,at noting that the court has the power to do equity and mould each decree to the necessities of the particular case.because the issue before us is the scope of the remedy,our review is for abuse of discretion.
in addition,conoco also argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to apply a notion of compelling circumstances to its remedy analysis and urges us to apply such a notion upon our review.conoco bases this argument on its reading of lea exploration,see at,and that case cautionary language that courts should award interest consistently in order to affirm the purposes of the esa and epaa,id.at.in a case where the doe sought restitution from lea exploration for overcharges that lea exploration collected from its customers,the court in lea exploration noted that restitution should make victims of overcharges whole,unless some compelling reason counsels otherwise.id.for several reasons,we disagree with conoco assertion that lea exploration limits the district court discretion through a governing notion of compelling circumstances.first,the district court in lea exploration rejected the government argument that a trial court must always include prejudgment interest.id.at.second,in the present case,sun,not conoco,is the victim who paid prices.this factual distinction limits the broad reading conoco seeks to ascribe to lea does not necessarily extend to operator liability situations such as the one at issue in the present case.finally,the court discussion of compelling reasons,consistency,and affirming the purposes of the esa and epaa,are all in the context of a suit where an overcharging producer is in dispute with the government and the overcharged customers deserve restitution.this context is different from the operator liability situation,where the dispute is among the interests owners operators of the property.this shift in focus means that even if a district court must meet a compelling circumstances requirement to decline to charge prejudgment interest against an overcharging producer,such a requirement does not automatically extend to this case in addition,as discussed below,even if such a requirement applied,the district court was within its discretion to find compelling circumstances here.
in sum,the standard of review we apply in operator liability restitution cases is to review for an abuse of discretion the district court exercise of its equitable powers to determine the proper remedy and whether that remedy includes some or all of the prejudgment interest.
iii.discussion 
on appeal the thrust of conoco argument is i that,in a nearly automatic fashion,the federal common law right of restitution includes prejudgment interest and ii that the district court erred in several ways by not following this automatic prescription and allowing conoco to recover such interest from huber.
conoco argues,in essence,that the cases dealing with a variety of overcharges under the esa and the epaa mandate an award of prejudgment interest once the overcharge is proven.conoco bases its reasoning on the underpinnings of the operator liability doctrine o perator liability has been imposed in at least two general situations when the operator is the animating force responsible for the overcharges,or when the operator is held liable as a matter of administrative convenience.in re dep t of energy stripper well exemption.relying on the latter,conoco argues that the harshness of the operator liability doctrine,under which conoco has the burden to pursue each interest owner and recover the overcharge,prescribes a singular outcome whereby the court must use its broad equitable power in a narrow set things right and compensate those overcharged for the loss of use of the money,see in re dep t of energy stripper well exemption,at,gathering,herrington.in conoco interpretation of the precedent,the only correct way for a district court to set things right is to declare a restitutionary award that includes principal and interest.conoco argues that consistency requires this approach.lea exploration,at.
in response,huber argues that the district court retains its full and traditional power to equitably determine the scope of the remedy for a federal common law claim of restitution.kern oil refining,at.it argues that the only question is whether the district court abused its discretion in evaluating the situation in which it determined to deny prejudgment interest.we agree with huber view of the matter.
conoco argument impeaches itself because if the district court has broad equitable power then that power is not also concomitantly narrow so as to mandate a remedy including prejudgment interest.in addition,conoco reads the consistency goal more broadly than expressed by the court in lea exploration.in lea exploration,the court acknowledged that the district court has discretion in deciding whether to award prejudgment interest.lea exploration,at.speaking to the situation where the government is attempting to recover overcharges from the producer operator,the court in lea exploration stated that normally an award of restitution would include prejudgment interest.id.at.we take the use of the term normally in the sense of predicting what will most commonly occur not as establishing a rule of law that overrides the district court equitable powers in determining the proper scope of a remedy.see van vranken atl.richfield,reasoning that there was no per se rule against awards of prejudgment interest.
