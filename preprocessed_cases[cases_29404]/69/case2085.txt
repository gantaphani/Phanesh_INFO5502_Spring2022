introduction 
in this case arising out of an automobile accident,defendants and appellants larry herrick and white knight limousine service appeal from a default judgment in favor of plaintiff and respondent michael scognamillo.defendants contend that the trial court entry of default is void because scognamillo failed to file a statement of damages with the court,although defendants were served with the required statement.defendants further contend that the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendants motion for relief from default as they demonstrated excusable neglect.we reject both of these contentions.
defendants further argue that the judgment must be reversed because a portion of the damage award was not supported by sufficient evidence,and because the trial court failed to reduce to present cash value the portion of the award representing future medical expenses and lost earnings.we agree with these contentions and we therefore reverse a portion of the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
in late march,scognamillo and herrick were involved in a car accident while herrick was in the course and scope of his employment for white knight limousine service,a business of which herrick is part owner.herrick notified fullerton insurance services fullerton,his insurance broker,of the accident,and it notified ward north america ward,the administrator for united states fidelity and guaranty company,which insured white knight.
ward claims account manager,sharon mcgaff,set up a file on the matter on april.scognamillo insurer,state farm,pursued a property damage subrogation claim.ward paid scognamillo on july,to resolve the claim,and ward then closed its claim file.
on march,scognamillo,represented by attorney scott dinsmore,filed a personal injury lawsuit against herrick and white knight.scognamillo served herrick and white knight with the summons and complaint on march.defendants failed to file an answer to the complaint.after receiving no response,dinsmore mailed a request for entry of default to defendants on july,and the clerk entered defaults against defendants on july.
on august,defendants filed a motion to vacate the default pursuant to code of civil procedure section,on the basis that the default was entered as a result of extrinsic mistake,inadvertence,or excusable neglect in support of the motion,defendants filed declarations by herrick,a claims account manager for defendants insurance carrier,and the attorney retained by the insurance carrier to represent defendants after the default was entered.
herrick stated in his declaration that he the summons and complaint to his insurance broker,fullerton,and was told the matter would be taken care of and that he had coverage for the accident.a few weeks later,plaintiff counsel dinsmore called herrick and asked if he had forwarded the summons and complaint to his insurance provider herrick said he had done so.herrick called fullerton and asked if the summons and complaint had been sent to the insurance carrier.the broker later confirmed that the summons and complaint had been sent,and assured herrick everything would be handled.herrick could not recall if he had any later conversations with dinsmore regarding the summons and complaint.
in july,herrick received a copy of a request for entry of default.he called his insurance broker to make sure his interests were being protected.the broker later told herrick that it was taken care of and not to worry.
on august,herrick received a message from attorney andrew marton that the matter had been referred to his office for handling by ward.
steve mccloud,the insurance carrier claims account manager,stated in his declaration that ward had undergone a complete change in personnel after the property damage subrogation claim was resolved in july.he further stated that his review of ward claim file indicated that ward received a copy of the summons and complaint on april,along with a letter addressed to sharon mcgaff,who no longer worked there.based upon my review of the file material,i believe that one of the office clerks opened this letter and inadvertently placed it into the claim file for this matter which was closed.the letter was never brought to my attention,or the attention of any other claims representative.i believe that the complete change over of office personnel contributed to the inadvertent filing of the document without appropriate review.the clerk that was employed at this time is no longer employed with ward north america.mccloud then states that on july,he was notified by fullerton about the default he contacted attorney marton,who learned from plaintiff counsel that a default was entered on or about may.marton contacted dinsmore,who later informed him that scognamillo was unwilling to stipulate to set aside the default.
scognamillo filed opposition to the motion to vacate the default.the opposition was supported by the declaration of scognamillo attorney,dinsmore.dinsmore stated in his declaration,based upon written notes in his file regarding telephone conversations he had with herrick,that herrick first phoned him on march,saying he believed the case had been resolved by his insurance carrier.dinsmore told herrick this was a personal injury action which had not been resolved,and suggested he forward the complaint to his insurance carrier.
dinsmore called herrick on may,and told him the time to respond to the complaint had expired and that defendants were therefore in default and could have default judgments entered against them.herrick said he sent the complaint to his insurance broker and was told the complaint would be transferred to his insurance carrier.dinsmore advised herrick to call his insurance carrier immediately because they had made a serious error which could result in default judgments being entered.
dinsmore called herrick again on may,and told him no response had been filed or served.herrick said he spoke to his insurance broker,who said the complaint had been forwarded to his insurance carrier and they were handling it.herrick said the broker gave him the insurer telephone number,and herrick personally called and was told the insurance carrier would handle the matter.dinsmore told herrick he would be required to enter default judgments against the defendants if he did not receive a response to the complaint immediately.herrick said he would call his insurance carrier again and call dinsmore back.dinsmore received no further communication from herrick.
dinsmore prepared a statement of damages and instructed his attorney service to serve the statement on defendants service of the statement of damages occurred on june,by substituted service on herrick at herrick residence.after receiving no response,dinsmore mailed a request for entry of default to defendants on july,and the clerk entered defaults against defendants on july.
defendants filed a reply to the opposition to the motion for relief from default but did not provide any further declarations as to the circumstances leading up to the entry of default.
