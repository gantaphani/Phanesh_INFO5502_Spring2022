this case concerns the standing of creditors to file an adversary action in bankruptcy court asserting the interests of the estate.plaintiffs,a secured creditor and a committee of unsecured creditors,sued a former insider of several debtor corporations to prevent his interfering with the debtors chapter restructuring.the bankruptcy court held that plaintiffs had standing and subsequently entered a preliminary injunction and contempt order in their favor.on appeal,the district court affirmed the standing determination.
plaintiffs argue that they had derivative standing to file this action because they had the debtors consent.even if the bankruptcy code allows such threshold question that neither the parties nor the lower courts would be inappropriate here.plaintiffs presented no evidence to the bankruptcy court that they actually had the debtors consent,nor did the bankruptcy court determine that allowing the suit would be beneficial to the estate and necessary to a fair and efficient resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings.without these procedural safeguards,there is no clear way to prevent creditors from commandeering bankruptcy proceedings to pursue their own interests to the detriment of the estate and other creditors.we therefore reverse the district court and remand with instructions that the injunction and contempt order be vacated.
defendant steven scott was the equity holder in,and the ceo,director,managing member of,several companies the debtors that supply management and physician services to healthcare providers.in combination,the debtor companies owned contracts involving over doctors and more than hospitals and clinics,generating a total annual revenue exceeding million.among the most valuable of these contracts were those with the broward hospital district broward,which brought in about million.
between november and april,the debtors filed a series of petitions with the bankruptcy court in the district of maryland seeking chapter bankruptcy protection.see et.appellee pappg grantor trust is the to national century financial enterprises ncfe,the debtors largest secured creditor,and the official committee of unsecured creditors appointed to represent the interests of the unsecured creditors collectively plaintiffs.together,plaintiffs hold claims of more than million against the debtors.
the debtors contracts with the broward hospital district were due to expire by their own terms on december.though there had been some discussion regarding possible extensions,counsel for broward sent a letter to the debtors on december,informing them that it was breaking off these negotiations.on that same day,scott resigned.on or around december,scott began his own independent negotiations with broward to supply the services that the debtors had been providing.six days later,broward and scott reached an agreement that he would do so.according to plaintiffs,scott also began to sow dissent among physicians at broward who worked for the debtors,presumably to recruit them for his new venture.
the plaintiff creditors became aware of scott activities shortly thereafter.they believed that his actions were undermining the debtors reorganization process and diverting assets of the debtors estates.the debtors were at this time represented by charles goldstein,their chief restructuring officer cro.according to an affidavit goldstein filed several months later with the district court on appeal,plaintiffs discussed their concerns with him and received his permission to pursue potential claims against scott.
plaintiffs filed an adversary complaint against scott with the bankruptcy court on december,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.they asserted various tort and contract claims,as well as claims under the federal bankruptcy code.the gravamen of the complaint was that scott had undermined the debtors business relationships and reduced the value of the estate.the debtors were parties to neither the complaint nor the motion for injunctive relief.
the bankruptcy court held a preliminary injunction hearing the following day.at that hearing,the bankruptcy court briefly addressed the issue of plaintiffs standing.it found that standing for some of the request for relief certainly is an open issue and one that would be raised going toward the merits.but it went on to note that a t this very preliminary stage it seems to me we have standing by the creditors committee because of its concern over the reorganization.it further stated that ncfe,as a real party in interest,was the biggest creditor in the case.certainly it has standing in the sense that it is a party in interest in what is the outcome.
after hearing evidence concerning scott activities,the bankruptcy court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting scott for a period of one year from undertaking various activities deemed potentially harmful to the estate.on january,plaintiffs and the debtors filed a contempt motion,alleging that scott had violated this injunction.following a hearing,the bankruptcy court found that violations had occurred and issued a contempt order against scott.
scott appealed to the district court from both the preliminary injunction and the contempt order.he argued that plaintiffs lacked standing to request the preliminary injunction,and also challenged various procedural and substantive aspects of the bankruptcy court determinations.the district court rejected all of scott arguments,affirmed the preliminary injunction,and dismissed the appeal of the contempt order.
scott appeals.we review the district court judgment de novo,applying the same standards of review that it did to the judgment of the bankruptcy court.see logan jkv real estate servs.in re bogdan,cir.in particular,we review the bankruptcy court legal conclusions de novo.id.
because we find it dispositive of his various procedural and substantive challenges to the bankruptcy court actions,we consider only scott argument that plaintiffs lacked standing to request the preliminary injunction.
under the doctrine of derivative standing,some of our sister circuits allow a creditor or creditors committee under certain narrow conditions to file an action in bankruptcy court in place of the or trustee.see,smart world,llc juno online,in re smart world,llc,cir.the bankruptcy code does not expressly permit such parties to initiate adversary proceedings.see,unsecured creditors comm.of debtor stn,noyes in re stn enters,cir.derivative standing is thus an implicit exception to the general rule whereby the bankruptcy code assigns to the trustee or the privilege of prosecuting various actions on behalf of the estate.collier on bankruptcy alan resnick henry sommer,ed.id.at nn.citing cases.
our sister circuits that acknowledge the doctrine have allowed a bankruptcy court to grant derivative standing to a creditor or creditors committee in two limited circumstances.first,several circuits have recognized such standing when the trustee or unreasonably refuses to bring suit on its own.see,in re smart world,at official comm.of unsecured creditors of cybergenics ex rel.cybergenics chinery,cir en banc fogel zell,cir canadian pac.forest prods.irving,in re gibson group,cir.world exposition fed.ins,cir.second,two circuits have permitted creditor derivative actions when the trustee or grants consent.see in re smart world,at avalanche,parekh in re parmetex,cir.it is this latter type of derivative standing that is at issue in this case.
