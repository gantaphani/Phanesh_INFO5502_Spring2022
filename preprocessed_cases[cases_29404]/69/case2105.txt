farzad yadollahi and fariborz biyazaei appeal from the denial of their motion to set aside a default judgment entered against them jointly on a.appellants contend the judgment is void because their default was improperly based upon their failure to appear at a trial for which they were given no notice.they also point out that the judgment subsequently entered on the default is rather shockingly out of sync with the distinct damages alleged against each of them in the operative complaint.we agree.
even assuming appellants had been given proper notice of the trial which they were not the court had no authority to enter their defaults for failure to appear.the court options at that point were to allow to proceed with their case in appellants absence,or to continue the trial.its order purporting to enter the default was void,and could be collaterally attacked at any time.additionally,the only damages alleged with specificity in the were approximately plus accrued interest on a portion against yadollahi,and approximately plus accrued interest against biyazaei.none of those damages were alleged to be owed jointly and severally by appellants.consequently,the court entry of a single judgment,against both appellants jointly,borders on the unfathomable.the order denying the motion to vacate is reversed.
the operative complaint in this case is a.it asserts,in general,that the,ahmad and peyman heidary,entered into agreements with appellants and a third,majid tabibi,concerning the ownership and operation of two gas stations.it alleges,in causes of action,that each of the participated in varying degrees in breaching promissory in converting the heidarys share of the profits from the businesses,failing to make payments in compliance with promissory notes,and defrauding the heidarys into investing their money in the businesses.the complaint prays for both compensatory and punitive damages,although it specifies the amount of compensatory damages sought in only a few causes of action,and never specifies any amount of punitive damages.
in april of,appellants attorney received permission from the court to withdraw as their counsel.the withdrawal order included the last known addresses for each appellant.several months later,in september of,plaintiff counsel served a notice of continuance of the trial date to january.unfortunately,however,that notice included neither appellants nor their former counsel 
not surprisingly,neither appellant appeared for the trial on january.the trial court apparently without checking to see if appellants had been given notice ordered that their answers to the be stricken and their defaults entered for their failure to appear at trial this date.the court then continued the trial date again.
the day after the court ordered the defaults,the heidarys filed a request for entry of default with the clerk.the request reflects it was served upon appellants by mail on that same date,at the addresses included in the order relieving their counsel.the default was entered by the clerk the same day the request was filed and mailed to appellants.
approximately a month later,the heidarys filed an ex parte application for entry of judgment based upon the defaults.although our record does not include all the documents filed in support of the judgment,it does include a statement of damages sought.that statement makes no distinction between the varied claims asserted against each appellant,and simply requests for general damages consisting of principal and interest due on promissory notes for general of real estate and for special.the total damages sought in the statement comes to.the heidarys did not serve appellants with any of the documents supporting the entry of judgment,but it would have made scant difference if they judgment was entered the same day those documents were filed,and in the exact total amount requested in the statement of damages 
it is not clear when appellants first became aware of the judgment entered against them,but the record suggests it may have been when the heidarys recorded an abstract of judgment and a lien in july of.less than a month later,appellants their previous lawyer and filed a motion to vacate the judgment.they argued the judgment was void because they had never received notice of the trial,and thus the court had no power to enter their defaults.they also argued that the damages awarded in the judgment were in excess of the damages specified in the complaint.
the heidarys opposed the motion,insisting appellants had received sufficient notice of the default entered against them,because they were each mailed a copy of the request for default the day after the court had ordered it entered.according to the heidarys,appellants had six months from that date to seek relief from the default under code of civil procedure section,and their failure to do so precluded relief.the heidarys also contended that if all the numbers mentioned in their were added up,it amounted to approximately against yadollahi,and approximately against biyazaei.
the court denied the motion to vacate,stating t he amounts of the judgments are supported by the.they within the amounts enumerated and cited in the,and therefore,i think the notice requirement is there as to the amount of damages sought against them.
appellants subsequently filed a petition for writ relief with this court,but we denied it on the basis that they had an adequate remedy at law.this appeal is that remedy.
as appellants correctly contend,this case is not governed by code of civil procedure section,subdivision b which allows parties to seek relief from certain consequences of their own mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.indeed,this case went awry not because of appellants mistake,but because of everyone else it was plaintiff who neglected to inform appellants of the trial date it was the court which improperly ordered their default for failing to appear apparently without confirming they were notified it was the heidarys who sought a type and amount of damages not specified in their and it was again the court which granted that request.none of those acts was attributable to anything done by appellants.consequently,their ability to seek relief is not constrained by the time limitation contained in section,subdivision b.
instead,appellants are seeking relief from a void judgment,which the court has authority to set aside at any time.rochin pat johnson manufacturing th,d a judgment void on its face is subject to collateral attack at any time.plotitsa superior court d.a default that is void on the face of the record when entered is subject to challenge at any time irrespective of lack of diligence in seeking to set it aside within the period of section.indeed,section itself contains a separate provision allowing the court to set aside a void judgment without any mention of a time limit.section,subdivision d the court may,on motion of either party after notice to the other party,set aside any void judgment or order.
and in this case,the record does show the default order,and hence the judgment,was void on its face.simply stated,the court had no power to order the entry of appellants default when they failed to appear for trial.wilson goldman d.kahn kahn d,fn.in re brian th,fn,d in re nemis th,d see also,merrifield edmonds d.explaining the distinction between a default judgment and the uncontested trial which occurred in that case.
in wilson,the facts are nearly identical to this case.the only distinguishing factor is that the defendant in that case did receive proper notice of the trial.when he did not appear,the court entered a default at the request of plaintiffs.plaintiffs then chose to wait until another day to prove up their damages,so no trial was held.plaintiffs subsequently proved damages on an ex parte basis,without notice to defendant.
the wilson court affirmed the order vacating the judgment,and because its opinion explains the governing law quite clearly,we will quote it at some length section of the code of civil procedure does not authorize the entry of any default in cases where an answer is on file,whether the defendant does or does not appear at
