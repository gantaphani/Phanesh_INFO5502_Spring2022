this is the story of how a bankruptcy filing listing a payday loan snowballed into a violation of the automatic stay,and protracted litigation,which left a stressed borrower with attorneys fees and emotional distress.when the automatic stay that accompanies a bankruptcy filing is violated,the bankruptcy petitioner is entitled to recover damages and attorneys fees.k.the issue we consider is whether a bankruptcy petitioner can collect attorneys fees incurred litigating the violation of the automatic stay after the violator sends an conditionally offering partial reimbursement.we conclude that such fees are recoverable under k.the bankruptcy laws do not permit a stay violator to undermine the remedies available under k by forcing a bankruptcy petitioner to accept a conditional offer in lieu of pursuing fair compensation and attorneys fees.
background and procedural history 
rupanjali snowden took out a payday from check into cash of washington cic to make ends meet for herself and her daughter.before payment was due,snowden put a stop payment on the check.on the same day,snowden advised cic sequim,washington office that she was thinking about filing for bankruptcy,and provided her bankruptcy attorney phone number.she was advised that she should let cic know if she decided to file.when snowden told cic that she could not repay the loan,cic said that she must call cic every day,otherwise the company would call her references.snowden complied,calling cic every day until the day she filed for bankruptcy because she did want to be embarrassed.
snowden was employed as a hospital nurse.cic employees called her at work numerous times asking why she had not yet repaid the loan.snowden referred them to her attorney and asked that they stop calling her at work,but the calls persisted.these calls affected her work performance and were very frustrating because every time snowden heard her name over the loudspeaker she would,run to the phone thinking her daughter had an emergency.cic advised snowden that it would not cash the check securing the loan.
in an effort to get her financial house in order,snowden filed her chapter bankruptcy petition without directly advising cic.she listed cic as an unsecured creditor with a claim.when snowden checked her bank account a little over a month after the bankruptcy filing,she saw that it was overdrawn.the bank advised her that cic had cashed the check securing the payday loan.instead of honoring the automatic stay,and after a number of harassing phone calls to snowden at the hospital,cic used an electronic funds transfer to debit snowden bank account for the amount due,overdrawing her account by,including bank charges.
when snowden found out about the overdraft,she went into a tailspin because her finances had careened out of control at the moment when she thought she was finally getting them together.t he number just panicked her,and she was out of her mind.she worried that every other creditor would do the same thing cic did,which was very overwhelming.snowden had to borrow to pay those overdraft fees,and had to tell her daughter she could not afford to buy tennis shoes for her as promised or pay for a haircut.snowden testified that she was going nuts,could not concentrate,was agitated,and felt miserable.
snowden went to cic sequim office to sort out the situation and was told someone would contact her,but no one did.she left there feeling really sick to her stomach because she just did want to deal with this anymore.snowden testified that,on the way to cic,she ran into her daughter babysitter,christy smith,and broke down crying.smith,however,testified that the never occurred and that snowden falsified an in smith name mirroring snowden account of their.smith testified that snowden offered her in exchange for favorable testimony.snowden,on the other hand,testified that smith wrote the and denied that she offered her any money.
in april,snowden filed a motion for sanctions in the united states bankruptcy court for the western district of washington,alleging that cic willfully violated the automatic stay provision of the bankruptcy code,and seeking a return of the funds and overdraft fees,emotional distress and punitive damages,and attorneys fees.throughout the proceedings,cic disputed that it violated the automatic stay.
cic rejected snowden request to settle the case for.instead,in an affirmatively claiming it was without fault,cic proposed repaying snowden the loan amount,bank fees,and three hours of attorneys fees,a total of.understandably,snowden did not jump at this suggestion because the did not compensate her for the emotional distress cic had caused.
the case proceeded to trial.ultimately,the bankruptcy court rejected cic defenses,found a willful violation of the automatic stay,and awarded emotional distress damages of as well as the loan amount,in bank fees,in punitive damages,and in attorneys fees,totaling it denied snowden request for a fee award in the court inherent authority or under a.the court found snowden testimony on emotional distress credible though it could not resolve the contradiction between smith and snowden and concluded that c ashing of the check upended both snowden finances and her efforts to manage her affairs as did cic ongoing refusal to rectify the situation that it created.the court also awarded punitive damages,determining that cic point ed to no policy directing its local offices to forward bankruptcy notices to headquarters or corporate collection or instructing how to check for bankruptcy,which qualifies under the authorities as reckless disregard for the rights of customers who file for bankruptcy relief.the court determined that snowden was entitled only to attorneys fees incurred up to may,the date on which cic sent its.
cic appealed the bankruptcy court emotional distress and punitive damages,and fees awards.the district court determined that although the bankruptcy court cited the controlling case,in re dawson,cir,it did not apply the proper standard for emotional distress damages.the district court found,however,that the bankruptcy court applied the appropriate punitive damages standard and indicated that it would be inclined to affirm the judgment were it not for the error regarding emotional distress damages.the district court remanded for a determination of emotional distress damages under the appropriate standard and for a reevaluation of punitive damages in light of any change in the emotional distress damages award.
the district court also affirmed on snowden crossappeal of the attorneys fees award and the failure to impose sanctions under the bankruptcy court inherent authority or under a.the district court classified the may,as a tender that would have remedied the stay violation.it therefore concluded that sternberg johnston,cir,le ft little to discuss because it limited attorneys fees solely to those fees associated with remedying the stay violation.id.at.like the bankruptcy court,the district court reasoned that any damages accrued after may,were not associated with remedying the stay violation because if snowden had accepted the amount mentioned in cic,the violation would have ended.
on remand,the bankruptcy court did not alter its judgment,even though it reconsidered the trial record in light of the district court decision.the bankruptcy court noted that it found snowden testimony more credible than smith,and that snowden had clearly established significant emotional distress because a reasonable person in precarious financial circumstances who had to endure what snowden did,after filing bankruptcy,going through the stress that normally attends that process and beginning to build a structure on which she could go forward with her life,had the repeated calls at work,then had the beginnings of the financial structure she was rebuilding kicked out from underneath would suffer substantial emotional distress.
following round two in the bankruptcy court,cic again appealed the emotional distress and punitive damages awards to the district court.snowden the sanctions decision and the attorneys fees determination under sternberg,and she sought to recover fees incurred on appeal.in this second appeal to the district court,the court determined that its prior rulings on attorneys fees and sanctions remained the law of the case.it also denied snowden attorneys fees incurred as a result of the appeal because those fees were not incurred in an effort to enforce the stay,but in pursuit of a damages award for a stay violation.in effect,the second appeal left in place the bankruptcy court original order.
cic now appeals the emotional distress and punitive damages awards,and snowden the attorneys fees and sanctions rulings.
emotional distress damages 
section k permits an award of emotional distress damages if the bankruptcy petitioner suffer s significant harm,clearly establish es the significant harm,and demonstrate s a causal connection between that significant harm and the violation of the automatic stay as distinct,for instance,from the anxiety and pressures inherent in the bankruptcy process.dawson,at.cic takes issue only with the bankruptcy court findings on the second prong,arguing that snowden did not clearly establish significant emotional harm but only f leeting or trivial anxiety or distress.see id.at.reviewing the decision of the district court de novo,we review for clear error the bankruptcy court findings of fact and for an abuse of discretion the bankruptcy court decision whether to award damages and how much to award.id.at.we affirm.
on remand,the bankruptcy court evaluated the evidence supporting snowden claim for emotional distress damages under the correct standard of proof,namely whether she clearly establish ed that she suffered significant emotional harm.see id.at.although the circumstances surrounding the violation make it obvious that a reasonable person would suffer significant emotional harm,id.at,cic contests whether snowden in fact suffered significant emotional harm.discrediting smith testimony,the bankruptcy court found snowden credible and determined that snowden did suffer significant and substantial emotional distress as a result of cic actions in cashing the check and in continuing to call her.cashing of the check upended both her finances and her efforts to manage her affairs as did cic ongoing refusal to rectify the situation that it created.
when asked why her declaration in support of the motion for sanctions did not include any information about the harassing telephone calls,snowden replied i did not know i was supposed to tell them.i did know it was such a big thing it is a big thing,because when you come out of the room,it a burden to leave everything behind and to walk to the phone to answer the phone every time.i do know if you ever seen a nurse work not only are you leaving that room to come answer the phone,you putting a patient on hold that a big thing.cic seizes on the statement,i did know it was such a big thing,to claim that snowden did not subjectively suffer emotional distress.in view of the context explaining why the phone calls indeed were a big thing and the testimony about her emotional distress,the district court did not err in confirming the emotional distress damages award.
ii.punitive damages 
section k provides for punitive damages in appropriate circumstances.k.an award of punitive damages requires some showing of reckless or callous disregard for the law or rights of others.in re bloom,cir.cic is incorrect that the bankruptcy court erroneously applied the willful violation standard rather than the reckless disregard standard.the bankruptcy court explained that punitive damages were appropriate in the context of a stay violation when there a reckless and callous disregard for the law or the rights of others or where the conduct is malicious,wanton,or oppressive.the bankruptcy court therefore applied the correct legal standard.
the court award of punitive damages was not an abuse of discretion.see pavon swift transp,cir.the bankruptcy court supported the award with findings that cic failed to provide a policy or employee training about how to address debt collection following a bankruptcy filing.the bankruptcy court reasonably concluded that cic demonstrated reckless and callous disregard for the law.
iii.attorneys fees 
the filing of a bankruptcy petition immediately gives rise to an automatic stay.sternberg,at citing.section k provides that an individual injured by any willful violation of a stay shall recover actual damages,including costs and attorneys fees,and,in appropriate circumstances,may recover punitive damages.k.
in sternberg,we held that attorneys fees under k are limited to those attorney fees related to enforcing the automatic stay and remedying the stay violation,not the fees incurred in prosecuting the bankruptcy adversary proceeding in which he pursued his claim for those damages.at.in that case,an arizona state court presiding over a divorce proceeding entered judgment against an individual who was also involved in bankruptcy proceedings.id.at.the arizona court required immediate payment of the judgment without determining whether there was any property or requesting that the bankruptcy court determine whether the automatic stay applied to its order.id.simultaneously with filing an appeal,the petitioner commenced an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court arguing that collection on the judgment was a willful violation of the automatic stay.id.the petitioner was successful in the adversary proceeding and received a damages award,which included attorneys fees.id.at.
we affirmed the finding that the automatic stay was violated,but concluded that the petitioner was not entitled to attorneys fees from the subsequent adversary proceeding in which the petitioner sought to collect damages for the stay violation.id.at.we interpreted k against the backdrop of the american rule,under which parties are presumed to bear their own litigation costs.id.at.we also relied on the plain meaning of actual damages as a n amount awarded to compensate for a proven injury or loss damages that repay actual losses.id.at citing black law dictionary ed internal quotation marks omitted.we reasoned that o nce the violation has ended,any fees the debtor incurs after that point in pursuit of a damage award would not be to compensate for actual damages under k.id.we remand ed to the district court with instructions to remand to the bankruptcy court to determine which fees are properly allocable to efforts to enforce the automatic stay and prevent enforcement of the state court order that violated the stay.id.at.
sternberg established a brightline rule that attorneys fees incurred in an attempt to collect damages once the stay violation has ended are not recoverable.id.however,the issue remains whether the cic sent to snowden ended the violation.to answer this question,we look to whether the petitioner is using t he stay a s a shield,not a sword.id.at.as we explained in sternberg,the limitation on recovery of attorneys fees was aimed at reducing incentives for further litigation while providing a bankruptcy petitioner a remedy for the stay violation.id.
our more recent decision in in re schwartz tallard,wl cir,is instructive.there,we permitted recovery of attorneys fees incurred in defending an appeal from the decision of the bankruptcy court finding a violation of the automatic stay.wl,at.we held that the debtor was entitled to fees because she was forced to defend the appeal to validate the bankruptcy court ruling that the creditor had violated the stay,and to preserve her right to collect the damages awarded by the bankruptcy court.in other words,unlike in sternberg,schwartz tallard was not using the stay as a sword,but as a shield from stay violation.id.at first alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.
here,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court rationale that although cic never admitted a stay violation,snowden losses would have been righted and the violation would have come to an end had she accepted the tender.we review that conclusion for an abuse of discretion.the bankruptcy court determination that the may,marked the end of the stay violation was an abuse of discretion because the court failed to identify the correct lega
