john companies,appeals the decision of the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee granting a preliminary injunction in favor of,phg technologies,phg.because we find that john has raised a substantial question of the validity of the two patents at issue,the district court abused its discretion by granting phg motion for a preliminary injunction.therefore,we vacate the preliminary injunction.
background 
phg and its predecessors have been in the business of selling certain medical patient identification labels as well as identification labeling software in the united states since.phg owns the two design patents at issue in this case united states patent nos.the patent and,the patent.the patent claims t he ornamental design for the medical label sheet,as shown.the patent claims t he ornamental design for a label pattern for a medical label sheet,as shown.figure from the patent and figure from the patent appear below,respectively 
as can be seen,both designs include eleven rows of labels,with each row containing three labels.the first nine rows are depicted to contain three labels of equal size,the size being consistent with a standard medical chart label.the tenth and eleventh row each contain labels which apparently correspond to the size of a pediatric and adult patient wristband respectively.the difference between the two patents is that the border is part of the design claimed in the patent but not part of the design claimed in the patent.the and patents depend from a utility patent application,the utility application,which is still pending at the united states patent and trademark office.
john also sells medical patient identification labels in the united states in competition with phg on may,before phg design patents issued,phg informed john by letter that the design of john medical label sheet infringed the intellectual property rights of phg and that phg anticipated that patents covering the accused design would be issued in the future.john did not respond to the may letter and continued to sell its medical label sheet.after the two patents issued,phg filed suit on august,alleging,inter alia,that john medical label sheet infringed the and patents.
on august,two weeks after filing suit,phg moved for a preliminary injunction against john continued sale of its accused medical label sheet.the district court held an evidentiary hearing on november.john argued that the patented medical label sheets are primarily functional and presented evidence from the prosecution history of the utility application and from an affidavit submitted by adam press,john chief executive officer,in support of its argument.phg presented the testimony of moyer,one of the inventors of the patents at issue.moyer testified that he and stewart,his,experimented with different configurations of the medical labels and chose the claimed designs because they were the most aesthetically pleasing to us.
on december,the district court granted phg motion for a preliminary injunction and made,inter alia,the following findings with respect to the validity of the patents the design claimed is not dictated by its function the different sizes and arrangement of labels on phg claimed design are primarily ornamental because there are other ways to arrange different sizes of labels on an x sheet the inventors of the design considered various arrangements and chose the patented design because it had the best flow and look and the novel features of phg designs,particularly the placement of the various sizes of labels at the bottom of the sheet,distinguishes phg designs from the prior art.additionally,the district court made the following findings pertaining to infringement of the patents by john medical label sheet when compared,john medical label sheet and the patented design are identical and an ordinary observer would be very to identify any differences in the two designs and john accused design appropriates the novelty of phg patented design,which distinguishes it from the prior different sizes of labels and their placement on the sheet.finally,the district court found that phg is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of irreparable harm and the evidence confirms that phg has suffered and will continue to suffer substantial damage in lost sales,business opportunities,and customer goodwill if john is not enjoined from continuing to market its accused design.see phg,john,preliminary injunction opinion.based on these findings,the court concluded that phg demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits,established that it would be irreparably harmed if an injunction did not issue and showed that the balance of hardships and the public interest weigh in favor of enjoining john from continuing to sell its accused design.
john appeals the district court grant of the preliminary injunction against its accused medical label sheet design.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court decision granting a motion for preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.novo nordisk of,genentech.to overturn the grant of a preliminary injunction,we must find that the district court made a clear error of judgment in weighing the relevant factors or based its exercise of discretion on an error of law or on clearly erroneous factual findings.pfizer,teva,usa.whether a patented design is functional or ornamental is a question of fact.
a decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction is based on the district court consideration of four factors the likelihood of the patentee success on the merits irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted the balance of hardships between the parties and the public interest.oakley,sunglass hut int l,citing.our case law and logic both require that a movant can not be granted a preliminary injunction unless it establishes both of the first two factors,likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm,at.in order to establish the first preliminary injunction factor,phg must show that it will likely prove that john infringes the and patents.however,in order to defeat the injunction on grounds of potential invalidity,john,as the party bearing the burden of proof on the issue at trial,must establish a substantial question of invalidity.see gonzales o centro espirita beneficente uniao do vegetal,d t he burdens at the preliminary injunction stage track the burdens at trial.see also ashcroft am.civil liberties union,d.
on appeal,john challenges the district court findings with respect to only the first preliminary injunction likelihood of success on the merits.john argues that the district court erred by finding that phg will likely prove infringement and john challenge to the validity of the patents at issue lacks substantial merit,does not raise a substantial question concerning the validity of the patents.we begin with john challenge to the validity of phg asserted patents.
substantial question of validity 
john asserts that the district court erred in finding that the patented designs are primarily ornamental rather than merely a byproduct of functional considerations.in support of its assertion of functionality,john points to various statements made by phg in the prosecution of the utility application and to statements made by press in an affidavit submitted to the court.john argues that the statements made during prosecution and those submitted by press constitute a clear and convincing showing of functionality.further,john asserts that because phg presented no evidence to rebut john showing of invalidity,the district court clearly erred in finding that the patented designs are primarily ornamental.
phg responds that the district court correctly determined that john failed to raise a substantial question regarding the functionality of the designs because the patented designs were not dictated by the use or purpose of the article of medical label sheet.phg concedes that the design has functional features but argues that the arrangement of the different sizes of labels on the sheet is primarily ornamental because,as found by the district court,there are a multi
