this appeal stems from an ugly incident of verbal abuse of a female police officer by her fellow male officers during a bus trip in the fall of,as well as from the actions of the union and its members in response to the investigations of her complaints in the years that followed.the female officer,vanessa dixon,eventually brought a civil suit in federal court against the national union and its local chapter,their presidents,and two of the police officers involved in the incident,asserting claims of discrimination,retaliation,and defamation.the jury found for dixon on some but not all of her claims,awarding her a total of in compensatory damages and in punitive damages.
defendants appeal the judge denial of their motions for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure b,as well as the judge jury instructions regarding retaliation and punitive damages.dixon,who lost her defamation claim against the national union and its president,appeals the judge determination that she was a public official,which required the jury to find that the defendants acted with actual malice.we affirm.
background 
because some of the defendants challenge the denial of their motions for judgment as a matter of law,we recount the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.stiefel,cir.vanessa dixon joined the lowell police department in,when there were fewer than ten female police officers in a force of nearly three hundred.she was years old.after early assignments with community policing programs,dixon was assigned as a resource officer at rogers middle school,an school.in that position,she coordinated with social services and juvenile probation to assist troubled students and their families.among other duties,she conducted peer mediation,organized and summer activities,taught gang resistance and a teens against violence curriculum,and advocated for students who were having trouble at home.this work required dixon to develop relationships of trust and respect with the students and within the community.her early evaluations were extremely positive,and she received special awards from her unit for her work with young people.
the day dixon joined the police department,she automatically joined the police officers union,local local of the international brotherhood of police officers ibpo.an active member,dixon ran for the local executive board,hosted holiday parties for members families,participated in fundraising events,and traveled with the local to union events in puerto rico and washington.in the fall of,dixon agreed to participate with the local in a gubernatorial campaign rally in boston.
on october,dixon joined seven of her fellow officers and six corrections officers on a hired bus to travel to boston.she was the only woman on the trip,other than the bus driver.from the moment she walked into the union hall that afternoon,she was subjected to criticisms by the other officers regarding what she was wearing and her presence on an trip.once in boston,the group participated briefly in the rally at faneuil hall,then reboarded their bus for anthony pier,where the ibpo hosted a dinner and open bar.after dinner,the group moved to the restaurant bar,where they befriended a group in town for a convention.gerald flynn,the president of the local and the organizer of the boston trip,invited these to join the lowell group on their bus as they continued on to foley,a bar in the south end frequented by police officers.
dixon spent time at foley with some of the conventioneers,including a man named jason kumm.when the bar closed at,kumm did not know how to get back to his hotel,so dixon persuaded the bus driver to drop kumm off before heading back to lowell.
as the bus left the bar,john police officer whom dixon had once dated and who was sitting directly across the aisle from yelling at dixon for creating a detour so late at night.the shouting escalated as other people at the back of the bus joined in.the comments,directed at dixon and kumm,turned sexual why do you fuck her.we all have.she gives great blowjobs.she will do you,she done all of us.the bus driver,who testified that she had spent seven years trying to forget that night,explained that the word fuck was used so often that i was turning my mind off to it.kumm described the barrage as totally inappropriate conversation,verbally abusive,threatening.flynn,sitting at the front of the bus,encouraged kumm to get off before a fight broke out the situation,he thought,had the potential to explode.
kumm did get off the bus before it reached his hotel,but the verbal abuse of dixon did not end.leary kept shouting in dixon face such comments as,get off the bus with your boyfriend.go fuck him at the sheraton if you want to bring him with you.similar comments continued from the back of the bus.when dixon looked behind her,she saw another officer,david pender,standing with his hands down his pants and saying,why do you come and fucking blow me.terrified,dixon demanded the bus driver let her off the bus near boston common,even though the driver and ed mcmahon,another officer,tried to dissuade her.throughout all of this,flynn remained at the front of the bus although the president of the local,he did not intervene to stop the abuse or to try to reassure dixon when she wanted to flee.
during her efforts to make her way home,dixon was subjected to an attempted sexual assault by a stranger.distraught,dixon called in sick to work the next two days,and when she did return to work,she avoided speaking about the bus incident.a few weeks later,however,the chief of the lowell police department,edward davis iii,caught wind of the incident and started an internal investigation,in which dixon cooperated.on november,the chief sent letters to the male officers on the bus trip,including leary,ordering them to have no contact with dixon.
on november,the very next day,leary sought and received an ex parte temporary restraining order tro against dixon under chapter of the massachusetts general laws.leary cursory affidavit,which the jury did not see,evidently alleged that dixon had made threatening comments to him the evening of the bus incident.he did not explain why he had waited a month to seek protection from dixon in the form of a tro.leary knew the tro would have the result,under department policy and massachusetts law,of forcing the police department to put dixon on administrative leave and confiscate her weapon while the tro was in effect.although dixon hired a lawyer and went to court to deny the allegations,leary never returned to court to support his tro or seek continued protection,allowing the tro to expire after its initial coverage.dixon testified she was humiliated when she had to explain her absence,caused by the tro,to the teachers,students,and parents with whom she worked at rogers middle school.because of the tro,she had to get special permission to renew her firearms permit,and she avoided participating in outreach programs that required a background check.
the lowell sun reported that leary had obtained a tro against dixon.this marked the beginning of extensive local publicity about the bus incident and its aftermath.flynn was quoted frequently in the paper and appeared on local television stations and radio shows talking about his version of events.the president of the ibpo,kenneth lyons,hosted a local television show produced and paid for by the union he used this show over the following year to defend the male officers and disparage dixon,the police chief,and the city manager for pursuing their investigation.his comments grew increasingly vicious and were the basis for dixon defamation claim against lyons and the ibpo,as well as part of the basis for her retaliation claims.
at the conclusion of the internal investigation in the spring of,the city fired leary and suspended flynn,pender,and some of the other officers.the officers appealed to the civil service commission,which held additional hearings that fall.in the interim,jose rivera,one of the disciplined officers,filed an internal sexual harassment claim against dixon.so did another officer who dare summer camps with dixon,further disrupting her work at the school.both claims were later determined to be unfounded.
in january,the civil service commission dismissed the charges against flynn and a few of the other officers,finding insufficient evidence to sustain the charges against them.it also determined that dixon testimony regarding pender alleged indecent exposure,flynn allegedly inappropriate comments to the bus driver,and various other details of events the night of the bus incident was inconsistent and thus not credible.the commission final decision,issued in january,sustained leary termination,though it decreased the length of pender and rivera suspensions.it again concluded that dixon testimony was not entirely truthful.within a month,leary,pender,and rivera all filed complaints against dixon with the police department internal affairs office,accusing her of perjury and launching another internal investigation.this investigation concluded in the spring of that dixon had perjured herself in statements made to the department investigators and in testimony before the civil service commission,and the city sent dixon a notice of contemplated discipline in august.she had,however,already quit the force on june.
dixon first filed complaints with the massachusetts commission against discrimination mcad and the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc in the spring of.after receiving right to sue letters from both the mcad and the eeoc,dixon brought suit in october in the district of massachusetts against leary,flynn,pender,lyons local,and the ibpo,alleging discrimination and retaliation under both state and federal statutes,as well as assault,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and defamation.after an jury trial in the fall of,the jury found against leary on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.it also found for dixon and against flynn and the local on the discrimination claims and against leary and the ibpo on the retaliation claims.dixon lost her assault and defamation claims.in addition to compensatory damage awards totaling,the jury awarded punitive damages of against the local and against flynn for discrimination,and against the ibpo and against leary for retaliation.these appeals followed.
ii.defendants appeals 
denial of rule b motions 
we review de novo the district court denial of the defendants rule b motions for judgment as a matter of law.the moving party bears a heavy burden we will set aside the jury verdict only if the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to dixon,points so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the defendants,that a reasonable person could not have arrived at this verdict.coastal fuels of,caribbean petroleum,cir see also,municipality of aguadilla,cir.
defendants leary and the ibpo challenge the sufficiency of the evidence for the jury findings of retaliation,and the local challenges the sufficiency of the evidence for holding it liable for discrimination.in all three instances,there was sufficient evidence for the jury to reach the conclusions it did.
retaliation claims 
dixon brought her retaliation claims under both federal and state law,and the jury findings of retaliation do not differentiate between them.title vii forbids any employer to discriminate against any of his employees or any labor organization to discriminate against any member thereof because she has made a charge,testified,assisted,or participated in any manner in an investigation,proceeding,or hearing under title vii.a.under the massachusetts employment discrimination statute,no person,employer,or labor organization may discharge,expel or otherwise discriminate against any person because she has filed a complaint,testified or assisted in any proceeding covered by the statute.laws ch.further,no person may coerce,intimidate,threaten,or interfere with another person in the exercise or enjoyment of any right granted or protected by the antidiscrimination statute.id.
all three provisions require dixon to provide evidence that she engaged in protected activity she suffered some materially adverse action and the adverse action was causally linked to her protected activity.mcdonough city of quincy,cir mole of,but what constitutes an adverse action differs slightly under each provision.for title vii retaliation provision,the adverse action must be one that could well dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination,whether or not the harm occurs in the workplace.burlington santa fe ry.white,d.as it has been interpreted to date by state courts,section of the massachusetts statute requires evidence that dixon suffered an adverse employment action under section,the adverse action is any action to coerce,intimidate,threaten,or interfere with the plaintiff.mole,at ritchie of state police.
both leary and the ibpo argue that dixon failed to establish her claims of retaliation because she did not offer evidence that she suffered an adverse action pertaining to her union membership as opposed to her employment the argument is incorrect both title vii and the massachusetts antidiscrimination statute cover retaliation claims against unions which cause harm in the workplace and outside of it.
while burlington northern and mole articulated the test for retaliation by an employer,we apply that test to dixon claim of retaliation by the union.this follows logically from the language of both the state and federal statutes.as explained in burlington northern,the language of title vii retaliation provision,unlike the discrimination provision,is not limited to workplace conditions it simply prohibits discriminating broadly against employees or union members in retaliation for their pursuit of discrimination claims.at.if an employer can effectively retaliate against an employee by taking actions not directly related to his employment or by causing him harm outside the workplace,then it follows that a union can effectively retaliate against a member in any context,including within the workplace.thorn amalgamated transit union,cir holding,prior to burlington northern,that any adverse action is sufficient to establish a retaliation claim against a union,including but not limited to adverse employment actions.section of the massachusetts statute likewise has no language limiting the coercive,intimidating,threatening,or interfering actions it prohibits to a particular context.
as for section,its more specific language to discharge,expel or otherwise discriminate against includes the catchall phrase or otherwise discriminate against,which should be read as applying as broadly as the similar language in title vii provision.bain city of springfield,massachusetts courts often look to title vii law in construing the state antidiscrimination statute.that section applies equally to individuals,who can neither discharge nor expel,also argues for a broad construction of the or otherwise discriminate clause.further,the state retaliation provisions are to be construed liberally.laws ch.if plaintiff has shown the necessary effect on her employment,she need not make a separate showing of an effect on her union membership 
the claims against the ibpo were brought under both state and federal law the in punitive damages assessed against the ibpo for retaliation exceeds title vii statutory cap for punitive and nonpecuniary compensatory damages.b.the massachusetts employment discrimination statute,however,does not limit punitive damages.laws ch,dartt.for the full amount of the jury verdict to be sustained,dixon must have presented sufficient evidence under the state law.further,the claims against leary were brought solely under state law.
dixon presented enough evidence to establish a claim against leary under section and against the ibpo under section of the massachusetts statute.dixon presented evidence that leary took out the tro against her the day after he found out he was the subject of an internal police department investigation that leary affidavit requesting the tro was only a few lines long that it was based on statements that dixon claimed she never made that leary had not bothered to appear before the court to extend the tro after the initial fifteen days of its coverage expired that as a foreseeable result of the tro,the police department suspended dixon and confiscated her weapon and that dixon had subsequent difficulty on the job as a result of having a tro on her record.there was clearly sufficient evidence for a jury to determine that leary retaliated against dixon by causing her to suffer a materially adverse employment action as required by section.
turning to the compensatory and punitive damages retaliation verdict against the ibpo,the ibpo argues that because the jury found that dixon had not met her burden of showing that lyons defamed her,the retaliation claim against the union must be vacated.specifically,it argues that the comments made by lyons on his television show can not be used to prove retaliation.the argument fails for many reasons.the basis for the jury defamation verdict is unknown.it may have held,on the defamation claim,that the statements were defamatory but that lyons did not act with the requisite degree of malice.to the extent the union is arguing that this speech can not support a retaliation claim,the argument is wrong.
in outlawing retaliation,congress and the massachusetts legislature prohibited a type of conduct that can,and often does,include speech.i t has never been deemed an abridgement of freedom of speech or press to make a course of conduct illegal merely because the conduct was in part initiated,evidenced,or carried out by means of language,either spoken,written,or printed.ohralik ohio state bar ass n,d quoting giboney empire storage ice.internal quotation marks omitted see also city of paul,d w ords can in some circumstances violate laws directed not against speech but against conduct.nlrb gissel packing,d finding no first amendment protection,in the context of the national labor relations act,for employer comments if those comments constitute a threat of retaliation based on misrepresentation and coercion.
courts have often deemed acts by employers and unions that involved speech to be discriminatory or retaliatory.see,eliserio united steelworkers,local,cir dissemination of no rat stickers by union official found discriminatory hashimoto dalton,cir dissemination of unfavorable job reference found retaliatory paxton union bank,cir intensive interrogation of employee over filing of eeoc charge found retaliatory.indeed,the idea that employers can be held liable for speech such as the use of racial or sexual epithets is inseparable from the very purpose of antidiscrimination statutes.see,dowd united steelworkers,local,cir finding racial slurs issued via intercom announcements,derogatory tee shirts,and graffiti directed against black employees who crossed picket line to be discriminatory durham life ins.evans,cir finding that sexist and sexual remarks constituted a hostile work environment.
there are limits on what speech can be proscribed as retaliatory,but those limits were not violated by the jury verdict.for example,the person or entity accused of discrimination must be allowed to defend himself or itself.bain,at what we most emphatically can not countenance as an instance of retaliation is the mayor response in the local newspaper to the charges against him so long as they were not defamatory.many of lyons comments about dixon were made after she had filed claims against the ibpo before the mcad.that does not provide a safe harbor,however,for any and all sort of speech in response.there is an important difference between defending oneself,on the one hand,and threatening,intimidating,or otherwise interfering with someone right to pursue a discrimination claim on the other.the supreme judicial court in bain,for example,upheld a jury verdict under section based on the mayor order to get rid of the plaintiff an intermediary in turn had told the plaintiff that the mayor wanted her out of his administration.id.at.in the court view,this statement was a threat or intimidation meant to prevent the plaintiff from bringing her claim.id.at.
lyons did not limit his comments to defending the ibpo or the conduct of its other members.instead he turned on dixon,describing her as unfit for her job guess where they have that girl working and she admits,admits,mind you,to the old four letter word.course,i would dare use it.and she,she is working in a school with children.god forbid.he repeatedly insinuated that dixon would pay a cost for pressing her discrimination claims for example,he argued that dixon was the only officer who should be suspended and closed one segment of his show by warning,that girl who made these fabrications,she in trouble,she in trouble,she in trouble.a jury could reasonably find that such statements,coming from the president of the national union,constituted threats and intimidation that objectively could deter someone in dixon position from pressing her claims,or that those statements interfered with dixon ability to do so by encouraging her colleagues to stand against her.
discrimination claims 
the local concedes that the boston trip was a event but argues that it can not be held liable for what occurred on the bus because flynn and the local did not supervise or control the officers on the trip.to the contrary,there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find the local liable.
the trip was not just it was organized and executed at every step as a union activity.lyons,as president of the ibpo,asked flynn,as president of the local,to organize a union contingent to support gubernatorial candidate paul cellucci,whom the union had endorsed,at the boston rally.the trip began and ended at the local union hall.the union paid for the bus,with flynn himself handing the check to the driver and explaining to her the evening plans.the driver,in turn,believed flynn to be in charge and acted on that belief.flynn used the bus microphone to give the officers instructions on what they were to do at the rally.he did not use the same microphone to intervene when things got out of hand on the return bus trip.when they arrived at the rally,flynn coordinated with the ibpo and other local branches,and the officers marched with union banners.the dinner was organized and paid for by the ibpo,and flynn put rounds of drinks on the local credit card.when things got heated that evening,the other officers yelled at dixon and kumm that this is a union trip and that o nly union members belong on this bus.on the trip from anthony to foley,flynn kicked a guest off the bus because he was acting rudely and inappropriately towards the bus driver.he was also aware of how volatile the situation on the bus had become later that evening,encouraging kumm to get off the bus before a donnybrook broke out.it is clear that the police officers were at the rally as representatives of the union and that flynn was in charge of this union event as president of the local,and there was also evidence that flynn could exercise his authority when he chose to do so.
the local cites eeoc pipefitters ass local union,cir,for the proposition that unions do not have an affirmative duty to prevent workplace discrimination.id.at.whether or not that proposition is correct is irrelevant here.this is a case of discrimination within the union,by union members including members of the local executive board,under the supervision and acquiescence of the local president.see eliserio,at a union has no affirmative duty under title vii to investigate and take steps to remedy employer discrimination but a union may be held liable under title vii if the union itself instigated or actively supported the discriminatory acts.citing and quoting thorn,at woods graphic commc ns,cir noting that,in interpreting a state statute in light of title vii,w e see no reason why a union should not be equally liable compared to employers for the union acts of harassment against its own members see also dowd,at finding a union liable under title vii where the harassment in the workplace was directly connected to a activity and at least one union steward participated in the harassment,others stood silently by as it occurred,and the union president exhibited discriminatory animus.
the local seems to argue that the police dep
