defendant,springfield terminal railway company springfield,appeals from a jury verdict awarding punitive damages to the plaintiff,jason worcester,under the whistleblower provisions of the federal railroad safety act the frsa.springfield argues that the district court gave the jury an incorrect instruction as to the standard for awarding punitive damages.we affirm.
on october,springfield reported a leak of hydraulic fluid to the maine department of environmental protection.at that time,the plaintiff,worcester,was an employee of springfield.he became involved in a dispute with his supervisor about the safety implications of cleaning up the spill and was eventually fired.he then brought suit against springfield under the frsa whistleblower protection provision.following the trial,the jury awarded the plaintiff in compensatory damages and an additional in punitive damages.this appeal followed.
we begin with worcester challenge to our appellate jurisdiction,which depends on worcester contention that springfield failed to timely file its notice of appeal.generally,a notice of appeal must be filed within days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from.fed.app.a a.here,the notice was filed much later.federal rule of appellate procedure a a provides,however,that i f a party timely files a motion for a new trial,the time to file an appeal runs for all parties from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion.and the parties agree that springfield timely filed a motion for a new trial.the question,therefore,is whether that motion tolled the clock for filing the notice of appeal.
worcester contends that the clock was not tolled because there was no order disposing of that new trial motion.but we do not agree.the judgment in this case was entered on june.on july,springfield filed a timely rule motion for a new trial.the plaintiff filed a response,and,on august,the district court held a telephone conference with both parties regarding the motion for a new trial.on that call,in light of the plaintiff response,springfield withdrew its motion for a new trial,at which point the following colloquy occurred 
the court all right.so i going to just take that as a verbal motion to withdraw that motion,and we will just declare it withdrawn,from our perspective,unless you wanted to file something,porter.
porter no,that fine,your honor.
the court all right.so then so that off the table,then,we do have to worry about that anymore.and is that the only pending motion in the case,then all right.
wietzke yes,your honor.
porter yes,your honor.
the court okay.so that decided as of today,and clocks are running.
then,that same day,an electronic entry was entered on the docket noting oral withdrawal of motion for new trial by springfield terminal railway company.
the district court verbal ruling on the motion to withdraw left no pending motions remaining before the district court,and as the district court stated began the clock running on the time to appeal.thus,there was an order disposing of the motion,and so the clock for filing the notice of appeal was tolled.see de león marcos,cir.t he district court order acknowledging the withdrawal of de leon rule motion is sufficient for purposes of rule a a.united states rodríguez,cir.t he filing of the motion for reconsideration stayed the running of the time for appeal under federal rule of appellate procedure b,even though the motion was withdrawn.brae,coopers lybrand,cir.a n order was issued disposing of the rule motion.the district judge referred to the motion and declared that it had been withdrawn.see also black law dictionary ed.an order is the mandate or determination of the court upon some subsidiary or collateral matter arising in an action quoting henry campbell black,a treatise on the law of judgments,at ed.
in arguing to the contrary,worcester relies on vanderwerf smithkline beecham,cir.but in that case,the appellants filed their notice of appeal on the same day that they filed a notice of withdrawal and thus before the district court had a chance to respond in any way to the notice of withdrawal.see id.at.in this case,by contrast,the withdrawal of the motion for a new trial occurred with the involvement of the district court,which specifically stated that it was treating the party statements as a verbal motion to withdraw that motion,granted that verbal motion to withdraw,and noted the withdrawal of the new trial motion on the docket.as a result,springfield notice of appeal was timely,and our jurisdiction over this appeal is proper.
we turn now to the substance of the appeal.springfield challenges the instruction that the district court gave to the jury regarding punitive damages.we review de novo preserved claims of legal error in jury instructions.drumgold callahan,cir.quoting uphoff figueroa alejandro,cir.
the frsa whistleblower provision explicitly provides for punitive damages.e.it does not specify,however,the standard for awarding punitive damages.the district court instructed the jury that it could award punitive damages if it found that springfield acted,w ith malice or ill will or with knowledge that its actions violated federal law or with reckless disregard or callous indifference to the risk that its actions violated federal law emphasis added.the district court took this standard from smith wade.there,the supreme court looked to general common law principles rather than the standard for awarding punitive damages adopted by any particular state in determining that this standard is the appropriate one for awarding punitive damages under.see id.
springfield argued below,as it argues here,that the district court was wrong to adopt the standard that the court approved in smith.springfield contends that the district court should have instructed the jury to award punitive damages on the basis of the maine standard for punitive damages,as this suit is being brought in federal district court in maine.and,accordingly,springfield contends,the district court should have instructed the jury that it could award punitive damages only if it determined that that springfield acted with malice,which springfield contends is the standard for punitive damages under maine state law.see tuttle raymond,me.
even assuming springfield is right about maine state law a proposition that the plaintiff disputes,its argument still fails.the department of labor is the federal agency charged with administering the frsa.see d.the department administrative review board has interpreted the frsa standard for awarding punitive damages to be the same as the smith standard.petersen union pac,arb case,wl,at,see also bnsf ry.dep t of labor,cir.and while springfield argues that this administrative interpretation of the frsa is not entitled to deference under chevron natural resources defense council,we still find the administrative review board interpretation persuasive.grosso surface transp,cir.see also skidmore swift.
congress made clear that a primary purpose of the frsa was that l aws,regulations,and orders related to railroad safety shall be nationally uniform to the extent practicable.that goal is hardly advanced by as springfield argues we should adopting in each individual case the punitive damages standard used by the particular state in which an frsa action arises.rather,in order to effectuate congress evident preference for uniform ity in the law s,regulations,and orders related to railroad safety,it makes sense to apply a single standard throughout the country.id.
additionally,the reasons that the court gave in smith for adopting the reckless disregard standard apply equally well here.in smith,the supreme court determined that,at common law,punitive damages in tort cases may be awarded not only for actual intent to injure or evil motive,but also for recklessness,serious indifference to or disregard for the rights of others,or even gross negligence.at.and the court concluded that nothing about the policies and purposes of itself require a departure from the rules of tort common law.id.
the same is true regarding the frsa,and springfield makes no argument that if we were to use a single national standard,
