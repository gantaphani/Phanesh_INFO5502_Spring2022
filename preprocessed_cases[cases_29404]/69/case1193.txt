appellant theodore john kaczynski kaczynski,also known as the unabomber,appeals the district court order approving the plan the plan developed,following an earlier remand by this court,to sell or to dispose of kaczynski personal property that was seized during the underlying criminal investigation into his bombings.kaczynski contends the restitution lien statute,is facially unconstitutional and violates the first amendment the plan violates the first amendment as applied by impinging his freedom of expression and restricting information from the public and the plan impermissibly allows credit bids from the victims and allows destruction of materials instead of returning them to his designee.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court order approving the plan.
facts and procedural history 
as is well known,kaczynski was arrested in and charged with numerous counts involving the transportation or mailing of explosives with the intent to kill,resulting in the death of three people and injuries to nine others.united states kaczynski,cir kaczynski i.he eventually pled guilty and was sentenced to four consecutive life sentences plus years imprisonment.he was also ordered to pay in restitution to four named victims the named victims.he later unsuccessfully tried to vacate his conviction pursuant to.id.at.
when investigating kacyznski crimes,government agents searched kaczynski montana cabin and seized various items of his personal property for use as evidence.the seized property included papers,books,kaczynski writings,guns,materials,and instructions on making bombs using items.in june,kaczynski attempted to regain this personal property.he filed a motion requesting the return of any property that had not been sold within a reasonable period of time.the magistrate judge recommended that the government sell any marketable property to pay restitution and return all other items to kaczynski.rejecting this recommendation,the district court denied kaczynski motion because the judgment lien gave the government a superior ownership interest in kaczynski personal property.united states kaczynski,d,kaczynski ii.the district court also concluded that kaczynski property was essentially worthless because the property had to be valued prior to his criminal celebrity status to prevent kaczynski from profiting from his crimes.id.at.
kaczynski appealed,and we held the government has a cognizable ownership claim in the property but only if that property is needed to satisfy the terms of the restitution order.united states kaczynski,cir kaczynski iii quoting united states mills,cir internal quotations omitted.we noted that kaczynski property may not be worthless because any increase in the property value as a result of his notoriety would benefit the victims by increasing the amount of money available for restitution.id.at.concerned about the lack of representation for the victims and their families,we appointed pro bono counsel to serve as amicus curiae to protect their interests in the enforcement of the restitution order.id.at we remanded the matter to the district court to give a timely and adequate opportunity for the government to present,and kaczynski and pro bono amicus to comment upon,a commercially reasonable plan to dispose of the property at issue,the principal purpose of which shall be to maximize monetary return to the victims and their families.id.
in july,the government submitted a plan to the district court that provided for the sale or disposal of kaczynski personal property.united states kaczynski,d kaczynski iv.specifically,the government would conduct a internet sale of kaczynski seized property,including personal items,books owned by kaczynski,and his own writings.at the named victims request,the writings would be redacted to exclude all information that could be used to identify the actual and intended victims and families.in addition,the government proposed that kaczynski weapons be sold to the named victims for a credit bid of.finally,the government would dispose of the instructions and materials for making bombs.id.at.
over kaczynski objections to various aspects of the plan,the district court approved the government plan with the exception that the instructions,including recipes and diagrams for making a bomb,were to be returned to kaczynski designated recipient id.at.kaczynski timely appealed.kaczynski was initially represented by counsel on appeal,but later sought and obtained permission to represent himself.

discussion 
first amendment facial challengea.
for the first time on appeal,kaczynski challenges the facial validity of,asserting that the restitution lien statute is unconstitutional to the extent that it authorizes the government to deprive a convict of his first amendment property in general,a party who does not raise an issue before the trial court is prevented from doing so on appeal.united states de salvo,cir.we may,in our discretion,hear an issue for the first time on appeal when review is necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice or to preserve the integrity of the judicial process,when a change in law raises a new issue while an appeal is pending,and when the issue is purely one of law.jovanovich united states,cir declining to hear issues raised by the government for the first time on appeal because the issues did not fall within one of these three exceptions.
although kaczynski characterizes his claim as a purely facial legal challenge,on closer examination it appears that in large part what he seeks is an advisory opinion that would be invalid if applied to him in particular ways in the future.reacting to some comments by the government about the scope of the restitution lien,kaczynski seems concerned about potential attempts to seize and sell any writing that he creates or receives from others after his conviction,or copyrights to his literary works.the current plan,however,is strictly limited to the physical originals of the documents previously seized from kaczynski cabin.thus kaczynski is really asking us to issue a speculative ruling that would prohibit the government from taking a possible future action.
the constitution empowers federal courts to hear actual cases and not render advisory opinions.see united public workers mitchell.aetna life ins.haworth.see also hillblom united states,cir case not justiciable because injury allegations based upon future actions congress might take to reduce government authority in the northern mariana islands.kaczynski can not,therefore,bring a justiciable claim at the present time based upon the possible future actions of the government.thus,we will consider kaczynski arguments only to the extent they constitute true facial challenges to.we need not and,indeed,can not consider the validity of specific applications of the statute which have yet to occur.
facial validity 
section is invalid under the first amendment if it is unconstitutional in every conceivable application or it seeks to prohibit such a broad range of protected conduct that it is unconstitutionally overbroad.members of city council of city of los angeles taxpayers for vincent,d.
every conceivable application 
a facial challenge to a statute is the most difficult challenge to mount successfully,since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the statute would be valid.united states salerno,d.while some members of the court have criticized the salerno formulation,all agree that a facial challenge must fail where the statute has a plainly legitimate sweep.washington state grange washington state republican party,d citations omitted.in particular,a generally applicable statute is not facially invalid unless the statute can never be applied in a constitutional manner.lanier city of woodburn,cir drug testing policy not facially invalid because the challenger failed to provide a reason why the policy could not be constitutionally applied to applicants for certain types of jobs.
the restitution lien statute assists the government in collecting unpaid restitution orders that have been imposed on those convicted of federal crimes.the statute provides that a lien arises automatically upon entry of judgment against these individuals and may be enforced against all property and property rights,regardless of the nature of the property.the statute is thus generally applied to all individuals subject to restitution orders,is not dependent upon the discretion of any government officials,and does not vary according to the type of property that is owned by these individuals because a restitution lien,like any other tax lien,can be constitutionally applied in many cases,kaczynski facial challenge must fail.
kaczynski urges this court to consider the facial validity of the statute only as it applies to his first amendment property he argues that the first amendment aspect of can be severed from the rest of the statute and held unconstitutional.this argument misunderstands the concept of severance,and conflates and facial challenges.a court does not sever a statute prior to determining whether it is facially valid.rather,a court will sever a statute when a portion of it is found unconstitutional and that portion can be excised from the statute without altering the statute intended purpose.see,united states jackson,d provision authorizing the death penalty severable from the federal kidnaping act because i ts elimination in no way alters the substantive reach of the statute and leaves completely unchanged its basic operation.in addition,a facially invalid or overbroad statute can not be severed unless it is susceptible to a narrowing construction using the terms contained within it.see erznoznik city of jacksonville,d.section is simply not subject to the type of division kaczynski urges 
moreover,despite describing it as a facial challenge,what kaczynski really claims is that might be unconstitutional if applied to first amendment property,and thus would not be constitutional in every situation.as we recently noted when another plaintiff attempted a similar facial challenge,this formulation would turn salerno on its head.lanier,at.kaczynski challenge likewise fails.
overbreadth 
a statute is facially overbroad when its application to protected speech is substantial,not only in an absolute sense,but also relative to the scope of the law plainly legitimate applications.humanitarian law project mukasey,cir quoting virginia hicks,d.because the overbreadth must be substantial,the mere fact that one can conceive of some impermissible applications of a statute is not sufficient to render it susceptible to an overbreadth challenge.taxpayers for vincent,at.in addition,heightened scrutiny is applied to generally applicable statutes only when they regulate conduct that has a significant expressive element or when the statutes have the inevitable effect of singling out those engaged in expressive activity.arcara cloud books,d enforcement of a public health regulation of general application did not implicate the first amendment even though it resulted in the closure of an adult book store.
the restitution lien statute is a generally applicable statute that places a lien on all property and property rights of individuals subject to a restitution order.the statute does not burden individuals engaged in first amendment activities any more than it burdens those engaged in other types of activities.the primary purpose of is to compel payment of restitution and not to prohibit any type of speech or expressive conduct.because it is not directed at any expressive activity and has only an incidental effect on such activity,is not constitutionally overbroad.see,nordyke king,cir ordinance forbidding possession of a gun at a specific location not unconstitutional because this conduct did not commonly convey any expressive content roulette city of seattle,cir ordinance prohibiting sitting or lying on a sidewalk not facially invalid because lying or sitting are not integral to,or commonly associated with,expression.
accordingly,is facially valid because it is not unconstitutional in all of its applications and is not overbroad 
ii.first amendment challenge 
kaczynski further argues that the district court order violates his first amendment rights with respect to the sale of his personal writings.an challenge contends that the law is unconstitutional as applied to the litigant particular speech activity,even though the law may be capable of valid application to others.foti city of menlo park,cir.as discussed above,the restitution lien statute is a generally applicable law that has at most an incidental effect on first amendment issues.its application to protected speech will be upheld if the regulation furthers an important or substantial governmental interest if the interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression and if the incidental restriction is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.united states,d see also barnes glen theatre,d general indecency law upheld even though it limited expression of completely nude dancing.
before delving into kaczynski specific arguments,it is important to note that most of his challenges stem from an inaccurate he does not have and can not obtain a complete set of copies of the underlying materials that will be sold.this arises from kaczynski interpretation of the district court order,which he views as requiring him to specifically identify the pages of which he has not yet received copies a task he claims is impossible because he can not remember everything he has written.the district court order,however,simply places an affirmative obligation on the government to provide a full set of legible copies to kaczynski or his representative the government shall provide kaczynski,though sic his designated recipient,with any page kaczynski has not already received in readable form.kaczynski iv,d at.we are confident that the district court can and will ensure compliance with this order prior to any sale of kaczynski documents 
right to communicate impaired without originals 
kaczynski argues that the sale of his original writings violates the first amendment.kaczynski claims that his right to communicate the information contained in the papers will be impaired because it will be impossible to establish the authenticity of the photocopies and they will be of little value.
kaczynski argument essentially reveals its own can still communicate any ideas contained in the documents without the originals,the originals are just worth more.he does not explain how his freedom of speech or expression is at all curtailed by receiving copies of his documents or having copies delivered to his designee.moreover,he admitted below and in his opening brief that receiving a full set of copies was a less restrictive alternative that would provide him with an alternative channel for communicating his ideas.
the first amendment protects ideas and the freedom to express them.see,roth united states,d the first amendment was fashioned to assure unfettered interchange of ideas thomas collins.free trade in ideas includes opportunity to persuade thornhill alabama.discussing historical importance of freedom of discussion.kaczynski cites no authority for the proposition that the original pieces of paper on which his ideas were written are independently deserving of constitutional protection.nixon warner commc ns,d no first amendment right to physical originals of audio tapes where reporters received transcripts of tapes and could communicate contents to public if desired.kaczynski offers instead practical,forensic considerations for why the originals are more valuable,but no explanation as to how his right to free speech or freedom of expression is impinged by their sale we therefore reject his argument that the sale of the originals violates the first amendment.
the approved plan permits the government to redact from the originals the names of victims and their families,names of
