in its,coregis argues paul should pay all of asa defense costs.coregis also argues the district court unreasonably reduced asa recoverable defense costs,and erred in denying coregis request for attorneys fees against paul.asa joins coregis in arguing the district court should have awarded prejudgment interest.we reverse the district court order denying prejudgment interest,and affirm in all other respects.
we briefly summarize the background of this insurance coverage dispute here,and refer the reader to the first of three published district court decisions for a more detailed account of this extended litigation.see am.simmental ass coregis ins,d,asa i.
simmental is a breed of cattle.asa is a association that registers and promotes simmental cattle.in april,a group of simmental breeders blue dane sued asa alleging it improperly designated certain bulls as fullblood simmentals,improperly marketed the bulls,and falsely advertised the bulls in the register,asa official publication.blue dane alleged asa activities decreased the value of their true fullblood simmentals.asa tendered defense of the blue dane suit to paul,its commercial general liability cgl carrier.in may,paul refused to defend.
blue dane original complaint stated violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,and the sherman act,a.as the suit progressed,amended complaints added a claim under the lanham act,and state law negligence claims.the second amended complaint alleged several claims pertinent to the insurance coverage dispute asa engaged in advertisement,promotion,and representation of the disputed bulls as fullbloods asa statements were false because the bulls had angus blood asa falsely advertised to simmental breeders who were or could be deceived and asa misrepresentations were likely to affect the purchasing decisions of those simmental breeders and impaired blue dane ability to compete,causing lost customers and sales.
asa tendered the second amended complaint to paul in april.paul again refused to defend in august.in june,asa tendered a third amended complaint containing the same causes of action as the second amended complaint.after paul third refusal in october,asa turned to coregis,its e o carrier.pursuant to its policy,coregis agreed to indemnify asa for defense costs arising from the blue dane suit,but indicated coregis had no obligation to actually defend asa in the suit.
in january,the blue dane litigation was tried.asa successfully defended itself,obtaining judgment as a matter of law.blue dane appealed and we affirmed.blue dane simmental am.simmental ass n,cir.asa incurred roughly million in fees and costs defending itself.
in october,asa commenced the present suit against coregis to recover the fees and costs which coregis had not yet paid.coregis paul,seeking a declaration that paul had the duty to defend asa in the blue dane litigation.coregis sought contribution,indemnity,or equitable subrogation from paul for the full amount coregis had paid asa.asa also amended its complaint to add a direct claim against paul.
the parties brought for summary judgment on the duty to defend issue.applying montana law the district court granted the motions of coregis and asa,concluding paul had a duty to defend because the blue dane allegations fell within paul coverage for advertising injury under the unauthorized taking and infringement clauses of the policy.see asa i,d at.
two months later,paul renewed its motion for summary judgment.the motion raised,for the first time,a defense based on the policy false material exclusion and cited our decision in callas,travelers indem,cir.the district court denied the motion as untimely,and also noted the callas opinion was not substantively persuasive.am.simmental ass coregis ins,asa ii.

paul duty to defend 
the cgl policy issued by paul provided coverage for advertising injury.advertising injury was defined in relevant part as injury caused by any of the following offenses that result from the advertising of your products or work unauthorized taking of advertising ideas or style of doing business or infringement of copyright,title or slogan.the policy did not further define unauthorized taking of advertising ideas,infringement,or title,the terms principally at issue in this appeal.therefore,those terms must be understood in their plain and ordinary meaning under montana law,and can not be given a technical meaning.wendell state farm mut.auto.ins.
paul argues the unauthorized taking of advertising ideas and infringement clauses do not apply to the allegations contained in the blue dane complaints.we disagree.the plain and ordinary meaning of advertising idea generally encompasses an idea for calling public attention to a product or business,especially by proclaiming desirable qualities so as to increase sales or patronage.advance watch,kemper nat.ins,cir.blue dane used the word fullblood in a manner that falls within the ordinary meaning of an advertising idea.blue dane used the term fullblood to call attention to its simmental cattle,and all parties agree that fullblood was a desirable quality in simmental cattle.
in addition,the word fullblood would be commonly understood to be a title.blue dane accused asa of wrongfully using the fullblood title to advertise bulls,thereby causing blue dane injury.thus,under a plain and ordinary meaning analysis,blue dane alleged an unauthorized taking of blue dane advertising idea,which infringed upon blue dane use of the term fullblood and caused injury.
paul further contends blue dane complaints against asa did not trigger a duty to defend because the advertising offenses did not result from the advertising of asa products or work.paul argues the advertised bulls were not asa products or work,but the products or work of tom risinger,the bulls owner.we disagree.the blue dane complaints alleged tom risinger was at all relevant times an officer and director of asa.blue dane did not distinguish between actions taken by risinger in his official capacity,and those taken in his personal capacity.because the paul policy provided coverage for asa executive officers and directors,paul had an obligation to defend the allegations against risinger.
in addition,the policy defined your products as goods or products that others using your name have sold.the blue dane complaints alleged risinger sold goods or products using asa name,the asa designation of fullblood.thus,paul should have defended even if a valid distinction could be made between risinger products and asa products.
paul argues some courts have construed the dispositive terms in this policy more narrowly than did the district court.but montana follows the rule that a split of authority from courts
