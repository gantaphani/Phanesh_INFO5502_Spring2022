the trial court denied a slapp motion brought by kcop to strike lieberman complaint,concluding that lieberman had presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate a violation of section.kcop appeals denial of the motion,an appealable order.code civ,subd.j.we agree with the trial court that sufficient evidence was presented to establish a prima facie claim for statutory damages pursuant to section and that the motion was properly denied.but we caution that statutory damages recoverable resulting from the surreptitious recordings are not tantamount to damages resulting from the kcop broadcast.
background 
a violation of section is committed by anyone who intentionally and without the consent of all parties to a confidential communication,by means of any electronic amplifying or recording device,eavesdrops upon or records the confidential communication,whether the communication is carried on among the parties in the presence of one another or by means of a telegraph,telephone,or other device,except a radio.
on may,lieberman,filed a verified complaint alleging that appellant kcop violated section in two separate incidents.it alleges that lieberman was a licensed physician at the time of the incidents,and on each occasion,an agent or employee of kcop made an appointment to be seen by lieberman at his medical clinic for treatment of a medical condition.one,jessica uribe,was seen on may,and the other,john halecky,was seen sometime prior to that date.on each occasion,the employee was accompanied from the waiting room of the clinic into lieberman private office by a companion who was not introduced to lieberman.the door was shut behind them,leaving halecky and his companion on the one occasion,and uribe and her companion on the other,alone with lieberman.lieberman office was equipped as an examining room in which he routinely conducted medical examinations.although lieberman had never recorded patient examinations there,and did not expect examinations to be recorded by the patient,the two companions secretly recorded his private consultation with uribe and halecky on both audiotape and videotape,without lieberman knowledge or consent.
the complaint also alleges that portions of the secret tapes were broadcast on kcop evening television news program on may,during a segment entitled,caught in the act,in which it was asserted that lieberman prescribed vicodin,a controlled substance,without proper medical examinations,and in which lieberman was labeled a drug dealer and candy doctor.it is further alleged that as a result of the broadcast,lieberman was ostracized from his on call association and later forced to resign from it,depriving him of nearly hmo patients.in addition,many pharmacies refused to fill any of his prescriptions,and his reputation was so permanently tainted by the broadcast that he lost the ability to earn income as a consultant or an expert in litigation.also,because of the broadcast,lieberman malpractice insurer notified him that it did not intend to renew his policy,vincent medical center denied his application for reappointment to its medical staff,and the california medical board launched an investigation,culminating in a police raid of lieberman clinic in full view of his patients sitting in the waiting room.
lieberman allowed his medical license to expire on november,because,it is alleged,the events following the broadcast caused him so much stress that he could no longer earn a living as a physician,and he was forced to close his practice.
the allegations of the complaint are set forth in a single count,entitled,violation of penal code section.the complaint seeks damages in the statutory amount set out in section,see post,at et,as well as actual damages alleged to be lost income and emotional distress.
on july,kcop filed a special motion to strike the complaint,or a slapp motion,pursuant to code of civil procedure section the motion asserted that section should not be applicable because lieberman had no expectation of privacy with the extra person involved in each of the consultations.additionally,citing freedom of the press under the first amendment,it argued that section should not apply to its newsgathering activities.it also urged that damages resulting from the broadcast must be afforded first amendment protection and that lieberman could not demonstrate that the damages alleged were caused by kcop.
lieberman opposed the motion with a declaration which supported the substance of the allegations of the complaint.additionally,he stated that uribe companion appeared to be familiar with her and halecky companion appeared to be acquainted with him,and he assumed each was the significant other of either uribe or halecky.with regard to each incident he stated all parties in the office were present with the knowledge and desire of uribe halecky,and no person who was not present in the office could overhear any of the discussions that took place therein.
the trial court denied the special motion to strike on august,finding that the recorded transaction was a confidential communication within the context of section,despite the presence of the companions.kcop filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
at the outset we emphasize that lieberman has asserted only one cause of action in his complaint violation of penal code section.he has not alleged claims for defamation or invasion of privacy resulting from the broadcast.
code of civil procedure section,subdivision b provides a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.
on appeal from an order granting or denying a motion pursuant to section,the appellate court engages in a process,determining first,whether the defendant made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising out of acts done in furtherance of the defendant exercise of a right to petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,as defined in the statute and second,whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d,subd.b.we independently determine whether a cause of action is based upon activity protected under the statute,and if so,whether the plaintiff has established a reasonable probability of prevailing.governor gray davis com.american taxpayers alliance th,d.in doing so,we consider the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based,subd.b equilon enterprises consumer cause,supra,cal th at,d.
we turn to the first question of whether lieberman complaint qualifies for treatment under section.
subdivision e of that section includes four separate categories of acts which qualify for treatment under the section.the first two categories pertain to statements made in connection with proceedings before or in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law.the third category identifies matters of public interest addressed in circumstances traditionally protected by the right to freedom of speech,statements made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue o
