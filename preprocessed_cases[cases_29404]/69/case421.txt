in,sabic filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the district of new jersey on behalf of its and exxonmobil subsidiary,kemya alleging that exxonmobil used technology developed for kemya to obtain the patents in breach of its service agreement with kemya.sabic sought a declaratory judgment that kemya owns the patents and an injunction directing exxonmobil to turn over legal title to kemya.
exxonmobil filed several counterclaims,and sought,inter alia,a declaratory judgment of its ownership rights in the patent.the fourth of these counterclaims,filed derivatively on kemya behalf,accused sabic of breaching its fiduciary duty to kemya by encouraging sabic affiliates including one called sharq to practice the scm t process the fourth amended counterclaim.
in february,sabic moved to dismiss the fourth amended counterclaim.exxonmobil agreed to the dismissal in exchange for sabic promise that its affiliates would not practice the scm t process while the litigation was pending.on march,the parties entered into a stipulation that neither sabic,sharq nor any other sabic affiliate other than kemya will use or practice scm t until the ownership rights thereto are established and the owner expressly authorizes such use the march stipulation.
the parties tendered the march stipulation to the district court on march.the district court wrote so ordered on the march stipulation and later entered it as a court order on april,the april order.
in the summer of,sabic affiliate,sharq,began operating reactors above weight percent condensed.upon learning of this,sabic moved the district court to clarify the march stipulation the motion to clarify by confirming that it did not prohibit sharq operations because sharq had received permission to perform them as the beneficiary of agreements between exxonmobil and another party.
while sabic motion to clarify was pending,exxonmobil filed a motion to dismiss sabic claims the motion to dismiss,alleging that sabic violated the april order by allowing sharq to practice scm sabic opposed the motion to dismiss by urging the district court to confirm its interpretation of the march stipulation that a sabic affiliate did not practice scm t by operating above weight percent condensed if it was not also practicing the second element of either patent either by maintaining a specific ratio or a specific z function.

jurisdiction 
as threshold matters,exxonmobil challenges our appellate jurisdiction and the timeliness of sabic appeal.we conclude that our appellate jurisdiction is proper under a because the june order is effectively an injunction.and we conclude that sabic appeal was timely because it was filed within the day appellate window that began with the issuance of the june order.
a.we have appellate jurisdiction under a.
as the june order is an interlocutory decision of the district court,its appealability is governed by.section a provides appellate jurisdiction over interlocutory orders granting,continuing,modifying,refusing or dissolving injunctions,or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions.thus,our appellate jurisdiction is proper under a if the june order is an injunction.
an order need not have the literal characterization of an injunction for a to apply,as long as it has the same practical effect.hershey foods hershey creamery,cir.we have previously defined an injunctive order as one that is directed to a party,enforceable by contempt,and designed to accord or protect some or all of the substantive relief sought by a complaint in more than a temporary fashion.cohen bd.of trs.of the of med.dentistry of,cir en banc quoting wright,miller cooper,et,federal practice and procedure see also hershey foods,at i n order to be an injunction for purposes of a,the order must grant part of the relief requested by the claimant and must be immediately enforceable by contempt.in contrast,o rders that in no way touch on the merits of the claim but only relate to pretrial procedures are not interlocutory injunctions within the meaning of a.hershey foods,at citing switzerland cheese ass horne market,d.
we conclude that the june order satisfies the three cohen factors for an effective injunction appealable under a.first,because the june order requires that sabic shall fully comply with the terms of the march stipulation,which are incorporated herein by reference,it is expressly directed to a party.second,by granting exxonmobil motion to enforce the march stipulation,the june order imposes an equitable remedy against sabic,whose noncompliance is punishable by contempt.see cohen,at see also harley davidson,morris,cir failure to obey a court judg
