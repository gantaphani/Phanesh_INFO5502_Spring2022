background 
in,charles doherty pleaded guilty to an information charging him with one count of conspiracy to launder money in violation of h and,et,based on his actions as president of rebar.the information charged that the conspiracy entailed three unlawful forged checks,theft concerning programs receiving federal funds,and mail fraud.as to uttering forged checks,doherty admitted during his plea colloquy that he forged checks from rebar payable to fictitious vendors,and provided those checks to joseph castello,a check casher who cashed the checks and transferred the cash,minus a fee,to doherty,who then used the cash to pay union employees off the books.at the plea proceedings,the government clarified further that doherty orchestrated the cashing of checks that constituted payments owed to rebar,some of which were payments for government contracts.the endorsements of the checks that were cashed were either forged or falsely completed,which resulted in creation of false banking records and thus were a basis for mail fraud doherty admitted that the monies he received were for purposes of paying certain employees in cash,thereby allowing them to avoid reporting a portion of their income to the irs,and the employees were paid the full amount that they would have gotten in cash.
based on doherty plea,local moved for restitution pursuant to the mvra and the cvra,contending that the collective bargaining agreements between itself and rebar required rebar to make payments to union funds and that by paying employees in cash,rebar had evaded that requirement.
at sentencing a debate ensued between the government and doherty regarding the dollar amount cognizable as laundered proceeds.significantly,in view of local claim,the government argued t he fact that doherty used the proceeds as expenses for running his construction company is not a part and parcel of the crimes committed,and were not expenses related to those crimes,and that doherty use of most of the laundered money to pay business expenses was a separate scheme,and therefore,irrelevant.doherty counsel,seeking to limit doherty exposure under the sentencing guidelines,see,countered that the gains attributable to doherty crime should exclude the amount paid as business expenses.counsel argued that doherty should not be held responsible for the total amount of the laundered checks because the money from the check cashing went to pay employees,and paying employees in cash was the whole raison of the scheme.
the parties and the court later agreed that all of the proceeds of the fraudulent check cashing scheme constituted proceeds under the money laundering statute,a,but,apparently by way of compromise,they agreed that the payments to employees under the federal contract scheme would not be counted as proceeds under.local was given an opportunity to allocute extensively concerning the impact of doherty behavior on the union.when the district court asked about restitution,the government cited the difficulty of calculating restitution generally,but did not argue against restitution of local on the ground that it was not a victim.doherty counsel explained to the district court that both the government and doherty had tried to ascertain the amount of restitution,but could not do so with reasonable certainty.given the complexities of determining any loss to local,the district court sentenced doherty to probation and a fine,but referred the issue of restitution to a magistrate judge.
before the magistrate judge,doherty argued for the first time in response to the restitution request that local was not a victim under the mvra because restitution was required only for conduct of which a defendant had been convicted.in support of his argument,doherty pointed out that in his cooperation agreement with the government,he agreed to plead guilty to one count of money laundering conspiracy,and in exchange,the government agreed not to bring any additional criminal charges for doherty activity involving his fraud in connection with defrauding union benefit funds.thus,adding a new argument to those he advanced at his sentencing proceeding,doherty contended that the conspiracy of which he was convicted did not include his ultimate plan to use the laundered cash to pay employees,nor did it include as an element any conduct that had a direct impact on local.
local replied that doherty had conceded its victim status by failing previously to object or challenge restitution on that ground.local also argued that although the specified unlawful acts of the conspiracy were the forged checks,the federal contract fraud,and the mail fraud,the acts of money laundering were completed by the financial transactions using the proceeds of those activities,cash payments to employees.
the magistrate judge recommended that local motion be denied,agreeing with doherty that his receipt of the cash from castello constituted the relevant financial transactions and completed the acts of money laundering.the magistrate judge went on to state that the common goal of the conspirators was to turn the forged checks into cash and that the use of the cash to pay the workers was not part of the scheme.quoting united states donaghy,d,the report and recommendation concluded that the mvra allows for recovery only for conduct that is part of the applicable scheme,conspiracy,or pattern of conduct that is the offense of conviction,and that local has not suffered direct and proximate harm from the offense of conviction as required for an award under the mvra.
local objected to the magistrate judge findings,arguing that the analysis conflated the unlawful activity element,forging a check,with the financial transaction and contending that the magistrate judge had ignored evidence in the record establishing that cash payments to employees was the goal of the conspiracy between doherty and castello.doherty testified at castello trial that he gave castello checks to get cash to pay doherty employees,and said at his plea hearing that he had cashed fraudulent checks for purposes of paying certain employees in cash.
the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation in its entirety,finding that local had not been directly and proximately harmed by doherty money laundering because the offense was complete at the moment castello handed the cash to doherty.the court agreed that restitution was not available under the mvra for harm caused by the actions of a single conspirator acting outside the conspiracy as part of a broader uncharged scheme.local filed a petition for mandamus in this court to challenge that adverse determination under the provisions of the cvra.see d.
in its petition for mandamus local concedes that the definitions of victim under both the cvra and mvra are coterminous,and it agrees with the district court determination that a person may be entitled to restitution only if he or she was directly and proximately harmed as a result of defendant doherty conspiracy to launder money.local argues that it is a victim of doherty specific offense of conviction,the money laundering conspiracy to which doherty pleaded guilty.it faults the district court application of the facts of the case to
