in this appeal,we consider the management of the waterways in arizona sonoran desert.this,of course,inevitably brings to mind the exchange between claude rains and humphrey bogart in casablanca warner,which aptly distills this dispute to its essence 
captain renault what in heaven name brought you to casablanca 
rick my health.i came to casablanca for the waters.
captain renault the waters what waters we in the desert.
rick i was misinformed.
in our case,it was not rick blaine,but the united states army corps of engineers that came to the desert for the waters.an aspiring desert developer,lone mountain,lone mountain,sought and obtained a clean water act cwa dredge and fill permit from the corps for the construction of a gated community near phoenix.the permit was required,and the corps jurisdiction invoked,because water courses through the washes and arroyos of the arid development site during periods of heavy rain.the desert washes are considered navigable waters,and therefore fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government.see a.
at some point,a environmental organization,save our sonoran sos,became aware of the project.it was not,shall we say,the beginning of a beautiful friendship.sos eventually filed this action against the corps and lone mountain,alleging violations of the national environmental policy act nepa and the cwa.the district court issued a preliminary injunction suspending development during the pendency of the litigation.save our sonoran,flowers,d.lone mountain appealed.we affirm.
at the center of this controversy is a parcel of undeveloped land the property,an alluvial fan containing a significant number of braided washes.the washes constitute approximately acres,which in fact constitute approximately of the site,but affect approximately of the area.though surrounded on all four sides by other development,the property is essentially unimproved and remains undeveloped desert,albeit not in pristine condition.the parcel was previously owned by the state of arizona,which decided not to retain it for park or other purposes and sold it for development,an action which was itself the subject of litigation.foster anable.the property was purchased from the state at a public auction by lone mountain predecessor for million.
lone mountain developed a plan to construct an upscale gated residential community consisting of homes.according to the plan,over half of the property would be maintained permanently as open space,including the bulk of the larger washes.
pursuant to the cwa,lone mountain applied for a section permit from the corps to fill in acres of natural waterways that flow through the property.the permit requested allowance of projects in the form of combined road and utility crossings,pad fill,as well as utility,remediation,drainage,and flood control measures.
in response to the application,the corps issued its environmental assessment and a finding of no significant impact,in which it made preliminary findings that the relevant scope of its inquiry was limited to the acres of jurisdictional waters,the immediately adjacent uplands directly affected by the dredge and fill projects,and the contiguous upstream and downstream washes that might be affected indirectly.within this area,the corps concluded that the dredge and fill projects would not significantly affect the environment,nor would they disturb the habitats of any endangered species.the corps determined that no environmental impact statement was necessary,and stated its intent to authorize lone mountain to build the projects.
the corps invited public comment on the permit,received requests for a public hearing,but declined to hold one.a variety of agencies and private interests responded by written correspondence.the united states environmental protection agency epa and the united states fish and wildlife service fws opposed the issuance of the permit and disagreed with the corps findings with respect to whether the site was a potentially suitable habitat for the cactus ferruginous pygmy owl,which is listed as an endangered species.the arizona game and fish department agreed with the corps findings.sos,a nonprofit group of citizens dedicated to the preservation of the sonoran desert,also made public comments about the proposed project.
the corps addressed the public comments,reiterated its preliminary findings,and issued the permit to lone mountain,subject to a few conditions.sos sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunctive relief against the corps and lone mountain.
the district court granted a temporary restraining order to sos and,after a hearing,the district court ordered preliminary injunctive relief.the district court concluded that there were serious questions on the merits regarding sos contention.the court emphasized that the development of the entire project depended upon the corps permit,concluding that the project could not go forward without permission from the corps for the separate and dispersed crossings.flowers,d at.though the washes cover only of the property,the court described that portion as critical to the whole but that runs through the entire acres the way capillaries run through tissue.it is difficult to deal with tissue without dealing with capillaries and difficult to deal with capillaries without dealing with tissue.so too here.id.after determining that there were serious questions on the merits,the district court went on to conclude that the balance of hardships tipped in favor of sos.
after sos was informed that lone mountain was continuing construction on the site,the requested clarification with respect to the scope of the injunction.after another hearing,the district court made clear that,in light of its previous factual findings,the status quo could be preserved only if lone mountain ceased any and all development on the site until a hearing on the merits could be held.
the corps elected not to appeal the district court orders.lone mountain,however,appealed both orders,and sos filed a as to the amount of the bond set by the district court.
lone mountain contends that sos lacks standing to bring this action.an organization may bring an action on behalf of its members if the individual members would have standing to sue the organization purpose relates to the interests being vindicated and the claims asserted do not require the participation of individual members.ecological rights found.pac.lumber,cir.the individual members have standing if they can demonstrate that an actual or threatened injury exists,which is fairly traceable to the challenged action,and that such injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.id.in addition to these constitutional requirements,a plaintiff bringing suit under the administrative procedure act for a violation of nepa must show that his alleged injury falls within the zone of interests that nepa was designed to protect.kootenai tribe of idaho veneman,cir citations omitted.
lone mountain does not dispute that sos has met the apa requirements or the latter two elements of article iii standing.it contends that sos failed to establish that any of its individual members would have standing to sue because no member has demonstrated actual injury,causation,or redressability.the injury in fact requirement in environmental cases is satisfied if an individual adequately shows that she has an aesthetic or recreational interest in a particular place,or animal,or plant species and that that interest is impaired by a defendant conduct.ecological rights,at.
here,sos tendered affidavits and presented evidence that its members owned land in close proximity to the property,and that the development would impair their recreational opportunities.see,id.at finding plaintiff established injury by averring longstanding recreational and aesthetic interests in place at issue,and that these interests were derogated due to concerns that defendant was discharging pollutants into creek northwest envtl.def.ctr.bonneville power,cir finding cognizable injury to plaintiffs based on affidavits stating enjoyment from fly fishing,sport fishing,and nature watching in river at issue.once a plaintiff has established an injury in fact,the causation and redressability standards under nepa are relaxed,such that a private owner alleged noncompliance with nepa is sufficient to meet these standing requirements.see cantrell city of long beach,cir w e have held that to establish redressability plaintiffs asserting procedural standing need not demonstrate that the ultimate outcome following proper procedures will benefit them.
the fact that this is a private development does not destroy standing.see,id.at rejecting navy argument that plaintiffs can only assert standing with respect to property to which they possess a legal right of access the ninth circuit stated that because the plaintiffs desire to view the birds at the naval station from publically accessible locations outside the station there is an interest sufficient to confer standing.indeed,one of lone mountain purported objectives in its development is to preserve opportunities,both for its residents and others from locations.thus,given the members adjacent land ownership,the development alleged impact on wildlife in the area,and the alleged diminution of the members recreational access and use,sos has established sufficient standing to maintain this action.
as we observed in clear channel outdoor,city of los angeles,cir,t he standard for granting a preliminary injunction balances the plaintiff likelihood of success against the relative hardship to the parties.we have described two sets of criteria for preliminary injunctive relief.under the traditional criteria,a plaintiff must show a strong likelihood of success on the merits,the possibility of irreparable injury to plaintiff if preliminary relief is not granted,a balance of hardships favoring the plaintiff,and advancement of the public interest in certain cases.johnson cal.state bd.of accountancy,cir.alternatively,a court may grant the injunction if the plaintiff demonstrates either a combination of probable success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury or that serious questions are raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in his favor.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
as we have said many times regarding the two alternative formulations of the preliminary injunction test these two formulations represent two points on a sliding scale in which the required degree of irreparable harm increases as the probability of success decreases.they are not separate tests but rather outer reaches of a single continuum.baby tam,city of las vegas,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
a district court order with respect to preliminary injunctive relief is subject to limited review and will be reversed only if the district court abused its discretion or based its decision on an erroneous legal standard or on a clearly erroneous finding of fact.united states peninsula communications,cir.our review may be de novo under circumstances in which the district court ruling rests solely on a premise of law and the facts are either established or undisputed.a m records,napster,cir.however,here,the district court order was grounded in its factual findings.
mere disagreement with the district court conclusions is not sufficient reason for us to reverse the district court decision regarding a preliminary injunction.sports form,united press int l,cir u nless the district court decision relies on erroneous legal premises,it will not be reversed simply because the appellate court would have arrived at a different result if it had applied the law to the facts of the case.rather,the appellate court will reverse only if the district court abused its discretion.
under our deferential standard of review,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction.there are no clearly erroneous factual findings made by the district court,and the district court did not apply an incorrect legal standard.rather,the district court made the determinations of hardships based on its factual findings and balanced the hardships appropriately in concluding that the issuance of a preliminary injunction was warranted.
lone mountain argues that the district court erred in including acres of washes in its analysis instead of the specified permit sites.in essence,lone mountain is arguing that it can constrain the corps jurisdiction by submitting a gerrymandered series of permit applications.
however,the corps jurisdiction is not dictated by the applicant rather,it is directed by statute.the cwa is a comprehensive statute,designed to restore and maintain the chemical,physical,and biological integrity of the nation waters.a.the cwa prohibits the discharge of any pollutant,including dredged or fill material,into navigable waters unless authorized by a cwa permit.a.the corps are authorized to issue a cwa section pursuant to.
the nepa requires federal agencies to prepare an environment impact statement for all major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.c.a section permit issued by the corps is a federal action to which nepa applies.tillamook county army corps of engineers,cir.the corps thus must determine the potential impact that a proposed development would have on the jurisdictional waters,and on those portions of the entire project over which the district engineer has sufficient control and responsibility to warrant federal review.pt,app.b b.the corps has control and responsibility for portions of the project in which the federal involvement is sufficient to turn an essentially private action into a federal action.these are cases where the environmental consequences of the larger project are essentially the products of the corps permit action.id.at b.
in sum,it is the impact on jurisdictional waters that determines the scope of the corps responsibility,not the constructs of the developer.lone mountain narrow jurisdictional interpretation would defeat the purpose of the cwa mandate to regulate the pollutants that flow into the nation waterways.
an examination of the district court careful reasoning supports our conclusion that the court did not abuse its discretion in determining that sos had raised serious questions going to the merits.specifically,the district court concluded that there were serious questions as to whether the corps had correctly confined its jurisdiction to the acres that were the subject of the dredge and fill permit applications.flowers,d at.it is significant at the onset to recall that two federal agencies,the epa and the the usual suspects in opposing the action of a federal with the acreage limitations set forth in the permit applications and thus with the corps interpretation of its jurisdiction.
in addition,the district court made key factual findings that supported its conclusion that there were substantial questions on this issue.first,the district court found,and it is undisputed,that the permit sites are scattered throughout the entire property.the district court determined that the desert washes run through the property like lines run through graph paper,id.at,and that the acres of jurisdictional waters are a dominant feature of the land and that no development of the property could occur without affecting the washes.id.at.the district court determined that the construction is dictated by the interconnectedness of the land and washes.id.at.the district court noted that the uplands are not on separate lots,nor are separable from the navigable waters rather,the uplands are interspersed through the section surrounded by washes on every side.id.the district court noted that the corps own environmental assessment bolstered this conclusion because the corps concluded that denial of a permit would prevent the site from developing in a manner consistent with the developer purpose.in short,the entire development was affected by the decisions concerning the washes.because the area affected by the permits runs through the entire acres the way capillaries run through tissue,the district court concluded that it was difficult for the development to affect the uplands without also affecting the jurisdictional waters.id.thus,because th
