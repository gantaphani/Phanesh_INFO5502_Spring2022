plaintiff david sorbo,a white male,filed suit against united parcel service ups,alleging age discrimination,reverse race and sex discrimination,hostile work environment,retaliation,and breach of of good faith and fair dealing in connection with his termination following complaints about his behavior from female employees of a ups customer in a thorough order,the district court held that plaintiff had not demonstrated a triable issue of fact as to any of his claims and,accordingly,granted summary judgment for ups.plaintiff seeks review of that order in appeal.a dispute over costs ensued and,ultimately,the court awarded ups under rule d plaintiff challenges that award in appeal.finally,plaintiff sought relief from judgment under rule b,which the district court denied.plaintiff seeks review of that ruling in appeal.the three appeals were consolidated for procedural purposes we address them in sequential order,determined by substance rather than chronology the grant of summary judgment,followed by the denial of rule b relief,and,finally,the award of costs.
summary judgment 
factual background 
a short summary of the basic facts should suffice as an introduction to the various issues raised on appeal from the grant of summary judgment.this summary is not intended to be exhaustive,and additional facts will be discussed where relevant later.
after some ten years with ups,plaintiff became an account executive in the business development department in,selling company services to new and existing customers.during the ensuing years,different supervisors voiced or related concerns about his relations with company personnel and customers.in october,monica harlan,his direct supervisor,raised performance issues that resulted in his being placed on probation for three months by harlan and ups district sales manager jack donnell.plaintiff signed an action plan stating that he fully underst ood that one single concern about his skills,his work ethic,his arrogance,or his full commitment to change his behavior or attitude will result in further discussion with all involved which could lead up to and include his termination from ups.vol.i,doc,ex.
shortly after plaintiff probation expired,two female employees of ups customer employee information services eis contacted his,jesse gallegos,with serious complaints about plaintiff professional conduct and personal behavior that led to eis canceling its account.the former complaints involved repeated gross tardiness and unresponsiveness to customer concerns the latter included a sexist joke and inappropriate comments of a sexual nature,ex.when gallegos told plaintiff about the eis employees complaint,he responded by claiming that they had sexually harassed him,ex,at.plaintiff did not,however,complete a written account of this claim,as requested by gallegos,ex,at.
gallegos,donnell,and kevin starbuck,a ups human resources manager,interviewed the eis employees,who reiterated and expanded on their complaints,ex.they detailed their complaints more formally in communications by letter and email,which also expressed shock at plaintiff emphatically denied.see,exs.based on these circumstances,plaintiff was terminated,with ups district manager myron gray making the final decision.see,ex,at and ex,at.
district court disposition 
a summary of the district court disposition of plaintiff various claims is necessary to frame our analysis of the issues on appeal.with regard to plaintiff hostile work environment claim,the district court addressed the instances of allegedly hostile conduct directed at plaintiff by his ups superiors harlan,gallegos,donnell,and gray,and by the two eis employees whose complaints prompted his termination.after considering these in detail,separately and collectively,the court concluded that plaintiff could not show actionable conduct severe or pervasive enough to give rise to the type of abusive environment necessary for a claim.vol.ii,doc,at applying davis postal,cir.
the district court then disposed of the discrimination claims,holding that plaintiff had failed to demonstrate a prima facie case of either age,sex,or race discrimination and that,in any event,ups had conclusively shown a legitimate business reason for his termination.plaintiff discrimination claims failed in the first instance because his comparisons to the treatment of younger,female,employees did not raise any inference of discrimination in light of the fact that these other employees were not shown to be truly similarly situated.even if this deficiency in his case were ignored,however,plaintiff misconduct and unsatisfactory performance provided a legitimate reason for termination that he failed to discredit as mere pretext for discrimination.
the district court rejected plaintiff retaliation claim for failure to show any pertinent protected activity upon which such a claim could be premised.as with the discrimination claims,the court also held that plaintiff had,in any event,failed to create a triable issue regarding the pretextuality of the otherwise plainly legitimate grounds stated by ups for his termination.
finally,the district court determined that plaintiff claims for breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing were deficient for reasons of controlling state law.plaintiff has not raised any issues on appeal with respect to these claims,however,and we therefore do not address them further.see doebele mgmt,cir.
before proceeding to the issues presented by this appeal,there is a legal point that should be clarified.the district court recited an older version of the prima facie case for discrimination which has limited,if indeed any,remaining application in this circuit.the version it recited initially in reference to the age claim required plaintiff to show that he belongs to the protected age group his job performance was satisfactory adverse employment action was taken against him and comparable employees who were not in a protected class did not receive comparable adverse employment action.vol.ii,doc,at following thomas ibm,cir.in reference to the fourth prong of the test,the supreme court has specifically held that plaintiffs need not show disparate treatment as compared to outside the protected class,those not over forty years of age.see consol.coin caterers,d.in perry woodward,cir,this court extended the same basic point to other forms of alleged discrimination 
indeed,numerous decisions of this court indicate that a prima facie case may not require a person comparison at all.in particular,several cases involving adverse action prompted by unsatisfactory performance or misconduct have framed the relevant element much more broadly,as requiring a showing of circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination.salguero city of clovis,cir see plotke white,cir hysten burlington santa fe ry,cir jones denver post,cir.while this broader requirement may be and often is satisfied by proof that the employer treated similarly situated employees more favorably,such proof is just one sufficient means to do this and should not itself be mistaken as an indispensable element of the prima facie case.see plotke,at hysten,at jones,at 
that said,we do not think that the district court recitation of an outmoded prima facie case test in itself warrants reversal.the parties have not noticed the point,much less offered any challenge to or defense of the district court formulation.more importantly,however the test is framed in the abstract,where,as here,comparison to others similarly situated is the method chosen by the plaintiff to raise an inference of discrimination,the claim is properly analyzed in those terms.jones,at.and,whether that analysis is conducted in reference to the prima facie case or the business justification versus pretext inquiry,see supra note,if the court correctly concludes that the evidence of fails as a matter of law,summary judgment for the defendant is the proper result.
issues raised on appeal 
much of plaintiff briefing relates directly or indirectly to his objection that ups advanced inconsistent positions as to who was the for his termination,naming sales manager jack donnell in discovery proceedings,but then citing district director myron gray during summary judgment proceedings.the adverse result of this change in position,plaintiff insists,is that he was unable to obtain materials in discovery later needed to oppose summary judgment.before addressing the legal issues this argument raises,it is important to clarify the procedural facts surrounding ups litigation conduct and plaintiff response thereto.
in his first set of interrogatories plaintiff asked ups to identify all account executives disciplined from to the present.ups raised various objections,but w ithout waiving these objections,ups provide d general information on the sex,race and age of account executive ae employees who were terminated or disciplined for performance reasons,from the period during plaintiff employment when jack donnell headed up the business development group exhibit a hereto.vol,doc,attachment at.in a motion to compel discovery addressed to much more than this single item,plaintiff argued that ups had provided incomplete and partial information,though not because of any undue significance attributed to donnell involvement.rather,plaintiff insisted he was entitled to documents dating to because ups had relied on such documents in justifying his termination,therefore the time frame in this interrogatory is reasonable in time and scope,doc.at.however,in reiterating the explanation for limiting ups answer to,ups counsel interjected that donnell was the decision maker for plaintiff termination,doc,at.the magistrate judge denied the motion to compel in a minute order for those reasons as stated in defendant ups response,holding ups has fully responded to the discovery requests,doc,at.plaintiff did not seek district court review of that order pursuant to b and rule a.
as plaintiff notes,when ups later moved for summary judgment,it identified gray as the person who decided on plaintiff termination.it is this change in focus that plaintiff now argues put him in an evidentiary bind,because his discovery had been limited per ups successful opposition to his motion to compel based on the mistaken premise that donnell had been the with respect to his termination.
plaintiff does not mention,however,that months before ups moved for summary judgment,it had corrected counsel misidentification of donnell as the.in response to a second set of interrogatories,ups clarified that the decision to terminate was made by gray and ups managers tim sullivan and kevin point recognized by plaintiff in his response in opposition to summary judgment.see vol.iii,doc,at.while thus aware that ups had provided a sworn response to his second set of interrogatories contrary to the statement made by ups counsel in opposing his prior motion to compel,plaintiff nevertheless did not argue to the district court that he had been improperly denied relevant discovery,nor did he oppose summary judgment under rule f on the ground that he needed additional discovery in order to respond adequately to the motion.
denial of discovery 
plaintiff appears to raise two distinct,albeit related,objections regarding the belated identification of district director gray as the person ultimately responsible for his termination that the magistrate judge improperly limited discovery,denying his motion to compel,based at least in part on the subsequently retracted designation of sales manager donnell as the responsible and that the district court improperly granted summary judgment for ups,penalizing plaintiff for the discovery disability inappropriately imposed on him.neither of these points was raised in the proceedings leading to summary judgment,however,and we decline to upset that determination on the basis of a belated attack.
after receiving ups response to his second set of interrogatories,plaintiff could have asked the magistrate judge to reconsider prior discovery rulings potentially affected by the identification of the final indeed,he could have simply served discovery requests on ups based on the new information.he did not pursue either course and we note that he was proceeding with counsel by this time.nor,as noted above,did he raise any objection regarding the denial of discovery or the need for additional discovery to the district court in conjunction with his opposition to summary judgment.thus,plaintiff never raised his current objections regarding ups identification of the below,despite ample opportunity to do so,and we therefore do not reach them.scheidt klein,cir see,quigley rosenthal,cir,cert.denied,d boyd motors,employers ins.of wausau,cir.
dispute regarding identity of 
plaintiff argues that the district court analysis of his claims was tainted by its failure to recognize that gray role as the was disputed.while this sounds like a distinct factual argument,it is actually just a variation on plaintiff complaint about discovery.plaintiff again invokes the inconsistency between ups counsel initial reference to donnell as the and ups subsequent verified clarification of the matter in its response to the second set of interrogatories as the basis for claiming that the identity was the subject of a genuine dispute precluding summary judgment.see aplt.opening br.at.while a party may be able to defeat summary judgment on the basis of a fact dispute created by an unexplained contradiction in the movant own sworn statements,that is not what we have here.as previously explained,the contradiction involved here is simply ups correction of a misstatement by statements of counsel,which are not summary judgment evidence,thomas wichita bottling,cir see also mares conagra poultry,cir,can not create an evidentiary dispute.
inconsistent positions taken on plaintiff probationary status 
plaintiff complains,in more summary fashion,about another discovery matter that mirrors in significant respects the flap over of the.he notes that in the proceedings over his motion to compel discovery involving his first set of interrogatories,ups indicated he had been on probation when he was terminated,but in subsequent discovery and in connection with summary judgment,acknowledged he was no longer on probation at the time.he insists that t he contradictory argument by ups in the two motions demonstrates pretext and discredits argument of fair treatment by ups.the genuine issue of fact also demonstrates that ups subjected plaintiff to abusive,disparate and discriminatory treatment.aplt.opening br.at.this line of argument is facially specious,for many of the reasons stated in connection with plaintiff other discovery objection.the pertinent facts undermine it further.
ups objected to plaintiff interrogatory seeking information regarding termination or discipline of other account executives for performance reasons on the ground that plaintiff had been involved in conduct unique to him sexual harassment of a customer and thus was not fairly comparable to other account executives who may have had performance issues.see vol.i,doc,at.nevertheless,as noted previously,ups provided the information reserving its objection concerning account executives because plaintiff was on probation at the time of his termination for performance reasons.id.emphasis added.in short,ups initial misunderstanding about plaintiff probationary status at the time of his termination prompted it to provide,not withhold,the requested discovery.and,when it came to summary judgment,acknowledging that plaintiff was not on probation when he was terminated would appear to have been more of a concession than a change in position.
accusations of perjury regarding ups investigation of plaintiff complaint of harassment by eis employees 
plaintiff final objection to the summary judgment order is that,with respect to his allegation that ups did not adequately investigate his harassment claim against the eis employees whose complaints prompted his termination,s everal key witnesses of ups have provided information that is potentially perjuri ous in nature and the district court failed to consider this evidence.aplt.opening br.at.in his opening brief,the only factual matter identified in this regard concerns plaintiff assertion that he was out of state at the time ups witnesses claim that he was interviewed about the relevant events.see id.he does not,however,contend that he never in fact spoke with the ups witnesses,just that they misidentified the particular date of the communication.see id.in short,though he insists the alleged potentially perjurious evidence bears witness that there was a genuine issue of fact,he presents no argument for the materiality of the issue to which he alludes.id.without such an argument,he has failed to raise an issue that undermines the grant of summary judgment.see schwartz of maint.of way employees,cir noting case teem ed with genuine factual disputes,and emphasizing that t o avert summary,however,the contested facts must be material.
in his reply brief,plaintiff also references allegedly false testimony from the chief complaining eis employee and two other ups witnesses,which he brought to the district court attention by way of a rule b motion filed after this appeal was taken.see aplt.reply br.at.the proper context for consideration of this allegation is in connection with plaintiff separate appeal from the denial of that motion,which is taken up below.
in sum,plaintiff has failed to demonstrate the existence of any reversible error with respect to the entry of summary judgment for ups.we therefore affirm the district court ruling under review in appeal.
ii.rule b ruling 
plaintiff filed a motion for relief from judgment under rule b on the last day of the period specified as the outside limit for seeking relief under three of the four subsections he invoked.id.the motion shall be made within a reasonable time,and for reasons,and not more than one year after the judgment,order,or proceedings was entered or taken.plaintiff later filed an amended rule b motion,well beyond the limit.the district court summarily denied the latter as untimely,holding that plaintiff attempt to invoke the principle of retroactive amendment in rule,which applies to pleadings,was inapposite.addressing the initial motion,the court held that while it was not barred as a general matter by the strict limit,plaintiff objections based on information available prior to the grant of summary judgment were not made within a reasonable time and,thus,were under this more flexible limitation.as for one matter based on evidence newly discovered shortly before the motion was filed,the court held it was not but lacked merit.we review the court ruling under rule b for an abuse of discretion.zurich am.matrix,cir.finding no abuse of discretion,we affirm.
we know of no authority suggesting that the district court was required to accept plaintiff belated amended rule b motion on the contrary,the rules appear to dictate precisely the result reached here.pleadings are categorically distinguished from motions,see rule a b,and the provisions of rule regarding amendments and their apply only to pleadings.see also schwartz united states,holding rule a inapplicable to amended motion to vacate judgment because original motion did not fall within the rule a definition of pleadings subject to the rule liberal amendment provisions,aff,cir.indeed,to disregard the limited scope of rule and allow use of its amendment and provisions to permit a belated motion under rule b would violate the unqualified directive in rule that the court may not extend the time for taking any action under rule b,except to the extent and under the conditions stated there in.the district court certainly did not abuse its discretion by proceeding in a manner consistent with the governing rules.
turning to the original motion,the district court noted that plaintiff objections regarding allegedly inconsistent statements from ups employees and assertedly incredible statements from eis employees plainly involved matters that could have been raised in the summary judgment proceedings concluded nearly a year before.accordingly,the district court held that these objections had not been made within a reasonable time,as required by rule b,relying on circuit decisions clarifying that motions filed within the limitation may still be barred under the limitation,depending on relevant circumstances see,cummings motors,cir following white am.airlines,cir.in particular,the court noted that plaintiff had not given sufficient justification for the delay,as required by our cases.see id.at following white,at.indeed,we have reviewed plaintiff rule motion,as well as the amended motion he later proffered,and neither endeavors to offer any justification for the delay.see supp.vol.vii,doc,supp.vol.v,doc.there is no abuse of discretion evident on our record as to the district court application of the governing law to matters plaintiff could have pursued in the underlying summary judgment proceeding.
finally,the district court considered plaintiff one allegation that was based on newly discovered that one of the eis employees who had complained about plaintiff sexually inappropriate behavior including his story about a visit to a strip club had herself visited strip clubs.plaintiff argument was that this newly revealed indiscretion,assertedly at odds with the general tone of her complaints about him and more specifically with deposition testimony regarding a specific business trip she had taken,rendered her testimony unworthy of belief.but the district court noted that,consistent with its limited role on summary judgment,it had not made any credibility determinations when granting ups motion.indeed,the issue on summary judgment was whether ups legitimately acted on the basis of the eis complaint about plaintiff whether subsequently developed extrinsic evidence might cast doubt on the veracity of some of what the complaining party said we note that she said a great deal more about plaintiff lack of professionalism distinct from sexually inappropriate conduct was simply not relevant to ups nondiscriminatory motivation.we have repeatedly held that the relevant inquiry in such cases concerns the belief of the employer that the employee engaged in misconduct,not whether the actual facts,as shown by evidence extrinsic to the employer assessment,may have been otherwise.see,medley polk,cir kendrick,at mcknight kimberly clark,cir.
in sum,plaintiff has not demonstrated any abuse of discretion with respect to the denial of his motion for relief under rule b.we therefore affirm the district court ruling under review in appeal.
iii.award of costs 
as prevailing party,ups sought and obtained costs under rule d in the amount of.the district court summarily denied plaintiff ensuing motion for reconsideration,and plaintiff appealed.
the award of costs under rule d rests in the sound discretion of the trial court.allison bank,cir.an abuse of such discretion occurs only where the trial court bases its decision on an erroneous conclusion of law or where there is no rational basis in the evidence for the ruling.id.quotation omitted.as explained below,it is evident from the face of the district court order and the cost documentation it addresses that the award under review is premised on an erroneous view of the law governing the availability of costs under rule d.we therefore vacate the award and remand for further proceedings consistent with the principles discussed herein 
absent some other statutory authorization,costs available to a prevailing party under rule d are limited to those specified in 
t he supreme court has examined the interrelation between rule d and section and has determined that rule d is not a separate source of power to tax as costs expenses not enumerated in.instead,the court determined that defines the term costs as used in rule d,and that although a court in its discretion need not award section costs under rule d,it has no discretion to award items as costs that are not set out in section.
