the defendant francis branin,a former principal in an investment management firm,and his partners sold their firm and its good will to another investment management firm,the plaintiff bessemer trust company,bessemer.soon dissatisfied with his employment at bessemer,branin left and joined a competitor.he did not contact his former clients in search of their business directly,but he did respond to their inquiries as to his status.he also participated in at least two meetings with respect to one client,and helped craft his new firm strategy for soliciting that client business.
when this client and several others stopped doing business with bessemer to do business with branin new firm instead,bessemer brought the instant lawsuit,alleging that branin had solicited his former clients at bessemer in violation of the doctrine established by von bremen macmonnies,and mohawk maintenance kessler,the mohawk doctrine,which prohibits,in perpetuity,a voluntary seller of a client good will from improperly soliciting business from that client after the client business,including its good will,is transferred to the purchaser.branin filed counterclaims against bessemer for breach of contract,in quantum meruit,and for promissory estoppel.
after a bench trial in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,the court john sprizzo,judge concluded that branin had improperly solicited one former client,but found insufficient evidence of improper solicitation with respect to the others.instead of trying branin counterclaims,the court granted bessemer summary judgment dismissing them.finally,after a second trial on damages,the court adopted a return of capital,rather than a lost profits,theory upon which it awarded bessemer in damages and interest.
branin appeals,contesting the finding of liability,the award of damages and the dismissal of his counterclaims.bessemer with respect to the calculation of damages.
the principal legal question before us depends not on interpretation of contract law,but on application of a branch of new york tort law,the mohawk doctrine.we find insufficient guidance in new york case law to establish whether branin behavior constituted actionable improper solicitation under that law.we therefore certify to the new york court of appeals that question.inasmuch as an answer to this question is dispositive of a finding of liability in this case,and is therefore also a threshold question that must be answered before any damages may be awarded,we need not,and choose not to,decide at this time whether the district court properly calculated damages.
branin promissory estoppel and quantum meruit claims have been waived on appeal.we affirm the dismissal of his breach of contract counterclaims because,for reasons we will explain,as an employee,he can not prevail on them based on diminution of his responsibilities and because his claim for failure to provide an adequate bonus is without merit as his offer letter explicitly vested bessemer with the sole discretion as to whether to pay him a bonus,and if so,in what amount.
background 
defendant francis branin,an investment portfolio manager,joined the investment management firm of brundage,story and rose,llc brundage in,rose to the level of principal in the firm by,served as chief executive officer from until,and at the time of the events in question,held the largest share of the firm.
in october,pursuant to a purchase agreement dated august,the purchase agreement branin and the seven other principals in brundage sold the assets of the firm,including its client accounts and related good will,to bessemer for more than million.branin,in view of his substantial ownership of brundage and as one of the lead negotiators for brundage with respect to the sale,had substantial involvement in arranging the sale.all the principals were to be employed by bessemer at will thereafter.they obtained no ownership stake in the new firm.
in an effort to ensure that the brundage principals devoted their energies to transferring their client accounts to bessemer and retaining those accounts,the purchase agreement provided that only a portion of the purchase price would be initial payment of million,of which branin received more than million and that further payments could be earned upon the meeting of certain benchmarks for client retention,revenue enhancements,and reduction of expenses.the brundage principals thereafter earned two such contingency payments,one for million in september in return for their meeting client account transfer benchmarks from brundage to bessemer,and a payment of approximately million in april because of a successful reduction of expenses.branin received nearly one quarter of each of these two payments.
it soon became clear,however,that branin and the other former brundage principals would not be eligible for the remaining two contingency payments,in large measure because one of the former principals,cheryl grandfield,departed the firm in january.she actively and successfully solicited many of her clients to follow her.that had a serious adverse effect on the ability of the remaining seven principals to meet the final two benchmarks.
bessemer subsequently brought suit against grandfield for improper solicitation of clients,alleging the same principal theory of liability that it asserts here.grandfield settled that lawsuit,agreeing to repay her entire share of the payments she had received from the sale of brundage.
branin soon became unsatisfied with his role at bessemer.several factors in addition to the fact that he would not be eligible for any further contingency payments appear to have contributed to his dissatisfaction at bessemer.in contrast to his role at brundage,where he had actively managed the portfolios of his clients,for example,at bessemer,branin was a client account manager without the authority to make investment decisions himself.and less than two weeks after the closing of the brundage transaction,bessemer ceo left the firm.his replacement reduced branin responsibilities,excluding him from management meetings.branin understood this effectively to be a demotion.
branin was also apparently upset by the fact that bessemer had made minimal effort to introduce him to its new or existing client base and did not involve him in any of the firm business development projects.finally,and relevant to branin counterclaims in this case,when bonuses were distributed for,branin received a far smaller bonus as a percentage of his potential target bonus than did the other former brundage principals 
branin move to stein roe 
branin then engaged a consulting firm to explore moving,with his business,from bessemer to another firm.the consultants brought branin to stein roe investment counsel llc stein roe,a competing investment management firm.for several months,branin and stein roe negotiated toward a possible deal between them.branin explicitly described for stein roe his client base at bessemer and touted his ability to bring his bessemer clients with him.
in or prior to june,branin agreed to move to stein roe.at that time,branin indicated to stein roe his hope that within twelve months of joining the firm he would be able to transfer to million of the approximately million in revenue that he was then generating for bessemer to stein roe.he informed stein roe that it was possible,however,that few or none of his bessemer clients would move their business.prior to his resignation from bessemer,branin refrained from contacting any of his bessemer clients to inform them of his impending move.
on july,branin resigned from bessemer.after his resignation,branin took limited action to assist bessemer in client retention,providing the firm with a memorandum profiling each of his accounts and the contact person for each account.
attempts to bring clients to stein roe 
at the time brundage was sold to bessemer,branin managed about million in investments,more than ten percent of the approximately billion managed by brundage immediately prior to the sale.once branin joined stein roe,the company began crafting and implementing a strategy to entice branin former bessemer or all of whom had come to bessemer with him from move their business to stein roe.this strategy included a new schedule of fee rates to be charged to clients that followed branin,under which clients fees would not thereby be increased.he and stein roe had some initial success.by the following summer,around thirty of branin former clients,representing million in assets,had transferred their accounts from bessemer to stein roe,accounting for all but around million of the assets branin managed at stein roe.
branin did not contact his clients directly to ask them to follow him to stein roe.he did,however,respond to their inquiries when they asked why he left and,if they requested information about the new firm,he sent them material about his new firm.according to the district court memorandum opinion and order,branin standard answer to clients who asked why he left bessemer was that a firm like stein roe was far more appropriate for me,that the method of dealing with clients,that the approach whereby portfolio managers managed the client portfolios and interacted directly with the clients was more appropriate for my training and experience of years in the business.bessemer trust,branin,d,s.bessemer i quoting joint statement of undisputed facts,exh.a to order dated august,joint statement of undisputed facts ellipses in original.branin did not say or suggest that stein roe approach would be better or more appropriate for any particular client,nor is there evidence that branin explicitly disparaged bessemer.
the evidence introduced at trial established that branin had individual meetings,either alone or with other stein roe employees participating,with representatives of two former clients with accounts at bessemer the palmer family and glen raven.their accounts were in the approximate amount of million and million,respectively.
the palmer family account 
the palmer family had been a brundage client since the.during the fifteen to twenty years branin had managed the account there,he developed a close friendship with carleton palmer,iii,who represented the family for these purposes.the two men,along with their wives and children,socialized and vacationed together,and they owned homes in the same community and jointly owned a small fishing boat.
branin nonetheless did not notify carleton palmer or the palmer family of his move from bessemer to stein roe,nor did he contact them directly after the move.indeed,the palmer family first learned of branin change of employment through an employee of bessemer.
upon learning of branin move to stein roe,carleton palmer called branin at his home to get his account of the that,palmer testified,was very spare.palmer followed up with a letter requesting specific information as to how the palmer account might be handled at stein roe.members of the palmer family then scheduled meetings on august,with stein roe and bessemer to discuss the palmer account.
in anticipation of the meeting and at branin instance,branin and other stein roe employees prepared what he described as a dog and pony show for a large client relationship that i am hoping will join stein roe.bessemer i,d at quoting pl.trial ex,from branin to ronald fisher and eric propper dated august,first brackets added block caps in original.on august,stein roe held a strategy session organized by branin during which he provided other stein roe employees with information about carleton palmer and about the nature of,and investment philosophy for,the palmer account.according to the trial testimony of carleton palmer,during the subsequent meeting between palmer and stein roe,branin played almost no role,trial tr.at,and pretty much sat over in the corner and kept quiet,id.at,other than to introduce carleton palmer to the firm and occasionally amplify a point if he knew it was something the palmers would be interested in,id.at.
following the meetings,the palmer family remained unsure about whether to move their investment accounts to stein roe.the palmers therefore invited branin to ohio to make a specific proposal on behalf of that company,an invitation which he accepted.during that visit,branin informed the palmer family that they would pay the same fees at stein roe that they were then paying at bessemer,and that the president of stein roe would be the number two on the family account.id.at.the next day,on september,the palmer family moved their account to stein roe.carleton palmer testified that he chose stein roe over bessemer because he was more impressed by stein roe senior management.he also thought that he would be a much more important client at stein roe because the firm had fewer large clients than bessemer,making the family account a big fish in a small pond.id.at.
branin assistant 
it was important to branin that his principal assistant at bessemer,alexandra fuhrmann,join him at stein roe.shortly after branin informed his staff at bessemer of his decision to leave the firm,fuhrmann contacted stein roe to seek employment there.although granted an interview,she was initially told there were no positions available.three days later,fuhrmann was nonetheless invited to,and did,attend additional interviews with the president of stein roe and others at the company.her interviews went poorly.interviewers thought that she had an unfortunate personality,and an overly aggressive demeanor,and that i n a vacuum,stein roe would never hire her.bessemer i,d at internal citations omitted.
nevertheless,on august,fuhrmann was offered a position as a vice president.the president of stein roe explained her hiring as a way to make branin comfortable and to assist in administrative work.however,it was understood that her primary responsibility would be to help branin transition as much of his client base to stein roe as possible,id.at quoting pl.trial exs,alteration in original,and that this was part of the reason that branin had recommended she join stein roe,see pl trial ex.
meanwhile,bessemer,unaware of fuhrmann attempts to join stein roe,assigned her increasing responsibility in an effort to retain branin clients,including promoting her to senior client account manager with respect to several accounts,and informing several customers that she would be assuming responsibility for their accounts.according to one of fuhrmann supervisors at bessemer,partner paul barkus,when fuhrmann subsequently left bessemer to join stein roe,on august,her departure made bessemer look kind of foolish to the clients.bessemer i,d at quoting trial tr.at.and barkus told fuhrmann that he thought the only reason that branin and stein roe wanted her to go to stein roe was to help branin transfer accounts from bessemer to stein roe.id.quoting trial tr.at alteration in original.
the complaint and counterclaims 
on november,after fuhrmann and several of branin former bessemer clients had departed the firm,bessemer filed the complaint in this action in the supreme court of new york county.bessemer asserted claims for breach of contract and breach of branin duty of loyalty to bessemer based on branin allegedly improper solicitation of clients and impairment of the good will which branin had sold to bessemer in connection with the sale of brundage.branin removed the case to the united states district court for the southern district of new york on diversity grounds.he then filed counterclaims for breach of contract relating to his position at bessemer,breach of contract with respect to his bonus,quantum meruit,and promissory estoppel based on the sale of brundage and his associated offer of employment by bessemer.
motions and trials 
after discovery was complete,the parties each brought a motion for summary judgment.these were denied.the case proceeded to a bench trial as to branin liability on bessemer claim.following the completion of trial,the filing of memoranda of law,summations by the parties,oral argument,and additional letter briefs,the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order on april,concluding that branin violated new york law by impairing bessemer good will in the palmer account,but that bessemer had not proven a violation of law by a preponderance of the evidence with respect to any other transferred account.bessemer i,d at.
bessemer then moved for summary judgment on branin counterclaims.in february,and by a subsequent memorandum opinion and order,the court granted bessemer motion.see bessemer trust,branin,d,bessemer ii.recognizing that branin employment contract was terminable at will and that branin had no contractual right to a bonus above of his salary and that his bonus was clearly within the discretion of bessemer,id.at,the court concluded that branin counterclaims were based on an erroneous interpretation of the purchase agreement,id.at.
the court then conducted a separate bench trial on damages.it rejected bessemer lost profits theory of damages and accepted branin return of capital theory,concluding that branin was liable to bessemer in the amount of plus prejudgment interest of for a total of.bessemer trust,branin,d,bessemer iii.

ii.improper solicitation of clients after voluntary sale of good will under new york law 
the mohawk doctrine,derived from the new york court of appeals decisions in von bremen macmonnies,n.and mohawk maint.kessler,recognizes as part of the common law of new york a implied covenant by a seller to refrain from soliciting former customers following the sale of the good will of a business,mohawk,at,at,at.this implied covenant precludes the seller from approaching his former customers and attempting to regain their patronage after he has purported to transfer their good will to his purchaser.see also von bremen,at,at finding that a voluntary assignor of the good will of a business may not solicit trade from his old customers.the basis for the rule was described by reference to english common law in von bremen 
a man may not derogate from his own grant the vendor is not at liberty to destroy or depreciate the thing which he has sold there is an implied covenant,on the sale of good will,that the vendor does not solicit the custom which he has parted with it would be a fraud on the contract to do so it is not right to profess and to purport to sell that which you do not mean the purchaser to have it is not an honest thing to pocket the price and then to recapture the subject of sale to decoy it away or call it back before the purchaser has had time to attach it to himself and make it his very own.
von bremen,at,at quoting lord macnaghten opinion in trego hunt,app.cas.
t he right acquired by the purchaser of the good will of a business by virtue of this implied covenant is a permanent one and is not subject to divestiture upon the passage of a reasonable period of time,since there is a continuing duty upon the seller imposed by law in order to prevent the seller from taking back that which he has purported to sell.mohawk,at,at,at accord borne chem,dictrow,dep t a cause of action for wrongful diversion of good will previously sold to a plaintiff by a defendant sounds in breach of an implied covenant of the contract of sale that the seller will permanently refrain from soliciting his prior customers.
when the intangible asset of good will is sold along with the tangible assets of a business,the purchaser acquires the right to expect that the firm established customers will continue to patronize the business.the essence of the transaction of the sale of good will is,in effect,an attempt to transfer the loyalties of the business customers from the seller,who cultivated and created them,to the new proprietor.
mohawk,at,at,at internal citations omitted.
this duty of the seller not to solicit customers does not,however,include an obligation not to accept such of his former customers as may choose to follow him to his new employment.see,at,at,at recognizing that the seller may accept the patronage of those customers who were actively dealing with the purchased company on the date of the sale if such customers choose to leave the purchased company without prompting from the seller.
the new york court of appeals has drawn an important distinction between the duty to refrain from soliciting customers on the one hand,which arises by operation of law upon the sale of good will,and the separate duty to refrain from competing with the purchaser,which may only arise out of an express agreement,at,at,at when a business is sold,the purchaser acquires no legal right to expect that the seller will refrain from engaging in a competing enterprise.id.rather,the seller remains free to pursue his own economic interests without restraint unless the purchaser has managed to extract from him an express promise to refrain from competing.id.this includes the right to contract with the seller former customers,provided that there is no improper solicitation,and,i ndeed,the occurrence of a certain amount of attrition is one of the risks that the purchaser must assume when he acquires an established business,at,at,at.so long as the client decision to follow the seller did not come about through improper solicitation,the implied covenant is not violated and the lost account should not be considered in ascertaining plaintiffs damages.hyde park prods.maximilian lerner.
the difficulty lies,of course,in determining what actions constitute improper solicitation,an issue upon which new york courts offer somewhat limited guidance.in the case before us,branin argues that he did not solicit any clients because he was simply responding to their inquiries bessemer counters that even if a former customer made the initial contact,branin was prohibited from taking any action that would tend in any way to exploit a client established loyalties or to prompt or encourage the client to leave bessemer,appellee br.at,and that branin could accept former clients business only if they left bessemer and joined him at stein roe without prompting or any act from branin,id.at.the district court took a middle path,concluding that bessemer had established that branin solicitation was improper as to the palmer account,but that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate solicitation of any other account,including the glen raven account,with whose representative branin also met in person while at stein roe bessemer i,at.
we find no clear error in the district court finding of fact that branin intended to take his clients with him from bessemer to stein roe.id.at.branin himself stated that he had learned the right way to transition clients from bessemer to another firm.id.quoting trial tr.at.he expressed his desire to transfer to million in revenue from bessemer to stein roe.id.
once at stein roe,as noted above,branin took actions both to help stein roe solicit his clients and to frustrate bessemer ability to retain them.most prominently,he called a meeting for the express purpose of devising a strategy to solicit the palmer family business,requested a new schedule of fees for his former clients so as to entice them to move,held discussions with employees at stein roe in which he described his clients at bessemer and what would motivate them to move their business to stein roe,and participated in both phone and meetings with his former clients during which he discussed his reasons for moving from bessemer to stein roe.
branin principal assistant at bessemer,whose intimate knowledge of branin clients would likely have been of significant benefit to bessemer in its effort to retain branin fact of which branin testified he was aware,was hired by stein roe despite receiving thoroughly negative reviews during her interviews and without having submitted any references or recommendations,because the president of stein roe believed that she could help branin transition as much of his client base to stein roe as possible.id.at quotation marks and citation omitted,alteration in original.indeed,this was part of the reason that branin initially suggested that stein roe hire her,and her hiring was important enough to branin that he offered to pay a portion of her salary at stein roe out of his own pocket.
the district court finding was that branin input helped stein roe presenters to steer clear of topics in which palmer had little interest and focus only on those things that were of interest to him.bessemer i,d at.and carleton palmer,the family representative,testified that branin occasionally amplif ied a point if he knew it was something i would be interested in from his relationship with me.trial tr.at.branin then traveled to ohio for a second meeting with palmer,in which he presented the palmer family with a proposed fee schedule and promised the ceo of stein roe as the number two on the account.id.at.
none of this behavior by branin requires a conclusion under new york law as we understand it,however,that branin solicited palmer as a client.as the district court correctly noted,other than palmer and glen raven,bessemer has offered no proof about which clients spoke to branin before they transferred their accounts,heard branin standard response,were familiar with fuhrmann,or knew that their fees would be the same at stein roe.bessemer i,d at.even had all of the clients at issue been party to these actions by defendant,no evidence has been presented to show that these clients would not have joined branin absent these inducements.id.and inasmuch as the palmer family transferred their account only after stein roe was able to demonstrate,in a meeting in which branin took part,that the firm would be a superior investment manager in light of the family investment needs,we think it relevant that new york law permits several steps bessemer might have pursued to protect itself in this regard,including and nonsolicitation agreements that could have been,but were not,entered into with the brundage principals at the time of the sale of the firm to bessemer.
the district court implicitly recognized what we think to be so the fact that branin participated in the meetings relating to the departure of the palmer family to stein roe does not necessarily demonstrate that he was engaged in improper solicitation because,as was the case with the glen raven account with respect to which branin also held an in person meeting while at stein roe,there is no conclusive proof or finding of a causative link between what branin did and the family decision to change investment advisors.see id.finding,despite the fact that branin had participated in a meeting with glen raven discussing the moving of the account to stein roe,that there was no solicitation because glen raven was intent on following branin regardless of any action or inaction on his part and therefore nothing branin did caused the transfer of the glen raven account.under the circumstances,the palmer family may well have followed in any event.
the district court found that,t aking all these actions together,it had no doubt that branin stepped over the line and improperly induced the palmers to leave bessemer and join stein roe.id.at.we recognize that these actions are far from passive acceptance of a client inquiries,but we lack the clarity of conviction of the district court on this point 
the district court found the question of initiation irrelevant to its analysis.see id.at finding that von bremen and mohawk maintenance place no significance on who initiates the communications between the seller of good will and his clients.in the court view,von bremen broader concern was that it would be bad faith for the seller to avail himself as against the buyer of any special knowledge or advantage derived by him from the business whose good will he has voluntarily sold.id.at quoting von bremer,at,at quotation marks and emphasis omitted.
we read the new york case law differently.inasmuch as von bremen relied on bad faith,the reliance on bad faith was not relevant to the solicitation analysis,but was instead part of a separate discussion of the basis for the distinction between voluntary and involuntary sales of good will and for applying the implied covenant in the former case to the exclusion of the latter.see von bremen,at,at.and,contrary to the district court suggestion that initiation is of no special significance,the identity of the initiator has been treated as both relevant and important for courts that have applied the implied covenant.they have characterized the forbidden action with words signifying direct initiation of communication,such as solicit,von bremen,at,at mohawk,at,at,at,approach,mohawk,at,at,at slomin,gray,dep t kraft agency,delmonico,dep t,apply,von bremen,at,at,specifically and directly appeal,at,at,and drum up or circularize,in re brown,cardozo.in von bremen itself,the court of appeals recognized that a previous attempt to divorce solicitation from initiation that had been made by lord jessel in leggott barrett.had been rejected by the higher court.von bremen,at,at.the language of mohawk is perhaps the most suggestive of the importance of initiation in the application of the implied covenant,since the court described the implied covenant as restrict ing the economic freedom of the seller only insofar as it precludes him from approaching his former customers and attempting to regain their patronage after he has purported to transfer their good will to his purchaser.mohawk,at,at,at emphasis added.and in the case before us,it is entirely clear that the palmer family,not branin,initiated the contacts that led to the transfer of its account to stein roe.
we might make the assessments as to whether branin efforts in following up on the palmer family initiation of contacts constituted improper solicitation.or,insofar as factual questions as to initiation and causation are involved,we might return the case to the district court,asking it for a more specific examination of those issues.but we find it difficult for either us or a district court to make that determination in the absence of further explication as to the law of the state of new york as to improper solicitation under these circumstances.especially in light of the importance of new york,and new york law,in the financial services industry,we think,and the new york court of appeals may agree,that it is that court which should make this determination in the first instance.
generalizing,we seek instruction as to whether two sets of actions,taken together,amount to improper solicitation under the law of the mohawk doctrine the active development and participation by the seller,in response to inquiries from a former client whose good will the seller has voluntarily sold to a third party,o
