this is a diversity case involving multiple parties that arose after an arsenic spill from a railroad tank car in a chattanooga rail yard.after a lengthy trial,the jury found hickson corporation,the owner of the arsenic being transported,liable to norfolk southern railway company,the rail carrier transporting the arsenic when it leaked,and awarded damages to norfolk southern.this appeal focuses primarily on a damages dispute between hickson and norfolk southern.hickson claims that the district court judgment awarding in contract damages and an additional in negligence damages to norfolk southern is in error because norfolk southern did not prove any contract damages separate from negligence damages.in essence,hickson contends that the damages arise from the same injury,and norfolk southern received an impermissible double recovery.specifically,hickson contends that the wording of the verdict form and the subsequent interpretation of the jury answers to the special interrogatories on that verdict form by the district court caused norfolk southern to be awarded duplicative damages.we see this,at bottom,as an election of remedies problem,caused,or at least exacerbated by,a confusing verdict form.although norfolk southern was entitled to put forth alternative theories of liability,it is clear that there was only one injury to norfolk southern arising from the leak.allowing norfolk southern to recover both contract and negligence damages for the same injury gave norfolk southern an impermissible double recovery.after the jury found hickson liable to norfolk southern under both the contract and negligence theories,the district court should have required norfolk southern to elect between contract and negligence damages.we therefore remand the case for a retrial on damages only.
the facts of this case are generally undisputed.we will relate them briefly here and add additional information when necessary.hickson manufactures wood preservatives in its conley,georgia plant and ships arsenic to another plant in valparaiso,indiana,as part of its normal business practice.hickson signed a lease with union tank car company for the use of tank cars to assist it in transporting arsenic acid from one plant to another.the leaky tank car at issue was manufactured in by union tank car and transported caustic acid for some time prior to hickson leasing the tank car from union tank car in.prior to the start of hickson lease,union tank car inspected the car for corrosion and performed some repairs.one of the repairs was to replace the eduction pipe that extracts liquid contents from the tank car.the pipe extends to just short of the bottom of the tank car and into the sump,or lowest,area of the car.
on june,prior to loading the tank car with arsenic acid,a hickson employee inspected the tank car for its journey to indiana.in violation of federal rules and regulations,the inspection did not include the sump area of the car because that area was covered with a pool of liquid.despite this lack of required inspection,hickson loaded the acid onto the car and certified to norfolk southern on the bill of lading that the acid was in proper condition and was properly packaged for transportation in accordance with department of transportation rules and regulations.norfolk southern took possession of the tank car and transported the arsenic acid to debutts yard in chattanooga on june and.
in the early morning hours of june,while the car was still at the chattanooga rail yard,a leak was discovered.no measures were taken by norfolk southern at that time to stop the leak.several hours later,norfolk southern employees moved the tank car to the edge of the railyard so that emergency equipment could reach it.norfolk southern employees notified the tennessee department of environment and conservation,the chattanooga fire department,the water company,ferguson harbour incorporated norfolk southern emergency response contractor,and hickson.the fire department sent a hazardous materials team to the site.the car continued to leak until a hickson employee arrived on the scene some hours after discovery of the leak and arranged for the leaking acid to be drained into a children plastic pool and pumped back into the car.before the leak was contained,approximately of the acid was lost,causing contamination to the soil in two places at the railyard and threatening the chattanooga water supply,although extensive leakage into the water system was averted.
after the spill,hickson,as the owner of the arsenic being transported,brought an action against norfolk southern under the carmack amendment to the interstate commerce act,a federal statute allowing recovery against an interstate rail carrier by the owner of property damaged by the interstate rail carrier during transit.hickson claimed,among other things,that norfolk southern caused the leak by joining rail cars together at an excessive rate of speed.norfolk southern counterclaimed against hickson,alleging breach of contract,negligence,nuisance,trespass and ultrahazardous activity based on hickson failure adequately to inspect the tank car before loading the arsenic onto the tank car and for misrepresenting to norfolk southern,through the bill of lading,that the tank car had been properly inspected and was fit to transport arsenic.norfolk southern also filed a complaint against union tank car,the manufacturer and owner of the tank car that leaked,claiming breach of contract,negligence,nuisance,trespass and ultrahazardous activity.norfolk southern alleged that union tank car had installed the eduction pipe incorrectly,causing it to strike the sump of the tank car,wear through the tank car protective lining and thereby allow the acid to corrode the tank car steel.in turn,union tank car filed a complaint against hickson for negligence and hickson counterclaimed against union tank car for various products liability claims,other negligence claims,breach of contract and contribution or indemnity.the district court granted partial summary judgment to union tank car,dismissing norfolk southern claims against union tank car for breach of contract,trespass,and nuisance.union tank car and hickson settled their claims against each other following jury selection.numerous other complaints and counterclaims were filed based on this incident 
after the district court ruled on various dispositive motions,the following issues were tried to a jury 
hickson carmack amendment claim against norfolk southern for damage to property being transported interstate by rail 
norfolk southern claims against hickson for breach of contract,negligence,nuisance and trespass arising from the alleged failure adequately to inspect the tank car and for misrepresentations about the inspection and condition of the tank car put forth in the bill of lading 
norfolk southern claim against union tank car for negligence in installing the eduction pipe.
all parties moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence.the district court granted judgment as a matter of law to hickson on norfolk southern ultrahazardous activity claim and denied all other motions.the jury found hickson liable to norfolk southern for breach of contract and negligence and found union tank car liable to norfolk southern for negligence.the jury also found that norfolk southern was not negligent with respect to hickson claim that it caused the leak by coupling the cars together too fast,but it did find that norfolk southern was negligent in its response to the spill once discovered,thereby increasing the harm done by the spill.
after determining liability,the verdict form asked the jury to determine damages.after discussion among the parties and the court,the jury was presented with a single damage question in question of the verdict form that read as follows what is the total amount that norfolk southern incurred in damages pursuant to the claims you found norfolk southern had proved by a preponderance of the evidence the jury responded that norfolk southern had incurred damages in the amount of.question asked the jury,in accordance with tennessee comparative fault law,to allocate the fault among
