before the accident,gumpenberger had been at a friend house and had been drinking.his blood alcohol level,tested later at the hospital,was.the evidence showed that he did not brake at all before the impact with either vehicle,and witnesses estimated his speed at gumpenberger stated that he was headed to monticello estates,which is off highway k approximately three miles south of the accident site.
