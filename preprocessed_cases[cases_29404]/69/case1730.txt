discussion 
section c does not require a criminal conviction under section a.
the trial court awarded bell treble damages under section c,which reads any person who has been injured by a violation of subdivision a or b may bring an action for three times the amount of actual damages,if any,sustained by the plaintiff,costs of suit,and reasonable attorney fees.section a makes receiving,buying,or withholding property that has been obtained in any manner constituting theft an act punishable by imprisonment feibush argues a criminal conviction under section a is a prerequisite to liability for treble damages under section c.
the fundamental task of statutory interpretation is to ascertain the legislature intent to effectuate the statute purpose.smith superior court cal th,d.in ascertaining the legislature intent,we first consider the language of the statute itself,giving the words used their ordinary meaning.ibid.the statutory language must be construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme,giving significance to every word,phrase,sentence,and part of the statute.ibid.if the statutory language is unambiguous,the plain meaning controls and consideration of extrinsic sources to determine the legislature intent is unnecessary.kavanaugh west sonoma county union high school dist.cal th,d.we read a statute as a whole to harmonize and give effect to all parts.marie riverside county regional park open space dist.cal th,d.
penal code section does not state a criminal conviction under section a is required for a private plaintiff to recover treble damages under section c.nor does section c limit recovery of treble damages to a crime victim.instead,section c permits a ny person who has been injured by a violation of subdivision a or b to bring an action to recover treble damages.both section a and section,subdivision b identify a subject every person in section a and every swap meet vendor,as defined in section,subdivision b.both section a and section,subdivision b then state that the identified subject who engages in certain described conduct shall be punished.a violation of section a or section,subdivision b would occur when the subject engages in that described conduct.the consequence of that violation is imprisonment,and a person injured by the violation may recover treble damages under section c.
heritage cablevision of,pusateri th,d heritage supports our interpretation of the word violation.in heritage,a cable television company sued the defendant for civil liability under penal code section,which imposes criminal and civil liability for tampering with cable television systems.heritage,supra,at,d.at that time,the civil liability provision of section provided,in relevant part any person who violates this section shall be liable to the franchised or otherwise duly licensed cable television system for the greater of five thousand dollars.three times the amount of actual damages,if any,sustained by the plaintiff,plus reasonable attorney fees,former subd.d.the trial court agreed with the defendant that section,former subdivision d presupposed a criminal conviction,and granted the defendant motion for judgment.heritage,supra,at,d.
the court of appeal,reversing,concluded a criminal conviction under penal code section was not a prerequisite to civil liability under section,former subdivision d.heritage,supra,th at,d.the court found no ambiguity,uncertainty,or doubt about the meaning of the phrase person who violates,and stated the noun form of violates,violation,means injury infringement breach of right,duty or law ravishment seduction.the act of breaking,infringing,or transgressing the law.citation.none of these meanings require a prefatory criminal conviction.conviction generally means the result of a criminal trial which ends in a judgment or sentence that the accused is guilty as charged.citation.there is simply no need for further judicial construction of section,former subdivision d.heritage,supra,at,d.
the court of appeal added that this plain meaning interpretation of the phrase person who violates is consistent with the statutory objective.heritage,supra,th at,d.the deterrent effect of the criminal sanction for theft of cable television is illusory because it is commonly supposed that law enforcement officials consider theft of cable services to be a low priority crime ibid.thus,the purpose of the statute would be defeated if the statute operated to condition civil liability upon criminal liability.ibid.
a criminal conviction likewise is not a prerequisite to recovery of treble damages by any person injured by a violation of section a.had the legislature intended to make a criminal conviction a prerequisite to treble damage liability under section c,it easily could have said so.
although we find no ambiguity or uncertainty in section c,we note that our construction is consistent with the statutory purpose expressed in the legislative history.that history was explained in citizens of humanity,llc costco
