catherine ryan,the defendant appellee,operated her vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.she disobeyed a traffic signal and collided with cameron logan vehicle.logan vehicle then spun out of control and struck robert wilhelm vehicle.logan later died from injuries suffered in the accident.ryan pleaded guilty to vehicular homicide as a result of causing logan death.
wilhelm brought a civil suit against ryan claiming negligence,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and negligent infliction of emotional distress.wilhelm sought compensatory and punitive damages for his claims.before trial,ryan sent wilhelm an offer of judgment for.wilhelm rejected the offer and the case went to a trial before a jury.the jury returned a verdict in wilhelm favor and awarded him in compensatory damages.as the prevailing party,wilhelm filed a motion for costs under superior court civil rule d.the trial judge granted wilhelm motion for his costs incurred before the offer of judgment,but denied his motion for his costs incurred after the offer of judgment.moreover,the trial judge granted ryan her costs incurred after the offer of judgment under superior court civil rule.
on appeal wilhelm raises three claims of error the trial judge erred by denying his motion in limine to exclude ryan testimony about her criminal conviction and remorse for her actions the trial judge erred by denying his motion for a new trial or additur and the trial judge erred by failing to grant him the costs he incurred after ryan offer of judgment.because the trial judge acted within his discretion and committed no legal error,we affirm.
on may,ryan operated her motor vehicle on route in new castle county while she was under the influence of alcohol.ryan,who drove at approximately mph,disobeyed a traffic signal and collided with logan vehicle.logan vehicle then spun out of control and struck wilhelm vehicle.after the collision,wilhelm got out of his vehicle and attempted to help logan and ryan.wilhelm approached logan vehicle and observed logan bleeding from his eyes,mouth,nose and ears.wilhelm then attempted to assist logan with his injuries logan died shortly after the accident,and wilhelm witnessed logan death.
because of the accident,wilhelm developed pain in his neck and back wilhelm visited his primary physician on may,to discuss his physical injuries and the shock of witnessing logan death.wilhelm also had an mri scan.this mri scan,according to ryan medical expert,revealed substantially the same condition that a mri scan had indicated wilhelm visited his physician two more times in the summer of wilhelm did not visit his physician again until january of when he again complained of severe neck pain.wilhelm physician then ordered him to undergo another mri scan.this mri scan revealed a major disc herniation that the earlier mris did not reveal on august,two years after his accident with ryan,wilhelm had surgery to repair two herniated discs in his back 
wilhelm filed a lawsuit against ryan for negligence,intentional infliction of emotional distress,negligent infliction of emotional distress and punitive damages.in addition to pain and suffering,wilhelm claimed that he sustained wage loss and medical bills of directly resulting from ryan negligence.
the case went to trial before a jury.ryan conceded liability and contested damages.a superior court jury returned a verdict granting wilhelm in compensatory damages and no punitive damages after the trial,the trial judge awarded wilhelm,as the prevailing party,his costs incurred before the offer of judgment,but required wilhelm to pay both his and ryan costs incurred after the offer of judgment because ryan timely offer of judgment exceeded the jury award.
ii.wilhelm claims on appeal 
wilhelm claim that the trial judge erred by denying his motion in limine to exclude ryan testimony about her criminal conviction and remorse over logan death.
before trial,wilhelm filed a motion in limine to exclude ryan testimony about ryan criminal conviction,remorse for her actions,and planned reconciliation with logan mother the trial judge denied wilhelm motion.
wilhelm now claims that the trial judge abused his discretion by failing to grant his motion in limine to exclude ryan testimony because ryan testimony about her criminal conviction both the crime to which she pleaded guilty and the sentence she received was not admissible under delaware common law.wilhelm also argues that ryan testimony,if admissible under delaware common law,was irrelevant or,if relevant,was unfairly prejudicial.ryan counters by asserting that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by admitting her testimony about her criminal punishment because the testimony was relevant and highly probative to mitigate wilhlem claim for punitive damages.therefore,the primary issue with respect to this contention is whether delaware law allows a defendant earlier criminal conviction to be admitted to mitigate a plaintiff civil claim for punitive damages when the plaintiff civil claim for punitive damages arises from the same actions for which the defendant received a criminal sentence.whether delaware permits a party to introduce evidence of a criminal conviction to mitigate a civil claim for punitive damages is a question of law.we review questions of law de novo 
in his opening brief,wilhelm relied on armstrong and keller to suggest that delaware common law prohibited the admission of ryan testimony to mitigate punitive damages putting aside the fact that these cases are over years old,wilhelm reliance is misplaced.neither armstrong nor keller involved a claim for punitive damages in both cases the superior court merely held that evidence of a criminal conviction could not be admitted to mitigate compensatory damages.
we would not be able to conclude that the trial judge legally erred by failing to follow either armstrong or keller.ryan counsel,following his ethical duty to cite all relevant cases,however,brought jefferson to our attention in his answering brief we discuss jefferson to remove any confusion about whether a defendant earlier criminal conviction is admissible to mitigate a plaintiff civil claim for punitive damages.
in jefferson,the plaintiff brought a civil lawsuit against the defendant for compensatory and punitive damages because the defendant forcibly entered the plaintiff home and violently assaulted him.by the time of trial in the plaintiff civil case,the defendant had been convicted and sentenced for a criminal offense.the defendant contended that his criminal conviction and substantial fine barred the plaintiff claim for punitive damages,or in the alternative,were proper evidence admissible to mitigate punitive damages.the trial judge determined that the plaintiff claim for punitive damages was not barred and that the defendant criminal conviction was not admissible to mitigate punitive damages 
it was for the jury to say whether there were circumstances of aggravation in this case,which ought in their judgment,to require a departure from the general rule of compensatory damages and which called on them to add any thing by way of public example or punishment.as to the proceedings in the criminal court,they were not evidence,and could not have been given in evidence in this case,and were not to enter into the consideration of the jury in deciding it either as to the propriety of a verdict against the defendants,or for the amount of the damages.the indictment was between other parties the state and these defendants,and not this plaintiff and the defendants the verdict was rendered upon other testimony than that given in this case even upon the testimony of the plaintiff himself and his wife and the punishment,if any such has been inflicted,had reference to the public peace and not to this plaintiff wrongs.it would obviously,therefore,be improper that these proceedings in the criminal court should enter into the present case for any purpose 
jefferson suggests that evidence of a defendant criminal conviction should not be admissible where a plaintiff brings a civil claim for punitive damages out of the same set of facts because criminal punishment and punitive damages serve two separate purposes.in other words,criminal punishment provides retribution for the public while punitive damages provide retribution for the plaintiff.we can endorse jefferson for the proposition that a defendant earlier criminal conviction does not bar a plaintiff civil claim for punitive damages on double jeopardy grounds but we can not follow jefferson apparent holding that a defendant criminal conviction is not relevant to mitigate an award of punitive damages in other words,we think the preferable rule is that a defendant criminal conviction will not prohibit a plaintiff civil claim for punitive damages,but the defendant will be permitted to admit evidence of her criminal conviction to mitigate any award of punitive damages one recent case discussing punitive damages is consistent with this rule.in jardel company,hughes we stated 
a majority of jurisdictions now accept that punitive damages serve a dual punish wrongdoers and deter others from similar conduct.this dual purpose is reflected in of the restatement second of torts,which provides in part punitive damages are damages,other than compensatory or nominal damages,awarded against a person to punish him for his outrageous conduct and to deter him and others like him from similar conduct in the future.
the rationale underlying punitive damages has caused them to be characterized as civil penalties which serve as a substitute for criminal prosecution for conduct which,though criminal,often goes unpunished by the public prosecutor 
while this language does not squarely address the question of whether a defendant should be permitted to admit evidence of his criminal conviction to mitigate a civil claim for punitive damages,it clearly implies that the admission of the criminal conviction would be the only logical result.because our case law recognizes that punitive damages can be awarded both to punish the defendant and to deter others for similar conduct,and because punitive damages traditionally served as civil penalties to substitute for criminal prosecution,it logically follows that the jury should be permitted to consider the amount of punishment the defendant has already received in the criminal action against her in order to determine whether to award punitive damages.in other words,because punitive damages and criminal prosecution serve the same purpose to punish the defendant,the jury should have the opportunity to consider the defendant criminal punishment crime and sentence when assessing punitive damages.therefore,because the trial judge acted in conformity with delaware law,we find that he did not abuse his discretion by admitting ryan criminal conviction for vehicular homicide to mitigate wilhelm claim for punitive damages.
wilhelm also argues that the trial judge abused his discretion by admitting ryan testimony about her conviction,remorse for her actions,and her plan of reconciliation with logan mother because the testimony was irrelevant,or in the alternative,unfairly prejudicial.rulings on whether evidence is irrelevant or unfairly prejudicial are matters within the discretion of the trial judge that we will reverse only upon a showing of an abuse of discretion 
here,we can not find that the trial judge abused his discretion.as discussed above,one purpose of punitive damages is to punish the defendant.certainly ryan conviction,remorse,and her intended reconciliation with logan mother were relevant to mitigate any need to punish ryan financially.likewise,we can not find that the trial judge abused his discretion by determining that the probative value of ryan testimony was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice the mitigating value of ryan testimony,an acknowledgement of the impact of her actions on herself,outweighed any danger that the jury would feel sympathy for ryan,a convicted felon,and allow that sympathy to affect its award of compensatory damages.moreover,assuming that any jury could be sympathetic to a felon convicted of killing someone as a result of drunk driving,the trial judge prevented any danger that the jury would allow that sympathy to enter into their verdict when he instructed the jury before deliberations.at the beginning of his instruction the trial judge stated 
you have been chosen and sworn as jurors to decide issues of fact.you must perform these duties without bias for or against the parties.the law does not allow you to be influenced by sympathy,prejudice,or public opinion 
near the end of the jury instruction,the trial judge reiterated what he said earlier 
ladies and gentlemen,your verdict must be based solely on the evidence in the case.you must not be governed by prejudice,sympathy,or any other motive except a fair and impartial consideration of the evidence.you must not,under any circumstances,allow any sympathy that you might have for any of the parties to influence you in any way in arriving at your verdict.i am not telling you not to sympathize with the parties.it is only natural and human to sympathize with the persons involved in litigation.you must not allow that sympathy to enter into your consideration of the case or to influence your verdict.
we presume that the jury followed these instructions 
wilhelm claim that the trial judge erred by failing to grant additur or a new trial.
after the jury verdict,wilhelm filed a motion for a new trial for damages or,alternatively,additur.wilhelm claimed that the jury award was so grossly disproportionate that it should have shocked the trial judge conscience.in support of his claim that the jury award was grossly inadequate,wilhelm cited to the fact that liability was not in dispute and the uncontested evidence that he incurred lost wages and medical expenses of.ryan countered claiming that there was substantial evidence supporting the jury verdict namely,evidence suggesting that wilhelm back injuries and the expenses allegedly related to them did not result from ryan admitted negligence.the trial judge denied wilhelm motion for a new trial and additur.wilhelm now claims that the trial judge erred by denying his motion.
we review a trial judge denial of a motion for additur for an abuse of discretion we have recently discussed the standard for granting additur.in young frase,we stated 
under delaware law,enormous deference is given to jury verdicts.in the face of any reasonable difference of opinion,courts will yield to the jury decision.it follows that,in the absence of exceptional circumstances,the validity of damages determined by the jury should likewise be presumed.accordingly,a jury award should be set aside only in the unusual case where it is clear that the award is so grossly out of proportion to the injuries suffered as to shock the court conscience and sense of justice.
a jury award will meet this standard when it is so inadequate that it must have been based on passion,prejudice or misconduct rather than on an objective consideration of the trial evidence.therefore,as a practical test,a court presented with a request for additur must review the record and determine whether the jury award of damages is within a range supported by the evidence.as long as there is a sufficient evidentiary basis for the amount of the award,the jury verdict should not be disturbed by a grant of additur or a new trial as to damages.this court will not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court in determining issues of granting additur or a new trial 
here,wilhelm presented evidence that he suffered in medical expenses and wages.most of these expenses and losses arose from wilhelm back surgery in.wilhelm claimed that he required back surgery as a result of his accident with ryan.as the trial judge stated when denying the motion for a new trial or additur,the jury obviously did not find that ryan negligence caused the need for wilhelm back surgery.
the jury certainly could have found that wilhlem back surgery and the corresponding in damages were not related to his accident with ryan based on the fact that wilhelm was involved in two previous car accidents in and,and after those accidents,was told by his physicians that he needed surgery even if that alone were not enough,the jury also could have found that wilhelm back injury and surgery bore no relationship to his accident with ryan because wilhelm did not have back surgery until after a february mri revealed a worse condition that,according to ryan medical expert,was not medically related to any injury wilhelm received in the accident of may.ryan medical expert,who examined wilhelm in preparation for trial,testified 
q just one or two other things i would ask of you.i would ask that when you do have to render opinions today that you render those opinions to a reasonable medical probability,which basically means that something,some particular fact is more likely than not 
q but one question that i have to ask you is whether there is a relationship between the may accident and the problems,especially the surgery that occurred in that occurred in february of and subsequent surgery in august of 
a right.it is clear,it is absolutely clear in my mind that may,was just a spike in the chronology of events.that,in and of itself,did not cause a disc herniation.this herniation occurred spontaneously independent of the auto accident of may,in february of.that is when the symptoms occurred,symptoms that when all complaints changed,that is when we saw a new mri of the cervical spine being acquired,what had been acquired since.everything changed in 
q did you conclude that there was any injury that wilhelm suffered as a result of the automobile accident in may of.
a again,i was there to see him there,wanting to that auto accidents will often times cause strains and sprains and whiplash type injuries.it was something severe,it was and vitt reports indicate things got better.he stopped treating.
in sum,the jury could properly rely on the physician testimony that,within a reasonable medical probability,the may,accident did not cause the condition revealed by the february mri and was just a spike in the chronology of events between the two earlier accidents meriting surgery and the mri and surgery in.the jury award did fairly reflect strains and sprains that were not severe and that got better.
the evidence also supported the jury decision to award little,if any,damages for wilhelm claims of emotional distress.wilhelm claimed that he suffered severe emotional distress because he witnessed the death of logan,but provided no medical evidence that he did so.he never received treatment from a psychologist,psychiatrist,or counselor resulting from the impact the accident had on him.moreover,at trial,a disinterested police officer disputed wilhelm testimony about the extent of his involvement in helping which wilhelm claimed caused him severe distress this evidence obviously supports a finding that wilhelm could not have suffered severe emotional distress as a result of witnessing logan injuries or death.in sum,we can not find that the trial judge abused his discretion by denying wilhelm motion for additur because there was some evidence to support the jury limited award of compensatory damages.
we also can not find that the trial judge abused his discretion by denying wilhelm motion for a new trial.the denial of a motion for a new trial will constitute an abuse of discretion if the jury verdict was against the great weight of the evidence,no reasonable jury could have reached the result,and the denial was untenable and unreasonable.for the reasons discussed above,the jury verdict was not against the great weight of the evidence because there was ample evidence supporting the jury verdict.
wilhelm claim that the granting in part and denial in part of plaintiff motion for costs under.civ.d was an abuse of discretion and clear error of law.
before trial,ryan sent wilhelm an offer of judgment for.wilhelm rejected the offer and the jury returned a verdict in wilhelm favor for.after trial,wilhelm,as the prevailing party,filed a motion for costs under superior court rule d.wilhelm claimed that he was entitled to his costs incurred both before and after the offer of judgment.ryan countered claiming that she was entitled to her costs incurred after the offer of judgment under superior court civil rule because the offer of judgment exceeded the jury verdict.moreover,ryan contended that wilhelm was not entitled to any costs incurred before or after the offer of judgment,under greenage ward the trial judge declined to follow greenage and granted wilhelm his costs incurred before the offer of judgment but denied him his costs incurred after the offer of judgment.the trial judge also granted ryan her costs incurred after the offer of judgment.
wilhelm now contends on appeal that the trial judge erred by denying him his costs incurred after the offer of judgment.wilhelm claim requires us to analyze rule d and rule.rule d provides 
except when express provision therefor is made either in a statute or in these rules or in the rules of the supreme court,costs shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party upon application to the court within ten days of the entry of final judgment unless the court otherwise directs.
rule provides 
at any time more than days before the trial begins a party defending against a claim may serve upon the adverse party an offer to allow judgment to be taken against the defending party for the money or property or to the effect specified in the offer,with costs then accrued.if within days after the service of the offer the adverse party serves written notice that the offer is accepted,either party may then file the offer and notice of acceptance together with proof of service thereof and thereupon the clerk shall enter judgment.an offer not accepted shall be deemed withdrawn and evidence thereof is not admissible except in a proceeding to determine costs.if the judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not more favorable than the offer,the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer.the fact that an offer is made but not accepted does not preclude a subsequent offer.when the liability of one party to another has been determined by verdict or order or judgment,but the amount or extent of the liability remains to be determined by further proceedings,the party adjudged liable may make an offer of judgment,which shall have the same effect as an offer made before trial if it is served within a reasonable time not less than days prior to the commencement of hearings to determine the amount or extent of liability.
wilhelm contends that it is clear from a plain reading of rule d that plaintiff shall be awarded costs as the prevailing party,and that costs must be read to include those incurred both before and after the offer of judgment.wilhelm suggests that rule d grants the prevailing party a virtual unqualified right to costs.wilhelm argument lacks merit.wilhelm ignores the fact that rule d states that except when express provision therefore is made in these rules.certainly this phrase makes the qualifying party right to receive costs subject to rule.
rule expressly provides that if the judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not more favorable than the offer,the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer.reading this provision in connection with rule d,we find that rule subjects the prevailing party right to costs incurred after a proper offer of judgment is filed to the condition that he be awarded an amount in excess of that offer of judgment.rule does not place any condition on the prevailing party recovery of costs incurred before the offer of judgment,but does condition the recovery of costs incurred after an offer of judgment on the offeree receiving an award in excess of the offer of judgment.
our interpretation of rule and rule d is consistent with rule purpose.the purpose of rule is to encourage settlement by shifting the risk of proceeding with the lawsuit to the offeree if we accepted wilhelm contention and interpreted rule d and rule to mean that the offeree is always entitled to his costs if he prevails including costs incurred after the offer of judgment when the verdict is less than the offer of judgment then very little risk would shift to the offeree.the offeree would
