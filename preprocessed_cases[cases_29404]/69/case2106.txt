a jury awarded plaintiffs mark lewis and his wife,shirley hackett,million in damages arising from lewis shipyard exposure to asbestos products manufactured by john crane,crane crane seeks reversal of the judgment,contending that it resulted from jury misconduct,prejudicial errors in the admission of evidence,and an improper special verdict form.in the alternative,crane contends that the trial court miscalculated the amount of the offset it was entitled to for plaintiffs settlements and improperly awarded expert witness fees to hackett.plaintiffs,asserting that crane settlement offset was overstated.
we modify the judgment to reduce crane settlement credit against lewis economic damages by and affirm it in all other respects.we also affirm the order awarding expert witness fees.
background 
lewis worked for the navy at the mare island naval shipyard from until.from to he was employed as a pipefitter working on nuclear submarines and surface craft.from until he worked as a quality assurance inspector in the nuclear inspection division.between and he worked as an inspector leader,and then as a supervisor in the inspection division.
lewis duties as a pipefitter included removing and replacing packing materials used to seal valves and gaskets used to seal pipe joints.such tasks were routinely performed as part of the process of overhauling submarines and surface vessels brought to mare island.as an inspector and supervisor,lewis was present from time to time observing others removing and installing packing materials and gaskets.while working as a pipefitter,lewis also handled thermal insulation materials and worked alongside insulators who were removing and applying such materials to pipes.much of the pipefitting and insulation work took place in confined spaces where pipefitters and insulators worked in close proximity.lewis did not wear a respirator or protective clothing.lewis smoked cigarettes for years,quitting in.
crane sold asbestos packing materials and gaskets to the navy.crane products were commonly used at mare island and were present in ships on which lewis worked.there was testimony that crane packing products were the predominant brand of packing used at mare island.lewis was also exposed to packing materials,gaskets,and insulation furnished by many other manufacturers,including garlock,owens corning,and.
lewis began to exhibit symptoms of lung disease in april.diagnostic tests indicated that lewis had mesothelioma,an invariably fatal form of cancer caused by asbestos exposure.medical experts and treating physicians called by lewis testified that they believed lewis had mesothelioma to a high degree of medical certainty.more invasive tests that could have definitively established this diagnosis were not performed because the cancer had progressed so far that the risks associated with such tests outweighed the benefits.
at the time of his diagnosis,lewis was years old.he had been married to shirley hackett for years.lewis and hackett had an son,and lewis also had a son by a prior marriage.
lewis and hackett sued crane and dozens of other companies involved in the use,distribution,or manufacturing of products,seeking damages for lewis personal injury and hackett loss of consortium.prior to trial,plaintiffs settled with more than of the defendants for sums totaling.the settlement agreements included language purporting to release the settling defendants from all claims arising from lewis exposure to asbestos,including potential future wrongful death claims by his heirs,and an undertaking by lewis to hold such defendants harmless from any loss or damage caused by the bringing of such claims.
plaintiffs proceeded to a jury trial against crane on the theory that its products were defective in design in that they failed to meet the ordinary consumer expectation of safety and were a substantial factor in causing lewis illness.crane presented testimony disputing lewis evidence that his illness was mesothelioma,and disputing whether crane products were unsafe or could have been a substantial source of lewis asbestos exposure.
after a trial,the jury found crane liable and determined that lewis had incurred in economic damages and million in noneconomic damages as a result of his illness.hackett noneconomic damages for loss of consortium were found to be.the jury determined that crane comparative fault for the plaintiffs noneconomic damages was percent.crane motions for a new trial and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict were denied.the trial court ruled that crane was entitled to a credit of against lewis economic damages based on plaintiffs settlements.
crane timely appealed from the judgment and ensuing orders,and filed a separate appeal from a posttrial order awarding expert witness fees to hackett.plaintiffs in from the order establishing crane settlement credit.before the close of briefing,we consolidated the appeals and for oral argument and decision.
ii.discussion 
calculation of settlement credit 
the jury awarded lewis in economic damages for lost income and medical expenses.after trial,plaintiffs moved for an order determining how much of the settlement funds plaintiffs received from other defendants should be offset against crane liability for lewis economic damages.both parties appeal from the resulting order.
crane contends that the trial court attributed too high a portion of the settlement to potential wrongful death claims of lewis heirs,thereby understating the credit to which it is entitled.plaintiffs argue the court followed the wrong formula and attributed too little of the settlement to shirley hackett loss of consortium claim,thereby overstating crane credit.we find merit in plaintiffs position.
background 
in addition to the economic damages awarded to lewis in this case,the jury also awarded lewis noneconomic damages of million for his pain and suffering and awarded his spouse,shirley hackett,million in noneconomic damages for her loss of consortium damages incurred between the time of lewis diagnosis and his death.
civil code section,subdivision a,provides in any action for personal injury,property damage,or wrongful death,based upon principles of comparative fault,the liability of each defendant for damages shall be several only and shall not be joint.each defendant shall be liable only for the amount of damages allocated to that defendant in direct proportion to that defendant percentage of fault,and a separate judgment shall be rendered against that defendant for that amount.this section,enacted by the voters in as part of proposition,has been held applicable to strict liability asbestos exposure cases.see wilson john crane,th,d wilson arena owens corning fiberglas th,d.
under proposition,crane is jointly and severally liable for the full amount of lewis economic damages along with all other defendants found to be at fault.however,as to lewis and hackett combined noneconomic award of million,crane is liable only to the extent of its percentage share of comparative fault as determined by the jury,percent.
prior to trial,lewis and hackett entered into a series of settlement agreements with other defendants.these agreements purported to settle any and all claims arising from lewis exposure to asbestos,including lewis personal injury claims,hackett loss of consortium claims,and any wrongful death claims that might be brought against the settling defendants 
in the future by hackett and by lewis two sons.none of the settlement agreements allocated the total amount to be paid between economic and noneconomic damages or among the different potential claimants.with the exception of a single settlement agreement signed by lewis older son,lewis children did not sign the agreements.however,the settlements included agreements whereby lewis and hackett,for themselves and their estates,promised to hold the settling defendants harmless against any potential wrongful death claims brought by lewis heirs.
under code of civil procedure section,crane was entitled to a credit against its liability for lewis economic damages for any portion of the plaintiffs settlement proceeds that were properly attributable to lewis economic
