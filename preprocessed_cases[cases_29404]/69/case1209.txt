these consolidated appeals present the question of whether the bureau of prisons bop,the federal agency responsible for the incarceration of inmates,may require inmates who participate in the bureau inmate financial responsibility program ifrp to pay restitution to victims at a higher or faster rate than was specified by the sentencing court,without obtaining an order from the sentencing court directing or approving the larger payments.we conclude that the bop may do so.
background 
christopher lemoine was,after a guilty plea,convicted of one count of wire fraud in violation of.that proceeding was in the central district of california.lemoine was sentenced to imprisonment for months,to serve five years thereafter on supervised release,and to pay restitution in the total amount of,pursuant to the mandatory victims restitution act mvra.the judgment and order entered by the district court required that lemoine pay restitution during his imprisonment at the rate of not less than per quarter,and pursuant to the bureau of prisons inmate financial responsibility program.the order required lemoine to make monthly payments of at least while on supervised release.
after he began serving his sentence at the medium security facility operated by the bop in sheridan,oregon,lemoine enrolled in the ifrp.as a condition of his participation in the program,the bop required that lemoine pay restitution at a rate of per month,a dollar figure and a frequency higher than the not less than per quarter specified in the court judgment.lemoine filed a motion with the sentencing court,the central district of california,to modify the judgment.he argued that the court had improperly delegated its authority to schedule restitution payments and raised a series of challenges,relying on united states gunning,cir gunning i,and united states gunning,cir gunning ii.
the district court denied lemoine motion,reasoning that the only duty which the ninth circuit has held under the mvra is that of scheduling restitution payments.here,the court did not delegate scheduling to the bop.it set the payment schedule as quarterly in its restitution order.page of cal.order entered october,which is er in the oregon case originally assigned to us.the court also noted that the phrase pursuant to the bureau of prisons inmate financial responsibility program was included in the judgment because the court assumed sub silentio that the defendant would choose to participate in the voluntary ifrp program to qualify for certain benefits and advantages,indicating that the order did not mandate lemoine participation and stating that lemoine did so choose to voluntarily participate in the program,agreeing to pay per month.the court declined to reach the merits of lemoine challenges to the ifrp itself because they were raised in his reply brief and because such challenges are properly made in a habeas petition under,and the petition should be filed in the district court in which petitioner place of incarceration is located.cal.order,at.lemoine,acting pro se,filed multiple appeals from the decision of the central district of california,two of which are before us,and 
shortly after lemoine unsuccessful challenge to his sentence,the bop modified the schedule of restitution payments required from lemoine under the ifrp,setting it as the minimum amount permitted under lemoine sentencing order per quarter.the record does not make clear the reason for the change.nonetheless,lemoine followed the suggestion contained in the order entered by the central district of california,and in january filed a pro se habeas petition in the district of oregon,where he was then incarcerated.that court issued an opinion and order on july.
lemoine district of oregon petition presented three challenges.first,he argued that the sentencing order impermissibly delegated authority to the bop to set his restitution repayment schedule.the oregon district court said it declined to reach this claim because it was the subject of the direct appeal from the central district order and was thus not ripe for collateral attack.later in the order,though,the oregon district court seemed to reject this challenge,by stating that here the sentencing court set a schedule for making restitution payments during incarceration and therefore did not unlawfully delegate that authority to the bop.
second,lemoine contended that the ifrp violated the equal protection clause by treating otherwise similarly situated prisoners differently based on whether they had the ability to pay their restitution.the oregon district court rejected this contention,stating that rational basis review applied because prisoners were not members of a suspect class and the ifrp did not impinge upon any fundamental rights.it held that the ifrp was rationally related to the legitimate governmental purpose of enforcing sentencing orders and ensuring that inmates fulfill their financial obligations to make good the harm they visited upon their victims.the court found that the ifrp furthered this purpose by offering inmates incentives to work and pay their debts during their imprisonment and imposing consequences,within constitutional bounds,for failing to do so.the court order cited several precedents and quoted specifically from gunning ii and stated that the ninth circuit implicitly endorsed the ifrp in that decision.
finally,lemoine argued that the bop lacked the authority to increase his restitution repayment rate above the per quarter minimum the sentencing court established in its judgment.the oregon district court agreed with that challenge.the court held congress mandate in the mvra to be clear the sentencing court shall specify in the restitution order the manner in which,and the schedule according to which,the restitution is to be paid citing f.it noted that the ninth circuit had interpreted the provision as decisive when it held in gunning ii that the district court must determine the restitution payment schedule.the court concluded that,t hough the ninth circuit has not yet considered whether the bop may increase an inmate restitution payment amount without a court order,i find that allowing the bop to modify the payment schedule in any way,without court approval,amounts to an equally impermissible delegation of authority as allowing the bop to create the payment schedule.
with respect to the potentially voluntary nature of the new payment schedule,the oregon district court found that lemoine agreed to pay the higher rate only to avoid the adverse consequences of failing to do so.it held that the bop modification of lemoine restitution payment schedule pursuant to the development of a financial plan under the ifrp was in excess of its authority and therefore not in accordance with law,and on that basis granted lemoine petition and ordered the bop to maintain the schedule at per quarter.the government appealed,and that appeal has been assigned by our court.
the three pending appeals,and from the central district of california,and from the district of oregon,have all been assigned to this panel as related cases.by separate order we have consolidated the three appeals,and we resolve all three in this opinion.specifically,we affirm the orders and judgment of the district court for the central district of california in and,and we reverse the order and judgment of the district of oregon in.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo a district court decision to grant or deny a petition for writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to.khotesouvan morones,cir.
we hold that the bop operation of the ifrp does not constitute an unlawful delegation of authority to schedule restitution repayments in violation of the mvra.the mvra requires the sentencing court to set a restitution repayment schedule.the sentencing court did that here.the mvra does not prohibit an inmate from voluntarily making larger or more frequent payments than what was set by the sentencing court.nor does it limit the authority of the bop,through the ifrp,to offer incentives to inmates to pay their restitution obligations in larger amounts or at a faster rate than the court has required 
we also reject lemoine argument that his
