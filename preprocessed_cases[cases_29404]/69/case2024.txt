costs were awarded in favor of plaintiffs and against defendants.defendants have filed timely appeals.plaintiffs also appeal.
navas contends on appeal as follows.isabel signed a consent form which she had the ability to read and understand,and she was verbally given informed consent.the procedures were not negligently performed on her.the trial court erred in presenting the jury with an ambiguous general verdict form,rather than the special verdict form requested by all parties and.the trial court erred in awarding costs under code of civil procedure section,as plaintiffs failed to obtain a more favorable outcome.
dunkelman contends on appeal as follows.a physician who examines a patient can not be held liable for the treating physician subsequent failure to obtain informed consent.the trial court erred in providing the jury with an ambiguous general verdict form that did not provide for a special finding of informed consent as distinct from medical malpractice.the trial court prejudicially erred in prohibiting defendants experts from testifying about standards of informed consent,while allowing plaintiffs experts to provide such testimony favorable to plaintiffs and.the trial court prejudicially erred in awarding costs under code of civil procedure section,where plaintiffs received a judgment against dunkelman for less than the amount requested in their statutory offer.
cedars towers contends on appeal as follows.a signed consent form indicating the patient was informed of the procedures risks and complications is conclusive evidence of informed consent.the trial court prejudicially erred in presenting the jury with a verdict form that allowed the jury to find cedars towers independently liable and did not distinguish between medical malpractice and informed consent.the trial court prejudicially erred in prohibiting defendants experts from testifying about standards of informed consent,while allowing plaintiffs experts to provide such testimony favorable to plaintiffs and.the trial court prejudicially erred in awarding costs under code of civil procedure section,where plaintiffs received a judgment for less than the amount requested in their statutory offer.

events prior to the surgery 
isabel testimony 
isabel sought treatment from dunkelman in at the clinica medica general for gynecological problems,including vaginal bleeding and associated pain.isabel and dunkelman conversed in spanish.isabel thought dunkelman was a gynecologist.she eventually had surgery in june.
three days before the surgery,isabel was examined by dunkelman.isabel was suffering from a recurring problem of a pimple located on the right side of her vagina and excessive bleeding and related pain.sid kamrava had previously performed a procedure on a similar pimple,which provided prompt relief.dunkelman did not answer isabel questions about the pimple other than to say he would take care of it,although he did not indicate when it would be treated.isabel had expected the pimple to be treated in the office,as had been her experience with kamrava.isabel had never heard the word vulva in and did not know what it meant.dunkelman did not use the word lesion in describing the pimple,nor did he give her any options or tell her of any risks with having surgery in that area.
based upon isabel complaints,dunkelman suggested he referred to in spanish as a raspado,a word that translates into a cleaning or scraping.although unfamiliar with the term,isabel did not ask what raspado involved,because she trusted dunkelman.she knew she was going to be treated with a raspado at the surgery center for her bleeding problem.she did not know if she would be put under anesthesia or how long the procedure would last.isabel could not recall whether she had a raspado before.isabel did not know the meaning of the terms dilation and curettage d c dunkelman did not advise isabel orally or in writing concerning his financial relationship with the surgical center,nor did she have knowledge of the relationship.
dunkelman did not inform isabel that he recommended a procedure in which an instrument would be inserted through her abdomen into her stomach so doctors could see what was happening in there.before filing the lawsuit,isabel had never heard of a bartholin gland.the raspado was scheduled for three days after her last visit with dunkelman.she received no instructions about the raspado.she believed the raspado would be performed by dunkelman,because he was the person she went to see.
dunkelman testimony 
dunkelman saw isabel in march at the clinica medica general,at which time she complained of a variety of problems including pelvic pain,irregular menstrual cycles,recurrent urinary tract infections,dysmenorrheal,and metrorrhagia.his examination did not reveal any mass or lesion on her external genitalia,nor did her chart reflect any asymmetry of her right and left labia,and surgery was not indicated.
in april,isabel complained to dunkelman of pelvic pain,vaginal itching,irregular and heavy menstrual cycles,and abdominal distention.following an examination,dunkelman recommended,under anesthesia,a d c procedure,and a laparoscopy.his examination revealed a possible pelvic mass on the internal genitalia.
isabel returned to dunkelman later in april,complaining of vaginal bleeding,pelvic pain,irregular menstrual cycles,dysmenorrheal,and metrorrhagia.they discussed doing a d c and laparoscopy to find the cause of her problems.dunkelman did not find a pimple or lesion on her external genitalia.
dunkelman discussed the proposed procedures in spanish with isabel.he believed isabel read and spoke perfectly.dunkelman did a pelvic exam and wrote vaginitis vulvitis,meaning congestion and inflammation of the vulvar area and vagina,but did not document any lesions.he told isabel she needed the laparoscopy to check the origin of her pelvic pain.the d c would be performed to locate the source of the bleeding.isabel had several unremarkable ultrasounds that revealed no mass and were intended to confirm there was no pathology causing the pain in the lower abdomen and pelvis.the only suggestion of a mass was something dunkelman felt,combined with an ultrasound,that showed a slightly inhomogeneous mass.
at an examination on june,three days prior to the surgery,isabel complained of bleeding after her period,although she was not bleeding that day.she also complained of a right vulvar mass and gave him a history of that mass in the past.isabel described pain in the lower abdominal area,pain in the pelvic area,pain with the menstrual cycles and continued bleeding,and a lesion in the cervical area.in his examination,dunkelman found a pimple on the external genitalia,which he described as a right vulvar mass that had two previous episodes of infection.isabel said she had recurrent infections in that area and surgeries before,one of which had been done by dunkelman.
there are glands known as bartholin glands on both sides of the vagina at the and positions,which become cysts when full of liquid.the gland,located in the middle of the labia minora,provides lubrication of the vulvar area.dunkelman has treated many bartholin cysts,which are quite common.isabel said she had a cyst lanced in the past.dunkelman did not see a bartholin saw a very small solid mass in the middle of the vulvar area.dunkelman impression was that isabel had an indurated mass,but that it could be a bartholin cyst.the mass needed to be removed to find the problem for diagnosis.he wrote on her chart that isabel had a recurring infection of the bartholin cyst.
the best treatment of the cyst was to remove the solid mass or lesion and send it to pathology for diagnosis.dunkelman told isabel she could have the lesion removed or leave it.he explained the procedure could result in infection,pain,bleeding,or death.dunkelman expectation was that isabel could return to sexual relations without pain in four to six weeks.isabel decided to have the lesion removed.
dunkelman did not expect isabel condition to change in the next few days.isabel was in pain and wanted the operation that week,but dunkelman was not available.the best day for her was friday,and dunkelman told isabel that navas was available that day.she agreed.dunkelman directed isabel to the los angeles surgical center rather than other available locations,because it was very convenient and she knew the location from a prior surgery.dunkelman did not tell isabel he owned all the stock to the los angeles surgical center.dunkelman always informs his patients that he owns the los angeles surgical center.
dunkelman referred isabel to navas.dunkelman told isabel that navas worked for him and was his associate at cedars towers.dunkelman spoke to navas once before the surgery and two or three times after the surgery.most likely,dunkelman called navas,although he has no record of the call.he most likely told navas about the procedure,the symptoms,the complaints,physical findings,and the type of surgery.dunkelman told navas there was a small indurated lesion in the right vulvar area that was infected before and the lesion was to be removed.
dunkelman expected navas to examine isabel before the procedure,which could be done better under general anesthesia.navas told dunkelman he found the right vulvar lesion and removed it.navas said he found an indurated mass as described by dunkelman on june.from the pathology,dunkelman thought it was a benign lesion of the vulva.
no laboratory work was ordered the day before the surgery.isabel was given a piece of paper with orders.
english and spanish language signs had been present on the walls at the los angeles surgical center since it opened in,stating patients are welcomed by dunkelman,owner of the surgical center.the signs notify patients of their right to choose their own health provider.the signs were placed in a visible area based on the advice of an attorney.
dunkelman last saw isabel as a patient on july.
silvina sotelo 
sotelo,who speaks english and spanish,is the office supervisor at the los angeles surgical center,having worked there since it opened in or.the surgical center has a policy to contact patients to remind them of their appointments and to see if they understand the procedure they will be undergoing.sotelo called isabel,who said dunkelman had explained the procedure to her.isabel asked if navas was going to do the procedure,and sotelo replied yes.isabel said she was going to have a raspado,but sotelo also told her she was going to have a laparoscopy and excision of her vulvar mass.isabel said dunkelman explained that to her.the conversation was in spanish.
sotelo saw navas meet with isabel before the surgery in the area.sotelo spoke to isabel after the surgery and gave isabel a pad to use when isabel said she had some bleeding.sotelo gave isabel instructions to keep the wound clean and dry.isabel was given medication and ordered to return for a appointment the following tuesday.
c.the surgery and its aftermath 
isabel testimony regarding the surgery 
isabel arrived at the los angeles surgical center at on friday,june.a female employee gave isabel a stack of papers and told her where to sign and initial,which took five minutes.there was no place to sit and read the forms,and the person helping isabel with the paperwork seemed to be in a hurry.isabel was told to sign and initial a consent form written in spanish,which she could not read.isabel did not read the documents and did not ask the woman what she was signing.isabel did not know the meaning of the words vulvar,lesion,or excision,nor did she understand the meaning of aspiration or laparoscopy.isabel had never heard the terms laparoscopy or d c.she signed the forms without getting an explanation.no one at the los angeles surgical center referred to the procedures as surgery.
after changing into a gown and waiting several hours,a nurse gave isabel an isabel was unaware she was going to be put under general anesthesia.isabel did not see dunkelman on the day of surgery,was not spoken to by a doctor before surgery,and had no recollection of meeting navas.
after the operation,isabel woke up experiencing vaginal pain.a woman entered the room and told isabel to get dressed.isabel became frightened when she took off the hospital gown and noticed she was bleeding heavily.isabel was told this was normal and given a cotton pad to cover her vaginal area.
a few days later,isabel noticed stitches on the lip of her vagina in an area where the pimple had been.the area hurt when rubbed,such as by contact with her underwear or wiping after going to the bathroom.isabel was surprised to see stitches.she showed the area to her husband,who acted quiet and surprised.
isabel decided to try to see dunkelman on the tuesday after the surgery,but he was not at the clinica medica general.isabel told a female doctor she was not feeling well.she was examined in stirrups,but the doctor said there was nothing she could do for isabel.isabel was informed dunkelman would likely be back the following tuesday.
isabel saw dunkelman three weeks after the surgery.she did not ask to see navas,because she did not know about him and,in fact,first heard his name when she gathered her medical records after the surgery.dunkelman did not examine her and did not place her legs in the stirrups.he told her,when asked,that she could engage in sexual relations.
isabel was not sure when she had sexual intercourse with her husband again after the surgery in.intercourse was not painful before the surgery and took place two to three times per week.isabel went into depression over the thought that she was a young woman who could not have intercourse with her husband.her condition after the surgery impacted her ability to take care of her children,who are most important in her life.isabel stopped driving the children to activities as she had done before the surgery.she has not had intercourse with her husband since the operation in june.in and,she had intercourse with her husband perhaps once a month,but it was painful,very fast,and she could not experience different positions as before.she had to alter her clothing so that it did not rub against her.
ramon testimony 
up until,ramon sex life with isabel had a frequency of two to three times per week.isabel spent more time with the children before the operation.isabel showed ramon the results from the surgery.she looked scared,upset,and confused,and ramon was shocked.ramon saw missing parts and something that was not normal.after the surgery,isabel has pain on the right side of her vagina during intercourse.sexual intercourse after the operation is limited to once or twice a month and is painful for isabel.isabel is low,she feels depressed sometimes,and ramon has seen her crying.
navas testimony 
navas first heard of isabel in june,in a telephone conversation with dunkelman.dunkelman wanted navas to perform a surgery because dunkelman was not available.isabel chart does not document the phone call from dunkelman.
dunkelman told navas that isabel knew that navas would perform the surgery.dunkelman described isabel problems as including pelvic and back pain,heavy menstrual bleeding,and a lesion or mass in the labia or vulva that required excision.dunkelman said isabel had a procedure done on the mass once before,which sounded like a bartholin cyst where the aspirated fluid was withdrawn and indurated.dunkelman and navas had only one conversation about isabel before the surgery.
navas had a conversation with isabel sometime between and on june,before she was put under general anesthesia.the conversation with her lasted about three minutes.navas did not do a physical examination before general anesthesia.he did tell isabel he was a surgeon,but he did not know if isabel was aware that navas was not a gynecologist.
navas reviewed isabel laboratory values,her office visit form,the informed consent form,and a pelvic ultrasound report.the laboratory values were from tests in march,three months before the surgery.isabel said she had been bleeding from the vagina for prolonged periods of time,which might have had an affect on her laboratory values.
navas introduced himself to isabel,said that he was dunkelman associate,that he understood dunkelman had spoken to her about navas doing the operation,and that she was going to have an exam under anesthesia.he asked her several questions about the bleeding and the pain,and isabel explained the problems to navas.isabel told navas she had a sore area,describing it as either a nodule,a mass,or a lesion.isabel said she had aspirations or lancing procedures performed once or twice in the past.navas told her they would look at the area under anesthesia and remove the mass or lesion.they spoke about how much pain she would experience.navas explained that the laparoscopy procedure involved a small incision,putting a needle inside her,blowing in gas,and looking around with a scope.they would look at her organs,aspirate cysts,and biopsy lesions to arrive at a diagnosis.because isabel had a previous laparoscopy and d c,she was given short explanations of the procedures.the risks navas discussed with isabel were bleeding,scarring,and injury to the abdomen or the bowels.
navas performed an examination under anesthesia,finding a mass in the right labia,which he excised and sent to pathology for analysis.according to his operative notes,he removed a cystic lesion right under the skin of the labia and used two or three stitches to close up the area.an infected cyst could have been left alone,lanced,or removed.navas only offered to remove it or leave it alone.navas thought there was a small possibility isabel had a bartholin cyst.the surgery was uneventful.
navas spoke to isabel after the operation,but she was a little sleepy and he would not expect her to remember the conversation.navas expected that isabel could have intercourse four to six weeks after the surgery.dunkelman was to see isabel post operatively.
claudia frias 
frias is a registered nurse who began working at the los angeles surgical center in november.frias did not remember isabel,but worked with a patient with isabel name on june.patients at the los angeles surgical center filled out forms as directed by office staff.
frias was involved in filling out the nursing record after isabel was brought to the room.frias filled out,signed,and witnessed isabel consent form at.she could not tell from isabel records whether or not navas spoke to isabel before the consent form was signed.the consent form contains writing referencing examination under anesthesia,d c,laparoscopy,possible biopsy,possible aspiration,and excision of the vulvar lesion.frias is a native spanish speaker,but does not read spanish because she was never taught the language.frias did not remember if she saw isabel sign the consent form.frias signed the consent form because she was the one who filled it out.normally,someone in the office would obtain the patient signature.
frias did not know if she asked isabel if she understood the consent.her practice was to review the form with the patient to see if the patient agreed.she assumed isabel was spanish speaking.the consent form was signed on the spanish language side,with nothing written on the english language side.
expert testimony 
stephen pine plaintiffs expert 
stephen pine,an obstetrician and gynecologist,testified as plaintiffs expert witness on the standard of care.he has a practice and teaches at the university of southern california.pine saw isabel and reviewed navas report.he also read notes of the admission physical by dunkelman,the operation and surgical reports,the report of the defense expert witness albert phillips,and the admission paperwork from the los angeles surgery center.pine concluded that isabel had four procedures an examination under anesthesia,a d c,removal of tissue from her right vulva or vagina,and a laparoscopy.it appeared to pine that navas was doing the procedures dunkelman thought were necessary.pine found no mention in isabel history of pelvic pain and no documentation of pelvic masses so the laparoscopy was not necessary.pine was reluctant to criticize dunkelman for the laparoscopy,since he was not present at the examination,but based on isabel chart,showing no current blood work,normal ultrasounds,and one pelvic exam showing enlarged ovaries,he saw no indication for the laparoscopy.
the standard practice to justify a laparoscopy calls for talking with the patient.a mention of pelvic pain does not warrant an operation.according to a diagram drawn by dunkelman on june,isabel had a problem in the right labia minora,in the of the vulva.on june,dunkelman found what he thought was a bartholin cyst infection pine disagreed with dunkelman opinion.the pathology report revealed it to be a sebaceous cyst.if a lesion is palpated felt and barring any intervening treatment,pine would expect the lesion to be there three days later.one can not palpate a bartholin gland that is not cystic,because the gland is not normally enlarged.an acute bartholin gland can be very red and tender,requiring treatment when it reaches the acute abscess stage.the treatment calls for opening the area with a scalpel and putting in a catheter or a small tube for draining.it needs to drain before sealing or the abscess will continue.
pine believed navas did not examine isabel before putting her under general anesthesia,which did not comply with the standard of care.it is not ethical or proper to do surgery relying on another physician findings.it is not responsible to subject a patient to surgery without examination by the surgeon,who makes his or her own determination.the standard of care requires that the patient know who the surgeon was going to be.navas testified he had a conversation with the patient before surgery,which did not seem long enough to get the necessary information according to pine,but it was possible.
the laboratory work was done on isabel on march,three months before the surgery.as a result of her complaint of bleeding,pine was of the opinion current blood levels should have been obtained before the operation.the diagnosis was vulvar mass,but did not indicate the location of the mass.the operative report indicates there was excision,meaning removal.
the operative report stated that the patient complained of some back pain and a history of a right vulvar mass with recurrent infection as determined by pelvic examination of pelvic mass.isabel was advised to undergo excision of a mass that was not palpable,which confused pine.just as pine could not testify that the laparoscopy was indicated without more history,he did not think navas should have performed the laparoscopy because he did not examine isabel except under anesthesia.because navas performed his examination after isabel was under general anesthesia,he would not have been able to discuss with her whether to remove or do anything regarding the right vulvar mass,which is below the standard of care.
pine believed dunkelman thought isabel had a bartholin cyst,but navas removed a mass he did not palpate.navas removed a pimple,a little sebaceous area of what could turn into a sebaceous cyst.it was below the standard of care for navas to rely on dunkelman findings made hours earlier.there was no reason to remove the pimple based on an examination while isabel was asleep.in pine opinion,the proper operation under the circumstances was the d c,which was performed.the laparoscopy and the excision of the right vulvar mass were not justified within the standard of care,although the laparoscopy was performed competently and isabel suffered no harm from the procedure.
pine examined isabel and determined there was surgical removal of the labia minora on the right which was smaller than the same area on the left.pine agreed with the defense expert witness that isabel had a neuroma in the area removed.isabel had exquisite pain in the area on the right when examined.isabel explained that the area was painful to touch and during intercourse,and she considered it ugly.
a consent form indicates that the patient understands exactly what procedures are going to be performed and constitutes authorization that the patient gives consent for the procedures.the consent form was signed at and witnessed by frias.a progress note signed by navas indicates informed consent was done at.it would have been sufficient for purposes of introduction if dunkelman said navas was going to do the surgery and navas introduced himself before the operation.it is the physician duty to explain the procedures.
the procedures listed on the consent form were examination under anesthesia,d c,laparoscopy with possible biopsy and possible aspiration of the cystic fluid,and excision of the vulvar lesions.isabel told pine she knew she was having surgery,but it was not described to her by the surgeon who performed the operation,and she did not understand the laparoscopy procedure.
pine did not criticize the way in which navas performed the surgical procedures.he did,however,find fault with the process that lead isabel to the operating room and was of the opinion the procedures performed were unnecessary.
enid reed plaintiffs psychologist 
reed is a psychologist and neuropsychologist who met with isabel and her husband for evaluation.reed did not give isabel a psychological test because she did not expect valid results.reed found isabel to be suffering and having feelings of rage and grief.reed assessed isabel ability to give informed consent.reed concluded isabel lacked the ability to question authority figures.isabel believes what authority figures say is true and tends to follow their orders.isabel told her that if a doctor tells a hispanic to do something,the hispanic believes it.
for her entire life,isabel was a nonassertive person who accepted authority.reed gave as an example the fact that isabel never applied for a promotion at work at costco.reed was of the opinion isabel did not read spanish well.isabel reads some words in spanish without understanding their meaning.the pain isabel has during intercourse has practically destroyed her.isabel is depressed and afraid her husband will cheat on her.isabel mood swings,depression,and sleeping problems are classic signs of posttraumatic stress disorder.before the surgery,isabel and her husband had a close relationship,but ramon questions when isabel will be better.ramon is depressed and the children do not know what is wrong.
isabel feels betrayed by the doctors,whom she trusted.she feels the doctors should be held accountable,but has not sought treatment for her psychological condition.in reed opinion,isabel is not malingering.
albert phillips defense expert 
phillips is an.isabel had a history of heavy bleeding,which returned after an estrogen treatment.phillips agreed with pine that a d c was a procedure within the standard of care in response to isabel bleeding problems.phillips was also of the opinion that an exploratory laparoscopy was within the standard of care,because of isabel history of pelvic pain and heavy bleeding.
phillips opinion is that a sebaceous hyperplasia causing a painful and indurated mass in the right labia could be surgically excised within the standard of care.he did not see any indication before surgery of a sebaceous hyperplasia.excision of the mass from isabel was totally appropriate.the mass was removed by navas in a manner consistent with the standard of care.isabel had what phillips believed was congenital labia asymmetry,in that the left labia was larger than the right labia minora.
phillips was able to elicit pain in isabel during an examination.he opined that isabel formed a neuroma,which he described as a collection of nerves that incorporated into scar tissue.this occurred because of abnormal healing in the area,not because a procedure was done incorrectly.a neuroma in that area would cause pain during intercourse.the problem could be treated with a steroid injection,or through a procedure to cut out the tissue in hope that the new healing will not incorporate scar tissue or a neuroma.
barbara moyer defense psychologist 
moyer holds a in clinical psychology,with a specialty in neuropsychology.stress disorder is a set of symptoms in response to an extreme and potentially trauma.the syndrome is based upon an extreme event which is very much out of the realm of human experience.the reaction of isabel to her surgery is not the type of experience which would support the syndrome.isabel did not exhibit the symptoms of traumatic stress disorder to rule out malingering.moyer was not given an opportunity to personally evaluate isabel.
testimony regarding isabel prior treatments 
sid kamrava is a medical doctor who is board certified in obstetrics and gynecology and who treated isabel beginning in may.kamrava saw isabel as a patient in march and april,when she complained of heavy bleeding.he did a d c on isabel in april.she returned to his office on may,with an abscess of the bartholin gland,which he drained by making a tiny incision.a needle was used to withdraw fluids two days later from cysts left in the same area.a few weeks later,isabel returned complaining of pelvic pain.kamrava repaired her cystorectolele.he would not have done the procedures had isabel not understood them.
on august,isabel complained of swelling and pain on the left side of her genitalia.kamrava incised and drained a vulvar abscess on the left side.in february,isabel complained of pain with urination,discharge,and pelvic pain.she had a vaginal infection with a small ovarian cyst,a small uterine fibroid,and pain.
in april,isabel complained of heavy bleeding and some vaginal discharge.she did not complain that the pain interfered with sexual relations with her husband and no tenderness was noted.kamrava did not notice anything visually different in her external genitalia.
kamrava saw isabel again on march,at which time she complained of pain during intercourse and discharge.isabel said they had cut her vulva.kamrava impression was that isabel felt pain from a retroverted fibric uterus.her mood was normal.he did not note that the left side of her external genitalia was larger than the right.seventy percent of women are symmetrical,thirty percent are not.
after kamrava was deposed,isabel complained to him in june of pain on the right side of her genital area.the right labia had scar tissue tender to the patient and the lower part of her right labia minora was missing.isabel right labia was tender to palpation.
discussion 
iinformed consent issuesa.navas argument that isabel signed a consent form detailing the procedures to be performed,thereby acknowledging her informed consent.
navas argues that isabel consented to the procedures performed upon her on june,as evidenced by the form she signed.in so arguing,navas contends the record shows that isabel did read spanish,despite her contrary testimony.navas further argues that dunkelman and navas verbally advised isabel of the intended procedures,thereby constituting verbal informed consent.
navas argument is based on a view of the evidence impliedly rejected by the jury.while there is evidence in the record,which if believed by the jury would have supported a defense verdict,there also is abundant evidence to the contrary.under the substantial evidence rule,navas argument that informed consent was given is without merit.
when considering a claim of insufficient evidence on appeal,we do not reweigh the evidence,but rather determine whether,after resolving all conflicts favorably to the prevailing party,and according the prevailing party the benefit of all reasonable inferences,there is substantial evidence to support the judgment.scott pacific gas electric cal th,d.in reviewing the evidence on appeal,all conflicts must be resolved in favor of the judgment,and all legitimate and reasonable inferences indulged in to uphold the judgment if possible.when a judgment is attacked as being unsupported,the power of the appellate court begins and ends with a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,which will support the judgment.when two or more inferences can be reasonably deduced from the facts,the reviewing court is without power to substitute its deductions for those of the trial court.western states petroleum superior court cal th,d,crawford southern pacific cal d.
the doctrine of informed consent was explained as follows in arato avedon cal th,d,arato the fount of the doctrine of informed consent in california is our decision of some years ago in cobbs grant cal d,cobbs,an opinion by a unanimous court that built on several decisions significantly broadening the scope and character of the physician duty of disclosure in obtaining the patient consent to treatment.in cobbs,we not only anchored much of the doctrine of informed consent in a theory of negligence liability,but also laid down four postulates as the foundation on which the physician duty of disclosure rests.
the first of these postulates,we wrote,is that patients are generally persons unlearned in the medical sciences and therefore,except in rare cases,courts may safely assume the knowledge of patient and physician are not in parity.the second is that a person of adult years and in sound mind has the right,in the exercise of control over his own body,to determine whether or not to submit to lawful medical treatment.citation.
the third postulate,we continued,is that the patient consent to treatment,to be effective,must be an informed consent.and the fourth is that the patient,being unlearned in medical sciences,has an abject dependence upon and trust in his physician for the information upon which he relies during the decisional process,thus raising an obligation in the physician that transcends transactions.citation.from these ethical imperatives,we derived the obligation of a treating physician of reasonable disclosure of the available choices with respect to proposed therapy and of the dangers inherently and potentially involved in each.
the record,viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment,supports a finding that navas and dunkelman did not satisfy their obligation of reasonable disclosure of the available choices with respect to proposed therapy and of the dangers inherently and potentially involved in each.arato,supra,cal th at,d.isabel testified she was only told by dunkelman about the d c,but not about the laparoscopy or removal of a lesion.she further testified she never met navas prior to the surgery,and he did not discuss the procedures with her.isabel testified she was given forms to initial and sign,but she did not read spanish and the forms were not interpreted for her.isabel testified to her shock when she saw stitches after the procedures.there is no indication in the record that isabel was advised of possible disfigurement,excessive pain,or interference with her ability to have sexual intercourse.the jury determination of a lack of informed consent is supported by substantial evidence.
b.the existence of a signed consent form as conclusive proof of informed consent.
navas and cedars towers contend that a signed consent form constitutes conclusive proof of informed consent.relying largely on contract principles,it is argued that one who signs an instrument such as the consent form in the instant case is bound by its terms.cedars towers argues that isabel uncorroborated testimony is insufficient to overcome the presumed validity of the written consent.cedars towers further argues that if a signed consent form is not given conclusive force,plaintiffs will undoubtedly and routinely deny that they read or understood consent forms they signed in order to pursue lawsuits against their doctors and the effect of disregarding the consent form would have significant impact on the practice of medicine.
