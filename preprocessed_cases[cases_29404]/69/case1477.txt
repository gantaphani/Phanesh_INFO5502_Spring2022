harry palmer,the owner of star edge,and the creator of a course called avatar,sought a preliminary injunction against eldon braun,alleging that braun book,the source course,infringed palmer copyright in the avatar course materials.the district court denied the request for a preliminary injunction after determining that palmer was unlikely to succeed on the merits of his claim.because the district court did not abuse its discretion,we affirm.
harry palmer the avatar course 
palmer is an educational psychologist.for many years,he was a member of the church of scientology and aided members of the church in the exploration of their consciousness.palmer left the church in and,in,embarked on a personal regimen of experimental research,seeking to explore the functioning of his own consciousness.palmer research led him to the conclusion that beliefs are the key to everything in the universe.
this insight,combined with palmer background in educational psychology,led palmer to develop an educational course in which students might explore their own consciousness.he calls his course avatar,from a word for incarnated deities,and it is premised on the idea that a person beliefs create his reality.the avatar course seeks to inform its students of the existence of these beliefs and to teach them how to create or discreate those beliefs as necessary.
the avatar course is taught by trained and licensed masters in three sections.section i is a seminar that introduces the avatar course using resurfacing techniques for exploring consciousness,a page manual that describes the basic of exploring the consciousness.resurfacing is available to the general public.
after completing section i,students are encouraged to take sections ii and iii.section ii uses the exercises,a page manual that teaches students to reconnect with their existence and experience the world directly.the key exercises in section ii rely on a collection of short sentences designed to allow a student to control his beliefs.once a student gains control of his beliefs,he moves on to section iii,the procedures.in this section,students learn,through meditation,to become source,or the seat of consciousness at the center of the universe,creating everything outside through conscious intent.ex.at.when a person is at source,he has achieved the enlightenment that the avatar course offers and is in control of his reality.section iii is taught with a page manual.
the manuals used in section ii and iii are kept confidential.students must sign a confidentiality agreement prior to taking the course and must return the materials when the course ends.confidentiality ensures both that the course is administered with the help of a trained master and that these sections,which cost and respectively to attend,maintain their commercial value.
once sections ii and iii are completed,students may take additional sections to elevate themselves in the avatar hierarchy.section iv teaches students to become masters,so that they may teach the course to others.section v is the wizards course,which endows its graduates with the ability to transform civilization.
eldon braun the source course 
braun began the avatar course in,after hearing palmer lecture about it.also a former scientologist,braun believed that palmer course would teach him what scientology did not.he signed up with palmer,took the avatar course,and became an avatar master in.as part of his mastery,he signed a license agreement and a confidentiality agreement.the confidentiality agreement required braun to keep the avatar course materials secret and to return the materials upon request.in,braun had a disagreement with palmer over the payment of royalties.as a result,braun license was suspended,and star edge asked braun to return his avatar course materials.braun did not return the materials.
after his break with palmer,braun continued to believe in the power of avatar but disliked palmer control of it.with these dual motivations,braun undertook a campaign to discredit palmer and undermine his control of avatar.as part of his effort,braun published an article on the internet entitled the wiz of orlando.this article relates both braun involvement with avatar and palmer control over the organization.to supplement his journalistic efforts,braun also sought to develop an alternative course of that would reveal the secrets of the avatar course and draw potential customers away from palmer.
braun alternative course is called the source course.the title is drawn from the avatar course ambition of leaving its graduates at source.the source course approaches consciousness the same way that the avatar course does,and braun billed it alternatively as an analog of the avatar course ex at,a refresher for the avatar course ex,a manual for graduates of the avatar course ex.at,and the equivalent of the avatar course materials at.unlike the avatar course materials,whose secrecy is jealously guarded,the source course is intended to be available to the general public,and braun even offered it for free to those who could not afford it.
braun began offering the source course to the public on november.on november,palmer and star edge sent braun a letter claiming that the source course infringed their copyright in the avatar course materials and demanding that braun cease and desist the infringement.braun refused,and palmer and star edge filed suit 
though it filed suit in december,palmer and star edge did not move for a preliminary injunction until march.they asked for a preliminary injunction on the basis of their claims for libel,unfair competition,and trademark and copyright infringement.because of scheduling conflicts,the district court did not hold a hearing on the motion until june.
at the hearing,palmer and star edge argued for the injunction only on the basis of their unfair competition claim and their copyright and trademark infringement claims.the district court denied the request for a preliminary injunction on the claim.it found that the source course was not substantially similar to the avatar course materials and that palmer was thus unlikely to succeed on his claim.on appeal,palmer and star edge ask us to review this ruling on the claim.we enjoined publication of the source course pending this appeal.
ii.issue on appeal standard of review 
the only issue on this appeal is whether the district court erred by failing to preliminarily enjoin braun publication of the source course.the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction is within the sound discretion of the district court and will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion.see siegel lepore,cir en banc cafe,johns county,cir revette int l ass of bridge,structural ornamental iron workers,cir.
iii.discussion 
palmer is not entitled to a preliminary injunction unless he establishes each of the following four prerequisites a substantial likelihood of success on the merits a substantial threat of irreparable injury that the threatened injury to the plaintiff outweighs the potential harm to the defendant and that the injunction will not disserve the public interest.see suntrust bank houghton mifflin,cir.the district court found that palmer did not establish a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of his copyright claim and,without considering the remaining prerequisites,denied the request for a preliminary injunction.palmer contends that he did,in fact,show a substantial likelihood of success on his claim.
prima facie copyright infringement 
to establish a case of copyright infringement,palmer must show that he owns a valid copyright in the avatar course materials and that braun copied original elements of the avatar course materials in the source course.see suntrust bank,at.palmer submitted copyright registration certificates to the district court,and braun does not dispute the validity of palmer copyright.palmer,then,owns a valid copyright,satisfying step one.
to satisfy step two,palmer must first show that the source course is substantially similar to the avatar course.two works are substantially similar if an average lay observer would recognize the alleged copy as having been appropriated from the
