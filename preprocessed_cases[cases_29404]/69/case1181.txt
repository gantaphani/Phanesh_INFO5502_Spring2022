the privacy act of,et the act,prohibits federal agencies from disclosing any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person,or to another agency without the consent of the individual to whom the record pertains,unless the disclosure falls within one or more enumerated exceptions to the act.id.b.the act also creates a private cause of action against an agency for its wilful or intentional violation of the act that has an adverse effect on an individual,and allows for the recovery of actual damages sustained as a result of such a violation.id.g d,g a.
plaintiff stanmore cawthon cooper claims to have sustained actual damages as the result of an interagency exchange of information performed as part of a joint criminal investigation by defendants federal aviation administration faa,social security administration ssa,and department of transportation dot collectively,the government.cooper seeks actual damages for nonpecuniary injuries,such as humiliation,mental anguish,and emotional distress,as a result of the unauthorized interagency disclosure of his medical information he does not claim any pecuniary or losses.
because cooper seeks damages only for nonpecuniary injuries,the district court granted summary judgment to the government,after holding that the act allows recovery only for pecuniary damages.we hold that actual damages under the act encompasses both pecuniary and nonpecuniary damages.we reverse and remand to the district court.
factual and procedural background 
medical certificates and disability benefits 
cooper first obtained a private pilot certificate in and has been flying airplanes intermittently ever since.to operate an aircraft lawfully,one must be issued a pilot certificate and a valid airman medical certificate.a,c.the faa requires that a pilot periodically renew his or her medical certificate to ensure that the pilot satisfies current faa medical requirements.id.the medical certificate renewal application requires an applicant to disclose any illnesses,disabilities,or surgeries the applicant has had during his or her lifetime,and to identify any medications being taken at the time of application.
cooper was diagnosed with hiv in.he knew he would not qualify for a renewal of his medical certificate if he disclosed his medical condition because,at that time,the faa did not issue medical certificates to individuals with hiv who were taking antiretroviral medications.accordingly,cooper grounded himself and chose not to renew his medical certificate.
in,however,cooper applied for and received a medical certificate from the faa,but without disclosing that he had hiv or was taking antiretroviral medication.cooper renewed his medical certificate again in,and,each time knowingly withholding required information about his medical condition.cooper explains that he chose to withhold that information because of the social stigma associated with hiv and his sexual orientation.cooper feared that knowledge of his status as a gay man with hiv would result in discrimination against him in employment,housing,and public accommodation.as a result,he disclosed his sexual orientation and medical condition only to close friends and family.
in august,after his symptoms worsened,cooper applied to the ssa for disability benefits under title ii of the social security act,et.cooper disclosed his hiv status to the ssa,comfortable in his understanding that the medical information disclosed in his application would be held confidential and would only be used by the ssa for its determination of cooper eligibility for disability benefits.cooper qualified for the benefits,which he received from august to august.
operation safe pilot 
in,the office of the inspector general oig for the dot and the oig for the ssa,who are charged with investigating crimes related to their respective agencies,see a and e,collaborated to investigate a california pilot who had consulted two different sets of doctors in a scheme to obtain simultaneously medical certifications to fly from the faa and disability benefits from the ssa.from this investigation grew operation safe pilot,a joint criminal investigation conducted by the and that sought to uncover efforts by medically unfit individuals to obtain faa certifications to fly.operation safe pilot was initially proposed as a nationwide endeavor,but was ultimately approved as a regional project,limited to northern california.
in july,the faa,which is part of the dot,provided the with the names and other identifying information for active certified pilots.in november,the sent the information relating to approximately pilots in northern california,consisting of the pilots names,dates of birth,social security numbers,and genders.the the information against the information in the databases,and in march or april,the provided the with three separate spreadsheets summarizing its analysis a spreadsheet listing the names and social security numbers for the pilots a spreadsheet listing pilots who had received title ii benefits and a spreadsheet listing pilots who had received title xvi benefits.and agents then examined the spreadsheets to identify entries suggesting fraud.
c.the investigation and prosecution of cooper 
upon review of the spreadsheets,the agents identified cooper as a person of interest because the agencies compiled data revealed that cooper was certified to fly by the faa,yet had received disability benefits from the ssa.acting on that information,the agents acquired cooper medical file from the faa,which revealed that cooper had never disclosed his hiv to the faa,and his disability file from the ssa,which contained information relating to cooper hiv.
in january,the agents conducted a series of meetings with faa flight surgeons to obtain their views as to whether the pilots identified by the investigation,including cooper,had falsified their medical certificate applications and if so,whether that falsified information was material to the faa decision to certify the pilots.after reviewing cooper faa medical file and ssa disability file,the faa flight surgeons concluded that the faa would not have issued cooper an unrestricted medical certificate had it known of his hiv.
at that point,the agents arranged an interview with cooper to ask him about his medical certificate applications.in march,the agents met with cooper,at which time he confessed to having intentionally withheld his medical condition from the faa.that same month,the faa issued an emergency order revoking cooper pilot certificate due to his misrepresentations to the faa.
in august,cooper was indicted on three counts of making false statements to a government agency under.in,he pleaded guilty to one count of making and delivering a false official writing,a misdemeanor under.he was sentenced to two years of probation and fined.
d.the district court decision 
in march,cooper filed a lawsuit in the northern district of california against the government.cooper alleged that the faa,dot,and ssa willfully or intentionally violated the act by conducting their interagency exchange of his records.he claims that this unlawful disclosure caused him to suffer humiliation,embarrassment,mental anguish,fear of social ostracism,and other severe emotional distress.
in spring,both parties moved for summary judgment.the district court concluded there was no genuine issue of material fact that the government had failed to uphold its obligations under the act,but that there was a triable issue of fact as to whether the government violation was intentional or willful.however,because the district court found the term actual damages to be ambiguous,and construed the waiver of sovereign immunity strictly in favor of the government,it ruled against cooper,holding that due to the strictly nonpecuniary nature of his damages,there was no genuine issue of material fact as to his having suffered actual damages under the act.the district court never reached the issue of whether the government failure to comply with the act proximately caused an adverse effect on cooper 
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review

iii.discussion 
the act forbids federal agencies from disclosing an individual records without that individual written consent,unless the disclosure falls within one of the act narrow exceptions.b.congress passed the act to protect the privacy of individuals identified in information systems maintained by federal agencies by regulating the collection,maintenance,use,and dissemination of information by such agencies.doe chao,quoting privacy act of,a,stat.to that end,the act furnishes federal agencies with detailed instructions for managing their records and provides for various sorts of civil relief to individuals aggrieved by failures on the government part to comply with the act requirements.id.
if a federal agency fails to comply with the act requirements,an individual may file a civil action against the agency in district court if the unauthorized disclosure has an adverse effect on the individual.g d.if the individual demonstrates that the agency acted in a manner which was intentional or willful,the individual can recover actual damages sustained by the individual as a result of the agency violation of the act,but in no case shall a person entitled to recovery receive less than the sum of.g a.thus,to prevail on a claim under the act,a plaintiff must prove that the government agency failed to uphold its obligation the agency acted intentionally or willfully in failing to execute its responsibility the failure proximately caused an adverse effect on the plaintiff and the plaintiff sustained actual damages.rose united states,cir.
in light of the ruling of the district court,the sole issue before us on appeal is the meaning of actual damages as used in the act the supreme court has not expressly addressed the issue.in doe chao,the court held that the act requires proof of some actual damages to recover the act minimum statutory damages of.at.but the court did not address the precise definition of actual damages,though it recognized the disparate views of courts of appeals on the question.id.at.
in fitzpatrick irs,the eleventh circuit held that actual damages permits recovery only for proven pecuniary losses and not for generalized mental injuries,loss of reputation,embarrassment or other injuries,cir,abrogated on other grounds by doe,at see also hudson reno,cir adopting the eleventh circuit position,abrogated on other grounds by pollard du pont de nemours.in johnson irs,the fifth circuit reached the opposite conclusion,holding that the term actual damages under the act does indeed include damages for physical and mental injury for which there is competent evidence in the record,cir,abrogated on other grounds by doe,at.
unlike the fifth,sixth,and eleventh circuits,we have not previously decided the meaning of actual damages under the act.see rouse dep of state,cir.
intrinsic sources 
declaring the meaning of actual damages is a matter of statutory interpretation.the purpose of statutory construction is to discern the intent of congress in enacting a particular statute.united states daas,cir.
our search for congress intent begins with the plain meaning of the language in question.united states pounds of blue king crab,cir.if the relevant language is plain and unambiguous,our task is complete.see united states carter,cir.to discern the text plain meaning,words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
unfortunately,there is no ordinary or plain meaning of the term actual damages because it is a legal term of art.as a result,ordinary dictionaries are of no assistance in clarifying the plain meaning of the term.see johnson aljian,cir w e follow the common practice of consulting dictionary definitions to clarify their ordinary meaning and look to how the terms were defined at the time the statute was adopted.internal quotation marks omitted alterations in original.neither the american heritage dictionary of english language nor webster third new international dictionary contains an entry for actual damages.see generally american heritage dictionary of the english language ed webster third new international dictionary.
black law dictionary defines actual damages as a n amount awarded to a complainant to compensate for a proven injury or loss damages that repay actual losses.black law dictionary ed.unfortunately,that definition sheds little light on the type of injury or loss congress intended plaintiffs to be able to prove under the act.simply because a statute authorizes the recovery of damages to compensate for injuries does not mean that the statute authorizes the recovery of damages for any type of loss.see,naton bank of cal,cir holding that pain and suffering damages are not allowed under the age discrimination in employment act,et ryan foster marshall,cir holding that actual damages for federal claims under the securities exchange act of,et,are limited to economic loss.
the eleventh and fifth circuits,in fitzpatrick and johnson,agreed that the meaning of the term actual damages is ambiguous.in fitzpatrick,the eleventh circuit concluded there is no consistent legal interpretation of actual damages,and observed that courts have used actual damages in a variety of circumstances,with the interpretation varying with the context of use.at.in johnson,the fifth circuit concluded that the term actual damages has no plain meaning or consistent legal interpretation.at.similarly,we have recognized the shifting sense we have attributed to the term.in re dawson,cir.the term is chameleon,as its meaning changes with the specific statute in which it is found.see kucana holder,wl,at.
since there is no plain meaning to the term actual damages,as used in the act,we next consult the term in its statutory context,looking to the language of the entire statute,its structure,and purpose.see nadarajah gonzales,cir i n ascertaining the plain meaning of the statute,the court must look to the particular statutory language at issue,as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.internal quotation marks omitted see also dolan postal,a word in a statute may or may not extend to the outer limits of its definitional possibilities.interpretation of a word or phrase depends upon reading the whole statutory text,considering the purpose and context of the statute,and consulting any precedents or authorities that inform the analysis.
congress articulated a clear purpose behind the act,stating that the right to privacy is a personal and fundamental right protected by the constitution of the united states,a,stat.to protect that right,congress passed the act to provide certain safeguards for an individual against an invasion of personal privacy by requiring federal agencies to be subject to civil suit for any damages which occur as a result of willful or intentional action which violates any individual rights under this act.id.b emphasis added.
congress intent that the act offer relief in the form of any damages resulting from a violation of one right of privacy begs the question of what types of injuries typically result from the violation of such a right.the supreme court has observed that i n the right of privacy cases the primary damage is the mental distress from having been exposed to public view.time,hill,see also restatement second of torts b one who has established a cause of action for invasion of his privacy is entitled to recover damages for his mental distress proved to have been suffered if it is of a kind that normally results from such an invasion.the related tort of defamation also provides monetary relief for nonpecuniary harms.in defamation cases,the supreme court has stated that the more customary types of actual harm inflicted by defamatory falsehood include impairment of reputation and standing in the community,personal humiliation,and mental anguish and suffering.gertz robert welch.accordingly,in her dissent in doe chao,justice ginsburg,commenting on the act purpose of providing relief for any damages,stated act violations commonly cause fear,anxiety,or other emotional the act parlance,adverse effects,and that in such cases,emotional distress is generally the only harm the claimant suffers.at ginsburg,dissenting.one can readily envision circumstances in which these types of injuries might flow from the disclosure of one confidential medical records,which often contain some of the most sensitive and intimate information about one physical,mental,and emotional,and sexual orientation.given the nature of the injuries that most frequently flow from privacy violations,it is difficult to see how congress stated goal of subjecting federal agencies to civil suit for any damages resulting from a willful or intentional violation of the act could be fully realized unless the act encompasses both pecuniary and nonpecuniary injuries.
congress signaled its intent,throughout the act,to extend monetary recovery beyond pure economic loss.the act obligates agencies to maintain a records system that shall establish appropriate administrative,technical,and physical safeguards to insure the security and confidentiality of records and to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to their security or integrity which could result in substantial harm,embarrassment,inconvenience,or unfairness to any individual on whom information is maintained.e emphasis added.further,the act provides a civil remedy for an agency failure to maintain any record concerning any individual with such accuracy,relevance,timeliness,and completeness as is necessary to assure fairness in any determination relating to the character of the individual that may be made on the basis of such record.id.g c emphasis added.congress use of language to ensure that a federal agency practices do not result in embarrassment or harm to one character bolsters a construction of actual damages that reaches nonpecuniary damages.
further,a contrary reading of the act seems unreasonable in light of how we and other courts have construed the term adverse effect.the act provides actual damages for intentional or wilful violations that have an adverse effect on an individual.our circuit and at least seven others have recognized that a nonpecuniary harm,such as emotional distress,may constitute an adverse effect under the act.see orekoya mooney,cir holding that provable emotional distress may constitute an adverse effect,abrogated on other grounds by doe,at doe chao,cir quinn stone,cir holding that stress and emotional anguish can constitute adverse effects englerius veterans,cir agreeing with the circuit and tenth circuit that emotional trauma can constitute an adverse effect albright.united states,emotional trauma alone is sufficient to qualify as an adverse effect under section g d of the act johnson,at parks irs,cir holding that mental distress or embarrassment could constitute an adverse effect.even the eleventh circuit acknowledged in fitzpatrick that humiliation or an emotional injury can qualify as an adverse effect.at.to recognize that the act entitles one to actual damages for an adverse effect related to one mental or emotional,or one character,as we and other circuits have previously done,while holding that one injured under the act can not recover actual damages for nonpecuniary injuries,would be an unreasonable construction of the act.indeed,such a reading would essentially render the provision of actual damages meaningless in cases where the plaintiff injury relates to his or her character,or mental or emotional health,even though such cases are common under the act.see trw andrews,it is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute ought,upon the whole,to be so construed that,if it can be prevented,no clause,sentence,or word shall be superfluous,void,or insignificant.internal quotation marks omitted.
extrinsic sources 
the parties in this case have argued at length about how the act legislative history supports their respective positions on the meaning of actual damages.
the statutory text itself is the authoritative statement of a statute meaning.exxon mobil allapattah.however,courts can and do consult extrinsic materials,such as legislative history,for guidance in construing an ambiguous statute.see oklahoma new mexico,w e repeatedly have looked to legislative history and other extrinsic material when required to interpret a statute which is ambiguous.but courts resort to extrinsic materials only to the extent they shed a reliable light on the enacting legislature understanding of otherwise ambiguous terms.exxon mobil,at.
in this case,the act legislative history is not a reliable source for the meaning of actual damages because both sides of the argument can readily find support for their respective positions in that history.accordingly,it is not surprising that in fitzpatrick and johnson,the eleventh and fifth circuits conducted their own thorough reviews of the legislative history of the act,only to arrive at diametrically opposing constructions of the same term.for these reasons,we decline to wade through the murky,ambiguous,and contradictory legislative history of the act in the vain hope of finding clear guidance concerning the meaning of the term actual damages.id.
moreover,legislative history is of no help to us in construing the scope of the government waiver of sovereign immunity at issue in this case,see infra part,because the unequivocal expression of elimination of sovereign immunity that we insist upon is an expression in statutory text.if clarity does not exist there,it can not be supplied by a committee report.united states nordic village.
however,one extrinsic source that does shed some reliable light on the meaning of the term actual damages in the act is the fair credit reporting act fcra,et.in,only four years before congress passed the act,congress enacted the fcra with the express purpose of requiring 
consumer reporting agencies to adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit,personnel,insurance,and other information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer,with regard to the confidentiality,accuracy,relevancy,and proper utilization of such information in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter.
in enacting the fcra,congress recognized that this country banking system has produced a complex system of credit reporting,involving consumer reporting agencies gathering and evaluating a wide range of personal and sensitive information,such as credit worthiness,credit standing,credit capacity,character,and general reputation of consumers.id.a.congress passed the fcra to ensure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness,impartiality,and a respect for the consumer right to privacy.id.a emphasis added see also safeco ins.of am.burr,u,congress enacted the fcra in to protect consumer privacy.to that end,the fcra prohibits credit reporting agencies from releasing consumer credit reports except as provided under a.
thus,not only did congress enact the act and the fcra within a few years of each other,but they were passed to address an identical concern growing out of closely analogous circumstances.in both cases,congress acknowledged that vast databases of personal information are being gathered by one case,federal agencies,and in the other,credit reporting sought to circumscribe these agencies in the manner they gather,maintain,and use that sensitive information.ultimately,congress passed both laws with the purpose of protecting an individual right of privacy from being violated by the disclosure of private information.
further,the act and the fcra provide similar remedies.the fcra creates a private right of action for injured consumers to recover any actual damages caused by an agency negligent or willful violation of the fcra.see,emphasis added.most importantly,we have held that actual damages under the fcra encompass damages for emotional distress.guimond trans union credit info,cir.other courts have held similarly.see,
