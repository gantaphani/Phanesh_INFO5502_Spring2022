at what all surely must hope is the conclusion of this long running litigation,we must address an issue of some importance under federal rule of appellate procedure b relating to the award of interest to the on the punitive damages judgment they obtained against the.this is a cautionary tale for all whose judgments on appeal are subject to the requirements of rule b.
in an earlier appeal,we reduced the punitive damages because we concluded they were excessive under the supreme court due process clause jurisprudence.we accordingly directed the district court on remand to enter a judgment for the damage amounts we specified,assuming the plaintiffs opted not to have a new trial.because our mandate did not contain instructions about the allowance of interest as required by rule b,we are now called upon to decide whether the district court had the authority to award interest from the date of its original judgment,as modified in its final judgment,or only from the date of that final judgment.we hold that our failure to specify the accrual date for interest in our mandate precluded the district court order that interest would run from the date of the original judgment.
we conclude,however,that our omission of interest was inadvertent,and we therefore recall the earlier mandate and amend it to provide for interest from the date of the original judgment.in so doing,we caution that in the future,rule b requirements as to the terms of our mandates should be noted and adhered to.
background 
in,four individual physicians and two clinics that provide medical services,including abortions,to women collectively,physicians brought suit against american coalition of life activists and others collectively,acla for violating the freedom of access to clinic entrances act face,and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico.the underlying facts giving rise to this long history of litigation are fully described in our en banc opinion,planned parenthood of the,am.coalition of life activists,cir en banc hereinafter ppcw v.
the jury found for physicians on all counts and awarded a total of in compensatory damages under face,million in punitive damages under face and million in compensatory damages after trebling under rico.see id.at.on february,the district court entered judgment against acla in the full amount of the jury verdict original judgment.the original judgment also provided that e ach plaintiff shall recover the aforementioned damages with interest thereon at the rate as provided by law.
acla appealed the judgment,which we affirmed on rehearing en banc except as to punitive damages.id.at.we remanded for the district court to consider in the first instance whether the award is appropriate in light of in re exxon valdez,cir,which clarified the constitutional limitations on punitive damages awards.id.at.on remand,the district court entered judgment reinstating the punitive damages award in full and awarding interest on the entire award from the date of the original judgment revised judgment.
acla again appealed.we reduced the punitive damages award to a total of million and remanded for the district court to order a new trial unless p hysicians accept a remittitur in accord with the amounts we specified.planned parenthood of the,am.coalition of life activists,cir hereinafter ppcw viii.the parties did not address interest.neither did our opinion or mandate.
physicians accepted the remittitur.on july,the district court entered judgment and awarded interest on the entire award from the date of the original judgment final judgment.acla appealed,challenging the district court authority to award interest from the date of the original judgment because our mandate in ppcw viii contained no instructions about the allowance of interest.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction to hear acla timely appeal from a final judgment.because this case involves the proper construction of and federal rule of appellate procedure b,our review is de novo.see at t united computer,cir.
discussion 
as a preliminary matter,acla contends that the district court award of interest on the entire damages award from the date of the original judgment rather than the date of the final judgment was improper.we do not address this contention,because it is barred from reconsideration by the law of the case.nothing is before this court but what is subsequent to the mandate.atlas scraper eng g pursche,cir quoting himely rose,cranch.in ppcw v,we affirmed the district court judgment in all respects but for punitive damages.at.we necessarily affirmed the compensatory damages awards and interest on those damages.accordingly,acla present appeal is limited to review of the district court award of interest on the punitive damages award only.all other issues were finally decided in ppcw v and ppcw viii.
acla argument relies on two premises.first,acla contends that briggs pennsylvania,and federal rule of appellate procedure b deprive a district court of authority to award interest from the date of an original judgment when the appellate court mandate directs the entry of a particular,modified money judgment and contains no instructions about the allowance of interest.second,acla contends that ppcw viii directed the entry of a particular,modified money judgment without mention of interest.therefore,the district court was bound by our mandate and could award interest on the punitive damages award only from the date of the final judgment,not the date of the original judgment.acla is correct.
assessing acla first premise requires that we unravel the relationship between and kaiser aluminum chemical bonjorno,d,which together govern the calculation of interest,and briggs and rule b,which together forbid the district court to award interest in excess of our mandate the district court award of interest is valid only if it complies with and conforms to our mandate.
section provides for the mandatory award of interest on any money judgment in a civil case recovered in a district court.see ford alfaro,cir quoting a.interest must run from the date of a judgment when the damages were supported by the evidence and meaningfully ascertained.see kaiser,at.at t,at tinsley,cir per curiam.we may reverse and remand a judgment without concluding that it is erroneous or unsupported by the evidence.see guam soc y of obstetricians and gynecologists ada,cir.when the legal and evidentiary basis of an award is thus preserved,interest is ordinarily computed from the date of the judgment initial entry.perkins standard oil of,cir see guam soc y,at.
kaiser and explain how to determine the accrual date of interest in the first instance.briggs and rule b,on the other hand,limit the power of the district court to award interest from any date other than the date of entry of judgment on remand when that is what our mandate requires.in briggs,the district court entered judgment for the defendant notwithstanding the verdict after granting a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.see at.without making provision for interest,the court of appeals reversed and directed that judgment be entered on the verdict.see id.relying on the principle that an inferior court has no power or authority to deviate from the mandate issued by an appellate court,the supreme court held that the district court could not award interest from the date of the verdict because the trial court had no power to enter judgment for an amount different than directed.id.at.briggs reflects the settled principle that once we have instructed the district court on a matter,it must faithfully carry out our command and go no further.see newhouse robert ilima tours,cir.
rule was promulgated as a reminder of the briggs rule.see advisory committee notes on rule.when we modif y or reverse a judgment with a direction that a money judgment be entered in the district court,our mandate must contain instructions about the allowance of interest.fed.b.when our mandate lacks such instructions,the district court ha s no power to enter judgment for an amount different than directed.briggs,at.it can not award interest from the date of the original judgment because
