this case arises from misrepresentations chapman university chapman made to plaintiffs,students in the inaugural class of its law school,and its violations of business and professions code section,which requires written disclosures of facts pertinent to a law school unaccredited status.we hold as matters of first impression that business and professions code section confers a private right of action for the refund of tuition from an unaccredited law school that violates written disclosure requirements is not subject to the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine requires written disclosures each semester,or preceding any payment of any tuition or fee other than an application fee does not unjustly enrich students who obtain refunds of tuition and continue in school and is governed by the limitations period for actions on a statute for a penalty or forfeiture code civ,subd.a former subd.we also conclude that to any extent doctrines of substantial compliance and waiver may apply to business and professions code section,they are inapplicable here.
further,we conclude substantial evidence supports the jury findings that plaintiffs stephen mann and raelyn yeomans did not prove the damages element of their fraud cause of action,and the trial court properly granted chapman summary adjudication of plaintiff dennis goehring fraud and related causes of action because as a matter of law he can not prove the damages element of the claims.we affirm the judgment in all aspects.
factual and procedural background 
a brief legal discussion is required to put the facts in context.california law schools are either accredited or unaccredited.an accredited law school has been granted accreditation by the committee of bar examiners of the state bar of california the committee,based on a variety of factors demonstrating it offers a sound legal education and complies with applicable provisions of the business and professions code and other laws.rules regulating accreditation of law schools in cal.accreditation rules,rule one,a.generally,the committee deems accredited a law school either provisionally or fully approved by the american bar association aba.
to be eligible to sit for the california bar examination,students in an unaccredited law school must attend a minimum of four years of law school,or more hours per year,and pass the first year law student examination fylsx.bus,subds.e a h.in contrast,students in an accredited law school are exempt from the fylsx bus,subd.h,and at the relevant time could sit for the bar examination after three years of study former bus,subd.e further,at the relevant time the state bar gave a student in an unaccredited law school no credit for the first year of study until he or she passed the fylsx,and absent a showing of good cause no credit for any subsequent study undertaken before he or she passed the fylsx.former bus,subd.g historical and statutory notes,pt.west ann.bus.ed.foll.
in july,in anticipation of opening a law school in,chapman sought accreditation from the committee in an internal memorandum chapman stated that without accreditation it would attract only the very worst of students,because the fylsx had a low passage rate and was dreaded.the committee deferred chapman request pending the receipt of additional information and cautioned that it ordinarily takes seven years to become accredited.
nonetheless,in january chapman published a newsletter for prospective students predicting approval under rule xviii of the committee admission rules at the earliest possible time,which is september,and advising the approval would exempt students from the fylsx requirement.the committee notified chapman the newsletter was misleading because early preliminary approval under rule xviii was very unlikely to occur,and in any event,students in a school preliminarily approved under rule xviii were not exempt from the fylsx requirement.chapman did not heed the committee suggestion it correct the newsletter.
chapman catalog for the academic year notified prospective students of the fylsx requirement and stated that it expected,but did not guarantee,it would have aba approval by.however,chapman did not disclose the rule.rather,it offered a program and implied that even if the school remained unaccredited students could sit for the california bar examination after completing three years of study.before chapman published the catalog,the committee reminded it of the rule,and the effect of unaccreditation on students not passing the fylsx.
chapman opened an unaccredited law school in august,with a founding class of approximately students,including goehring,mann and yeomans.the committee advised chapman it should disclose that if it did not obtain preliminary approval from the aba as projected,students would be required to take the fylsx and pass it to get credit for their studies.however,chapman made no such disclosure.
to the contrary,during the spring semester chapman president informed students that under an exemption the state bar would allow students failing the fylsx to continue their studies and obtain full credit for them,and chapman was seeking a ruling from the state bar making the fylsx voluntary for its students.further,chapman dean told students that although they had to take the fylsx,the state bar waived the requirement they had to pass it to sit for the bar examination,or had made the fylsx advisory only because of chapman special status.
chapman inaugural class took the fylsx in june,and the passage rate was only percent.students began to learn about the rule because the state bar notified students who did pass the examination that they were required to attend three additional years of classes before sitting for the bar examination.in response to students complaints,chapman dean said it did not inform students of the rule because the state bar never enforced it.
chapman catalog for the academic year continued to offer a program,and stated that by agreement with the committee students who did not pass the fylsx could continue their studies and may be allowed to sit for the bar examination.the state bar complained to chapman of misstatements in the catalog and denied having any agreement with it pertaining to the fylsx.
in january the aba rejected chapman application for provisional approval.noting students undergraduate grade point averages,law school aptitude test lsat scores and the passage rate on the fylsx,the aba explained its most serious concern was the quality of the student body and the apparent weakness of the school academic standards.the aba also commented on the faculty lax approach to academic grading,evidenced by the lack of mandatory academic dismissals until the end of the third semester and the failure to take specific steps to address academic standards.
chapman initially refused to let students review the aba letter,and told them it was extremely pleased with the positive feedback and in the ballpark of aba approval.however,in may the aba denied chapman request for reconsideration 
in june chapman,under new leadership and pursuant to the state bar direction,finally disclosed the requirement that students in unaccredited law schools attend four years of classes,and with the exception of the first year,they would receive no credit for classes taken before passing the fylsx.further,chapman released the aba january and may letters denying it approval.
responding to students displeasure,chapman offered to refund all tuition paid by inaugural students who elected by september to withdraw from school.for continuing students,chapman offered,contingent on its not receiving accreditation by the end of the spring semester,a percent reduction in tuition through spring and free or reduced tuition for classes taken after to meet the requirement.however,a student could qualify only by signing a waiver of all claims against chapman.
goehring,mann and yeomans,who all failed the fylsx,rejected chapman refund offer.mann withdrew from school and yeomans took a leave of absence,citing financial reasons.goehring continued in school until january when chapman dismissed him for academic reasons.yeomans returned to chapman for a third year of study and graduated in may,after it attained preliminary approval from the aba.
goehring,mann and yeomans separately sued chapman for fraud and related causes of action,and the court consolidated their cases in a fourth amended complaint,mann alleged that in enrolling and reenrolling in law school he relied on numerous written and oral misrepresentations of chapman regarding the quality of its faculty,the admission of only applicants showing a genuine aptitude for the study of law,the construction of a art law school facility by,the prediction of attaining early state bar accreditation or aba approval,students ability to continue in school despite failing the fylsx and to sit for the california bar examination after only three years of study,and negotiations with the state bar to make the fylsx voluntary.mann also alleged he withdrew from chapman when he learned of the misrepresentations because he lost all trust and confidence in the school.
the fraud allegations of yeomans third amended complaint were substantively identical to those of mann fourth amended complaint.goehring sixth amended complaint alleged fewer incidents of fraud,and concentrated on statements regarding the prediction of obtaining aba approval,the necessity of only three years of study,the state bar agreement that students failing the fylsx could continue their studies,and the unimportance of the fylsx results because of a waiver from the state bar.
plaintiffs also sought the return of tuition under business and professions code section,which requires unaccredited law schools to make specified written disclosures to students and provide them with signed copies of the statements as receipts for their payment of tuition.further,the plaintiffs alleged chapman violated former education code section,which prohibited private postsecondary educational institutions from making false,deceptive,inaccurate,or misleading statements in connection with the offering or publicizing of a course.former,subd.e.
chapman successfully moved for summary adjudication of goehring causes of action for fraud,negligence and violation of former education code section,on the ground that since chapman dismissed him for academic reasons he can not establish a causal connection between its conduct and his damages.the court denied his motion for reconsideration,this court denied his petition for writ of mandate and the california supreme court denied his petition for review.
after a lengthy trial,the jury returned a special verdict finding chapman knowingly and recklessly made false representations to the plaintiffs with the intent to defraud them,and they justifiably relied on the misrepresentations.the special verdict form,however,did not require the jury to specify the statements it found deceitful or any details regarding reliance.in any event,the jury found neither mann nor yeomans satisfied the damages element of their fraud claims.the jury also rejected their claims under former education code section.
before trial,the court ruled plaintiffs claims for refunds of tuition and fees for the violation of business and professions code section were subject to a statute of limitations applicable to actions on a statute for a penalty or forfeiture.code civ,subd.a.after the presentation of evidence,the court directed a verdict for goehring,mann and yeomans on their statutory claims in the amount of the tuition and fees they paid during the year preceding their actions.judgment was entered on january.

in support of its motion,chapman submitted evidence that as of the academic year it required students to maintain a minimum grade point average to remain in good standing,and it dismissed goehring on january,because his grade point average for the fall semester was and his cumulative grade point average was.this evidence shows goehring damages were not caused by the alleged misrepresentations that induced him to attend chapman,but by his academic dismissal.indeed,goehring concedes that but for his dismissal,he would have received his degree from an law school.assuming a claimant reliance on the actionable misrepresentation,no liability attaches if the damages sustained were otherwise inevitable or due to unrelated causes.kruse bank of america d,italics added.
goehring asserts chapman failed to meet its initial burden,and thus the burden did not shift to him to raise a triable issue of material fact.he submits chapman relied on the conclusory assertion that he was academically dismissed from the school.to the contrary,chapman submitted competent evidence it dismissed goehring for academic reasons.
in opposition to the motion,goehring submitted a declaration asserting chapman wrongfully dismissed him because before he enrolled it guaranteed him one semester of probation if his grade point average fell below,and alternatively,chapman manipulated his grades to appear lower than they actually were.goehring stated that when he was dismissed he was units short of the units required to complete the degree,but because of the dismissal i can not transfer any of my units to another aba law school,and even were i to start over again at another unaccredited law school,not one of my credits could transfer,and i f i graduate from an unaccredited law school in california,i will not be able to return to my home state of new york and practice law.
goehring asserts he raised triable issues of fact regarding whether he actually flunked out,and the court improperly weighed the evidence on the reasons for his dismissal.however,his complaint was not based on wrongful dismissal,but on false representations that induced him to enroll and reenroll in chapman he produced no evidence to support a finding he suffered damages as a result of relying on those misrepresentations,likely an insurmountable task given his academic dismissal.contrary to goehring assertion,the fact that other plaintiffs proceeded to trial does not show he raised an issue of material fact requiring trial.
goehring also asserts the court erred by finding the measure of damages applied to his causes of action,and not the measure of damages.see alliance mortgage rothwell,supra,cal th at,d,baji.however,the measure of damages is immaterial because chapman established as a matter of law that goehring can not show a causal nexus between his alleged reliance on misrepresentations and any damages.the court correctly found chapman was entitled to summary adjudication.
sufficiency of trial evidence 
mann and yeomans challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury findings they suffered no damages as a result of their reliance on chapman misrepresentations.when findings of fact are challenged in a civil appeal,we are bound by the familiar principle that the power of the appellate court begins and ends with a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,to support the findings below.citation.we view the evidence most favorably to the prevailing party,giving it the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolving all conflicts in its favor.citation.substantial evidence is evidence of ponderable legal significance,reasonable,credible and of solid value.citation.however,s ubstantial evidence is not synonymous with any evidence.citation.instead,the evidence must be substantial proof of the essentials which the law requires.oregel american isuzu motors,th,d.
yeomans testified that in the spring or summer of when she learned of chapman misrepresentations,she was concerned the law school was going to shut down at some point.she wanted to get out of the school because it appeared chapman would not receive accreditation,and thus she could not sit for the california bar examination without attending four years of classes and passing the fylsx.further,she realized that because she failed the fylsx,and chapman had no waiver of the requirement,the state bar would not recognize her credits.yeomans attributed her leave of absence to chapman conduct,and claimed she was damaged by the delay in her graduation from to.
in her petition for a leave of absence,yeomans did not mention chapman conduct.rather,she stated i am writing to inform you that i must petition for a temporary leave of absence from school as a result of severe financial difficulties.by working more than over the next year,i hope to put myself in a position where i am able to pay my current bills and save enough to complete my studies.the cost of attending law school has been high and my studies have made it difficult for me to contribute to my family household and living expenses.at this time,my financial situation has worsened partly due to a loss of transportation and my need for extensive dental work.
during her testimony,yeomans conceded the statements in her petition were truthful.she also conceded she submitted the petition before the aba rejected chapman request for reconsideration in may,before she read the aba january rejection letter,and before she learned about the rule.however,she testified she actually took a leave of absence because chapman lied to her about being able to take the california bar examination after three years of study and having a waiver of the fylsx requirement,but she did not mention those reasons because a professor told her there could be nothing about accreditation in her petition.
even if the jury accepted yeomans testimony,it could reasonably conclude her claimed damages for graduating a year later than planned were merely speculative.whatever the proper measure of damages may be,in a given case,the recovery therefor is still subject to the fundamental rule that damages which are speculative,remote,imaginary,contingent,or merely possible can not serve as a legal basis for recovery.frustuck city of fairfax d.
plaintiffs expert economist,tamorah hunt,calculated that a year delay in graduation caused yeomans damages over her work life of between and.hunt based the calculation on the assumptions that chapman wrongdoing caused yeomans leave of absence,and if had she not taken leave she would have graduated in and passed the bar examination that summer on her first try.hunt agreed that if any assumption were incorrect,her calculations were incorrect.chapman expert,robert trout,testified that if hunt assumptions were correct,yeomans damages were approximately.
however,yeomans testified she failed the california bar examination in february and,and skipped opportunities to take the examination in july and,because she was unprepared,and in july so she could attend trial of this matter.yeomans predicted she would pass the bar examination on a third try in february,but that does not suggest that had she graduated in she would have immediately taken the bar examination and passed it.t he opinion testimony of expert witnesses does not constitute substantial evidence when it is based upon conclusions or assumptions not supported by evidence in the record.hongsathavij queen of angels.medical center th,d.
regarding her emotional distress claim,yeomans testified she visited a doctor once because she had an irregular heartbeat for several days.however,that occurred in january,several months into her leave of absence from chapman.yeomans also testified she believed the year delay in her legal education adversely affected her grades during her third year of study and her ability to pass the bar examination.she said that when she returned to chapman her grades suffered because even though it had attained accreditation,she did want to be there,worried constantly,was unable to sleep,had trouble concentrating and had a real distrust of people.she also said the leave of absence had a huge effect on the amount of material i retained from my first and second year,and t his whole experience has shaken my confidence in myself and really affected my.
yeomans asserts she was entitled to an award of damages because her testimony was uncontradicted.however,on she testified that during her third year at chapman she was a member of the law review,was active in the tax society and participated in social events such as a golf tournament and a graduation dinner.further,yeomans admitted she really enjoyed several of her classes and particularly enjoyed at least one class.
in any event,u ncontradicted testimony in appellant favor does not necessarily conclusively establish the pertinent factual matter the trier of fact is free to reject any witness uncontradicted testimony and the court of appeal will affirm so long as the rejection was not arbitrary.eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group,ortzman van der waal d.the jury had the benefit of observing the demeanor of witnesses and is therefore in a better position than the appellate court to assess credibility.eisenberg et,supra.in assessing the plaintiff credibility,the jury may consider his or her interest in the case.ortzman van der waal,supra,at.we conclude substantial evidence supports the jury finding that yeomans suffered no compensable damages.
mann testified that in june when chapman disclosed the rule and other matters,and revealed the aba january letter denying its application for approval,he was overwhelm ed by not being able to figure out what to do,and although he could trust anything that anybody at chapman said he was reluctant to give up the dream of becoming a lawyer.he testified he ultimately decided to withdraw because he lost confidence and trust in chapman and in the administrators of the law school because i had just been lied to too many times.
plaintiff expert calculated mann incurred in damages,including loss of earnings during the period he was attending chapman,and tuition plus accrued interest that he paid while attending chapman.mann also claimed moving expenses and emotional distress damages,manifested by headaches,stomachaches and decreased sexual relations with his wife.chapman expert,trout,agreed with hunt calculation,if her assumption were correct,that mann withdrew from law school because of its conduct.
the issue of why mann withdrew from chapman raises the reliance element,as well as the damage element,of his fraud claim.reliance exists when the misrepresentation or nondisclosure was an immediate cause of the plaintiff conduct which altered his or her legal relations,and when without such misrepresentation or nondisclosure he or she would not,in all reasonable probability,have entered into the contract or other transaction.alliance mortgage rothwell,supra,cal th at,d.
the jury returned a special verdict finding that plaintiffs relied on chapman fraudulent statements.however,the verdict form did not require the jury to specify the representations it found false,the identities of plaintiffs who relied on particular statements,or the nature of their reliance.in other words,the jury may have found a plaintiff relied on misrepresentations for some purposes,enrolling or reenrolling in law school,but not for others,leaving law school.a judgment or order of the lower court is presumed correct.all intendments and presumptions are indulged to support it on matters as to which the record is silent,and error must be affirmatively shown.this is not only a general principle of appellate practice but an ingredient of the constitutional doctrine of reversible error.denham superior court cal d,in re marriage of arceneaux cal d.moreover,the appellant has the burden of affirmatively showing error by an adequate record.witkin,supra,appeal.because the evidence was undisputed that mann suffered damages in some amount if chapman caused him to withdraw from law school,but the jury awarded him no damages,we presume the jury found mann withdrew for unrelated reasons and affirm the finding if it is supported by substantial evidence.
notably,mann conceded that in april he leased space in an industrial complex in fullerton for a furniture repair and refinishing business,the type of business he previously ran in kansas.mann also testified he could not fathom working while attending law school full time,and in any event chapman discouraged students from working.thus,the jury could reasonably infer that when mann learned in june of chapman misrepresentations he had already decided to abandon his law studies.
further,such an inference is supported by evidence of mann financial situation.mann testified he wanted to avoid incurring student loans,and he initially intended to use his life savings for the first two years of law school.however,he took out an student loan for his second semester tuition because it was expensive to live in california,and it was getting scary because he and his wife were going through money so fast.additionally,he took out an student loan for his third semester tuition.further,mann testified he withheld his tuition for the spring semester because he learned chapman was required under business and professions code section to make certain written disclosures and it failed to do so.however,mann conceded his tuition was due by january,but he learned of the statutory disclosure requirement no earlier than january.
additionally,mann grades had steadily declined,and his grade point average for the spring semester was and his cumulative grade point average was.he conceded that before he withdrew he learned that in response to the aba criticisms chapman adopted a mandatory grading curve and required students to maintain minimum grade point averages of.mann admitted there was some buzz around the school that people were upset about that because marginal students might flunk out.mann agreed he was a marginal student,and if his grades went down percent he would flunk out.
moreover,mann supposedly withdrew because he feared chapman would not receive aba approval by his projected graduation date,but in his application to law school he wrote he was unconcerned with whether chapman had aba approval,and i f i have to earn my from a mail order law school when i years old,so be it.mann was years old when he applied to chapman,and he performed poorly three times on the lsat and was turned down by three accredited law schools in the midwest.
it was the jury province to assess mann credibility,and it presumably rejected his stated reason for withdrawing from chapman.substantial evidence supports a finding that mann withdrew because he was in danger of academic dismissal for financial reasons,and the withdrawal caused the loss of his investment in the endeavor and his claimed damages.further,the jury could reasonably find implausible mann emotional distress claims,including the claim that for about to months during law school he lost the desire to have sexual relations with his wife because he was upset by chapman delay in building a permanent law school facility.
additional contentions 
mann and yeomans cite shaw hughes aircraft th,d shaw,in asserting they are entitled to a new trial because the jury compromised its verdict.in shaw the plaintiff sued his former employer for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and wrongful termination in violation of public policy,alleging the stated reason for the termination,his sexual harassment of coemployees,was pretextual and the real reason was retaliation for his whistle blowing activities.the jury found for the defense on the breach of contract claim,but awarded the plaintiff more than for breach of the implied covenant.the jury also found in favor of the plaintiff on the wrongful discharge claim,but awarded him no damages.id.at,fn,d.
the court held the jury verdicts on the breach of contract and breach of implied covenant causes of action were irreconcilable,and both claims had to be retried.shaw,supra,th at,d.the court rejected shaw argument that instead of ordering a new trial it should sustain the jury award on the implied covenant cause of action as damages for wrongful discharge.the court explained the jury finding of wrongful discharge could not stand because w hen the issue of liability is sharply contested,and the jury awards inadequate damages,the only reasonable conclusion is the jury compromised the issue of liability,and a new trial is required.id.at,d.the court found a clear inadequacy of damages on the wrongful termination cause of action because the defendant own expert calculated shaw minimum loss at.because of a possible compromise verdict,a new trial on all issues was required,as opposed to merely the damages issue.see also wilson werner d.rose melody lane cal d,when jury fails to compensate a plaintiff for damages indicated by the evidence only reasonable conclusion is that the jury compromised on liability issue and new trial limited to damages issue is improper.
here,in contrast to shaw,the jury findings that plaintiffs suffered no damages as a result of chapman wrongdoing are supported by substantial evidence.accordingly,there is no cause for a new trial on any issue.
additionally,mann and yeomans submit that because the jury found chapman made intentional misrepresentations,its finding against them on their claim under former education code section is inconsistent.again,that statute prohibited postsecondary educational institutions from making false,deceptive,inaccurate,or misleading statements in connection with the offering or publicizing of a course.former,subd.e.chapman counters that the jury could find its misrepresentations were not made in connection with the offering or publicizing of a course.inconsistent verdicts are against the law,and the proper remedy is a new trial.shaw,supra,th at,d.we are not required to reach the issue,however,because damage is an essential element of a claim under that statute see former,subd.b,and the jury reasonably found plaintiffs did not satisfy the damages element of their claims.
mann and yeomans also contend the court erred by ruling chapman failure to comply with the disclosure requirements of business and professions code section was not actionable under former education code section,which provided that n otwithstanding any provision of the contract or agreement,a student may bring an action for a violation of this article or for an institution failure to perform its legal obligations.former,subd.b,italics added.again,we do not address the issue because damage is an element of the claim ibid.and the plaintiffs suffered no compensable damages.
further,mann and yeomans assert chapman counsel,jennifer keller,presented arguments filled with improper references to ethnicity,religion,and sex and painted a lurid picture of the plaintiffs as lazy,crazy,dissolute reprobates with their hands outstretched to reach into the christian pockets of chapman,and those improper arguments,coupled with the fact that the jury verdict was hopelessly inconsistent,show clearly that the verdict was compromised.
however,the jury finding of no damages disposes of plaintiffs inconsistency argument.moreover,plaintiffs neither raise misconduct of counsel as a separate issue on appeal nor discuss legal authorities on the issue.see cal.rules of court,rule a b an appellant must state each point under a separate heading or subheading summarizing the point,and support each point by argument.
in any event,we find no prejudicial error.it is only when the conduct of counsel consists of a willful or persistent effort to place before a jury clearly incompetent evidence,or the statements or remarks of counsel are of such a character as to manifest a design on his or her part to awake the resentment of the jury,to excite their prejudices or passions against the opposite party,or to enlist their sympathies in favor of his or her client or against the cause of his or her adversary,and the instructions of the court to the jury to disregard such offered evidence or objectionable remarks of counsel could not serve to remove the effect or cure the evil,that prejudicial error is committed.dominguez pantalone d.
plaintiffs complain that chapman counsel questioned mann about his sex life.however,the questioning was proper because mann claimed a decrease in sexual relations with his wife as an element of his damages.
plaintiffs also claim that in closing argument keller taunted yeomans,a woman of color,with the rhetorical question,how now,brown cow in addressing yeomans claim that chapman conduct caused her to fail the bar examination,keller stated how,now,brown cow how is this chapman fault yeomans counsel objected to that statement about yeomans,and the court overruled the objection.as we recall,the phrase how now,brown cow was one of numerous phrases used to teach elocution.keller use of the phrase is puzzling,and offensive if she were referring to yeomans.however,the trial court presumably found keller was not referring to yeomans,but to lack of causation,and from this record we can not say the court erred.
keller did make several improper remarks about religion during closing argument.in addressing plaintiffs claims they were damaged by chapman failure to build a permanent law school facility,keller stated one of the great teachers in the history of the world did have any buildings,either.he was poor and people followed him and listened to what he had to say.keller then stated,when i was growing up,my mother used to say if our pastor talks about the building fund one more time,i am going to scream.keller also said one of chapman professors wrote a book or hosted a public broadcasting service series titled the search for god in america.in a hearing outside the jury presence,the court found the remarks improper and warned keller to cease referring to religion.plaintiffs rejected the court offer to admonish the jury,thereby waiving appellate review of the issue.sabella southern pac.cal d.in any event,contrary to plaintiffs assertion the references to religion did not create an atmosphere of christians versus pagans,and the impropriety does not merit a new trial.
lastly,mann and yeomans assert that in finding against them on the damages issue the jury must have been affected by the events of september,it turned out,the very morning the jury was to begin deliberations.they submit that although the court adjourned until the following day,the jury uncertainty and concern for the future was at best a major distraction,and the losses suffered september unfairly but understandably trivialized less severe losses and injuries,even legally cognizable ones such as those suffered by plaintiffs at the hands of chapman.mann and yeomans engage in speculation.
on september,before giving legal instructions,the court asked each juror to reach down deep in your heart to determine whether the events of yesterday are lingering in your mind to the point where you think you would be really unable to concentrate and deliberate on this case.the court instructed the jurors to think very carefully about that because despite the tragic events of yesterday,these parties have a case that each of them deem to be very,very important,and it would not be right if we were to ask you to deliberate if you felt that you were honestly in a frame of mind where you would find that difficult to do.the court asked any juror who felt he or she could not deliberate to raise a hand,and no juror did so.we presume the jury understood and followed the court instructions.housley godinez th,d.
business and professions code section 
in its appeal,chapman contends the court erred by determining that business and professions code section hereafter section creates a private right of action,or alternatively,that plaintiffs claims for the refund of fees are barred by their failure to exhaust administrative remedies with the state bar.chapman also contends the statute requires only one written disclosure,when a student first matriculates,and continuing students are not entitled to additional disclosures.further,chapman asserts the refund of tuition to a student who continues in law school and benefits from the education is improper under unjust enrichment principles.
in their appeals,goehring,mann and yeomans contend the trial court erred by determining their section claims are governed by the statute of limitations for an action upon a statute for a penalty or forfeiture.code of civ,subd.a.plaintiffs argue their claims are governed by the limitations period for an action upon a liability created by statute,other than a penalty or forfeiture,subd.a.these are issues of first impression indeed,no reported decision has discussed any aspect of section.

chapman relies on,in which the supreme court,overruling its decision in royal globe ins.superior court cal d,royal globe,held that in enacting insurance code sections and the legislature did not intend to create a private civil cause of action against an insurer committing one of the numerous acts set forth in insurance code sections,subdivision h.the latter provision prohibits insurers from k nowingly committing or performing with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice certain unfair claims settlement practices,such as n ot attempting in good faith to effectuate prompt,fair,and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear,subd.h,italics added.
the court relied on the dissent in royal globe,supra,cal d at,which concluded the frequency requirement of insurance code section,subdivision h unambiguously showed the legislature had no intent to create a private right of action for a single or isolated act,and rather prohibited acts were to be considered unfair practices subject to administrative by the insurance commissioner regulation and discipline and then only if committed with the requisite frequency.royal globe,supra,cal d at,conc.dis,richardson.the dissent in royal globe observed that had the legislature intended to create a private right of action,one would reasonably have expected that the legislature simply would have directly imposed such liability in clear,understandable,unmistakable terms,as it has done in numerous other statutes.id.at.the dissent cited the unfair practices act bus,et which expressly provides that a ny person may bring an action to enjoin and restrain any violation of this chapter and,in addition thereto,for the recovery of damages.royal globe,supra,cal d at,citing bus.
the court also reviewed the available legislative history and found the fact that neither the legislative analyst nor the legislative counsel observed that the new act created a private right of action is a strong indication the legislature never intended to create such a right of action,supra,cal d at.the court,however,noted its legislative intent analysis did not limit individual actions against insurers under common law theories such as fraud,infliction of emotional distress,breach of contract or breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,supra,cal d at.
chapman also relies on crusader,supra,th,d,in which the court interpreted to mean that when neither the language nor the history of a statute indicates an intent to create a new private right to sue,a party contending for judicial recognition of such a right bears a heavy,perhaps insurmountable,burden of persuasion.in crusader,the issue was whether an admitted insurer had a private right of action under insurance code section,which prescribes the procedures that must be followed by surplus line brokers in soliciting and placing insurance with nonadmitted insurers.crusader,supra,at,d.the statute does not expressly provide for a private right of action,and based on the legislative included testimony by a witness recommending that private parties be given a right to court found the legislature had no intention of conferring such a right.rather,the legislature increased regulatory procedures and created a surplus line advisory organization.id.at,d.the court also explained an insured suffering a loss because of improper conduct by a broker in placing surplus line coverage is not without a remedy because he or she may pursue common law claims against that broker,which may include negligence,breach of contract,id.at,d.
additionally,chapman cites this court opinion in schaefer williams th,d,for the proposition that s urely,if the legislature had intended to create a private action,it would have done so by clear and direct language.id.at,d.in schaefer,we held the legislature did not intend to make enforceable through private action a political candidate alleged violation of his voluntary pledge to abide by the code of fair campaign practices,and inferred the legislature believed that any enforcement of that code would be obtained in the court of public opinion.ibid.moreover,we noted that when the fair campaign statutes were enacted and when the legislature revisited the issue five years later,it was the legislative intent that the legal remedy for defamation in the course of a campaign was a private action for libel or slander.ibid.
section,a provision of the state bar act bus,et,requires any unaccredited law school to provide every student with a disclosure statement,subsequent to the payment of any application fee but prior to the payment of any registration fee,containing certain information,such as its unaccredited status the school assets and liabilities the number and percentage of students who have taken and who have passed the fylsx and the final bar examination in a specified period the number of legal volumes in the library the educational background,qualifications and experience of the faculty the ratio of faculty to students whether the school has applied for accreditation and the status of any application and,that the education it provides may not satisfy requirements of other states for the practice of law,subds.a h.
section also provides the disclosure statement required by this section shall be signed by each student,who shall receive as a receipt a copy of his or her signed disclosure statement.if any school does not comply with these requirements,it shall make a full refund of all fees paid by students.subject to approval by the board,the committee may adopt such reasonable rules and regulations as are necessary for the purpose of ensuring compliance with this section,subd.h,italics added.
chapman asserts there is nothing in the language of section indicating the legislature intended to confer a private right of action.however,chapman ignores the statute mandate that a law school failing to make proper written disclosures refund students fees,subd.h.in contrast,the statutes at issue in,crusader and schaefer did not expressly entitle individuals to a refund or any other type of payment for violation of the statute.since in enacting section the legislature unquestionably intended to bestow students or former students with individual monetary claims,it must have intended to give them private rights of action to pursue such claims.in our view,section refund language explicitly denotes a private right of action.in any event,did not hold that courts should never imply a private right of action.jacobellis state farm fire and casualty cir.
moreover,in the court based its holding in part on adverse consequences and analytical difficulties caused by royal globe.for instance,commentators pointed out the undesirable social and economic effects of the decision,multiple litigation,unwarranted bad faith claims,coercive settlements,excessive jury awards,and escalating insurance,legal and other transaction costs,supra,cal d at.further,it is difficult to ascertain the means by which the plaintiff must prove a pattern or general business practice of unfair settlement practices under insurance code section,subdivision h,supra,at.the court noted the plaintiffs in these cases whether insureds or third party claimants seldom have the ability to prove any widespread pattern of wrongful settlement practices on the part of the insurer.ibid.in contrast,section succinctly sets forth disclosure requirements and a law school compliance or noncompliance is readily ascertainable.
the court also relied on alternative means of enforcement.under the unfair practices act the insurance commissioner may issue cease and desist orders for violations of insurance code section.willful violation of such orders may result in a maximum fine of,and repeated violations may result in the suspension of the insurer license for up to one year.
chapman submits that similarly,a private right of action under section is unnecessary because the state bar is authorized to enforce the statute.section states the committee may adopt such reasonable rules and regulations as are necessary for the purpose of ensuring compliance with this section,subd.h,italics added.neither section nor the committee rules promulgated thereunder sets forth any procedure for the pursuit of students individual refund claims.
chapman relies on rule one,section of the accreditation rules,but it undercuts chapman position.section provides complaints received from law school students regarding particular law schools shall be associated with the committee file for the school,but the committee shall not act on any one complaint,except to review it in the context of the school compliance with the admission rules,standards or rules.the committee shall not intercede in matters between a law school and a student.italics added.
additionally,chapman relies on rule xx of the admission rules,which states at section that if the committee determines a law school disclosure statement was incomplete or inaccurate,or that it did not supply each student with a complete and accurate disclosure statement,the committee will direct it to correct the statement,advise students of the changes,and offer them a refund of tuition.section of rule xx provides the failure to comply with the committee direction shall be considered as grounds for removing the school from the list of schools registered with the committee and the committee will recommend to the board of governors such action as in the opinion of the committee is necessary or desirable to obtain compliance.italics added.
admission rules rule xx does not authorize the committee to award students refunds of tuition,or require it to pursue refunds for them.although the committee may conduct evidentiary hearings bus,it appears that at best its interest in seeking compliance with the refund provision of section is discretionary.chapman asserts that is immaterial because the committee ability to deregister an unaccredited law school and thus put the school out of business is more than sufficient to ensure compliance with the committee directions regarding section however,the legislature included a refund provision in section,presumably to encourage compliance with disclosure requirements,and chapman theory essentially renders that provision nugatory.we must avoid treating any portion of a legislative enactment as surplusage.cabrini villas homeowners haghverdian th,d.
chapman also asserts the lack of evidence in section legislative history of an intent to create a private right of action shows the legislature lacked such intent.we are unconvinced,given the express refund provision of section.moreover,the fact that in enacting section in the legislature transferred regulatory authority over written disclosure requirements from the superintendent of public instruction and the attorney general see,former,and see to the state bar does not show the legislature invested it with the exclusive authority to handle refund disputes,or that it is equipped to handle such disputes.we conclude that in mandating individual refunds for the violation of section,the legislature intended to confer a private right of action.
exhaustion of administrative remedies 
we are also unpersuaded by chapman contention that refund claims under section are subject to the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine.
a failure to exhaust administrative remedies is a fundamental defect.lopez civil service com.d.the claim or cause of action is within the special jurisdiction of the administrative tribunal,and the courts may act only to review the final administrative determination.if a court allowed a suit to be maintained prior to final administrative determination,it would be interfering with the subject matter jurisdiction of another tribunal.accordingly,the exhaustion of an administrative remedy has been held jurisdictional in california.witkin,cal.procedure ed.actions,lance camper manufacturing republic indemnity th,d.the exhaustion doctrine applies to remedies created by statute rojo kliger cal d,or created by a rule of an administrative agency that has the force and effect of a statute.witkin,cal.procedure,supra,actions.
however,the exhaustion requirement is not applicable where an effective administrative remedy is wholly lacking.witkin,cal.procedure,supra,actions.the mere possession by some official body of a continuing supervisory or investigatory power does not itself suffice to afford an administrative remedy unless the statute or regulation under which that power is exercised establishes clearly defined machinery for the submission,evaluation and resolution of complaints by aggrieved parties.lance camper manufacturing republic indemnity,supra,th at,d,italics added.
this court found the exhaustion doctrine inapplicable when there was no statute or rule advising an aggrieved person how to apply for administrative relief.henry george school of social science san diego unified school dist.d.in martino concord community hosp.dist.d,the court found the exhaustion doctrine inapplicable when the hospital district had no procedure for the hearing or determination of a physician grievance and its bylaws required it to only consider the matter.id.at.the court found there was no assurance the physician grievance would be handled in any particular manner,and t his nebulous procedure can not be deemed an adequate procedural remedy.id.at.see also witkin,cal.procedure,supra,actions,and cases cited therein.
here,neither section nor the committee rules define any procedure for the submission,evaluation and resolution of refund claims.accordingly,the state bar does not provide an adequate administrative remedy and the exhaustion doctrine is inapplicable 
written disclosures for continuing students 
additionally,chapman contends that plaintiffs are not entitled to refunds of tuition under section,because it requires that an unaccredited law school give students only a single disclosure statement when they matriculate,and does not require it to give continuing students additional statements each semester.
section provides any law school that is not accredited by the examining committee of the state bar shall provide every student with a disclosure statement,subsequent to the payment of any application fee but prior to the payment of any registration fee italics added.chapman asserts that because the statute refers to disclosure statement and registration fee in the singular,only one written disclosure is required.chapman also asserts that because only prospective students pay application fees,the phrase any registration fee must refer only to first semester tuition.plaintiffs assert the word any preceding registration fee means each semester tuition.
whenever possible we glean legislative intent from the words of the statute,giving them their usual,ordinary and commonsense meaning.department of fish game irrigation dist.th,d oil state bd.of equalization d.i f there is no ambiguity,then we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.allen contracting cal th,d.however,we find section ambiguous,and thus we review the legislative history.
