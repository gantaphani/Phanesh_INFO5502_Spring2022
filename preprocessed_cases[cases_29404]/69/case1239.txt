on december,the district court for the western district of washington entered an order granting preliminary injunctive relief to a class of aliens,enjoining defendants department of homeland security and secretary michael chertoff collectively dhs from denying certain applications for permission to reapply for admission into the united states,or from acting on any denied applications.we vacate the order and remand because we defer to the decision by the board of immigration appeals bia in in re,bia,which is dispositive of plaintiffs request for injunctive relief.
in,congress amended the immigration and nationality act ina,providing for adjustment of status for certain aliens otherwise ineligible for such relief because of their unlawful status in the united states,title v b,stat,the special adjustment provision.the special adjustment provision excepted these aliens from certain admissibility requirements for adjustment of status.see a.it allowed the attorney general to adjust the status of an alien who had entered the united states without inspection to that of a legal permanent resident provided that the alien was admissible to the united states and the beneficiary of an immediately available immigrant visa,and paid an application fee five times the usual fee,b,stat.the law was effective for three years,from october,until october.id.

in,congress passed the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,effecting large scale changes to the ina,div.c,stat.in addition to the special adjustment provision,two iirira provisions pertaining to aliens who reenter the united states after being previously removed or deported are relevant a the reinstatement provision,and a c i ii the inadmissibility provision for previously removed aliens unlawfully present in the united states 
section a provides for automatic reinstatement of an alien prior removal or deportation order when an alien has reentered the united states illegally.it also states that the alien is not eligible and may not apply for any relief from removal.section a c i ii deems permanently inadmissible a previously removed alien who reenters the united states unlawfully.an alien inadmissible under this section,however,may seek admission into the united states if he has been absent from the united states more than ten years,and he has received the consent of the secretary of homeland security to the application for readmission.a c ii.agency regulations provide that permission to reapply is sought by the filing of an form.a successful applicant receives an waiver.
in august,we held that a previously removed alien unlawfully present in the united states was eligible to adjust his status under the special adjustment provision provided that he filed an waiver application prior to the initiation of reinstatement proceedings,notwithstanding the bar to relief from removal contained in iirira reinstatement provision and inadmissibility provision for previously removed aliens unlawfully present in the united states.ashcroft,cir.relying on this authority,plaintiffs commenced the present action in the district court.
the named plaintiffs in this case are seven mexican citizens who have previously been deported or removed from the united states and have reentered without permission or detection.each has applied for an waiver in conjunction with an application for adjustment of status under the special adjustment provision.the waiver application is pending in four of the cases and has been denied,along with the adjustment of status applications,in the remaining three cases.
on september,the named plaintiffs filed a complaint against dhs for injunctive and declaratory relief,a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction,and a motion for class certification.the complaint alleged that a class of persons have been denied the opportunity to apply for lawful permanent resident lpr status as a result of defendants refusal to comply with the precedent decision of the ninth circuit in ashcroft.plaintiffs demonstrated dhs by submitting a march,interoffice memorandum from the united states citizenship and immigration service uscis acting associate director for operations and acting chief counsel,entitled effects of ashcroft on adjudication of form applications filed by aliens who are subject to reinstated removal orders under ina a interoffice memorandum.the interoffice memorandum instructs uscis officers to adjudicate waiver applications before instituting reinstatement proceedings in the ninth circuit only when the alien meets a c ii provision requiring the lapse of ten years since the date of the alien last departure from the united states.
on november,the district court issued an order granting the motions for injunctive relief and class certification,and on december,it issued an order amending the injunction the district court held that the interoffice memorandum conflicted with because did not read the exception to the ina a c ban as limiting the waiver available under to those who had remained outside the united states for more than ten years.it pointed out that himself was inadmissible under ina a c and had not remained outside the country for more than ten years since his last departure.it granted the injunction because plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim,and the harm faced by loss of eligibility to apply for adjustment of status,including work authorization,and potential reinstatement of removal the government administrative burden and its interest in deterring aliens from repeatedly entering the united states illegally.
the amended injunction enjoins dhs from applying or enforcing the policy enumerated in part a of the sic memo against any member of the class for the remainder of this action.it prevents dhs from deny ing any class member applications in the ninth circuit on the grounds that the applicant is inadmissible under ina a c i ii and ten years have not elapsed since the applicant last departure from the united states,emphasis omitted and from 
giv ing any legal effect to any denied applications of class members if a the applicant application was adjudicated in a uscis district office located with the ninth circuit,b the application was denied between august,the date sic was filed and the date of this order,and c the application was denied on the grounds that the applicant was inadmissible under ina a c i ii and ten years had not elapsed since the applicant last departure from the united states.
dhs timely appeals.the district court stayed discovery and ordered that the injunction remain in effect pending appeal.
we first review the district court jurisdiction.we then examine whether the law supporting the district court decision remains in effect in light of two decisions,gonzales,d,and in re,bia.
standard of review 
the existence of subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law reviewed de novo.coyle garuda indonesia,cir.we also review de novo whether exhaustion is required in an immigration case.chang united states,cir.
we review the scope of injunctive relief for an abuse of discretion.idaho watersheds project hahn,cir.review is de novo when the district court ruling rests solely on a premise of law and the facts are either established or undisputed.harris board of supervisors,cir.
subject matter jurisdiction 
before reaching the merits of this appeal,we must address the government contention that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter the injunction.title f precludes jurisdiction over actions to enjoin or restrain the operation of the provisions of part iv of subchapter ii of the ina,except as to an individual alien against whom proceedings under such part have been initiated.part iv,captioned inspection,apprehension,examination,exclusion,and removal,contains the reinstatement provision.adjustment of status,however,falls under part v of subchapter ii,and inadmissibility provisions are contained in part ii.
dhs contends that f barred the district court from issuing this injunction because the injunction prevents the department from giving legal effect to any denied application.dhs reasons that the legal effect of such a denial is the commencement of reinstatement proceedings under a and,by requiring aliens to bring individual proceedings to challenge provisions under part iv,f was intended to preclude courts from granting relief to enjoin the operation of the reinstatement provision.dhs cites to the legislative history behind f,explaining that a single district court or court of appeals does not have authority to enjoin procedures established by congress to reform the process of removing illegal aliens from the united states.house judiciary committee report i at.
plaintiffs respond that the district court order enjoins the unlawful application of i the special adjustment falls under part v of subchapter ii of the ina.they argue that application of the reinstatement provision is not a direct consequence of the denial of an waiver or an adjustment of status application,but rather it is one of several available recourses following the denial of an adjustment of status application.
in support of their argument,plaintiffs cite to catholic social services,ins,cir en banc.there,we held that f limitation on injunctive relief did not apply to a district court order enjoining the immigration and naturalization service enforcing an unlawful advance parole policy that prevented an alien from adjusting his status under a amnesty provision.id.at the law required that the alien reside in the united states continuously for a certain time period and provided that a brief casual and innocent absence from the country would not disrupt this continuity requirement.id.at.the ins required an alien to obtain advance parole,advanced permission to reenter the united states,for any departure to be deemed brief,casual and innocent.id.as part of that injunction,the district court enjoined the government from executing final orders of removal in cases where the aliens adjustment of status applications had been rejected because of the unlawful advance parole policy.id.at.we held that f was inapplicable because the injunction was issued under a statutory provision governing adjustment of status,which is located in part v of subchapter ii of the ina.id.at.
we conclude that catholic social services is controlling.there,like this case,the district court enjoined the unlawful application of statutory provisions regarding adjustment of status.in both cases,removal was a collateral effect of the unlawful practice of denying adjustment of status.section f does not prohibit the current injunction because,as in the catholic social services injunction,it directly implicates the adjustment of status provision which falls under part v of subchapter ii,notwithstanding that a reinstatement proceeding may be a collateral consequence of an unsuccessful adjustment application.accordingly,the district court did not err by concluding that the injunction effect on reinstatement proceedings is one step removed from the relief sought by plaintiffs and therefore does not bring this action within the ina f bar.
dhs also contends that the district court erred as a prudential matter by not requiring plaintiffs to exhaust administrative remedies prudential exhaustion was not required.prudential exhaustion comes into play where agency expertise makes agency consideration necessary to generate a proper record and reach a proper decision relaxation of the requirement would encourage the deliberate bypass of the administrative scheme and administrative review is likely to allow the agency to correct its own mistakes and to preclude the need for judicial review.el rescate legal,executive office of immigration review,cir internal quotations omitted.here the agency has spoken clearly through the policy statement contained in the interoffice memorandum and its application of this policy in a number of cases.moreover,the case presents a question of law that would not be aided by further development of the record.
ashcroft does not undermine 
pursuant to galbraith county of santa clara,cir,we can overrule our existing precedent without en banc proceedings when intervening supreme court authority undermines our precedent,and both cases are closely on point.dhs argues that the supreme court decision undermines,and thus overrules,the threshold a successful waiver would act to prevent the reinstatement provision bar to relief from removal.
in,the supreme court addressed whether iirira reinstatement provision applied to aliens who reentered the united states unlawfully prior to iirira effective date,april.at,like plaintiffs in the case at bar,reentered the united states unlawfully after being previously deported several years later he filed an application to adjust his status to lawful permanent resident through his united states citizen wife.the application prompted the ins,in,to reinstate his prior deportation order,thus preventing him from adjusting his status.id.at.
prior to the passage of iirira,was eligible to apply for adjustment of status under the special adjustment provision.id.he argued that the former law governed his case because his illegal reentry occurred prior to iirira effective date.id.at.he also contended that applying the new reinstatement provision to him would have an impermissibly retroactive effect.id.the supreme court rejected both arguments.first,it held that the new reinstatement provision,on its face,reached aliens who reentered the united states.id.at.it then held that the reinstatement provision had no retroactivity effect because it does not penalize an alien for his illegal reentry but rather establishes a process to remove him based on his remaining in the country after re entry.id.at.thus,the statute applies to stop an indefinitely continuing violation that the alien himself could end at any time by voluntarily leaving the country.id.
dhs argues that had the supreme court agreed with,it would have required the agency to adjudicate adjustment of status application.thus,dhs contends that by implication undermines and requires us to disregard our holding that a successful waiver would avoid application of the reinstatement provision.
dhs argument fails because the supreme court in did not address the issues raised in.we have held that issues that are not raised or discussed are unstated assumptions on issues and are not precedential holdings binding further decisions.sakamoto duty free shoppers,cir.the supreme court holdings that the reinstatement provision reaches aliens regardless of when they illegally reentered the united states,and that the provision has no impermissible retroactive effect on aliens who reentered the united states prior to iirira effective date,do not address the holding in that a successful waiver,if filed prior to the initiation of reinstatement proceedings,can circumvent application of the reinstatement statute accordingly,the district court did not err by concluding that does not undermine.
national cable telecommunications ass brand x internet services requires that we review in light of the bia opinion in in re 
dhs also contends that the bia opinion in in re undermines the holdings pertaining to an illegal reentrant admissibility and submits that the district court erred by failing to defer to in re.the question,then,is whether,under national cable telecommunications ass brand x internet services,d brand x,we must now defer to in re.if we determine that we are bound by in re,then the district court,in turn,will be bound by our decision.
in chevron usa,natural resources defense council,d,the supreme court established a inquiry for judicial review of an agency construction of a statute.first,the reviewing court must determine whether the statute is unambiguous if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.the court explained that i f a court,employing traditional tools of statutory construction,ascertains that congress has an intention on the precise question at issue,that intention is the law and must be given effect.id.at.however,if the court determines that the statute is silent or ambiguous,it then proceeds to the second chevron step.id.at.it does not impose its own construction of the statute,but rather it decides whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.
brand x dealt with an agency statutory interpretation that conflicted with a circuit court earlier interpretation of a statute.the supreme court held that the circuit court must apply chevron deference to an agency interpretation of a statute regardless of the circuit court contrary precedent,provided that the court earlier precedent was an interpretation of a statutory ambiguity.brand x,at.the court explained 
a court prior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to chevron deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion only a judicial precedent holding that the statute unambiguously forecloses the agency interpretation,and therefore contains no gap for the agency to fill,displaces a conflicting agency construction.
accordingly,brand x requires us to review our prior opinion in in light of the bia subsequent decision in in re.if we conclude that was based,at least in part,on ambiguity in the applicable statutes,then pursuant to chevron and brand x we must give deference to the agency resolution of these ambiguities in in re 
e.our holding in ashcroft 
in,we first addressed whether the reinstatement provision categorically barred a previously removed alien who unlawfully reentered the united states from obtaining adjustment of status under the special adjustment provision.we distinguished padilla ashcroft,cir where we held that an alien who had unlawfully reentered the united states was barred by the reinstatement provision from adjusting his status under the special adjustment the grounds that padilla had applied only for adjustment of status prior to the initiation of reinstatement proceedings,while had applied for adjustment of status and an waiver of inadmissibility before the initiation of his reinstatement proceedings.at.
held that a successful waiver would offer a means of avoiding the reinstatement provision bar.id.at.we reasoned that by applying for the waiver before the initiation of reinstatement proceedings,was not yet subject to the reinstatement provision and therefore not barred from seeking adjustment of status through the special adjustment provision.id.we explained that h ad the ins exercised its discretion over waiver request in favor,he would no longer be subject to the reinstatement provision as he would no longer be considered an illegal entrant.id 
we next held that the ins denial of application based on his failure to apply for the waiver from outside the united states was legal error because it was contrary to the agency regulations,which provide for the filing of an form by an applicant for adjustment of status with the district director having jurisdiction over the place where the alien resides,and for the approved form,filed in conjunction with an application for adjustment of status,to be retroactive to the date on which the alien embarked or reembarked at a place outside the united states.id.at citing e,g,i 
we then determined that this legal error prejudiced because he was otherwise legally eligible for adjustment of status,and we accordingly remanded to the bia for a determination of whether he was entitled to the waiver as a matter of discretion.id.at.importantly,we held that the waiver cured inadmissibility under a c i ii.id.at.we relied on the text of the special adjustment provision allowing aliens who entered the united states without inspection to apply for adjustment of status,noting that nothing in that in and extended in and in the discussion of the statute purpose,limited the adjustment of status provision to aliens not subject to the reinstatement provision.id.at.we also relied on e and i,concluding that these regulations expressly permit applicants for adjustment of status who have been previously removed or deported to apply for permission to reapply from within this country.id.we noted further that c,which sets forth classes of aliens ineligible for adjustment of status,does not include previously deported or removed aliens.id.
was based on a finding of statutory ambiguity 
we conclude that,despite some language to the contrary,was based on a finding of statutory ambiguity that left room for agency discretion.chevron deference is mentioned twice in.as part of the standard of review discussion,we wrote that chevron deference was not applicable to our decision because the normal principles of statutory construction suffice,at.later in the opinion,when rejecting an agency guidance memorandum stating that aliens inadmissible under subsection a c are disqualified from seeking adjustment of status,explained that the guidance memorandum was entitled to only some deference,under christensen harris county,d,as opposed to r egulations that are a form of agency interpretation that is due chevron deference.at.when rejecting the guidance memorandum as inconsistent with the special adjustment provision and its implementing regulation,we commented that i n the absence of a more complete agency elaboration of how its interpretation of ina a can be reconciled with its own regulations,we must defer to the regulations rather than to the informal guidance memorandum.id.at citing christensen,at.
dhs argues that by the above statement,we did not rely on an unambiguous interpretation of the statute inadmissibility provision.it urges that the reference to chevron in the standard of review section is generalized and not supported by the text of the opinion in the specific context of the opinion interpretation of section a c.in contrast,plaintiffs contend that brand x does not apply because we decided under the first step of relying on the statutory terms of the special adjustment provision,buttressed by the agency regulations.
although relied on the special adjustment provision to hold that inadmissibility under subsection a c was not a bar to adjustment of status,we clearly relied on the agency regulations to reconcile the inadmissibility provision with the special adjustment provision.id.at.we could not rely on the plain language of the inadmissibility provision to reach our holding because subsection a c ii provides for a waiver of this permanent inadmissibility only by remaining outside the united states for ten years.instead,we expressly deferred to the regulations,reasoning that they were consistent with the special adjustment provision not the inadmissibility provision,and they would make no sense if read in conjunction with the guidance memorandum.id.at.
thus,notwithstanding disclaimer of chevron deference,careful review of the opinion shows that it is premised on the existence of ambiguity in the interplay between the inadmissibility and adjustment of status provisions.accordingly,our decision did not follow from the unambiguous terms of the statute and thus leave no room for agency discretion.brand x,at.we did not foreclose the agency interpretation of the statutory scheme,id.at,but rather relied on the regulations to both reject an informal agency interpretation of the inadmissibility provision and reach our holding,at.indeed,we noted that we were deferring to the regulations i n the absence of a more complete agency elaboration of how its interpretation of ina a can be reconciled with its own regulations.id.at.
the issue in might have been resolved under the first step of chevron by examining the text of the relevant statutes and their legislative histories.indeed,this was the bia approach in in re,as well as the approach taken by the tenth circuit in.see infra note.this approach was also adopted by a member of the panel who dissented from the denial of petition for panel rehearing however,by declining to adhere to the plain language of the inadmissibility provision and instead falling back on the regulations,did not find the inadmissibility provision,nor the statutory scheme,to be unambiguous.accordingly,we are not bound by and must defer to in re if its interpretation of the governing statute is reasonable.
g.the bia decision in in re interprets the applicable statutes 
in in re,a case arising out of dallas,texas,the bia addressed whether a c i ii barred a mexican citizen who was unlawfully present in the united states after having been removed from adjusting his status under the special adjustment provision.at.received an waiver while in mexico,granting his request for permission to reapply for admission.id.at.instead of reapplying for admission,however,reentered the united states without being admitted or paroled.id.subsequently,he filed an application for adjustment of status under the special adjustment provision which was denied because he was unlawfully present in the united states.id.he was placed in removal proceedings where he renewed his adjustment of status application.id.the immigration judge pretermitted his renewed application because unlawful reentry into the united states rendered him inadmissible under a c i ii.id.argued that he was not inadmissible under subsection a c i ii because,like,he had applied for his waiver before the commencement of removal proceedings.id.at.he maintained further that dhs approval of the waiver insulated him against any allegation of inadmissibility arising from his subsequent unlawful reentry.id.at.
the bia rejected these arguments,explaining first that the waiver was limited to inadmissibility under a a ii,pertaining to aliens who had been removed after illegally entering or attempting to enter the united states id.at.in other words,the waiver allowed him to apply for readmission without waiting the ten or twenty years otherwise required by subsection a a ii.the bia explained that by reentering the united states without permission,became permanently inadmissible under subsection a c i ii.id.at.he was ineligible to seek an waiver at that point because he did not qualify for relief from permanent inadmissibility under subsection a c ii,which requires an alien to remain outside of the united states for ten years before requesting permission to reapply for admission.id.at.therefore,successful waiver under subsection a a iii,obtained from outside the united states before he reentered the country,had no effect on his subsequent inadmissibility under subsection a c i ii as a previously removed alien unlawfully present in the united states.id.
the bia also rejected as support for position 
w e believe the ninth circuit analysis regarding the availability of a retroactive waiver of the ground of inadmissibility set forth at ina section a c i contradicts the language and purpose of the act and appears to have proceeded from an understandable,but ultimately incorrect,assumption regarding the applicability of.
id.at.the bia explained that the regulation was promulgated to implement changes to the ina made in and did not reflect the statutory changes made to the ina in iirira it reasoned 
w hile e and i authorize aliens who are unlawfully present in the united states to seek permission to reapply for admission retroactively in conjunction with an application for an adjustment of status,the very concept of retroactive permission to reapply for admission,permission requested after unlawful reentry,contradicts the clear language of section a c,which in its own right makes unlawful reentry after removal a ground of inadmissibility that can only be waived after the passage of years.
id.at citing comfort,cir 
the bia concluded that could not reasonably be construed as implementing subsection a c ii waiver provision and could not be reconciled with the plain language of subsection a c ii.at.it disagreed with the reasoning in that the statutory limitation would not cover the class of aliens under,who have been previously removed and are currently in this country prior to seeking permission to reapply.id.at quoting,at.the bia considered the more reasonable interpretation of the statutory framework to be that an alien may not obtain a waiver under subsection a c ii,retroactively or prospectively,without regard to the bar.id.it explained 
allows an alien to obtain a section a c ii waiver nunc pro tunc even though such a waiver would have been unavailable to him had he sought it prospectively,thereby placing him in a better position by asking forgiveness than he would have been in had he asked permission.such an interpretation contradicts the clear language of section a c ii and the legislative policy underlying section a c generally.
because the bia statutory interpretation in in re is reasonable,it is entitled to chevron deference under brand x 
the question,then,is whether we must defer to this ruling as a reasonable interpretation of the statutes.plaintiffs urge that chevron deference is owed only to the agency regulation and not to the bia decision which they contend is contrary to the regulation.they also rely on the fitzgerald living trust united states,cir explaining that brand x requires that deference be given to an agency interpretation of a statute unless a prior court decision has held that the statute is incompatible with the agency interpretation,to argue that brand x does not apply because our interpretation in is incompatible with the agency interpretation.
the relevant inquiry is not whether we are required to defer to the agency regulation but whether we must in re to that decision as a valid agency interpretation of the statute.the supreme court has accorded chevron deference to bia decisions,and we have followed suit.see ins,d gonzales,cir en banc.plaintiffs the regulation should be accorded chevron deference but the administrative decision interpreting that regulation in the context of the relevant statutory scheme should not be accorded fails.
moreover,plaintiffs are wrong when they assert that our statutory interpretation in was incompatible with the agency interpretation.indeed,we relied on the agency,its support our interpretation of the statutes in that case.furthermore,the reliance on the agency regulation in does not prevent deference to in re today.brand x explained that chevron deference applies even when an agency interpretation was a recent reversal of agency policy,at,because the whole point of chevron is to leave the discretion provided by the ambiguities of a statute with the implementing agency.id.at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.therefore,under chevron and brand x we are required to defer to in re interpretation of the statutory scheme,regardless of whether the agency once adhered to a different interpretation.
in in re,the bia held that an applicant who is inadmissible under subsection a c i ii is also ineligible to adjust his status under the special adjustment provision from within the united states.the alien is bound by subsection a c ii,requiring that he obtain permission to apply for readmission from outside the united states after ten years have lapsed from the date of his last departure.the bia decision is clearly reasonable and is therefore entitled to chevron deference under brand 
the district court correctly determined that it has jurisdiction over this case and that does not undermine the holding in that a successful waiver would avoid the reinstatement provision 
however,we vacate the district court order because we hold today that we are bound by the bia interpretation of the applicable statutes in in re,even though that interpretation differs from our prior interpretation in.pursuant to in re,plaintiffs as a matter of law are not eligible to adjust their status because they are ineligible to receive waivers.accordingly,the plaintiffs have no likelihood of success on the merits of thei
