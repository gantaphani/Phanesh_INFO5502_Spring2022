in this appeal,we determine whether wetmore printing company wetmore improperly breached its contracts to sell microsoft software to hgi associates,hgi,and,if so,what damages hgi properly can recover from wetmore.after a bench trial,the district court found that wetmore formed and breached three of four putative contracts with hgi,that hgi was entitled to accrued lost profits but no future lost profits caused by the breach,and that hgi was entitled to punitive damages because of the knowingly fraudulent actions wetmore undertook when forming and later breaching those contracts.we affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.
background 
in this case,the microsoft corporation microsoft,through its subsidiary,microsoft licensing,msli,and business partner,wetmore,attempted to set an trap to ensnare a suspected software pirate,hgi.the trap,however,only managed to ensnare wetmore.from the district court findings of fact,we summarize the relevant facts as follows.
hgi is a reseller of computer software and hardware that purchases software in the secondary market because the costs of obtaining software through authorized distribution channels are prohibitive.other than the contracts involved here,hgi never purchased or distributed software through any manufacturer authorized distribution channels.hgi president,ronald swartz,has worked for hgi since and is responsible for all of hgi acquisition and distribution of software,and he approves all purchases and sales.
at all times relevant to this appeal,wetmore was an authorized replicator ar for microsoft original equipment manufacturer oem distribution channel.wetmore was authorized by microsoft to sell microsoft software to approved microsoft distributors or licensees.wetmore customers include oems and authorized distributors ad such as compaq,and jcpenney.wetmore sells its software kits for approximately each however,after the sale,wetmore notifies msli,who then charges the oems and ads a separate licensing fee.the price for the software kits does not include any licensing or royalty fees.
in february of,swartz contacted wetmore and inquired about purchasing microsoft software.after the initial contact,wetmore notified msli about hgi interest.msli requested that wetmore help it investigate hgi activities because microsoft believed hgi was illegally selling unlicensed software.before any further contact or transactions,both msli and wetmore knew that hgi was not an ad for microsoft.
despite this knowledge,wetmore invited swartz to its houston,texas facility on february.while in houston,swartz met wetmore sales manager,steven herbst wetmore director of operations,karl kluetz wetmore sales support manager,todd bond and wetmore project manager that would be assigned to hgi,shane hatler.during the visit,swartz toured the facility,was given a credit application,and told that wetmore would supply specific microsoft pricing and part numbers.
wetmore representatives let swartz believe that he could buy microsoft products from wetmore even though it knew hgi was not an authorized microsoft dealer,and they did so with no intention to establish a bona fide business relationship with hgi.at.wetmore was only pretending to do business with hgi in order to assist in microsoft investigation.
furthermore,mark roenigk,msli director of oem operations,asked wetmore to record its meetings with swartz,and he proposed a list of questions to ask swartz in order to,among other things,get schwartz sic to admit that what he is doing is not a way to distribute microsoft products.id.at.during the meetings with swartz,wetmore asked whether hgi was licensed by microsoft to sell its software.the district court found that swartz replied that he was not licensed and stated that he did not believe hgi was required to have a license to sell microsoft products because hgi was only a reseller.id.at.moreover,the court also found that swartz stressed his concern that any microsoft products purchased by hgi be authentic microsoft software.id.both wetmore and msli knew that their actions were designed to deceive swartz into believing hgi would become a legitimate customer of wetmore and free to order microsoft software.
on march,swartz submitted his credit application to wetmore,which then shared it with msli.wetmore project manager,hatler,then price lists of various microsoft software to swartz and copied msli noting the prices sent to hgi.on or about march,swartz requested that wetmore send samples of the software.wetmore sent the samples with msli full knowledge and under the pretense that wetmore was willing and able to carry on a legitimate business relationship with hgi.id.at.
on march,hatler told swartz that wetmore could begin taking hgi purchase orders for microsoft software.several days later,hatler notified swartz that wetmore could deliver software kits to hgi.hgi ordered the kits on march,and wetmore accepted.msli was informed of the sale and requested descriptions of the units shipped to hgi.wetmore completely filled the order for units on march.on the same day,hgi ordered the kits,hgi also submitted purchase order for microsoft kits and purchase order for.swartz was told that wetmore would have to go to press on those orders.id.at.when wetmore notified msli of the additional orders,msli responded by saying,thanks.sounds like a plan.id.on march,swartz placed an additional purchase order for kits.
on march wetmore confirmed the orders and confirmed that it could make a partial of orders and in three days.for the remaining balance of the purchase orders,and,wetmore sales manager,herbst,told swartz,a s soon as i get more information on when we can ship the balance of your requirements,i let you know.id.at.thus,wetmore confirmed that it would fill the purchase orders and made no indication that hgi was not authorized to purchase the software.
in order to prepare for the incoming shipments,hgi leased warehouse space in colorado for three years.on march,hgi received the partial shipments of order and at the colorado facility however,the shipments were nonconforming because they were branded with a compaq logo and not generic as requested.further,the shipment was missing manuals for some of the kits.wetmore shipped the missing manuals to hgi however,it shipped them to hgi florida address at the request of msli because msli wanted to locate hgi warehouse there.
wetmore treated hgi as a legitimate client.it invoiced hgi for the completed orders,and hgi paid all invoices in full.wetmore invoices showed hgi as customer number.additionally,msli showed wetmore employees how to enter hgi orders into msli orion system for tracking royalty payment.
on april,hgi placed another order with wetmore for kits,but this order was never confirmed.due to pressure from hgi customers,swartz tried to contact wetmore representatives to check the status of his orders on april.several days later,on april,wetmore indicated that it could no longer supply hgi with microsoft software because hgi was not an authorized microsoft distributor.wetmore told hgi that there had been a mistake and asked hgi to return the prior shipments for a full refund.after this communication,swartz and hgi had no further contact with anyone at wetmore.
the district court summarized its findings and stated that,before april,wetmore never informed hgi that it could not or would not provide microsoft products to hgi never stated to hgi that hgi was required to be an authorized microsoft dealer and never stated to hgi that hgi was required to enter a licensing agreement with microsoft.id.at.furthermore,the district court found that 
wetmore engaged in a pattern and practice of blatantly false,deceptive and manipulative dealings and misrepresentations to hgi by confirming hgi purchase orders promising to ship outstanding requirements that had been ordered advising hgi that it would go to press on other products shipping products to hgi invoicing hgi and accepting payment from hgi,all prior to wetmore mistake.at all relevant times,hgi justifiably believed that the pricing provided to it by wetmore included any royalty that may have been due msli,if any,and that hgi was not liable to msli for payment of royalties of any microsoft product purchased from wetmore.
in its legal conclusions,the trial court held that,of the four alleged contracts in dispute,three were valid and binding contracts.orders,and were valid however,hgi final purchase order was not a valid contract because it was never confirmed by wetmore.after the court held that the contracts were valid,the court also held that wetmore committed a material breach of each of the three contracts by repudiating its obligations thereunder.id.at.the district court further held that wetmore breached its obligation to act in good faith,pursuant to and,when wetmore told hgi there had been a mistake.because wetmore knew hgi was not an authorized dealer of microsoft software from the beginning,there was in fact no mistake.thus,the trial court began its analysis of the damage award owed to hgi.
first,the district court found that wetmore owed hgi for any accrued lost profits from its breach of the contracts.the court estimated that hgi had outstanding orders from customers totaling in revenue.given that hgi cost to buy this product from wetmore would have been,the district court awarded the difference of to hgi as lost profits.furthermore,the district court found that hgi rented warehouse space in anticipation of wetmore delivery.the present value of the lease payments,was also awarded to hgi,making a total award of plus prejudgment interest to hgi for wetmore breach of contract.
second,the district court considered hgi claim for future lost profits.according to hgi expert,hgi sustained lost profits and future lost profits of approximately million.the court,however,found that the claim for future lost profits that have not accumulated prior to the trial of this matter can not be proven with a reasonable degree of certainty as they are entirely speculative and conjectural.id.at.thus,the district court did not award additional future lost profits to hgi.
third,the district court found that wetmore actions resulted in fraud in the inducement.wetmore fraudulent misrepresentations to hgi that led hgi to justifiably believe it was purchasing software from wetmore injured hgi.the district court,however,found that,because the damages sustained by hgi breach of contract and fraudulent inducement claims were the same under florida law,no additional damages would be awarded for the fraud claim.
fourth,the district court awarded to hgi in punitive damages because wetmore intentionally pursued a course of wrongful conduct.id.at.the court found by clear and convincing evidence that wetmore engaged in and knowingly condoned and ratified fraudulent actions so reckless as to constitute a conscious disregard or indifference to hgi business,and therefore,a punitive damage award was warranted.id.at.
on appeal of a district court order from a bench trial,we review the court conclusions of law de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.see uruguay compania de seguros,aaa cooper,cir.we will not upset a district court finding of fact unless it is clearly erroneous.a.by that standard,we may reverse the district court findings of fact if,after viewing all the evidence,we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states united states gypsum.
in this case,both parties argue that the district court erred.wetmore argues that the district court improperly upheld the validity of the contracts because they violate public policy,the district court improperly applied the doctrine of waiver to msli rights in the software,and the district court erred by awarding punitive damages to hgi.on the other hand,hgi argues that the district court erred by not allowing damages for future lost profits.we now consider each of these arguments in turn.
contract validity 
public policy violation 
wetmore argues that the district court erred by finding the contracts were valid and any intellectual property rights waived because the contracts were in violation of public policy.essentially,their argument is that the undelivered software wetmore would have provided was not licensed or authorized by microsoft therefore,hgi resales of that software would violate microsoft copyrights and the public policy to protect those rights.wetmore analysis of the circumstances,however,here is incorrect.
there is no violation of public policy in this case because the contract entered into by hgi called for software that was already licensed and authorized by microsoft.according to the findings of fact by the district court,which we conclude are supported by sufficient evidence in the record and are not clearly erroneous,at all times hgi justifiably believed that the pricing provided by wetmore included any royalty that may have been due msli,if any,and that hgi was not liable to msli for payment of royalties of any microsoft products purchased from wetmore.at.further,the court found that there was nothing in the contracts that contemplated circumvention of microsoft intellectual property rights.id.at.thus,by wetmore deception,the contracts it formed with hgi required wetmore to supply microsoft software that did not violate microsoft intellectual property rights and was approved,and even encouraged,by microsoft.
viewing wetmore contractual obligations in this light,we do not agree with its public policy argument.essentially,wetmore asks us to invalidate a contract requiring it to deliver lawful and approved goods because the goods it could supply were,in fact,not lawful or approved goods.this we can not do.
under texas law,parties may contract so long as their agreement does not violate the law or public policy.in re prudential ins.of.we can not find any requirement in the contract between wetmore and hgi that would violate law or public policy.their contract is an agreement to purchase licensed and approved software.unless otherwise agreed,hgi had a right under texas law to presume that it would take possession of the software with no further claims of infringement by a third party.see.bus.ann.c see also doyle harben,finding an innocent seller of a stolen vehicle was liable to buyer for breach of warranties when the vehicle was confiscated by the state.although wetmore knew its software kits did not include royalty payments to microsoft,and wetmore knew hgi was buying the software kits with the understanding that it had no obligations to pay royalties wetmore continued to mislead hgi by treating hgi as an approved customer and failing to correct the belief that the software was.though the violation of intellectual property rights is of great concern to public policy,it was not contemplated by this contract 
instead,we find that wetmore position is a greater threat to public policy and contract law in general.as an example,suppose that two parties form a contract to purchase a car with the expressed understanding that the seller has the right to sell that car to the buyer.in other words,the seller is not selling a stolen car to the buyer.the seller can not,then,intentionally avoid his contractual liability to sell a car by claiming that the car he would have sold buyer was in fact stolen and thus an illegal contract that violates public policy.the agreement was not for the purchase of a stolen car,which would violate the law and public policy,but for a legitimately owned car.similarly,hgi contracted to purchase microsoft software with the understanding that there were no further royalties due on that software.wetmore,although knowing its typical products required additional royalty payments,intentionally misled hgi into believing it would receive software licensed by microsoft.it can not now circumvent this valid contractual obligation to hgi.wetmore argument that the contract violates public policy fails because the actual contract created did not violate microsoft rights or public policy.
waiver of msli rights 
next,wetmore contends that even if the contracts do not violate public policy,the trial court misapplied the copyright waiver doctrine by waiving microsoft rights in the undelivered software.wetmore argues that msli only waived its right to the software that had already been delivered,however,microsoft did not waive its rights to the undelivered software because it never approved of the sale by wetmore.thus,under the doctrine of copyright waiver wetmore argues that microsoft conduct does not amount to the type of clear,decisive,and unequivocal conduct that manifests an intent to waive its rights.appellee answer br.at.
considering our holding in the previous section and the district court finding that wetmore intentionally misled hgi into believing it was purchasing software,we strain to understand the relevance of wetmore decision to defend itself with microsoft intellectual property rights.nevertheless,we do not strain to answer its arguments.the actions of both wetmore and msli warrant the of any applicable copyright claims either may have in the undelivered software.
copyright estoppel applies when the alleged infringer can show that the copyright owner knew the facts of the infringement,the copyright owner intended its conduct to be acted upon or the copyright owner acted such that the alleged infringer has a right to believe it was so intended,the alleged infringer is ignorant of the true facts,and the alleged infringer relies on the copyright owner conduct to his detriment.see carson dynegy,cir hampton paramount pictures,cir.a copyright owner can be estopped not only by words and actions but also by silence and inaction.see carson,at hampton,at.in this case,all four conditions are met.first,both wetmore and msli knew that hgi was seeking to purchase microsoft software from wetmore and that hgi did not have a licensing agreement or approval to distribute from microsoft.second,both wetmore and msli intended hgi to place orders for the software once hgi was allowed to do so,and they intentionally misled hgi regarding its ability to purchase approved software.
third,as the district court found,hgi justifiably believed that wetmore software kits would include any and all royalty payments to microsoft.hgi was ignorant as to any further royalty payments required,and both wetmore and msli were silent when hgi asserted its belief that it would not need a license from microsoft to purchase the software from wetmore.not only was hgi legitimately ignorant of the fact it might be infringing microsoft rights,but also both wetmore and msli knew of this ignorance and actively sought to induce it.
fourth,hgi relied on wetmore conduct and the conduct of msli acting through wetmore agents to its detriment.after relying on wetmore assertions that it could deliver the software,hgi placed purchase orders for numerous software kits,rented warehouse space in colorado for three years,and proceeded to accept orders from customers for the software.these outstanding obligations were all formed on the basis of wetmore and msli fraudulent conduct and hgi subsequent reliance.therefore,the doctrine of copyright estoppel applies to any possible claim by wetmore that microsoft copyrights were violated.
punitive damages 
wetmore also argues that the district court award of punitive damages was improper.specifically,it argues that texas law requires a separate and distinct injury in order to prove fraud in the inducement,see camp ruffin,cir per curiam,and,that,even if the fraud claim is allowed,florida law does not allow the award of punitive damages when the compensatory damages for both the breach of contract and fraud claim compensate for the same injuries,see kee reserve life ins,cir where the compensatory damages requested in a count for tort are identical to the compensatory damages sought in a count for breach of contract,compensatory damages and punitive damages for the tort are not recoverable.
first,to the extent camp prevents a fraudulent inducement claim where the parties also allege the same damages under breach of contract that holding has been expressly rejected by the texas supreme court decision in formosa plastics presidio engineers contractors.in formosa plastics the texas supreme court resolved a dispute of this issue between the various texas appellate courts and decisions.see id.at.the court held that tort damages for a fraudulent inducement claim are recoverable irrespective of whether the fraudulent representations are later subsumed in a contract or whether the plaintiff only suffers an economic loss related to the subject matter of the contract.id.at.furthermore,the court stated that a decision a llowing the recovery of fraud damages only when a plaintiff suffers an injury that is distinct from the economic losses recoverable under breach of contract claim is inconsistent with texas law and ignores the independent legal duty preclud ing the use of fraud to induce a binding agreement.id.consequently,the idea that texas law does not allow fraudulent inducement claims with injuries that are separate and distinct from breach of contract losses is incorrect.
second,from our review of florida damages law,we conclude that punitive damages are awardable for sufficient fraudulent inducement claims,even when those claims involve facts related to a collateral breach of contract claim.the general rule in florida states that punitive damages are not awarded for breach of contract claims.see,griffith shamrock,so d.however,where the acts constituting a breach of contract also amount to a cause of action in tort there may be a recovery of exemplary damages upon proper allegations and proof.accord ferguson,north am.van lines,so d,per curiam southern bell.hanft,so d,see also kee,at.the underlying tort cause of action must be based on some sort of intentional wrong,willful or wanton misconduct,or culpable negligence,the extent of which amounts to an independent tort.hanft,so d at.
wetmore relies on our decision in kee to assert that punitive damages are not recoverable when the compensatory damages for the breach of contract and fraudulent inducement are the same.that reasoning,however,has been rejected in fraudulent inducement cases.in kee,we based much of our decision on the florida supreme court holding in afm southern bell telephone telegraph that stated,without some conduct resulting in personal injury or property damage,there can be no independent tort flowing from a contractual breach which would justify a tort claim solely for economic losses.so d,accord kee,at.the florida supreme court,however,has subsequently rejected the use of this language to eliminate a legitimate fraudulent inducement cause of action on the sole basis that claims recover for the same alleged economic injuries.see htp,lineas aereas costarricenses,so d.
in htp,the court resolved a conflict between the florida courts of appeal regarding whether a claim of fraudulent inducement is barred in a breach of contract action.see id.at.the court held that a fraudulent inducement is a separate and independent tort when compared to breach of contract.see id.at.the facts concerning fraud committed during the formation of a contract can be distinguished from the facts resulting in the breach of that contract.see id.thus,an action on a contract and for fraud in inducing plaintiff to enter into such a contract may exist at the same time,and a recovery on one of the causes will not bar a subsequent action on the other.id.citations and quotations omitted.
florida courts have further explained that the decision in htp allows an award of punitive damages for fraudulent inducement despite additional claims for breach of contract.see connecticut life ins.jones,so d,indeed,even we have recognized the ability of a party to seek punitive damages for fraud and compensatory damages for breach of contract under florida law,despite both claims arising from the same facts.see palm beach atl,first united fund,cir.thus,we conclude that the district court properly granted punitive damages for the acts of fraud perpetuated by wetmore.
lost profits 
finally,hgi appeals the decision of the district court denying its claim for future lost profits on the undelivered software.the district court granted damages to hgi for any accrued profits it incurred from resale contracts it had outstanding at the time of the breach.for the undelivered software that did not have outstanding resale contracts at
