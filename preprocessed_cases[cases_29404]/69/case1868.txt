diane benson benson seeks review of the en banc opinion and decision after reconsideration of the workers compensation appeals board board that granted her a total of,in two separate awards,based on a determination that two industrial injuries to her neck each caused percent permanent disability.benson contends she is entitled to a single award of because she suffers a combined permanent disability from both injuries of percent.having previously granted benson petition for a writ of review,we now affirm the decision of the board.
factual and procedural background 
benson began work as a file clerk for respondent permanente medical group permanente in april.benson job required her to stand essentially all day,except for some brief periods of sitting,and it required repetitive neck and upper extremity motion.on june,she sustained an injury to her neck while reaching up over her head and pulling out a plastic bin to file a chart,at which point she felt a pain in her neck.the next day,she went to work,but her neck hurt even more.she was initially diagnosed with neck strain and put on light duty.on july,benson was placed on temporary total disability and did not return to work thereafter.in november,she filed an application for adjudication of claim alleging a specific injury on june.benson eventually underwent a fusion of the cervical spine.
on september,benson was examined by joseph izzo,who was acting as an agreed medical examiner ame.in his report,izzo concluded that benson had actually sustained two separate injuries to her specific injury on june,and a cumulative trauma injury through june.izzo also concluded that benson injuries both became permanent and stationary on september.izzo apportioned half of benson permanent disability to cumulative trauma through june,and half to the specific injury of june,izzo concluded there was no basis for apportionment to nonindustrial factors.benson later filed a second claim for the cumulative trauma injury.
it is undisputed that benson combined permanent disability rating is percent,after adjustment for age and occupation.at trial before the workers compensation judge wcj,permanente argued that the workers compensation reform legislation,enacted as senate bill reg.sess.abrogated wilkinson workers compensation appeals bd.cal d,wilkinson and necessitated two separate awards of percent permanent disability.benson urged that wilkinson had survived senate bill and argued for the imposition of a single award based on a combined rating of percent permanent disability.the wcj issued her findings and award,which applied wilkinson and issued a single award of based on the combined permanent disability rating.
permanente filed a petition for reconsideration,which the board granted.thereafter,the board issued an en banc opinion and decision after reconsideration,wherein a majority of the board held that the rule in wilkinson is not consistent with the new requirement that apportionment be based on causation and,therefore,wilkinson is no longer generally applicable.rather,we now must determine and apportion to the cause of disability for each industrial injury.applying its holding,the board concluded that b ased upon the ame determination that each of benson two injuries was equally responsible for her current level of permanent disability,she is entitled to receive a separate award of percent permanent disability for each injury.the board amended the wcj findings and award to provide for two separate awards of each,based on two separate ratings of percent permanent disability.the board two awards entitle benson to a total of,with each award payable at per week for weeks.the wcj combined award entitled benson to a total of,payable at per week for weeks.the difference is caused by the benefit schedule,which more generously compensates more severe disabilities.brodie,supra,cal th at fn,d,number of weeks of indemnity increases in proportion to percentage of permanent disability.
one commissioner dissented,arguing that senate bill did not impact wilkinson and,alternatively,that substantial evidence did not support a finding that any permanent disability was caused by benson cumulative injury.this petition for a writ of review followed.
ii.discussion 
benson maintains that the board erred by holding that the repeal of former labor code section repealed by stats,ch,and enactment of new sections and,abrogated the wilkinson doctrine applying sections and to require apportionment between two simultaneous industrial injuries for the reasons discussed below,we conclude that senate bill superseded the wilkinson doctrine and that current sections and require apportionment to each distinct industrial injury causing a permanent disability

apportionment law before senate bill 
before the enactment of senate bill,apportionment was governed by former sections and marsh workers comp.appeals bd.th,d marsh.two sections,and,appl ied to antecedent injuries.former s ection relieve d an employer from the burden of compensating an injured worker for disability attributable to a preexisting permanent disability or physical impairment.former s ection did the same when an injured worker disability was partially attributable to a preexisting disease or condition.marsh,supra,th at,d.former section left employers liable for any portion of a disability that would not have occurred but for the current industrial cause if the disability arose in part from an interaction between an industrial cause and a nonindustrial cause,but the nonindustrial cause would not alone have given rise to a disability,no apportionment was to be allowed.citations.brodie,supra,cal th at,d.f ormer section was interpreted as granting employees wide latitude to disprove apportionment based on prior permanent disability awards by demonstrating that they had substantially rehabilitated the injury.citation.brodie,supra,cal th at,d.thus,b efore the enactment of bill,apportionment was concerned with the disability,not its cause or pathology.citation.marsh,supra,th at,d accord,brodie,supra,cal th at,d,under old apportionment rules courts properly rejected apportionment of a single disability with multiple causes.
in wilkinson,our supreme court interpreted former section and held that whenever a worker sustains successive injuries to the same part of his body and these injuries become permanent at the same time,the worker is entitled to an award based on the combined disability.wilkinson,supra,cal d at,citing bauer county of los angeles.in wilkinson,the employee had injured both of his,in a fall on april,and then again on june.cal d at.it was determined that both injuries arose out of and occurred in the course of employment and that both injuries became permanent at the same time.id.at.after deducting preexisting disability caused by nonindustrial injuries,the wcj apportioned the combined remaining permanent disability of percent between the two industrial injuries,rating each at percent.id.at.the wcj awarded for each injury,or a total of.ibid.

the board decision 
in this case,the board concluded,at permanente urging,that the legislature repeal of former section and enactment of new sections and revealed its plain intent to adopt a new apportionment scheme inconsistent with the wilkinson doctrine.the board decision,and permanente argument before us,relies in large part on the plain language of new sections and.section,subdivision a,provides the employer shall only be liable for the percentage of permanent disability directly caused by the injury arising out of and occurring in the course of employment.section provides,in relevant part,as follows 
a apportionment of permanent disability shall be based on causation.
b any physician who prepares a report addressing the issue of permanent disability due to a claimed industrial injury shall in that report address the issue of causation of the permanent disability.
c in order for a physician report to be considered complete on the issue of permanent disability,the report must include an apportionment determination.a physician shall make an apportionment determination by finding what approximate percentage of the permanent disability was caused by the direct result of injury arising out of and occurring in the course of employment and what approximate percentage of the permanent disability was caused by other factors both before and subsequent to the industrial injury,including prior industrial injuries.if the physician is unable to include an apportionment determination in his or her report,the physician shall state the specific reasons why the physician could not make a determination of the effect of that prior condition on the permanent disability arising from the injury.the physician shall then consult with other physicians or refer the employee to another physician from whom the employee is authorized to seek treatment or evaluation in accordance with this division in order to make the final determination.
d an employee who claims an industrial injury shall,upon request,disclose all previous permanent disabilities or physical impairments.
the board also relied on brodie,supra,cal th,d.in brodie,the supreme court considered the impact of senate bill on the following question when a worker suffers an industrial injury that results in permanent disability,how should the compensation owed based on the current level of permanent disability be discounted for either previous industrial injury or nonindustrial injuries id.at,d.in fuentes workers compensation appeals bd.cal d,fuentes,the court had previously held that formula a was the correct method for calculating an award when permanent disability could be partially attributed to nonindustrial causes.brodie,supra,cal th at,d,noting formula a also applied when permanent disability could be partially attributed to a previous permanent disability.under formula a,the percentage of permanent disability attributable to a new injury is calculated by subtracting the old permanent disability rating from the new permanent disability rating and then consulting the benefits table for the award due that difference.brodie,supra,cal th at,d,fuentes,supra,cal d at.
after reviewing the prior approach to apportionment,the brodie court attributed the statutory revisions to the following goals reversal of the rule barring apportionment if the disability arose in part from an interaction between an industrial cause and a nonindustrial cause,but the nonindustrial cause would not alone have given rise to a disability and reversal of the rule allowing employees wide latitude to disprove apportionment based on prior permanent disability awards by demonstrating that they had substantially rehabilitated the injury.citation.brodie,supra,cal th at,d.the brodie court reasoned that former sections and,as interpreted by the courts,were inconsistent with the new regime of apportionment based on causation,as well as the conclusive presumption that previous permanent disability still existed for apportionment purposes,subd.a,subds.a,b.former section required consideration of the new injury by itself and not in conjunction with or in relation to the previous disability or impairment and further called for compensation for the later injury to be determined as though no prior disability or impairment had existed.but under senate bill,the new approach to apportionment is to look at the current disability and parcel out its causative,prior industrial,current decide the amount directly caused by the current industrial source.this approach requires thorough consideration of past injuries,not disregard of them.thus,repeal of section was necessary to effect the legislature purpose in adopting a causation regime.brodie,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.
the court observed w e do not presume that the legislature intends to overthrow principles of law unless such intention is clearly expressed or necessarily implied.citations.brodie,supra,cal th at,d.given that the legislative goals just noted sufficiently explained the reforms,the absence of legislative history regarding calculation,and that the plain language of the new statutes did not compel any particular method of calculation,the supreme court held that senate bill had not superseded fuentes.brodie,supra,cal th at,d.
benson analogizes to brodie and maintains that neither the plain language of the new apportionment scheme,nor its legislative history,suggests that the legislature sought to abrogate the wilkinson decision.we disagree and conclude that the plain language of the new statutory scheme requires apportionment to each cause of a permanent disability,including each distinct industrial injury.this conclusion is compelled by the plain language of current sections and the repeal of former section the legislative history and the deference we owe the board interpretation of workers compensation statutes.honeywell workers comp.appeals,supra,cal th at,d.we address each point in turn.
the plain language of sections and 
sections and do not support benson argument that the legislature only intended to protect employers from liability for permanent disability previously compensated or not caused by their employment.in fact,the plain language of sections and compels apportionment here.
section,subdivision a,provides the employer shall only be liable for the percentage of permanent disability directly caused by the injury arising out of and occurring in the course of employment.italics added.the legislature use of the phrase the injury necessarily implies that each distinct industrial injury must be separately compensated.adopting benson interpretation would ignore the legislature use of the singular form of injury,rather than the plural.although all percent of benson permanent disability was directly caused by injuries arising out of and occurring in the course of benson employment with permanente,each distinct industrial injury directly caused only half of that permanent disability.
furthermore,section,subdivision a,provides that a pportionment of permanent disability shall be based on causation.the plain language of section,subdivision a,makes clear that the focus is no longer on the permanent disability itself,but its causes.apportionment based on causation is not naturally limited to apportionment to nonindustrial causes and previous permanent disability awards.rather,a pportionment based on causation must mean apportionment to all causes,including each distinct industrial injury.had the legislature intended to insulate certain causes from apportionment,it would have said so.
our understanding is confirmed by the plain language of section,subdivision c,which calls for a physician to make an apportionment determination by finding what approximate percentage of the permanent disability was caused by the direct result of injury arising out of and occurring in the course of employment and what approximate percentage of the permanent disability was caused by other factors both before and subsequent to the industrial injury,including prior industrial injuries.italics added.again,the legislature required assessment of the approximate percentage of permanent disability caused by the direct result of injury and not injuries,subd.c,italics added.we agree with the board majority that the plain language of section,subdivision c,read in conjunction with the rest of the statutory scheme,suggests the legislature intent to require apportionment on an basis,and no longer only for previous permanent disability.compare,subd.c with former.although brodie did not address the precise question presented here,the brodie court interpretation of senate bill is consistent with the board majority understanding.see brodie,supra,cal th at,d,the new approach to apportionment is to look at the current disability and parcel out its causative,prior industrial,current decide the amount directly caused by the current industrial source.
the clear change in the statutory language indicates an intent to invalidate wilkinson.see mosk superior court cal d,generally,a substantial change in the language of a statute or constitutional provision by an amendment indicates an intention to change its meaning.brodie,supra,cal th at,d.reference to other subdivisions of sections and makes clear that the legislature was cognizant of the distinction between successive permanent disabilities and successive injuries.see,subd.d an employee who claims an industrial injury shall,upon request,disclose all previous permanent disabilities or physical impairments.italics added,subd.b if the applicant has received a prior award of permanent disability,it shall be conclusively presumed that the prior permanent disability exists at the time of any subsequent industrial injury.italics added.the legislature focus,in section,subdivision c,on apportionment to other causative factors,including prior industrial injuries,rather than prior permanent disabilities,must be accorded significance 
it is unreasonable to contend,as benson does,that the plain language of section,subdivision c,is consistent with the continued validity of wilkinson the dissenting commissioner below similarly contended that section,subdivision c,provides for the apportionment of disability to other factors both before and subsequent to the industrial injury emphasis added,but it does not provide for the apportionment of disability to causation by other factors where those factors are caused by successive industrial injuries and are concurrent with the factors of disability caused by the first industrial injury that is,to rephrase wilkinson if the worker incurs successive injuries which become permanent at the same time,none of the factors causing permanent disability is before or subsequent to the others,and section hence does not require apportionment.
the problem with the dissenting commissioner approach is that it rewrites the statute to require apportionment based on what approximate percentage of the permanent disability was caused by other factors both before and subsequent to the permanent disability caused by the industrial injury,subd.c.in so doing,the dissent assumes that section,subdivision c,was intended to perpetuate the preexisting permanent disability rule.however,senate bill could not have been intended to eliminate the but for rule with respect to permanent disability simultaneously caused by industrial and nonindustrial factors while,at the same time,perpetuating the preexisting disability rule for industrial injuries.see brodie,supra,cal th at,d,in cases of apportionment for causation,however,the notion of a first percent and a second percent will frequently not apply.where an industrial cause and nonindustrial cause simultaneously interact and are equally responsible for a percent injury,there is no first percent or second percent.yeager construction workers comp.appeals bd.th,d prior disability or evidence of modified work performance is no longer a prerequisite to apportionment.in order for the board to comply with section,subdivision a,and distinguish permanent disability directly caused by the industrial injury from permanent disability simultaneously caused by nonindustrial factors,medical evidence,determining the percentages attributable to each,must be available.see brodie,supra,cal th at,d.benson interpretation of section,subdivision c,would deprive the board of a physician apportionment determination when permanent disability is simultaneously caused by multiple factors,industrial or otherwise.
in conclusion,we agree with the board majority that the plain language of section,subdivision c,read in conjunction with the statutory scheme as a whole,specifically requires a physician to determine what percentage of disability was caused by each industrial injury,regardless of whether any particular industrial injury occurred before or after any other particular industrial injury or injuries.given the plain language of the new statutory provisions,we agree with the board that a pplication of wilkinson,and the concomitant merging of separate injuries into a single award of disability,is contrary to the reforms set in place by sb,which mandate that an employer can not be held liable for any disability other than that directly caused by the industrial injury.
repeal of former section 
the repeal of former section buttresses our conclusion.see wilkinson,supra,cal d at,former section d id not require apportionment in all cases of successive injuries,but only in cases of successive permanent disabilities.as the supreme court stated in brodie the new approach to apportionment is to look at the current disability and parcel out its causative,prior industrial,current decide the amount directly caused by the current industrial source.this approach requires thorough consideration of past injuries,not disregard of them.thus,repeal of section was necessary to effect the legislature purpose in adopting a causation regime.brodie,supra,cal th at,d.
nonetheless,benson urges us to follow the presumption,reiterated by the brodie court,that the legislature does not intend to overthrow principles of law unless such intention is clearly expressed or necessarily implied.brodie,supra,cal th at,d.according to benson,we should be even more cautious than the brodie court in inferring intent to supersede precedent from the repeal of former section,because wilkinson was an exception to the fuentes doctrine.wilkinson,supra,cal d at,o ur decision in fuentes explaining how to apportion disability for injuries falling within section is inapplicable to the successive industrial injuries at issue here which do not fall within the scope of that section.therefore,if the legislature,by repealing former section,did not intend to abrogate fuentes,in which the result was mandated by the express language of former section fuentes,supra,cal d at,then surely it did not intend to abrogate supreme court precedent that provided an exception predicated on the same statute.
brodie is distinguishable.in brodie,the supreme court concluded that,with respect to fuentes,nothing in current section or section expressly requires formulas a,b,c,modified c,or any other approach to calculating compensation.nor does anything in the language implicitly do so.brodie,supra,cal th at,d.with respect to apportionment,however,we agree with the board that the legislature has not been silent.as amicus curiae cwci contends the permanent and stationary date of successive injuries is now irrelevant,because the requirement of a preexisting disability to support apportionment no longer exists.the legislature rejected the combination of distinct industrial injuries when it repealed former section and enacted sections and.accordingly,any presumption in favor of the continued validity of wilkinson does not apply.brodie,supra,cal th at,d.
legislative history 
when the statutory language is clear and there is no uncertainty as to the legislative intent,we are required to look no further and simply enforce the statute according to its terms.citations.dubois workers comp.appeals,supra,cal th at,d.inasmuch as the plain language of the new apportionment scheme expresses a legislative intent to abrogate the wilkinson doctrine,we are required to go no further.but even if some ambiguity were to exist in the statutory language,our conclusion is reinforced by the legislative history 
senate bill itself provides this act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace,health,or safety within the meaning of article iv of the constitution and shall go into immediate effect.the facts constituting the necessity are in order to provide relief to the state from the effects of the current workers compensation crisis at the earliest possible time,it is necessary for this act to take effect immediately.stats,ch,italics added.the perceived crisis that the legislature sought to relieve was one caused by soaring workers compensation costs.see stats,ch,assem.com.on insurance,analysis of bill reg.sess.as proposed to be amended july,identifying crisis linked to skyrocketing costs cal.chamber of commerce,floor alert re bill reg.sess,w orkers compensation costs for employers have skyrocketed over the past four years,on average.
we can not agree with benson that the legislature sole intent was to combat rising premium rates caused by disturbances within the insurance sector.see assem.com.on insurance,analysis of bill reg.sess.as proposed to be amended july,attributing increased insurance premium rates to deregulation and investment losses in the insurance sector,as well as increasing cost of medical care.workers compensation costs ha d increased for a number of reasons.id.at.as discussed below,the legislature repeatedly indicated its specific intent to reform apportionment rules to meet the overarching legislative goal of cost reduction.
as noted by the brodie court,senate bill reg.sess.started out as a minor bill designed to change one aspect of workers compensation wholly unrelated to apportionment.see com.on labor and industrial relations,analysis of senate bill reg.sess.as amended.it was but one of different bills to reform workers compensation passed out of the senate or assembly in.rules,off.of floor analyses,on bill reg.sess.as amended july.senate and assembly leaders responded to this plethora of overlapping measures by submitting them to a joint conference to digest the bills and incorporate their provisions into a single omnibus reform measure.assem.com.on insurance,analysis of bill reg.sess.as proposed to be amended july.brodie,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
during the regular legislative session,apportionment reform was originally proposed in assembly bill,assembly bill,and senate bill.but,these bills proposed reforms that differ significantly from the reforms ultimately enacted.see stats,ch,assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced,amend.to bill reg.sess,amend.to assem.bill reg.sess.july.for example,assembly bill proposed,in relevant part section be added to the labor code,to read.a the burden of proof for the apportionment regarding permanent disability under sections,and shall rest upon the defendant.in accordance with section,the defendant shall demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence,and by reasonable medical probability,that absent the industrial injury,the injured worker had lost,as a consequence of a preexisting injury or illness,some capacity to perform the activity affected by the injury.b notwithstanding any other provision of this code relating to workers compensation benefits,including section,in denying apportionment the appeals board may not,in determining permanent disability,rely on any medical report that fails to fully address the issue of apportionment and fails to set forth the basis of the medical opinion.in denying apportionment,the appeals board may not rely on any medical report that fails to apportion a previous injury or illness that has been the subject of a prior claim for damages or that fails to provide a discussion of the medical processes by which a previously asserted injury or illness resolved without affecting bodily function.assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced,italics added accord,amend.to bill reg.sess,amend.to assem.bill reg.sess.july.
it was when senate bill emerged from the conference committee that the proposed apportionment provisions first appeared in the current form.proposed conf.report to bill reg.sess,as proposed april.although the legislative history does not provide any further clarification for the changes,we must conclude that the changes had significance.none of the precursor bills had proposed repeal of former sections and.see assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced amend.to bill reg.sess,amend.to assem.bill reg.sess.july.furthermore,all of these precursor bills proposed limiting the board reliance on any medical report that fails to apportion a previous injury or illness that has been the subject of a prior claim for damages assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced,italics added accord,amend.to bill reg.sess,amend.to assem.bill reg.sess.july.by removing this limitation and requiring physicians to apportion to prior industrial injuries without limitation,it can be inferred that the legislature intended to expand the scope of apportionment to include prior industrial injuries that had not been the subject of prior compensation.compare assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced,with,subd.c.had the legislature intended apportionment only for prior industrial injuries that had been the subject of previous awards,it would not have changed the proposed statutory language.
the legislative history also demonstrates a clear intent to wipe the slate clean of prior apportionment law and proceed under an entirely new causation regime.see legis.counsel,bill,stats,ch.reg.sess.summary,this bill would repeal and recast apportionment provisions.rules,office of senate floor analyses,conf.on bill reg.sess.as amended.present law replaced by language that apportionment of permanent disability is based on causation.as the supreme court has stated,the legislative history of senate bill highlights the legislature intent to change how one arrives at the percentage disability for which an employer or insurer is liable brodie,supra,cal th at,d.
we can not conceive that the legislature would intend to replace or repeal and recast the rules of apportionment but still retain the wilkinson doctrine.the legislature indicated no such exception in either the legislative history or the statutory language.furthermore,we are not convinced that the absence of reference to wilkinson by name in either the statutory language or the legislative history compels its survival.the legislature may have on occasion explicitly mentioned certain judicial decisions it sought to overrule.see,former the purpose of this section is to overrule the decision in jensen wcab,d.but benson cites no legal authority compelling the legislature to do so.in fact,when the legislature undertakes to amend a statute which has been the subject of judicial construction it is presumed that the legislature was fully cognizant of such construction,and when substantial changes are made in the statutory language it is usually inferred that the lawmakers intended to alter the law in those particulars affected by such changes.citations.palos verdes faculty palos verdes peninsula unified sch.dist.cal d,see also people mendoza cal th,d,legislature repeal of prior statute together with its enactment of a new statute on the same subject with significant differences in language,strongly suggests the legislature intended to change the law.when the legislature repealed former section and provided for apportionment to causative factors,including prior industrial injuries,it demonstrated a clear intent to overrule wilkinson.see,subd.c.
in enacting senate bill,the legislature made approximately revisions to the workers compensation statutes.stats,ch.it is little wonder that the legislature did not mention wilkinson by name in the midst of such extensive reform.furthermore,it is undisputed that sections and abrogated the rehabilitation rule and the bar against apportionment to pathology.brodie,supra,cal th at,d.yet,the legislature did not refer to the judicial decisions that had established those rules.if the legislature can abrogate those lines of authority without explicit reference,then surely it can do the same regarding wilkinson.
the fact that both workers and employers were to benefit from senate bill as a whole does not help us interpret the specific statutes at issue here.see rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended july,while there is agreement among the parties that the system is in need of repair,what remains subject for debate is what the real systemic problems are and how best to address them without diminishing the arguably meager benefits injured workers receive in this state.benson reliance on the few provisions of senate bill that expanded employee benefits is misplaced,subd.d increasing benefits for workers with percent or greater permanent disability,subd.d increasing benefits for disabled workers denied prompt return to work,subd.c providing additional medical benefits.the brodie court aptly observed that these changes were all made in areas other than apportionment.brodie,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
benson does not cite any legislative history that both specifically relates to apportionment and supports her position.when it came to apportionment,the legislature included a requirement that doctors include apportionment discussions in their reports,subds.b,c,a prohibition against avoiding apportionment by proving that a prior injury had been rehabilitated,subd.b,a cap on awards based on injuries to any one body part,subd.c,and a reversal of the prohibition against apportionment based on cause and corresponding expansion of the range of bases that would trigger apportionment,subd.a.brodie,supra,cal th at,fn,d.even if the statutory language were ambiguous,the legislative history shows a clear intent to abrogate the wilkinson doctrine.
deference to the board interpretation 
finally,our conclusions are consistent with the en banc board majority opinion.t he board has extensive expertise in interpreting and applying the workers compensation scheme.consequently,we give weight to its interpretations of workers compensation statutes unless they are clearly erroneous or unauthorized.citations.brodie,supra,cal th at,d.the board conclusion,that senate bill superseded the wilkinson doctrine,is not clearly erroneous and is entitled to deference.
we are well aware that section provides that the workers compensation statutes shall be liberally construed by the courts with the purpose of extending their benefits for the protection of persons injured in the course of their employment.however,s ection is a tool for resolving statutory ambiguity where it is not possible through other means to discern the legislature actual intent.brodie,supra,cal th at,d.section can not supplant the intent of the legislature as expressed in a particular statute.fuentes workers comp.appeals bd,supra,cal d at.if the legislature intent appears from the language and context of the relevant statutory provisions,then we must effectuate that intent,even though the particular statutory language is contrary to the basic policy of the workers compensation law.citation.kopping workers comp.appeals,supra,th at,d.because the legislature intent is ascertainable from the language of the new apportionment statutes and the legislative history,we can not rely on section to defeat that intent.
d.the board did not err in its application of the current apportionment statutes 
benson argues that even if the legislature did intend to abrogate wilkinson,the board nevertheless erred in requiring apportionment on the facts of this case because all of her disability was caused by simultaneous industrial injuries.italics added.we disagree and conclude that the plain language o
