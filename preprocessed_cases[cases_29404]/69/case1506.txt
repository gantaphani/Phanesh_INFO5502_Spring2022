background 
peyton employment at gpo 
appellee monica peyton worked for gpo for years from july,to august.she served in various and positions,including supply clerk and supply technician.in the fall of she was accepted into a proofreader apprenticeship program.successful completion of the apprenticeship program leads to an appointment as a journeyman proofreader.the apprenticeship program consisted of training as well as some classroom instruction.apprentices were evaluated during each period of the training program.gpo set specific proofreading standards,the number of keystrokes that must be read within an hour and then taught the apprentices how to meet those standards.throughout the training program gpo provides information to apprentices to allow them to access their reading speed at any time and periodically advises apprentices as to whether they are meeting expectations.peyton apprenticeship began in january.although she apparently failed to meet the number of key strokes per hour during one of the periods in,peyton continued successfully in the program.then in,she failed to meet the number of required keystrokes per hour for the july period.
according to peyton evidence,a superior,charlotte massey,made lewd comments and gestures concerning peyton breasts on more than one occasion.peyton complained to massey directly and massey ranted at her and intimidated her.thereafter,peyton made an informal complaint to gpo equal employment opportunity eeo office on july,and a formal complaint on august.upon learning that peyton had filed the informal complaint,massey engaged in a pattern of harassment,including threats communicated directly and through.there was physical contact between peyton and massey,which peyton characterized as a bump,or an elbowing,by massey.peyton complained to her superiors that her work was being adversely affected by the hostile environment of the proof room,but to no avail.peyton was even told that she should drop her complaint.ultimately,peyton was distressed and fearful about approaching the head desk when massey was assigned to work there.
according to gpo,peyton failure to meet the proofreading goal in resulted in her being given a delay,then a probation to improve.peyton in fact began to improve.however,peyton was misled as to when these probationary periods actually began and was ultimately expelled from the apprenticeship program in what had been represented to her as the fifth week of the scheduled probation.peyton was released from the apprenticeship program in january,though not terminated by gpo at that time.gpo placed her in the library programs service,and ultimately she was terminated on august.
proceedings below 
having exhausted her administrative remedies,peyton filed the action below in the district court.in her complaint filed before she was fired,peyton alleged sex discrimination in the forms of quid pro quo sexual harassment and a hostile work environment,as well as retaliation for pursuing her rights under title vii.subsequently she amended her complaint to allege that she was terminated from gpo as retaliation.the district court granted summary judgment for gpo on the quid pro quo claim but denied it with respect to the hostile work environment and retaliation claims.peyton hostile work environment and retaliation claims were tried to a jury in november.the jury returned a unanimous verdict finding that peyton proved,by a preponderance of the evidence,each element of her claim of sex discrimination on the basis of hostile or abusive work environment,and retaliation,against gpo.the jury awarded peyton compensatory damages in the amount of.
the jury also sat in an advisory capacity on the issues of damages for past lost earnings and benefits,up to the time of trial,and damages for future lost earnings.see.c.the jury returned an advisory verdict in which it found that plaintiff had proved,by a preponderance of the evidence,that she was entitled to damages for past lost earnings and benefits,and to damages for future lost earnings.the advisory verdict recommended for back pay and for future lost earnings.
on the issues of entitlement to back pay and future lost earnings,the district court made findings of fact.the court agreed with the jury that peyton presented convincing and credible evidence proving that her and supervisors conduct had a material effect upon her ability to perform and upon her quality of life in the workplace.it found no credible explanation for the discrepancy between the timeframe of the probationary training period represented by gpo to peyton,and the period actually treated as the probationary training period by gpo.the court found the evidence to establish that after being told of her probation on december,until her removal from the program,peyton performed above the required standards.the district court concluded as a matter of law that a s a direct and proximate result of the retaliatory adverse employment actions taken against peyton by officials of the gpo,peyton failed to be promoted to journeyman proofreader,as of january,and was terminated from her employment with the gpo as of august.she has suffered compensatory damages and a loss of earnings and benefits as a direct and proximate result of these adverse employment actions.
damages and relief 
based on its findings,the district court awarded compensatory damages and equitable relief.first,the court reduced the amount of compensatory damages recoverable to,the statutory maximum under title vii for an award against an employer with more than employees.see b d.the court determine d on the facts of this case that represent ed a fair and appropriate compensatory award pursuant to the statutory cap at b.in denying gpo rule a and e motion for a new trial or,in the alternative,remittitur,the district court rejected the argument that this award of compensatory damages was grossly excessive because the case did not present the most egregious instance of unlawful conduct meriting the maximum amount recoverable under title vii statutory cap.rather,the court determined that the jury could reasonably view this case as the type of egregious,unlawful conduct that title vii was designed to remedy.it distinguished this case from nyman fdic,based on the physical assault of peyton and gpo manipulation of the apprentice training rules in order to expel the plaintiff from the training program.it concluded that the award neither shocks the conscience nor represents a miscarriage of justice.
the court awarded back pay and future lost earnings front pay as equitable relief.it calculated back pay for three periods january,while peyton was still at gpo august,from termination at gpo until employment by bowne,and october,to trial peyton employed at bowne.it determined peyton was entitled to an award of back pay in the amount of.the court rejected arguments by appellant gpo that peyton inadequately mitigated her losses during the period when she was unemployed.noting that it is the defendant burden to prove that the plaintiff efforts to secure employment constituted inadequate effort to mitigate damages,the court conclude d that the defendant has failed to demonstrate that the plaintiff inadequately mitigated her losses.
in determining that front pay was appropriate,the court first found that it would be futile,and inequitable to order that peyton be returned to her old position.relying on our decision in barbour merrill,cert.dismissed,d,the district court calculated projected future lost earnings.it found that at the time of trial,peyton earned less per week less per year working for bowne,a private printer,than she would as a journeyman proofreader for gpo.because the court found that peyton reasonably expected and intended to work as a proofreader for the gpo until she retired,it awarded her front pay which reflects that the plaintiff will suffer a loss of future earnings totaling per year until her projected retirement,discounted to the net present value.as peyton was years old,and her retirement was projected at age,the district court ultimately awarded in front pay.
gpo filed the instant appeal challenging the district court determination of compensatory damages,back pay,and front pay.
ii.analysis 
this court reviews a district court denial of a rule a and e motion for abuse of discretion.a,e see langevine district of columbia,rule a anyanwutaku moore,rule e.this court also reviews equitable relief,the standard for calculating back pay and front pay,under an abuse of discretion standard.see barbour,at.a district court has wide discretion to award equitable relief.id.at.the district court should fashion this relief so as to provide a victim of employment discrimination the most complete makewhole relief possible.id.in reviewing for an abuse of discretion,the court considers whether the decision maker failed to consider a relevant factor,whether the decision maker relied on an improper factor,and whether the reasons given reasonably support the conclusion.id.citation omitted.with this standard of review in mind,we consider each of the challenged awards in turn compensatory damages back pay and future lost earnings or front pay.
compensatory damages 
gpo argues that the denial of the motion for new trial,or remittitur,and the award of in compensatory damages is an abuse of discretion in that a compensatory damages award is grossly excessive given the record in this case.appellant relies on nyman fdic.at,for the standards that should govern remittitur in a title vii case.in nyman,the district court held that the maximum amount recoverable under the applicable cap should be reserved for the most egregious cases of unlawful conduct.at.there the district court ordered remittitur of a compensatory damages verdict to.id.at.appellant essentially argues that the harm to peyton was not serious enough to warrant the maximum penalty under the law,particularly when compared to other title vii cases.further,according to gpo,appellee approach would have us consider the quality of the unlawful conduct at issue,rather than the nature of the harm suffered,conflating compensatory damages with punitive which are foreclosed to the plaintiff as the defendant is a government entity.see b.as to the critical inquiry of harm to the victim,appellant contends there simply was no significant evidence of any prolonged,serious,or substantial harm to appellee stemming from gpo actions.
at the outset,we address appellant suggestion that peyton failed to carry her burden in proving damages.although compensatory damages must be proven and can not be presumed,see carey piphus,d,there has been no such presumption here.the district court found that the jury could reasonably view this case as the type of egregious,unlawful conduct that title vii was designed to remedy peyton had worked her way up the ladder at gpo,won a desirable apprenticeship,was harassed by a superior in the final months,was threatened,intimidated,physically assaulted,suffered retaliation for attempting to exercise her rights under title vii,and was ultimately fired for exercising her rights.the evidence supports the district court finding that she became depressed,angry,and suffered a loss of.she was injured.
thus,the only question remaining is whether it was an abuse of discretion by the district court to award the statutory maximum,in compensatory damages,when the jury had awarded.of course,the district court is in the best position to determine damages,as it heard all of the evidence and saw all of the witnesses.this court will only require remittitur when the verdict is beyond all reason,so as to shock the conscience,or the verdict is so inordinately large as to obviously exceed the maximum limit of a reasonable range within which the jury may properly operate.see jeffries potomac dev,williams steuart motor.the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that neither test required remittitur here.
appellant does not contend that an award of shocks the conscience in the abstract,but rather argues,relying on the district court opinion in nyman,that b in essence requires a sliding scale.thus,only the most egregious cases of unlawful conduct are entitled to the statutory maximum of,and this case is not so egregious.first,we reject the argument that b itself ever requires a reduction below the cap.by its plain language,b does nothing other than provide a cap.nothing in the language of that section evidences a congressional intent to specifically empower,let alone require,a trial or appellate court to reduce a verdict in excess of to some lesser figure.although appellant offers a plethora of cases in which smaller damage figures have been awarded,and in which remittiturs to amounts below have been ordered,appellant provides no authority for the proposition that cases involving some perceived or even evident degree of injury less than the most egregious must inherently be awarded some figure lower than the cap.it may well be that in the most egregious conceivable case a jury might award,for example,which would be reduced to.the fact that some other hypothetical case might be only half as egregious assuming such comparisons can be made would not require either the trial or appellate court to reduce the award in that hypothetical case from to.
rather,the proper approach is to determine whether the judgment awarded,regardless of whether it is the statutory maximum,is supported by evidence,and does not shock the conscience,or is not inordinately large so as to be obviously unreasonable.smith northwest financial acceptance,cir.the cases that appellant offers for purposes of comparison in which lesser damages were awarded or approved do not convince us to the contrary.in rejecting that line of argument,we find useful the reasoning of a state court considering a similar question in a different context.
the appellant argues that a comparison of this award to other awards for similar injuries would show that this award is excessive.we stated in fitzsimonds cogswell,that we are sure counsel realizes that there is no way of obtaining uniformity in the amount juries and trial judges may award for damages in cases.because of the unique circumstances of each case as well as the adjustments which would necessarily have to be made for inflation,it is awkward to discuss the size of an award through comparison with past decisions.
mariner marsden.just so here.
all,then,that is left is to assess whether the district court abused its discretion in granting a damage award of,which is less than the jury would have awarded.it is rarely appropriate for an appellate court to reduce the trial court determination as to the proper amount of damages.thus,in reviewing a damage award,we consider whether it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand.grunenthal long island,d quoting dagnello long island,cir.given the district court findings of fact,which are unchallenged,we can not say that the court abused its discretion.the court found that peyton presented convincing and credible evidence proving that her and supervisors conduct had a material effect upon her ability to perform and upon her
