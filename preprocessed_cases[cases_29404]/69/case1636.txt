on october,semitool,was issued united states patent the patent.the patent is entitled,centrifugal wafer carrier cleaning apparatus and as the title suggests,the patent describes a cleaning apparatus for rinsing and drying carriers used to hold and process semiconductor wafers,substrates,flat panel displays and similar articles.patent,ll.semitool also filed continuation patent applications based on the patent application.from these continuation applications,semitool received two more patents united states patent the patent which,like the patent,claimed a centrifugal wafer carrier apparatus and united states patent the patent,which claimed a method of cleaning and drying wafer carriers.
as described in the patent,
the processing of semiconductor wafers and substrates is very sensitive to problems of contamination i t is necessary to maintain a high level of cleanliness during all or nearly all stages of production.
semiconductor wafers,substrates,photomasks,flat panel displays and other similar wafer products are also typically processed in batches batch processing of this type almost always utilizes some type of carrier or carriers to hold the thin materials being processed.
patent,ll.as a result,specialized cleaning machines are needed to maintain the cleanliness of the carriers.these machines both wash and dry the carriers.centrifugal drying machines as described in the,and patents are one type of these specialized cleaning machines.they operate by spinning the carriers at high speeds whereby cleaning solvents are readily spun off the carriers and,furthermore,the induced airflow dries the carriers by removing any residual solvent.
dms manufactured and sold machines.in prior litigation,semitool sued dms for patent infringement alleging that two dms products,the model and the model wafer carrier cleaners,infringed the claims of the,and patents.during that proceeding,the district court construed the claims of the patents in a claim construction order.the district court granted semitool motion for summary judgment of infringement as to the model but denied the motion as to the model.see semitool,dynamic micro.semiconductor equip.gmbh,no.c,dist.lexis.thereafter,the parties entered a settlement agreement.
in the settlement agreement,dms agreed not to make,use,offer to sell,or import any infringing device.as part of the agreement,the parties stipulated to enter into a permanent injunction barring dms from infringing any claims of semitool patents.both the agreement and the injunction explicitly retained the district court jurisdiction to enforce the agreement or the injunction.the agreement further specified that dms model and model,as configured,admittedly infringed the patents and so would any device that is no more than a colorable variant of the model and model.the settlement agreement also stated how to construe semitool patent claims in the event of any future infringement determinations 
the court construction of phrases and terms used in the claims of the semitool patents,as specified in the court final claim construction order dated june,shall be used in determining whether dms is infringing any claims of the semitool patents in violation of this agreement or the stipulated permanent injunction.

dms has developed a new carrier cleaning system called the tornado.on july,dms filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment that its tornado system did not infringe any of semitool patent claims.on september,the parties stipulated to dismiss the declaratory judgment complaint and instead the district court reopened the original patent infringement litigation.semitool sought to enforce the injunction and to enforce the settlement agreement arguing that the tornado system literally infringed its patents.dms argued that the tornado is colorably different from its previous models and does not infringe the patent claims,and therefore it does not violate the settlement agreement or the terms of the injunction.
the district court considered the differences between the tornado system,the patent claims,and the previous infringing models sold by dms and concluded that the tornado was colorably different from the infringing models and did not infringe semitool patents.it granted dms for summary judgment of and therefore denied semitool motion to enforce the permanent injunction and settlement agreement.id.wl,slip op.at.
on march,semitool appealed the district court decision to this court.we have jurisdiction under a.

in the present case,semitool alleges that the tornado system infringes claims,and of the patent as well as claims of the patent.of these asserted claims,claims and of the patent and claim of the patent are independent claims.for purposes of the current dispute,there are two important claim limitations in each of these patent claims.independent claim of the patent reads 
a centrifugal cleaner for cleaning carriers used in semiconductor processing,comprising 
a processing vessel defining a process chamber therewithin 
at least one drying gas supply for supplying drying gas to the process chamber 
independent claim of the patent reads 
a centrifugal cleaner for cleaning carriers used in semiconductor processing,comprising 
a processing vessel defining a process chamber therewithin 
at least one primary drying gas supply for supplying primary drying gas to the process chamber 
and independent claim from the patent reads 
a process for cleaning carriers used to hold semiconductor articles,comprising 
a processing chamber within the processing vessel 
supplying drying gas to the processing chamber.
claim of the patent requires a processing chamber within the processing vessel and furthermore supplying drying gas to the processing chamber.almost identical limitations are found in the rest of the asserted claims.the current dispute centers on defining the processing vessel,the processing chamber,and supplying drying gas to the processing chamber.
the district court construed this last claim limitation in its final claim construction order and held that drying gas meant 
a n air or other gas with a level that is capable of readily absorbing evaporated cleaning liquid from the carriers and removing said vapor s from the process chamber as the air or other gas is evacuated therefrom.although it may be treated,treated by use of a heater,treatment is not a requirement so long as the drying gas is of level and capable of readily absorbing evaporated cleaning liquid and removing said vapor s from the process chamber as the air or other gas is evacuated therefrom.
semitool order,wl,at.the phrase supplying drying gas to the process chamber was construed to mean 
the introduction of drying gas into the process chamber.once inside the process chamber,all that is required is that the drying gas has a level and is capable of readily absorbing evaporated cleaning liquid from the carriers and removing said vapor s from the process chamber as it is evacuated therefrom.thus,the process chamber may include a device to enhance the capabilities of the drying gas inside the chamber,a heater inside the process chamber.
based on this claim construction,the district court then turned to the allegations of infringement.the district court noted that the parties disputed two things whether the condenser in the tornado supplies drying gas to the process chamber and whether the condenser is part of the process chamber or a separate unit.id.at.
as to the second question,the district court observed that semitool argues that the condensing unit used in the tornado system is outside the process chamber.meanwhile dms argues that the condenser is not a separate unit id.but ultimately,the district court concluded that i n light of the ruling below,it is not necessary to reach this issue.id.in other words,the district court did not delve into the precise definition of the processing chamber,nor did the district court reach the question whether the condenser in the tornado resides inside or outside the processing chamber.instead it focused only on the first question and concluded that r egardless of whether the condenser is merely an area within the process chamber or a separate unit,it does not supply a drying gas to the process chamber.id.at.
in answering the first question,the district court discussed how the admittedly infringing model supplied drying gas to the processing chamber in the model shown above on left,drying air enters the processing chamber and then is exhausted out of the apparatus in a similar fashion to that described in semitool patent.as shown on the right,dms tornado does not have an external air inlet or external air outlet as did the model.as described by the district court,
defendant product,the tornado system,differs from the model in several respects most importantly,the centrifugal fan that previously supplied clean room air to and the exhaust vent that allowed air to evacuate from the process chamber have been removed.instead,as air circulates within the tornado system,it passes a series of condensing plates located at the rear of the process chamber,behind a spray guard this area of the device was called the condenser during depositions.these condensing plates are kept cool with a cooling liquid,such that the air becomes cooler as it passes,thereby causing moisture to precipitate onto the glass.this cooler and drier portion of air is with the rest of the air.the mean humidity gradually decreases as the air in the process chamber absorbs more evaporated cleaning liquid from the carriers.this repeats until all or nearly all of the water vapor is removed from the process chamber.
id.at.the district court held that the tornado system could not supply drying gas to the processing chamber as required by the claims,concluding that 
r ather,the condenser in the tornado treats drying gas that was already within the process chamber,which is a closed system that merely the gas therein.thus,the tornado system does not infringe the patent or the patent.moreover,the tornado is more than colorably different from the model and model 
id.at.accordingly,the district court granted dms motion for summary judgment of and denied semitool motion to enforce the settlement agreement and the permanent injunction.
on appeal,semitool argues the district court improperly granted the for summary judgment of by limiting the scope of semitool invention to cover only those systems that supply drying gas from an external source.semitool argues that its patent claims do not require an external source of drying gas and that the tornado system condenser must only supply drying gas to the processing chamber as required by the claims.semitool argues that the dried air flowing out of the condenser in the tornado meets the district court constructions of both drying gas and supplying drying gas to the processing chamber.the air absorbs and removes the solvents inside the tornado system processing chamber by carrying away vapor as the drying gas is evacuated from the process chamber.semitool argues that it does not matter that the air dried by the condenser originally came from the processing chamber.nothing in the claims,specification or prosecution history of semitool patent requires an open system in which the drying gas is new air that originates from some location outside the cleaning system.with regard to the claim language,semitool argues that the dried air is a drying gas that leaves the condenser and is supplied to the processing chamber.the tornado system condenser removes moisture from the air while the air is outside the processing chamber and introduces the dried air back into the processing chamber.
semitool recognizes that its arguments are predicated upon locating the condenser outside the processing issue the district court did not reach.if the condenser is located inside the processing chamber,then it can not introduce drying gas into nor remove drying gases from the processing chamber.to support its contention that the condenser is not inside the processing chamber,semitool argues that the processing chamber should be interpreted to extend only to the region where carriers are loaded,cleaned,and dried.accordingly,with such an interpretation,the condenser in the tornado would be located outside the processing chamber.
semitool makes four related arguments to support its interpretation of processing chamber.first,it points to dms own admissions in the first infringement proceedings regarding the model device and its process chamber where dms stated that the central area of the dms model contains a vessel defining a process chamber in which wafer carriers are loaded,cleaned,and dried.second,semitool points to dms own literature describing a process chamber in its tornado with dimensions that seemingly can not include the condenser.third,semitool points to dms own expert that testified that the usable interior space of the tornado does not include the region containing the condenser thus inferring that the condenser is outside the process chamber.lastly,semitool points to the spray protection wall in the tornado device that separates the condenser from the area where the carriers are cleaned.semitool argues that this physical barrier proves that the condenser can not be part of the process chamber.
on the other hand,dms maintains that the condenser is necessarily inside the processing chamber and therefore the tornado can not infringe.dms argues that semitool construction of process chamber proposed in its appeal the usable area in the center of the system in which the wafer carriers are,loaded,cleaned and dried,is contrary to the patent specification.rather,it submits that according to the specification the processing chamber encompasses the entire interior of the processing vessel and not just the central region of the vessel as contended by semitool and that the patent specification expressly contradicts semitool suggested interpretation of the term processing chamber.the specification states 
the outer bottom wall piece of the processing vessel has a processing chamber outflow opening or port formed adjacent to the outflow box.liquids drain across the bottom wall of the processing bowl and into the outflow box.gases flow from the processing chamber through the outflow port into the outflow box.
patent,ll.from this language,dms argues that the patent specification expressly incl
