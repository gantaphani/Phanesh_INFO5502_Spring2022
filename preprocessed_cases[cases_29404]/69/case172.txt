the narragansett indian tribe appeals from the district court denial of a preliminary injunction against the warwick sewer authority.the tribe claims that the authority is proceeding with a sewer construction project which risks desecration of ancestral burial sites.the tribe argues that the authority failed to consult adequately with the tribe about the project,as required by of the national historic preservation act nhpa,and its attendant regulations,pt.
the district court denied the preliminary injunction.we affirm,because we find that the tribe falls far short of the standards for a preliminary injunction.indeed,it appears that the authority has acted responsibly to comply with the nhpa and to avoid any adverse impact on important cultural artifacts.
the district court held an evidentiary hearing on the preliminary injunction motion on november.the following facts are drawn principally from evidence presented there.
the authority has undertaken a construction project to link the eastern portion of warwick,rhode island,to the city existing sewer system,requiring some miles of sewer line.the parties agree that the entire project must comply with of the nhpa as a condition of federal funding it receives.section and its implementing regulations,discussed in greater detail below,require sponsors of federally funded undertakings to consider their impact on historically or archaeologically important areas.the regulations also require consultation with a historic preservation officer and,in some circumstances,with affected indian tribes.in early,the authority retained public archaeology laboratory,pal,a nonprofit consulting group founded by five archaeologists formerly associated with brown university,to assist in ensuring the sewer project compliance with these mandates.
alan leveillee,a registered professional archaeologist and of pal,conducted an initial assessment survey of the project.leveillee completed a preliminary report based on this investigation.he determined that most of the proposed sewer lines would run under existing roads in highly developed suburban areas,so that excavation was unlikely to encounter any remaining archaeological material of significance that had not already been disturbed.for these sections of the project,the report concluded that it would be sufficient to have archaeologists train construction supervisors,conduct periodic field checks,and remain on call in case unexpected materials of potential historical value were encountered.
however,the report noted that several segments of the project had potentially greater archaeological sensitivity.of particular relevance to this litigation,leveillee identified a stretch of approximately feet near the intersection of west shore road and sandy lane,adjacent to buckeye brook.in this area,the proposed sewer route ran through a relatively undisturbed wetlands area rather than under an existing roadway.because of this difference,and the fact that indian artifacts are often found along watercourses close to narragansett bay,such as buckeye brook,the report recommended that archaeologists stay on site to monitor all construction in this area.
on january,leveillee mailed copies of the preliminary report both to rhode island state historic preservation officer known under as the shpo and to the tribe historic preservation officer the thpo.his cover letters stated please provide any comments or concerns you may have.if you require additional information,please do not hesitate to call me at your convenience.the tribe never responded to this letter.in contrast,the shpo wrote back to leveillee on january,and sent copies of its response to the thpo,the authority,and the project chief contractors.the shpo concurred in most of leveillee conclusions and proposals,but recommended that shovel test pits should be excavated in two of the more sensitive areas,including the one near buckeye brook,to determine the presence or absence of cultural material.
pal complied with the shpo suggestion in the next phase of its inquiries,excavating nineteen test pits in the buckeye brook area.south of buckeye brook,this intensive archaeological survey found remains of an agricultural homestead that had been inhabited in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.pal reported that native american cultural materials were recovered in low densities and represent incidental incursions,indicating only limited occupation of the area by native americans.the test excavations uncovered bone fragments these were analyzed in the lab and all were found to be animal bones,most likely from the homestead food wastes.leveillee and other pal archaeologists prepared a detailed technical report elaborating on these findings.leveillee testified that further investigation would be required to determine the archaeological significance of the homestead.the report recommended instead that the sewer should be rerouted to avoid the homestead site entirely.
the technical report was again sent to both the shpo and the thpo in march.the shpo concurred in the report recommendations.the tribe again did not respond.based on the suggestion made by pal and the shpo,the authority altered the sewer route in april to avoid the undisturbed area south of buckeye brook where the homestead site lies.the new underground route runs south down west shore road which is also state highway route,rather than alongside it,and then turns at the intersection to proceed west down sandy lane.west shore road was originally built in the early twentieth century and there has been further construction on it several times since.
although the tribe did not comment on either of pal reports,testimony at the hearing by both leveillee and the tribe deputy thpo,douglas harris,indicated that the tribe did have contact with the authority and pal about the sewer project in both and.according to harris,this included a meeting with the executive director of the authority early in the consultation process,and daily cell phone communication with pal during the test excavations south of buckeye brook.
at the construction site on october,leveillee met with representatives of the thpo,the authority,and the army corps of engineers to discuss the topic of fish runs in the brook.after discussing the tribe concerns,harris suggested that there might be narragansett indian burials in the area south of the brook.this was the first time the tribe ever mentioned such a prospect.harris said that he had been told by an eyewitness that human remains had been exposed during previous construction near there,but were immediately covered back up.leveillee asked for the name of harris informant,but harris declined to provide it.harris also showed leveillee a mound of dirt with shell and glass fragments harris testified at the hearing that the mound could be consistent with a burial.the mound was located where the homestead lies,so its surroundings had already been investigated extensively and the sewer route was already changed to avoid the area.
the only other evidence the tribe presented in the case about burials near west shore road was the testimony of max brown,a year old tribe member and retired construction worker brown said he had once worked on a project where a uncovered bones that looked like an arm and a leg or a hand and a leg he did not approach or touch them and he left without finding out what the bones were or what his coworker did with them.when asked to identify the time of this incident,brown stated that it must have been the fifties,i guess.as to location,he stated,well,i live down around there.i worked so many places they all look the same.i ca remember just which one is which,but i did yeah,in them days i had dug up these bones.eventually,guided by questioning from the tribe counsel,brown marked a map of east warwick with an x near the intersection of west shore road and sandy lane.harris also testified that he had spoken to various other tribe members about the history of the site,although there was no evidence about what they told him 
despite the dearth of specific information provided by the tribe,leveillee promptly notified the shpo and the authority of these new
