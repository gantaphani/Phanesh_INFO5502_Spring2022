tivo,owns a patent on technology that enables television users to television signals,that is,to record a television program in digital format and enable the user to replay,pause,fast forward,or reverse while the program is playing on the user television set.the technology enables time shifting both for previously recorded programs and for programs that are currently being recorded.in,tivo sued the five appellants,collectively referred to as echostar,in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas,alleging that they had infringed various claims of the patent,patent the patent.
the claims of the patent that were asserted at trial included hardware claims claims and and software claims claims and.those four claims are the only ones at issue in this appeal.the accused devices are two types of echostar digital video recorders dvrs,which the parties refer to as the dvrs and the broadcom dvrs.at the conclusion of the trial,the jury found that the dvrs literally infringed the asserted hardware and software claims.the jury found that the broadcom dvrs literally infringed the asserted hardware claims and infringed the asserted software claims under the doctrine of equivalents.the jury awarded tivo a total of in damages in lost profits and in reasonable royalties.the district court entered judgment on the verdict and issued a permanent injunction against echostar.on echostar motion,this court granted a stay of the injunction pending appeal.
the accused dvrs and the dvrs described in the patent both receive television signals and store data relating to the transmissions on a hard disk in motion picture expert group mpeg format.an mpeg stream typically has interleaved audio and video components.both the accused devices and the devices described in the patent can store the mpeg data and subsequently transform it for replay.the storage of the television programs as mpeg data enables users to control the playback of programs,including those that are currently being broadcast,with commands such as pause,fast forward,and reverse.
television programs are typically transmitted in one of three ways over the air from a transmitter for reception by a user television antenna through a cable or by satellite.and cable transmissions can be used to broadcast either analog or digital television,while satellite services typically broadcast digital television only.the most common format for analog television signals in the united states is the national television standards committee ntsc standard.the corresponding european broadcast standard for analog television signals is phase alternating line pal.digital television standards include the digital satellite system dss,digital broadcast services dbs,and advanced television standards committee atsc.
both analog and digitally encoded television programs that are transmitted over the air are transmitted using high frequency analog carrier waves that are capable of traveling long distances.the federal communications commission has partitioned the analog broadcast signal range into mhz bands for such transmissions.a single band can carry a single television channel in analog form or several channels in digital form by interleaving multiplexing the signals corresponding to the various channels in a digital format such as mpeg.
the two hardware claims at issue in this case relate to the process and apparatus used to effect time shifting according to the invention.the two software claims relate to the software process and apparatus used in the invention.
claim of the patent,the first of the two asserted hardware claims,provides as follows 
a process for the simultaneous storage and play back of multimedia data,comprising the steps of 
accepting television tv broadcast signals,wherein said tv signals are based on a multitude of standards,including,but not limited to,national television standards committee ntsc broadcast,pal broadcast,satellite transmission,dss,dbs,or atsc 
tuning said tv signals to a specific program 
providing at least one input section,wherein said input section converts said specific program to an sic moving pictures experts group mpeg formatted stream for internal transfer and manipulation 
providing a media switch,wherein said media switch parses said mpeg stream,said mpeg stream is separated into its video and audio components 
storing said video and audio components on a storage device 
providing at least one output section,wherein said output section extracts said video and audio components from said storage device 
wherein said output section assembles said video and audio components into an mpeg stream 
wherein said output section sends said mpeg stream to a decoder 
wherein said decoder converts said mpeg stream into tv output signals 
wherein said decoder delivers said tv output signals to a tv receiver and 
accepting control commands from a user,wherein said control commands are sent through the system and affect the flow of said mpeg stream.
claim,the other asserted hardware claim,is similar,except that it claims an apparatus rather than a process.
echostar accused dvrs receive analog and digital signals,but they conduct time shifting only for digital satellite signals.echostar argues that the district court committed legal error when it failed to construe the two hardware claims to require that the subject devices be capable of time shifting analog as well as digital signals and when the court failed to grant echostar motion for judgment as a matter of law on that ground.echostar dvrs do not infringe,according to echostar,because they can process only one type of digital television signal and are incapable of processing analog television signals at all.in making that argument,echostar focuses on the first three limitations of claims and,each of which,according to echostar,makes clear that the hardware claims do not apply to dvrs such as its accused devices.
echostar begins with the first limitation of the hardware claims,which recites the step of accepting broadcast signals based on a multitude of standards.echostar notes that in the accepting limitation the reference to a multitude of standards is followed by the words including but not limited to,national television standards committee ntsc broadcast,pal broadcast,satellite transmissions,dss,dbs,or atsc.because some of those broadcast standards apply to analog signals and some to digital signals,echostar contends that the accepting limitation requires that the claimed dvr be capable of processing both types of signals.echostar does not make clear how many different standards it believes the claimed device must be capable of processing.in its reply brief it suggests at one point that the number must be greater than three.at a minimum,however,echostar seems to contend that an accused dvr can not infringe the hardware claims if it is not capable of processing at least one type of analog signal and at least one type of digital signal.
tivo responds that echostar argument is based on an unduly restrictive interpretation of the claim language.first,tivo argues that the hardware claims require only that the accused products accept television signals based upon a multitude of standards,not that they process all such signals.because echostar accused devices accept analog television signals and forward them to the user television set for viewing,tivo argues that those devices infringe the accepting limitation even though they do not process the analog signals by converting them to mpeg streams suitable for internal storage.second,tivo argues that echostar devices process signals that are based on numerous standards,such as the transport standard,the video standard,and in most cases the audio standard.for that reason,tivo contends,echostar dvrs infringe the accepting limitation even if that limitation is understood to require processing of the accepted signals.
echostar replies to tivo characterization of the accepting limitation by saying,first,that the claim language must be understood to link the acceptance and the processing of signals,so that the signals that are accepted are also processed in accordance with the other limitations of the invention.in support of that argument,echostar points out that the tuning limitation,which sets forth the first step in the processing operation,states that the tuning is performed on said tv signals,referring generically to the signals first identified in the accepting limitation.the patent contains no reference to signals that are simply passed through the dvr without the processing described in the rest of the claim limitations.
echostar replies to tivo second argument by contending that the reference in the claims to the multitude of standards as including,but not limited to,ntsc broadcast,pal broadcast,satellite transmission,dds,dbs,or atsc is a reference to broadcast standards,and that the standards limitation can not be satisfied by reference to data standards,such as the transport,video,and audio standards cited by tivo.
while the language of the accepting limitation is not very precise,we agree with the trial court that it does not require that a dvr be capable of time shifting both digital and analog signals,as echostar argues.even echostar does not contend that the claimed dvr must be capable of processing signals transmitted under all of the listed broadcast standards.although the claim refers to the recited television signals as being based on a multitude of standards,including,but not limited to the particular specified standards,the use of the word or in the list of standards makes it clear that the claim language does not require that the claimed device be capable of processing signals based on all of the listed standards.the specification likewise demonstrates that the claim language should not be given such a restrictive interpretation.at several points,the specification refers to a dvr that accepts television input streams in a multitude of forms,for example,analog forms such as national television standards committee ntsc or pal broadcast,and digital forms such as digital satellite system dss,digital broadcast services dbs,or advanced television standards committee atsc.patent,ll.emphasis added see also,ll.
nor is there anything in the specification to suggest that the claimed dvr must be capable of time shifting at least one type of analog television signal as well as digital signals.at various points,the specification describes how analog signals are processed and then describes how digital signals are processed.the specification also describes,as a preferred embodiment of the invention,a dvr that takes television streams in a multitude of forms,including analog and digital and converts those signals into mpeg streams.see,ll.but nowhere does the specification indicate that in all embodiments of the invention a single dvr must be capable of processing and converting both analog and digital signals into such mpeg streams.in fact,the specification contains one embodiment that seems to contemplate a dvr that processes only digital signals.see,ll.that embodiment is based on figure of the patent,a schematic depiction of the media switch that is at the heart of the invention.after describing how figure operates to process analog signals,the specification adds the following if a digital tv signal is being processed instead,the mpeg encoder is replaced with an transport demultiplexor,and the mpeg audio encoder and vbi decoder are deleted,ll.modified in that fashion,the media switch would accept only digital signals.that embodiment of the media switch therefore seems to contradict echostar contention that the claims require that the dvr be capable of processing both analog and digital transmissions.
even after rejecting echostar main contention that the accepting limitation requires that the claimed dvr accept both analog and digital transmissions,the meaning of the accepting limitation is still not entirely clear.in particular,it is less than clear what meaning should be assigned to the term a multitude of standards in the accepting limitation.as to echostar argument that the claimed dvr must be capable of processing signals based on some undetermined number of standards greater than one,it seems unlikely that a claim drafter would use a term of such biblical imprecision as multitude if that term were meant to have an important restrictive function in the claim.on the other hand,if the drafter intended to require only that the dvr be capable of processing signals based on one or more broadcast standards,including but not limited to those referred to in the limitation,it is difficult to understand why the drafter would not have used that very common and clear manner of expressing the idea.
in the end,we conclude that the interpretation of the accepting limitation that is least problematic is the one proposed by the reference to the multitude of standards includes not only broadcast standards of the type set forth in the claim,but also data standards of the type identified in the written description portion of the specification.see patent,ll.on several occasions,the written description refers to the broadcast standards as forms,and refers to the data standards as standards.see,ll.while that choice of terms may not be the product of careful and consistent usage,it at least reflects that the patent did not use the term standard as a term of art restricted to broadcast standards.in the absence of any more convincing interpretation of the accepting limitation,we adopt that interpretation.because the evidence at the trial showed that,interpreted in that fashion,echostar devices were capable of accepting and processing television signals based on numerous data standards,we hold that the jury verdict with respect to the accepting limitation is supported by substantial evidence.
echostar next argues that because its dvrs process only digital signals and not analog signals,they do not satisfy the second limitation of the asserted hardware claims,which recites the step of tuning said tv signals to a specific program.echostar explains that the band used to transmit digital television signals carries a multiplexed signal that contains data for multiple television programs.thus,unlike the case of analog transmissions,in which a single program is carried on a particular segment of the broadcast band,echostar argues that tuning to a particular band does not constitute tuning to a specific program.the trial court rejected that argument,holding that one of ordinary skill in the art would understand a specified program to mean a specified frequency range.
the language of the tuning limitation is not by its terms limited to locating a place on the broadcast band that carries only a single program.that is,nothing about the phrase tuning to a specific program excludes tuning to the portion of the band that carries the specific program of interest,even if a further process,such as demultiplexing,is required to extract the data corresponding to that program from the band to which the dvr has been tuned.if a program is contained within a channel that contains multiple,multiplexed programs,then tuning to a program that is contained within the channel is accomplished by tuning to that channel.
significantly,the specification of the patent describes an embodiment in which the dvr tunes to a particular program by tuning to the particular band that contains the multiplexed digital signal that includes the program of interest.at that point tuning is complete.the device then extracts the program from the signal that was carried on the band by demultiplexing and generating an mpeg stream.patent,ll.the input section tunes the channel to a particular program,extracts a specific mpeg program out of it,and feeds it to the rest of the system.thus,the specification clearly uses the term tunes to refer to the selection of the portion of the band where the multiplexed signal containing the particular program along with others is being transmitted.we therefore hold that the district court correctly interpreted the phrase tuning to a specific program to include tuning to a specified frequency range that contains the program in question,whether or not that program is the only one contained within a signal transmitted in that specified frequency range.with the tuning limitation construed in that fashion,the evidence is clearly sufficient to support the jury conclusion that echostar devices infringed that limitation.
echostar next contends that the term converts,as used in the third limitation of the hardware claims,provides a further indication that the claimed dvrs must be capable of processing analog signals,rather than just digital signals as the echostar devices do.that limitation requires that the claimed device convert said specific program to an mpeg formatted stream for internal transfer and manipulation.the trial court regarded that language as sufficiently clear that it was not necessary to use additional or different language to explain the phrase to the jury.echostar argues that the specification uses the term converts to refer to the process of encoding a nonmpeg analog program into mpeg format and not to refer to the process of transforming an mpeg signal into an internally storable format.echostar supports its argument by pointing out that the specification uses a different term,extraction,to refer to the process of transforming an mpeg signal that is carried on a broadcast transmission to an internally storable format.patent,ll.echostar therefore concludes that the term converts does not encompass transforming mpeg data from a satellite signal that already contains data.for that reason,echostar argues that its and broadcom dvrs,which process only satellite transmissions that already contain data,do not satisfy the converts limitation and therefore are not covered by the hardware claims.
tivo argues that echostar interpretation of the converts limitation is at odds with portions of the specification that describe the process of extracting mpeg streams from incoming digital signals containing mpeg data,such as satellite or atsc transmissions.see patent,ll.the specification makes clear that if the input signal does not contain data,the data is recoded in mpeg format and stored in a digital mpeg format that is suitable for internal transfer and manipulation.if the input signal already contains data,as in the case of incoming satellite transmissions,the incoming data is still converted to the internally transferable and manipulable mpeg format.whether or not the input stream already contains data,it is converted to a uniform,purely digital mpeg format that is suitable for internal transfer and manipulation.the benefit of the uniformity of these streams is that the system does not need to be concerned with how the signal was obtained.patent,ll.because the invention disclosed in the specification and recited in the claims converts the signal to which the device has tuned into an mpeg formatted stream for internal transfer and manipulation,we hold that the process of converting a digital signal to an mpeg stream is within the scope of the converts limitation.
both the and broadcom dvrs,even if they do not need to convert signals from an analog format to mpeg,must accept satellite transmissions and convert them into a form suitable for internal transfer and manipulation.with the converts limitation construed to cover converting a digital signal to an mpeg stream suitable for internal transfer and manipulation,the evidence supports the jury verdict that all of the echostar dvrs satisfy that limitation.we therefore reject echostar contention that the converts limitation,the accepting limitation,and the tuning limitation all indicate that the dvrs of the invention must be capable of processing analog as well as digital signals.
echostar devotes substantial attention to the fourth limitation of the hardware claims,which requires that the mpeg stream be separated into its video and audio components.the trial court regarded that claim language as and therefore did not provide a separate interpretation of that language in the instructions to the jury.echostar urges this court to construe the term to require that the interleaved mpeg stream be copied into two distinct memory buffers,one for the audio portion of the stream and another for the video portion of the stream.we agree with echostar that the written description portion of the specification discloses such an embodiment.see,patent,ll.the more difficult question is whether that embodiment represents the limits of the claims scope.
tivo argues that physical separation of the audio and video data is not necessary,that logical separation is all that is required,and that indexing of the data achieves logical separation.under that interpretation,a device would satisfy the separation limitation for literal infringement even if the audio and video streams were not copied to separate buffers but were maintained in a single interleaved buffer,as long as the separate audio and video components were indexed with pointers to the components locations in the interleaved buffer.
the specification states that t he invention parses the mpeg stream and separates it into its video and audio components.it then stores the components into temporary buffers.patent,ll.in that passage,the specification clearly refers to the separation aspect of the invention and not merely one embodiment of a broader invention.as this court recently held,w hen a patent thus describes the features of the present invention as a whole,this description limits the scope of the invention.verizon servs.vonage holdings.
in the same context,the specification states that the audio and video components are stored in temporary buffers.although tivo does not address that statement in the specification directly,it appears to argue that the statement that the invention separates the mpeg stream into its video and audio components refers to logical indexing.however,there is no textual basis from which to conclude that the reference to storing the components in temporary buffers encompasses logical separation or indexing,and tivo does not provide any explanation of how the language of the specification can be understood to do so.
the specification discussion of figure adds force to echostar argument regarding the separated limitation.the specification explains that the video and audio segments of the incoming mpeg stream must be separated and recombined to create separate video and audio streams or buffers.this is necessary because separate decoders are used to convert mpeg elements back into audio or video analog components.patent,ll.because the statement refers to separate streams and buffers,and not logical separation or indexing,the most natural interpretation of that passage is that the audio and video elements are separated into different buffers,not simply logically indexed according to the type of data carried by each element.
tivo effort to discount the passage of the specification discussing figure is unconvincing.tivo first argues that figure represents only a preferred embodiment.the detailed description of the invention makes clear that some of the depicted embodiments such as those in figure and figure are merely preferred embodiments.the specification,however,does not characterize figure as representing only a preferred embodiment.in fact,the discussion of figure suggests the contrary,as it states that the incoming interleaved video and audio segments must be separated and recombined to create separate video and audio streams or buffers.the specification further states that the recited separation is necessary because of the use of separate decoders to convert the mpeg elements back into audio and video analog components.patent,ll.even if the separation of video and audio components into separate streams were regarded as representing only a preferred embodiment,that passage at minimum rebuts tivo assertion that physical cleaving of digital data makes no sense in the context of a invention.
tivo second argument regarding the specification treatment of figure is that it relates to the output stage,when appropriate components must ultimately be placed into distinct streams or buffers for decoding.again,there is no textual basis for that characterization.the discussion of figure is not limited to the output stage,but instead refers generally to the processing of data that is interleaved in the incoming mpeg stream.patent,line.moreover,tivo strained interpretation of figure is at odds with the specification discussion of figure,in which the specification describes the media switch at the heart of the invention as operating on separate video buffers and audio buffers,ll.
with respect to figure,which depicts the media switch separating data into four video buffer,an audio buffer,a private data buffer,and an event argues in its brief that the accompanying text in the specification shows that the patent focuses on the logical segmentation and cataloguing of data into an event table to help avoid unnecessary physical data transfers.while tivo is correct that the specification describes a process of logical cataloguing or indexing of data,figure and the portion of the specification that describes it make clear that the logical processes described by tivo occur after the data is separated into distinct audio and video buffers.that is,after the parser in the media switch separates the video,audio,and private event data packets and stores them in separate buffers,the parser generates event data that identifies the storage location of each of the data packets.that event data is stored separately in an event buffer.patent,ll.the program logic reads accumulated events in the event buffer and generates a sequence of logical segments that correspond to the parsed mpeg segments.the logical segments contain information including the address and type of the corresponding mpeg segment,the length of the segment,and the time stamp for that segment.those logical segments are then stored in a separate buffer known as the packetized elementary stream pes buffer,ll.
the patent explains that using logical segments in the pes buffer means that the data associated with the logical segments need not be present in the buffer itself.patent,line,through,line.the use of the logical segments has the effect of gathering components of the stream,whether they be in the video,audio or private data circular buffers,into a single linear buffer of stream data on the storage medium,ll.thus,the stream data can be efficiently managed without the need for the computer central processing unit to copy the underlying data,ll.in sum,tivo is correct that the specification describes the process of indexing data.both the specification and the text of claims and make clear,however,that indexing occurs after,and in addition to,the separation of the incoming data into distinct video and audio buffers.
pointing to dependent claims through,tivo contends that those claims recite the additional steps specifying the use of distinct video and audio buffers and thus support its contention that the independent claims do not require separation of the audio and video components of the incoming signal.the dependent claims,however,recite in detail the processing steps that occur after the separation of the video and audio components,such as placing the video and audio components in separate circular buffers,posting events in a circular event buffer indicating the location of the video or audio component in the video or audio buffer,and generating a buffer containing logical segments that point to the buffer location where corresponding video and audio components have been placed.while those details go beyond the recitations of the independent claims,they do not obviate the requirement of the independent claims that the mpeg stream be separated into its video and audio components.in fact,the dependent claims underscore that the initial separation is separation into distinct buffers,not merely logical indexing.
finally,tivo argues that figure and the discussion of figure in the specification support its construction of the is separated limitation.figure depicts the media switch and its relationship to other components of the invention.although the specification discussion of figure is unclear in at least one respect the specification unambiguously describes the parser in the media switch as detecting the beginning of all of the important events in a video or audio stream.patent,ll.that description supports echostar contention that the video and audio components processed by the media switch are separated at the time of processing.for the foregoing reasons,we hold that the term is separated,as used in the claims,denotes copying the audio and video components into separate buffers,not mere logical separation by way of indexing.
echostar concedes that its dvrs separate the video and audio streams into distinct buffers.therefore,the dvrs satisfy the is separated limitation.tivo expert testified that the broadcom dvrs logically separate the video and audio streams by creating a frame index table that indexes or stores pointers to the video data.tivo does not appear to contest echostar contention that the broadcom dvrs do not separate the two streams of data into distinct buffers.because we construe the term is separated to require separation into distinct buffers and not to encompass mere logical separation,as performed by the broadcom dvrs,we agree with echostar that the evidence at trial does not show that the broadcom dvrs satisfy the is separated limitation of the hardware claims.
echostar next contends that its dvrs do not satisfy the seventh limitation of the hardware claims,which provides wherein said output section assembles said video and audio components into an mpeg stream.echostar argues that the assembles limitation covers only the assembly of audio and video components into a single,interleaved mpeg stream.tivo argues that the assembles limitation also covers the assembly of each component,audio and video,into its own separate stream.because echostar does not dispute that the broadcom dvrs satisfy the assembles limitation,even under its construction,the dispute over the assembles limitation applies only to echostar dvrs.
tivo agrees that the dvrs do not assemble audio and video components into a single interleaved mpeg stream,but instead assemble the audio and video streams into two separate mpeg streams.nonetheless,tivo argues that the dvrs satisfy the assembles limitation because the reference to an mpeg stream must be interpreted to mean one or more mpeg streams.
as a general rule,the words a or an in a patent claim carry the meaning of one or more.baldwin graphic,siebert.that is particularly true when those words are used in combination with the antecedent comprising.see,abtox,exitron.however,the question whether a or an is treated as singular or plural depends heavily on the context of its use.see norian stryker.the general rule does not apply when the context clearly evidences that the usage is limited to the singular.baldwin graphic,at.
unlike the case in baldwin graphic,where the claims and the written description could be read to encompass either a singular or plural interpretation of a or an,the claims and written description in this case make clear that the singular meaning applies.the pertinent claim language refers to assembl ing said video and audio components into an mpeg stream,which in context clearly indicates that two separate components are assembled into a single stream,not that the video components are assembled into one stream and the audio components into a second stream.earlier limitations in the claims refer to converting specific programs into an mpeg stream,parsing that mpeg stream and separating it into its video and audio components.later limitations refer to sending the reassembled mpeg stream to a decoder and converting it into tv output signals.those steps clearly describe the separation of a single stream into two components and then reassembly of the components into a single stream for conversion into television signals.moreover,although the term comprising is used to refer generally to the limitations of the hardware claims,the assembles limitation itself does not contain that term.rather,the claim language simply refers to the assembly of two components into an mpeg stream.
the corresponding explanation in the specification refers to separating the mpeg stream into video and audio components,which are then reassembled into an mpeg stream.patent,ll.that language describes the process of separating one stream into two sets of components and then reassembling the two sets of components into a single stream.in particular,when discussing the term assembles,the specification states that when the program is requested for display,the video and audio components are extracted from the storage device and reassembled into an mpeg stream which is sent to a decoder.the decoder converts the mpeg stream into tv output signals and delivers the tv output signals to a tv receiver.patent,abstract,ll.the specification also provides that the mpeg stream has interleaved video and audio segments,ll.that language,like the claim language,describes the mpeg stream that is reassembled as a single mpeg stream,not two different streams.the concept of reassembly indicates that the mpeg stream is restored to an earlier state,which in this case would be the state in which it was initially received by the system,as a single stream of data.accordingly,we agree with echostar that the claim would be interpreted by one having ordinary skill in the art to require the reassembly of the audio and video components into a single interleaved stream.
tivo argues that the assembles issue presents a question as to the sufficiency of the evidence and that tivo evidence of assembly has not been shown to be insufficient.but the evidence cited by tivo did not establish infringement under the narrower test for satisfying the assembles limitation that we have adopted.rather,tivo simply argues that the evidence showed that echostar devices assemble video and audio components into separate streams or buffers.
for example,tivo contends that echostar dvrs infringe the assembles limitation when performing a function referred to as trickplay,which involves or rewinding a television program.the evidence at trial,however,showed that trickplay involves only video data and does not result in the assembling of video and audio components into a single stream of data.tivo evidence therefore does not show that echostar dvrs satisfy the assembles limitation,as properly construed.
because we hold that the term assembles,as used in the hardware claims,requires interleaved assembly of the audio and video components,and because the evidence at trial did not show that the dvrs perform interleaved assembly,we necessarily conclude that the dvrs do not literally infringe the assembles limitation of the hardware claims.inasmuch as the broadcom dvrs do not satisfy the is separated limitation and the dvrs do not satisfy the assembles limitation,we must reverse the portion of the judgment upholding the jury verdict that echostar dvrs literally infringe the hardware claims.
at several points,tivo argues that even if this court were to overturn the jury verdict of literal infringement,there would still be ample evidence of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.there are two problems with upholding the judgment on the hardware claims on that basis.first,the jury was told that if it found literal infringement it should not make a determination as to whether there was infringement under the doctrine of equivalents,so there was no verdict on the issue of equivalents with regard to the hardware claims.second,we have construed two of the claim limitations more restrictively than the trial court instructions permitted.for that reason,even if the jury had reached a verdict with respect to the doctrine of equivalents we could not sustain that verdict merely upon finding that substantial evidence supported it.at this juncture,we could uphold the judgment on the basis of the doctrine of equivalents only if we were to conclude that no reasonable jury,given proper instructions,could reach any verdict other than to find infringement by equivalents.the parties,however,have not briefed that issue in any detail,and we therefore do not address it.more generally,we do not decide what further proceedings,if any,are appropriate in the district court regarding the equivalents issue.instead,we leave that issue for the district court to resolve in the event that,on remand,tivo decides to continue to pursue the hardware claims in light of this decision.
with respect to claims and,the software claims,echostar argues that its dvrs do not satisfy several of the claim limitations and that the jury verdict of infringement must be reversed.
claim of the patent is the first of the two software claims.it provides as follows 
a process for the simultaneous storage and play back of multimedia data,comprising the steps of 
providing a physical data source,wherein said physical data source accepts broadcast data from an input device,parses video and audio data from said broadcast data,and temporarily stores said video and audio data 
providing a source object,wherein said source object extracts video and audio data from said physical data source 
providing a transform object,wherein said transform object stores and retrieves data streams onto a storage device 
wherein said source object obtains a buffer from said transform object,said source object converts video data into data streams and fills said buffer with said streams 
wherein said source object is automatically flow controlled by said transform object 
providing a sink object,wherein said sink object obtains data stream buffers from said transform object and outputs said streams to a video and audio decoder 
wherein said decoder converts said streams into display signals and sends said signals to a display 
wherein said sink object is automatically flow controlled by said transform object 
providing a control object,wherein said control object receives commands from a user,said commands control the flow of the broadcast data through the system and 
wherein said control object sends flow command events to said source,transform,and sink objects.
claim,the second of the two asserted software claims,is similar,except that it recites an apparatus rather than a process.
as a matter of claim construction,echostar challenges the district court definition of the term object.that word is used in the claim terms source object,transform object,sink object,and control object.
echostar expert stated in his declaration that the term object,as used in the computer arts,means an item written in an computer programming language for example,c that is an instance of a class from which it inherits properties,and that includes both data and all procedures that operate on the data.based on that declaration,echostar urged the court to define the term object as meaning an item written with an computer programming method such as c that encapsulates data and the procedures necessary to operate on that data and can inherit properties from a class or another object.
tivo expert offered a broader definition for the term object,referring to it as a software term that describes a collection of data or operations.he explained that objects can contain both data and operations,but that they may contain only data or only operations.he added that the term object does not imply the use of an computer language,and that objects and techniques can be used in many programming languages.as support for its proposed definition,tivo cited a technical dictionary,which gave a collection of data and operations as one of the definitions of the term object.ieee the authoritative dictionary of ieee standard terms ed.
after assessing the competing expert declarations and the evidence to which the parties directed the court attention,the district court accepted as the proper definition of object the definition offered by tivo,a collection of data and operations.the court concluded that tivo definition represented the plain meaning of the term object to one of ordinary skill in the art.the court also concluded that persons of ordinary skill in the art would readily understand the meaning of source object upon a reading of the claim language and its context in the specification.based on both intrinsic and extrinsic evidence,the court concluded that in accordance with its ordinary meaning the term source object means a collection of data and operations that extracts video and audio data from a physical data source,obtains a buffer memory where data can be temporarily stored for transfer from a transform object,converts video data into data streams,and fills the buffer memory where data can be temporarily stored for transfer with the streams.additionally,the court defined transform object to mean a collection of data and operations that transforms the form of the data upon which it operates it defined sink object to mean a collection of data and operations that obtains data stream buffers memory where data can be temporarily stored for transfer from a transform object and outputs the streams to a video and audio decoder and it defined control object as a collection of data and operations that receives commands from a user that control the flow of broadcast data.
on appeal,echostar argues that the district court erred in failing to construe the term object to require the use of software.echostar points out that the patent describes how three conceptual components that are featured in the software object,transform object,and sink in the context of software written in the c programming language,which employs an approach that collects together logical operations and software elements that perform those operations.
we discern no error in the district court claim construction.while the patent specification includes an embodiment showing the use of a c class hierarchy derivation of the program logic,patent,ll,and uses terms characteristic of programming in connection with that example,neither the written description nor the claims anywhere state or imply that the invention must use programming in general,or c in particular.without more,the use of an example that employs programming is not sufficient to require that the claims be limited to embodiments using c or a similar programming language.moreover,while echostar criticizes the court for using an alternative definition in a technical dictionary as the basis for its definition of the term object,tivo offered evidence other than the dictionary that supported that particular,its expert the district court concluded that persons of ordinary skill in the art would understand that term according to its ordinary meaning,which accorded with tivo definition.
importantly,the term object was not used by itself in the claims,but rather as part of the terms source object,transform object,sink object,and control object.the district court defined each of those terms by reference to the functions performed by the collection of data and operations,and aside from its contention that the claims should be read to require programming,echostar does not object to those definitions.because the intrinsic evidence did not limit the scope of the software claims in the manner that echostar urges,and because the district court construction of each of the claim terms was soundly based on the extrinsic evidence proffered by tivo,we find no error in the court decision not to limit the software claims to embodiments employing programming such as c 
we next address echostar argument that the jury finding of infringement is not supported by substantial evidence even under the district court construction of the critical language of the software claims.echostar argues that in order to be a collection of data and operations,all data and operations that constitute the collection must be grouped together within the software code or perhaps within a single file.the word collection,however,brings with it no such requirement of.tivo expert explained that the echostar software at issue constitutes a collection of data and operations because the relevant subroutines are part of the same program and are able to interact and get access to the data they need to.he testified that because the echostar software allows the subroutines to come together to achieve a particular function in each case,and share data,they constitute a collection of data and operation s.echostar offers nothing other than its own expert testimony to rebut tivo expert on this issue.particularly in light of the absence of any objective support for the testimony of echostar expert that a collection of data and operations must appear in the same subroutine or subdirectory within the software code,we can not agree with echostar that the jury verdict was unsupported by substantial evidence.
echostar also argues that its dvrs do not satisfy the portion of the source object limitation that requires the source object to extract video and audio data from said physical data source.echostar argues in part that tivo and its expert,jerry gibson,addressed this limitation with respect to only one model of echostar dvrs.while it is true that gibson testified in detail with respect to only one type of device,there is nothing improper about an expert testifying in detail about a particular device and then stating that the same analysis applies to other allegedly infringing devices that operate similarly,without discussing each type of device in detail.gibson testified that the other models of echostar dvrs operate similarly with respect to the source object limitation,and echostar own expert,thomas rhyne,also discussed the various models of echostar dvrs collectively and made no relevant distinction among them with respect to this limitation.furthermore,rhyne specifically stated that the dvrs use the same hardware push to a temporary memory buffer as is used in the device that was analyzed by gibson,and in its brief echostar points to no distinction among the dvrs that would require separate analysis.we therefore analyze all of the dvrs together with respect to the source object limitation.
echostar argues that its dvrs do not contain software that extracts data.instead,it contends that its devices use a hardware push to move data from the physical data source to a temporary data buffer.echostar also argues that its broadcom devices push the data to a temporary buffer and not to the broadcom chip.finally,echostar argues that,for its broadcom dvrs,the ioctl command identified by tivo expert can not extract video and audio data from said physical data source because it does not extract data from any circuitry on the broadcom chip,but instead extracts data from the temporary data buffer that is connected to the broadcom chip.
as an initial matter,software alone can not extract data from a physical device it can only control hardware that extracts data.therefore,when a device extracts video and audio data from a physical data source,it is necessarily the case that certain hardware operations are performed.for that reason,the distinction made by echostar is unhelpful.what matters is whether the operations performed by the interaction of software and hardware in the accused dvrs,taken as a whole,are covered by the claim term.in order to assess echostar argument,we must determine whether the evidence was sufficient to show that the particular process employed in echostar accused devices is covered by the extracting limitation.that is,we must determine whether the process of pushing data from the physical data source to a temporary data storage buffer and then extracting the data from the temporary data storage buffer,all under the general control of the dvr software,constitutes a process that is fairly described as extract ing video and audio data from said physical data source,as recited in the software claims.
after consideration of the parties arguments and the evidence to which the parties have drawn our attention,we conclude that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could find that the extracting limitation was satisfied.in particular,it was reasonable for the jury to find that the process of moving data from the physical data source to the source object,as practiced in the echostar devices,constitutes extraction by the source object of video and audio data from the physical data source,as those terms are used in the extracts limitation of the software claims.in particular,the jury could have rejected the argument made by echostar,based on the testimony of its experts,that data is not extracted from the physical data source because it is extra
