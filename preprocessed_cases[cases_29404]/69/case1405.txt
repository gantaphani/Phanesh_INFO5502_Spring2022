at the time scheduled for the damages hearing,only howell was present,appearing pro se after traveling from his home in baton rouge to court in oklahoma city.the district court checked with chambers staff and learned that hammons had not telephoned to say that he and plaintiff would be late.the court then called the hearing to order,award ed no damages to the plaintiff for her failure to present evidence,and closed the matter.id.at.the court told howell that i t pays to show up.id.the court recessed at,sixteen minutes after the hearing was to begin,and entered a written order of judgment in favor of plaintiff for zero dollars in damages.

ii.judgment for zero damages 
we generally examine a factual determination on the appropriate amount of damages for clear error.nieto kapoor,cir.it is axiomatic that a plaintiff bears the burden of providing evidence in support of her damages claim.ferguson constr,cir.here,due to the absence of plaintiff and her counsel,proof of damages was totally lacking.consequently,there was no factual error in the district court finding of zero damages.it was simply one of the procedural consequences of proper,if perhaps unintended,litigation actions or decisions.sec.bank john deere,cir.
moreover,it was not unreasonable for the court to open the hearing,note the absence of plaintiff,and conclude the hearing with an award of zero damages.a district court is far too busy to conduct a search for missing attorneys and litigants or wait an indefinite amount of time in anticipation of a belated appearance.a workable system of justice requires that litigants not be free to appear at their pleasure.cessna fin.bielenberg masonry contracting,cir.the burden of litigation is too pressing,and trial courts patience has too long been tried,to permit parties to evade the consequences of neglecting their cases.control fluidics,cir.though the district court determination was severe,it was not erroneous and is not subject to reversal on appeal.
