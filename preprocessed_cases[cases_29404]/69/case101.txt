shell oil company,shell oil products company collectively,shell,and motiva enterprises appeal jury verdicts against them on several claims relating to their treatment of the dealers,franchisees and operators of service stations.shell and motiva together,the defendants challenge the legal basis for verdicts against them under a federal statute designed to protect franchisees,as well as the verdicts under massachusetts state law.additionally,they appeal the jury damages determinations as without sufficient basis in the evidence.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.see caribbean forms,cir.
shell maintained a network of franchisees in massachusetts.plaintiffs were eight of these franchisees.in,shell,texaco,and star enterprises formed defendant motiva,and shell transferred the franchise relationships to that entity,assigning its rights and duties under the relevant contracts to motiva shortly thereafter,motiva replaced the variable rent program vrp with the special temporary incentive program stip.each of these programs collectively,the subsidy provided for reduction of the contract rent through sales of gasoline once the specified threshold gallonage was sold in a given month,the contract rent for the next month would be discounted by a certain amount for every gallon sold in excess of that threshold.the threshold amount and the discount amount changed from time to time.the subsidy had been in effect since it was renewed in an annual notice to franchisees,although its terms explicitly provided for cancellation with thirty days notice.various representations were made to the dealers to the effect that the subsidy or something like it would always exist,the contract rent was to be disregarded,and the cancellation provision was only intended to be invoked in a situation like a war or an oil embargo.nevertheless,having given the required notice,motiva ended the stip on january,terminating the subsidy.without the subsidy,the dealers paid much more rent.
motiva also offered new leases as the old leases expired.the new leases calculated rent differently than the old leases,resulting in a further increase in rent.
in accordance with their fuel supply contracts,the dealers were charged a wholesale price for gasoline known as the dealer tank wagon price the dtw price.the fuel supply contracts were open price term contracts the contracts were silent as to price,and one party set the price unilaterally.this price was set by the defendants,who calculated it by assessing the street prices of other competing gasoline stations in the area,and reducing those prices by the taxes levied on gasoline and an estimated industry margin to approximate the wholesale price of the defendants competitors.
proceedings below 
several franchisees,along with an unincorporated association called the shell dealers defense group the defense group,filed for injunctive and declaratory relief as well as damages on june,tsaniklides shell oil products.when the defense group was found to lack standing,a motion was made to add its members as individual plaintiffs.in denying that motion the district court indicated in a margin order,p laintiffs may file a new case which may be deemed to be related.the individual franchisees filed a new suit on july,and the original suit was voluntarily dismissed on august.the new suit was assigned to the same district judge.the cases of new hampshire and rhode island plaintiffs in the new action were transferred to those districts.from the massachusetts plaintiffs in the new suit,ten plaintiffs were chosen to go forward.one of those settled on the eve of trial and another lost at summary judgment.one plaintiff of the remaining eight,mac shell service,operated two stations that were sometimes treated as separate plaintiffs.therefore,eight plaintiffs representing nine stations proceeded to trial.
the dealers sued under a variety of theories.first,they contended that the subsidy had been incorporated into the property leases,although the written leases purported to be integrated contracts under massachusetts law.they claimed the amended contracts were then breached when motiva eliminated the subsidy.under the dealers theory,this breach gave rise to two distinct claims a state cause of action for breach of contract and a claim under the pmpa that shell had improperly terminated the franchises when shell assigned the franchise agreements to motiva and motiva terminated the subsidy.because no actual termination occurred,the dealers proceeded under a theory of constructive termination.similarly,they claimed motiva had constructively nonrenewed the franchise relationships in violation of the pmpa even though the franchises were in fact renewed because the new contracts changed the method and increased the rent,along with other objectionable changes.finally,the dealers argued that motiva failed to set prices for gasoline in good faith,as required for open price term contracts under massachusetts law.
the defendants unsuccessfully moved for dismissal on all constructive termination claims and the constructive nonrenewal claims of two plaintiffs on the ground that they were.they also moved for a judgment as a matter of law on all claims.following a jury verdict against them on all claims,they properly renewed this motion.they moved as well for a new trial and to set aside the jury damages awards.the defendants now appeal the denial of all of these motions.
congress enacted title i of the pmpa to remedy the disparity in bargaining power between franchisors and franchisees,sess,cong,see also four corners serv.station mobil oil,cir.because franchisees claimed that this unequal power was often wielded through arbitrary or discriminatory termination or nonrenewal,or threats of termination or nonrenewal,the pmpa aimed to remove this potent weapon from the franchisors arsenal,at,cong.at numerous allegations have been made before congressional committees investigating petroleum marketing problems that terminations and,or threats of termination or,have been used by franchisors to compel franchisees to comply with marketing policies of the franchisor.id.at,cong.at t ermination of franchise agreements during the term as a remedy for contract violations has been repeatedly utilized.the pmpa attempts to level the playing field by restricting the grounds upon which a franchisor can assert a unilateral termination or nonrenewal of a franchise.id 
the pmpa makes a distinction between a franchise and the franchise relationship.the franchise is a set of definite agreements for lease of the premises,the right to purchase gasoline for resale,and the right to use the franchisor trademark.franchise relationship refers to the respective obligations of the franchisor and franchisee created by a franchise.id.the legislative history of the pmpa makes clear that franchise and franchise relationship were distinguished to drive home the fact that the franchise relationship survives the expiration of the agreements underlying the franchise.see,sess,cong.at the term franchise relationship is utilized to avoid any contention that because the franchise does not exist there is nothing to renew.the structure and history of the pmpa emphasize congress view that the franchisees have a reasonable expectation that the franchises would be renewed and that the relationships would continue.
accordingly,the pmpa forbids termination of a franchise or nonrenewal of a franchise relationship except under enumerated circumstances and with proper notice.see a nonrenewals and terminations generally prohibited id.b grounds for termination and id.notice requirements.the pmpa provides a cause of action to franchisees who suffer termination or nonrenewal in violation of the relevant sections.id.a.as long as the action is brought within one year of the termination or nonrenewal complained of,id.a,the franchisee may seek preliminary injunctive relief,id.b,damages,id.d,and such equitable relief as the court determines is necessary,id.b.the pmpa mandates that preliminary relief shall be granted if the plaintiff shows termination or nonrenewal and sufficiently serious questions going to the merits that are a fair ground for litigation,and the court determines that the balance of hardships tips in favor of granting the injunction.id.b.in all private civil actions for termination or nonrenewal,it is the franchisee burden to show termination or lack of renewal.id.c.

statute of limitations 
the pmpa contains a statute of limitations the district court found,and the defendants here do not contest,that the cause of action for constructive termination arose on january,when motiva terminated the subsidy.the defendants claim that all of the constructive termination claims are because this action was not filed until almost nineteen months later,on july,the dealers point out that in dismissing their motion to be added as plaintiffs to the old action,the district court gave them leave to file a new action which may be deemed to be related to the original complaint,and that the first action was not dismissed until after the second was filed.
the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on which relief might be granted,citing the lapse of time and the pmpa statute of limitations.this motion was denied 
our review of the record indicates that the district court denied the motion to add the individual plaintiffs only because it granted the plaintiffs a right to file a new action that related back.we further conclude that had the district court allowed the motion to amend,the amended pleading would have related back under federal rule of civil procedure.in the light of this,two powerful reasons lead us to uphold the district court resolution of this issue first,all the purposes of rule c are satisfied,if not its letter and second,the district court was in a better position when it placed the case in this posture than we are now to assess whether the interests of justice are served by permitting this relation back 
federal rule of civil procedure c provides that an amended pleading may be deemed to relate back for statute of limitations purposes to the date of the pleading if certain conditions are met.the defendants rightly point out that rule concerns amended pleadings,not new pleadings in separate actions.rule c simply does not apply where,as here,the party bringing suit did not seek to amend or supplement his original pleading,but,rather,opted to file an entirely new action at a subsequent date.neverson bissonnette,cir noting that a dismissal without prejudice leaves the plaintiff in the same situation as if the first suit had never been filed for purposes of rule c.we note that this case differs from neverson in that here the dismissal of the previous action did not occur until after the new pleading was filed,and we note further that the district court expressly suggested a new action be filed at the very moment it denied leave to amend the complaint in the first action.
acknowledging that the letter of rule is not met here,we conclude that the rule nonetheless does provide some guidance.rule c is intimately connected with the policy of the statute of limitations.c,advisory committee note.the purpose of statutes of limitations is to avoid the difficulties inherent in litigating matters long past,and to provide repose to potential defendants regarding such matters.see nelson county of allegheny,cir statutes of limitations ensure that defendants are protected against the prejudice of having to defend against stale claims,as well as the notion that,at some point,claims should be laid to rest so that security and stability can be restored to human affairs.internal quotation omitted.the defendants at no time could have expected or enjoyed repose regarding these matters.the denial of the motion to add the specific dealers to the original litigation was accompanied in the same breath by notice that a new complaint might be filed under the same facts.this occurred in a timely fashion.and the first litigation was not dismissed until after the second one was filed.no evidence of sandbagging was brought forward,nor do we infer any prejudice to the defendants on this record 
here,the dealers had sought to vindicate their rights as the defense group,but lacked standing in that guise.in denying a motion to add the plaintiffs to the original litigation,the district court indicated it would allow a new filing to relate back to the date of the old one.it seems clear that the district court could instead have allowed the pleadings to be amended to name the plaintiffs individually.while we can not say with certainty why one course of action was to be preferred over another,we are confident that the district court did not abuse its discretion.
rule c does not specifically contemplate the substitution of plaintiffs.see.c,advisory committee note the relation back of amendments changing plaintiffs is not expressly treated in revised rule c,since the problem is generally easier.but this is not a bar to relation back here either assuming that the general principles of rule are to govern this admittedly unusual situation,we find that substituting plaintiffs here wreaks no injustice.
w e have laid down three separate requirements applicable to plaintiffs who seek succor under rule c the amended complaint must arise out of the conduct,transaction,or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading there must be a sufficient identity of interest between the new plaintiff,the old plaintiff,and their respective claims so that the defendants can be said to have been given fair notice of the latecomer claim against them and undue prejudice must be absent.
young lepone,cir quoting allied int l international longshoremen ass n,cir.accepting,as the district court did,that the dealers were members of the defense group these factors are met here.the district court factual conclusion does not represent an abuse of discretion,and so we adopt it.
the original complaint states the same causes of action,arising from the same events,as the new complaint.the dealers have always claimed that they were all members of the defense group.that organization was established only to assert its members rights and protect their interests,and so we find sufficient identity of interest to put the defendants on notice of the claims against them.and there is no undue prejudice where the dealers are simply asserting themselves a claim they had made through a proxy well within the statute of limitations.had the motion to amend been granted,and the individual plaintiffs named,relation back would have been within the district court discretion.the district court,then,properly allowed the relation back of the new case to the previous one,and therefore did not err when it denied the motion to dismiss 
state contract claim 
the defendants appeal the jury determination that the leases were orally amended to include the subsidy,and therefore when the subsidy was ended,the leases were breached.first,the defendants contend that the leases were completely integrated,meaning oral representations before or during the execution of the contract must be excluded by the parol evidence rule.second,they claim that even if the leases were not integrated,the jury had insufficient evidence to conclude that the leases were amended to include a promise to continue the subsidy.
the defendants argue as an initial matter that the leases were completely integrated agreements.the leases indisputably represented that they were integrated agreements and that any subsequent modification had to be in writing.the defendants claim the integration clause operated to insulate the leases from oral representations made prior to or contemporaneous with execution.but a document is not integrated merely because it says so.see restatement second of contracts cmt.b written contracts,signed by both parties,may include an explicit declaration that there are no other agreements between the parties,but such a declaration may not be conclusive.
in massachusetts,the question of integration is one of fact reserved for the trial judge,whose resolution of that issue will not be reversed unless clearly erroneous.cambridgeport sav.bank boersner,antonellis northgate constr,even absent specific evaluation of evidence by trial judge,finding of upheld as not clearly erroneous alexander snell,accord brennan carvel,cir u nder massachusetts law,the determination of whether a contract is completely or partially integrated,or whether a second contract is collateral to an integrated agreement,is a question of fact to be decided in the first instance by the trial judge.
here,the district court did not make a specific finding about integration,but the charge to the jury on amendments compels the inference that the agreements were not integrated.the jury was instructed to consider what the parties said and did concerning the lease because the instruction did not exclude actions prior to or contemporaneous with the execution of the written lease,the district court must have concluded that the lease was not an integrated agreement.
after review of the record,we can not say that this determination was clear error.the subsidy was explained to each plaintiff in documents accompanying the lease,and many plaintiffs testified they regarded the subsidy as essential to their businesses.there was evidence that the defendants said that the subsidy was intended to be permanent,that the provision was only in place for cases of war or embargo,and that the dealers could rely on the continuation of the subsidy or something like it.the district court therefore had ample evidence before it to determine that the lease was not an integrated agreement.
because the leases were not integrated,they could be varied by mutual agreement.mutual agreement on modification of the requirement of a writing may be inferred from the conduct of the parties and from the attendant circumstances.first.mortg.trust dorchester sav.bank,internal quotation omitted.the defendants assert that the evidence was insufficient to allow the jury to decide,as it did,that a promise to continue the subsidy was incorporated into the leases.the district court instructed the jury y ou may consider what each one said,one to the other,how they behave d,what each did,what each knew and what the circumstances were then you may infer from their statements and their conduct whether both shell and each plaintiff agreed to amend the leases.evidence adduced at trial included not only representations made directly to the dealers that the subsidy or something like it would always be available,but also internal shell documentation indicating that the subsidy was intended to be permanent,that franchisees should plan their businesses around the continued availability of the subsidy,and that franchisees would understand the loss of the subsidy to be a breach of a promise by shell.a rational jury viewing this evidence might come to the conclusion that the leases were amended to include the subsidy.
constructive termination 
the dealers claimed that when motiva breached their leases by eliminating the subsidy,that breach perfected a constructive termination by shell.the pmpa allows assignment of duties in franchise agreements in accordance with state law.see b.but an assignment that is violative of state law,or one that results in a breach of one of the statutory components of a franchise,gives rise to a claim under the pmpa against the original.in the words of the fourth circuit,a franchisor can not circumvent the protections the pmpa affords a franchisee by the simple expedient of assigning the franchisor obligation to an assignee who increases the franchisee burden barnes gulf oil,cir reversing summary judgment and holding that where assignee breaches franchise agreement,action will lie against.in chestnut hill gulf cumberland farms,cir,we adopted the test for constructive termination articulated by the sixth circuit.
to sustain a claim,under the pmpa,that a franchisor assigned and thereby constructively terminated a franchise agreement,the franchisee must prove either that by making the assignment,the franchisor breached one of the three statutory components of the franchise agreement,the contract to use the refiner trademark,the contract for the supply of motor fuel,or the lease of the premises,and thus,violated the pmpa or that the franchisor made the assignment in violation of state law and thus,the pmpa was invoked.
id.at quoting gulf,chevron,cir.
what set barnes apart from both chestnut hill gulf and gulf was that in barnes the assignment of the contract had resulted in gasoline prices above the price specified in the contract in other words,barnes concerned a breach of one of the statutory elements of the franchise,the agreement for the supply of branded motor fuel.the fourth circuit vacated summary judgment for the defendant,holding that the breach of the contract for the supply of gasoline created a constructive termination of the franchise.in chestnut hill gulf we held the pmpa was not implicated because there was no evidence that any of the statutory components of a franchise had been breached.a ll thirteen dealers continued to occupy the same service stations under the same leases they continued to purchase gulf brand gasoline under the same supply agreements and they continued to do business under the same gulf trademark.chestnut hill gulf,at.in gulf,the defendants were entitled to summary judgment because the plaintiffs had merely complained of potential breaches to the franchise agreement.in the case before us,the dealers have proven to the jury satisfaction that motiva breached the lease component of the franchise agreements.that breach allowed the jury to find that shell constructively terminated the dealers franchises when it assigned the franchises to motiva.
the defendants argue that in order to show a constructive termination,the breach must be contemporaneous with the assignment and the breach must amount to a total deprivation of one of the three elements of the franchise.both contentions misunderstand constructive termination.
first,we agree with the fourth circuit that an action for constructive termination lies against the assignor of a franchise when the assignee breaches the franchise.barnes,at.this prevents the from shielding itself against liability through the use of another corporation.the pmpa does not contemplate that a franchisee should be relegated to seeking damages from an assignee that might not have the resources to satisfy a judgment.id.a delay between the assignment and the breach changes nothing.the reasons for this are even stronger where the assignee is a subsidiary of the franchisor,or a joint venture in which the franchisor is a party.
second,the breach of the statutory element of the franchise does not have to be a total breach.in barnes the plaintiff was forced to raise her prices,and her sales and net income declined.id.at.she did not suffer a complete loss of the benefits of the motor fuel supply contract.the defendants attempted analogy to constructive termination in employment law or constructive eviction in law is misleading.those doctrines require an actual severance of the relationship the employee must leave the workplace the tenant must move out.but here,as the dealers testified,sunk costs,optimism,and the habit of years might lead franchisees to try to make the new arrangements work,even when the terms have changed so materially as to make success impossible.indeed,some plaintiffs testified they had gone into personal debt,driven themselves into bankruptcy,or enlisted the aid of family members working without pay to make ends meet.to require an actual abandonment of years of work and investment before we recognize a right of action under the pmpa would be unreasonable.the congressional plan would be frustrated by requiring a franchisee to go out of business before invoking the protections of the pmpa.pro sales,texaco,cir.
we do not here say that any material breach of the lease would necessarily be sufficient to sustain the constructive termination claim.in this case,the district court instructed the jury that it could find constructive termination only if the breach of the lease was such a material change that it effectively ended the lease,even though the plaintiffs continued to operate the business it not simply was the lease breached,but did that breach amount to effectively the end of the franchise relationship.in this instruction the district court set an appropriate threshold.
we agree with the district court that an assignor may be liable for even a subsequent breach of the franchise agreement by an assignee,and that a breach of the franchise agreement need not result in complete deprivation of a statutory element of the franchise to support a constructive termination.
indeed,this case presents a strong argument for the doctrine of constructive termination.at trial the dealers argued that shell assigned the franchise agreements to motiva,even created motiva,in order to squeeze them out of their franchises.they presented evidence that this was the reason for the change in the rent formulation,the elimination of the subsidy,and the dramatic increase in rents they paid.if the jury accepted this as the reason,the case falls within the scope of the pmpa,which is designed not to freeze the franchise agreements exactly where they were but to prevent franchisors from improperly terminating franchises and thereby to ensure that franchisees benefit from successful investment in their franchises.
this same protection for franchisee expectations underlies the pmpa requirement that a franchisor make a bona fide offer,or grant a right of first refusal,to the franchisee when the franchisor contemplates withdrawing from the relevant market,selling the underlying real property,or dedicating the property to another use.b e b d.this is also why parts of the pmpa place more restrictions on franchisors when the purpose of termination or nonrenewal is to convert the station to direct operation by the franchisor were it otherwise,the franchisor could extract any increase in value created by the franchisee investment,without sharing that increase with the franchisee.this would dampen the incentive for a franchisee to develop the business.in this case,the dealers presented evidence that the defendants wanted to convert their stations to direct operation where a franchisor has breached its obligations to the franchisee such that the franchisee faces the effective end of the franchise,the pmpa must treat that as a termination of the franchise.
neither will we contradict the jury verdict.when we are satisfied that the law has been faithfully interpreted,we will overturn a jury verdict only when no reasonable jury could have come to that verdict on the facts presented.see,at.the jury heard ample evidence to conclude that the financial hardship resulting from the loss of the subsidy meant the end of the relationship.the defendants had opportunity to attack the credibility of that evidence and to put on their own.we will not step into the jury box to provide a second opinion.nor was the verdict against the demonstrable weight of the evidence or likely to result in a blatant miscarriage of justice.consequently,there was no manifest abuse of discretion in the district court denial of the motion for a new trial.
constructive nonrenewal 
as each dealer lease expired,motiva presented a new lease.the new leases changed the way rent was calculated,which had the effect of increasing the rents charged.the dealers argued that this change and others were not made in good faith,as required by the pmpa,but rather were part of the plan to drive the franchisees out of business.they claimed that inclusion of these terms amounted to a nonrenewal of their agreements,even though each dealer signed a new agreement albeit under protest.we conclude that the pmpa does not support a claim for nonrenewal under these circumstances.we therefore vacate this portion of the district court judgment and remand with instructions to issue judgment on this claim for the defendants.
it is the plaintiffs burden to prove that a nonrenewal or a termination has taken place.c.a notice of nonrenewal issued pursuant to,while not strictly speaking a nonrenewal,presumably satisfies this burden.see dersch energies,shell oil,cir a franchisor issuance of a notice of nonrenewal is the precise equivalent of a nonrenewal.lippo mobil oil,cir in an action brought under section a the franchisee has the burden of proving termination of the franchise.this must really mean attempted termination if the injunctive relief is to be of any use.but see seckler star,cir no claim under pmpa when notice of nonrenewal rescinded before action commenced akky bp,cir same.
the threshold question is whether to recognize such a constructive nonrenewal and thereby bring motiva actions within the reach of the pmpa.the ninth circuit is the only circuit so far to recognize a claim for constructive nonrenewal.pro sales.in pro sales,the plaintiff signed a renewal agreement under protest and immediately brought suit under the pmpa.id.at.the court relied on legislative history to conclude that these facts gave rise to a claim for constructive nonrenewal under pmpa.id.at.
pro sales has been rejected by the other circuits to consider the issue.the pmpa,after all,requires a franchisor to provide a notice of nonrenewal,c,and then provides a framework for the franchisee to seek preliminary relief on receipt of that notice,id.b.two circuits have held that this structure is evidence that congress intended to limit the reach of the pmpa to cases where either a notice is given or an actual nonrenewal has taken place.see abrams shell shell oil,cir t he seventh circuit rejected the pro sales approach based on a franchisee ability to obtain an injunction under the pmpa in cases of nonrenewal.we reject the pro sales approach on the same basis.quoting dersch energies,at.thus,in dersch energies,the seventh circuit held that a franchisee who had signed a renewal under protest did not have a claim for constructive nonrenewal because the franchise had in fact been renewed.had dersch allowed the defendants to issue a formal notice of,its dispute with the defendants would have been transformed from a mere contract dispute into a within days of its franchise allowing it to maintain suit under the pmpa.id.at accord abrams shell shell oil,cir we find the seventh circuit reasoning in dersch energies to be especially persuasive,thus we apply the same logic to this case.plaintiffs have not provided any evidence that defendants failed to renew the relevant agreements therefore,plaintiffs have not shown a breach in the franchise relationship.
the plaintiffs constructive nonrenewal argument requires the following reasoning.had the dealers refused to agree to the new contract terms,motiva would have issued notices of nonrenewal alleging as a permissible basis for nonrenewal the failure of the parties to agree on changes or additions to the provisions of the franchise b a.the dealers would have asserted that the nonrenewal was improper because the changes were not offered in good faith,id.b a i,or else were offered in order to convert the premises to the franchisor own control,id.b a ii.on those grounds the dealers could have sought preliminary relief and damages under the pmpa.id.a b.
the stumbling block that trips up the plaintiffs is that,rather than insist on receiving notices of nonrenewal,the dealers signed the new agreements under protest and continued in operation under the new agreements.we conclude that just as the pmpa requires a clear indication from franchisors that they seek nonrenewal of a franchise relationship,it likewise requires that franchisees faced with objectionable contract terms refrain from ratifying those terms by executing the contracts even under protest and operating under them.allowing a franchisee to sign under protest and then later challenge the renewal would extend the period of uncertainty through the entire first year of a contract that in this case was only three years.recognizing constructive nonrenewal also would enable a franchisee to sign the contract and simultaneously challenge it.if its claims were rejected by the courts,the franchisee would have lost nothing and could continue to operate the franchise under the agreement with the reasonable expectation of continuation and renewal.absent a claim for constructive nonrenewal,a franchisee must wait for a notice of termination to bring suit under the pmpa.the franchisee therefore risks the end of the franchise if the claim fails and so must carefully weigh the decision to sign or sue this is the balance congress has struck,and should we prefer another,we would not be free to impose it.consequently,we reject application of constructive nonrenewal to these facts.
we note with some concern the limited scope of the pmpa.two unexpected consequences of the legislation seem to loom as potential problems.the first is that franchisors will conform their behavior to the letter of the law but still use their position of power to impose their will on franchisees.the statute is of course not a panacea and can not be faulted for what it fails to do.but some statutory protection is worse than none when it serves as protective cover for the very misdeeds it purports to eliminate.the second unintended consequence is that,to the extent congress succeeds in leveling the playing field,it makes the franchise arrangement less appealing to franchisors.it is not difficult to imagine protections for franchisees so strong that franchisors abandon the model entirely.evidence introduced at trial spoke to both of these hazards.however,these are issues for congress to weigh and remedy,not for the courts.
because we do not recognize a claim for nonrenewal under the pmpa where the franchisee has signed and operates under the renewal agreement complained of,we vacate this portion of the district court judgment and remand with instruction to enter judgment on this count for the defendants.
unreasonable gasoline prices 
the uniform commercial code,as adopted in massachusetts,contemplates the enforcement of contracts in which one party sets the price of goods over time.laws ch.but the price must be set in good faith.id.the jury found that the defendants had failed to set reasonable prices in good faith.the defendants appeal on two grounds.first,they claim that the good faith requirement means only that such a price may not discriminate among similarly situated buyers and second,the defendants assert that the dealers evidence of unreasonable pricing is inadequate as a matter of law,because it was based only on retail pricing charged by competitors to the dealers,rather than dtw prices charged to those competitors and the dealers expert presented pricing analysis of only one competitor,thereby failing to establish a range of prices outside of which the defendants wholesale prices fell.we find neither contention persuasive.
section rejects the uncommercial idea that the seller may fix any price he may wish by the express qualification that the price so fixed must be in good faith.good faith includes observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing id.cmt.cmt.i n the normal case a posted price or a future seller or buyer given price,price in effect,market price,or the like satisfies the good faith requirement.id.the defendants and amici urge us to read this comment as providing an absolute safe harbor for nondiscriminatory posted prices in open price term contracts.this we will not do.
for one thing,the very comment on which the defendants and amici rely expressly invokes the general notion of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.if the comment meant that only discriminatory pricing would be disallowed it certainly could have said that.for another,it is clear to us that a situation in which one merchant is raising its prices in order to force a customer out of business is hardly the normal case.the eleventh circuit allowed this question to go to a jury in a class action involving another oil company pricing policies.allapattah servs.exxon,cir conceding that in a normal case nondiscriminatory pricing is protected,but holding that where the allegation was that an oil company was trying to drive service stations out of business,whether this case constituted a normal case was a factual issue necessary to determine whether exxon acted in good faith and therefore rightly submitted to the jury.more recently,the fifth circuit upheld the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law on the basis that setting gasoline prices in bad faith to drive franchisees out of business violated the ucc.mathis exxon,cir t he jury finding that exxon breached its duty of good faith in setting the dtw price it charged the plaintiffs is not without foundation in the law or the evidence.see also bob shell,oil,wl,dist.lexis,wayman amoco oil,finding that the case before it was a normal case but noting that i f there was evidence that amoco had,for example,engaged in discriminatory pricing or tried to run plaintiffs out of business,then the court decision might be different.but see shell oil hrn,holding absence of price discrimination created presumption of good faith notwithstanding allegations that that oil company set prices in bad faith as part of a plan to drive franchisees out of business.
commerce is predicated on the idea that a transaction is good for both buyer and seller.the comment recognizes that allowing one party complete control over the price would be uncommercial.we do not think the only reason for this is the risk of price discrimination.the drafters of the ucc and amici here are rightly concerned about a flood of litigation every price set in an open price term contract.mere allegations of bad faith will never be enough to survive summary judgment.but this case comes to us after a jury verdict finding bad faith and commercial unreasonableness.
nor do the defendants objections to the sufficiency of the evidence require us to set the jury verdict aside.while perhaps more specific and more comprehensive evidence would be preferable,the jury had enough evidence of the defendants motives and practices,as well as enough information about competitors pricing,to come to the conclusion that the dtw prices were commercially unreasonable.specifically,the use of competing gas stations retail prices to draw conclusions about what those stations might be paying for gasoline is not ideal,but is adequate to the task at hand.in fact,it is the same benchmark that the defendants used in their pricing model in setting the dtw price in the first place.in the light of this,the defendants can not be heard to complain that such prices are not a good measure of what other distributors of gasoline are charging.and although the dealers expert failed to present a range of such prices,the expert testimony was not the only testimony available.one dealer testified that the retail prices he observed were equal to or lower than the wholesale prices he paid.additionally,at least one dealer had firsthand knowledge of the dtw prices charged in the same area by another franchisor.on appeal,the defendants put forward once again the contentions of their own experts regarding the range of prices set by competitors.but it was up to the jury to choose between these competing characterizations,and the jury did so.
the defendants argue that the damages awarded for the pmpa constructive termination claim are not supported by sufficient evidence.the district court instructed the jury to calculate two kinds of damages damages in
