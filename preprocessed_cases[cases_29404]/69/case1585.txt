this appeal involves the damages calculation for the partial breach by the united states of its contract with the nuclear utilities,in this case,pacific gas electric pg e,for the storage of nuclear waste hlw and spent nuclear fuel snf.because the united states court of federal claims erred in its determination of the rate at which the contract obligated the department of energy doe to accept the utilities hlw and snf,this court and remands.
pg e owns humboldt bay and diablo canyon,two nuclear power generation stations in california.humboldt bay shut down temporarily in,but never restarted due to concerns about seismic activity and regulatory uncertainties.diablo canyon two reactors remain operational,supplying about of california energy needs.like the other nuclear utilities,pg e entered into a standard contract with doe,as discussed in greater detail below,which obligated doe to take title to and dispose of pg e snf and hlw.in exchange,pg e paid a fee of approximately million to cover non fuel,used for generation of electricity before april,and committed to paying ongoing contract fees approximately million per quarter to doe nuclear waste fund.
doe did not begin accepting fuel from pg e or from any other nuclear utility,for that matter by january,as required by the standard contract.in fact,doe has not even yet performed under the contract.meanwhile,pg e continues to pay its quarterly contract fees.in addition pg e has continued to store its at humboldt bay and diablo canyon.a series of cases has established that doe has partially breached the contract by failing to begin its performance on january.see.power united states.iii me.yankee atomic power united states.thus this case deals only with the question of damages for that partial breach.
as explained further below,the court of federal claims concluded that the duty of good faith and fair dealing required reasonable performance,as defined by the circumstances existing at the time and based on the requirements of the standard contract.relying primarily on doe reports from,the court of federal claims awarded pg e approximately million in damages through december,about half the amount pg e had sought.pac.gas united states,pg e i.pg e appeals the court of federal claims interpretation of the standard contract to require an acceptance rate according to the numbers,as well as the court of federal claims exclusion of the proffered expert testimony of frank graves,its exclusion of greater than class c gtcc waste from the contract,and its issuance of a final judgment,rather than a partial judgment,under court of federal claims rule b.

acceptance rate 
in setting the rate at which doe was obligated to accept from pg e and the other utilities under the standard contract,the court of federal claims improperly relied on a unilateral doe estimate made far after contract formation and tainted by a statutory framework in place at that time,which,if left unchanged,would have rendered timely performance impossible.to understand the contours of the parties expectations and intent,and ultimately to discern the appropriate acceptance rate from the contract itself and the parties dealings,this court will briefly set forth the byzantine process leading up to and following the execution of the standard contract.
a brief history of the standard contract 
on january,congress enacted the nuclear waste policy act of.codified at nwpa or act.the act set forth four objectives to develop repositories to protect the public and the environment from snf and hlw to establish federal responsibility and a definite federal policy for the entire project to define the relationship between the federal government and the states and tribes with respect to disposal and to establish a nuclear waste fund,financed by the nuclear utilities,to pay for the waste disposal.b.the act assigned doe the obligation to begin acceptance and disposal of the utilities snf and hlw not later than january.id.a b.in return,the act obligated the utilities to pay fees in an amount equivalent to an average charge of mil per for electricity generated by snf,or hlw derived therefrom.id.a.the nwpa also required doe to take title to the snf and hlw as expeditiously as practicable.id.a a.to accomplish these tasks,the act required doe to enter into contracts with the nuclear utilities no later than june.id.b a.the utilities had little choice but to enter into these contracts,because the act also precluded the nuclear regulatory commission nrc from issuing licenses to utilities that had not contracted with doe for disposal or were not in the process of negotiations for doing so.see id.b a me.yankee,at.
in april,doe promulgated the standard contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel high level radioactive waste standard contract after a lengthy notice and comment process.various utilities and industry groups,among others,provided specific suggestions to doe during this process.although numerous commentators advocated the inclusion of a firm commitment from doe on its rate of disposal,doe instead agreed to take title to as expeditiously as practicable following commencement of operation of a repository.the standard contract also included provisions setting priority for acceptance of waste generally through an oldest fuel first off scheme and allowed utilities to swap approved delivery commitment schedules the exchanges provision.in lieu of a firm rate for acceptance and disposal,the standard contract required doe to issue annual capacity reports acrs beginning no later than july.these reports set forth projected annual receiving capacity for doe facilities and annual acceptance rankings,including projected capacity information for the first ten years of operation for the repository.in addition to the annual reports,the standard contract also required doe to issue annual acceptance priority rankings beginning april.in response to these priority reports,the standard contract obligated each utility to submit a delivery commitment schedule to doe to identify the ready for delivery to doe beginning months after the dcs submission.this court refers to this entire process as the acceptance capacity schedule or acs process.
on december,doe set forth its plan for a firm schedule for waste acceptance and removal beginning no later than the date january.specifically,the schedule was designed to provide an acceptance rate in the first five years such that no utility will have to provide additional storage capacity after january.subsequently,the acceptance rate will be equal to or greater than the actual discharge rate of spent fuel each year.pg e i.at quoting mission plan.the preliminary schedule in this plan envisioned that doe would begin accepting waste in at a rate of metric tons of uranium mtu per year until,when doe would begin accepting.this plan also cautioned that completion of a geologic repository by was optimistic,requiring resolution of several regulatory,institutional,and technical challenges.as a contingency in case the permanent repository would not be available to meet the deadline,the plan stated that doe would request congressional authorization to build a monitored retrievable storage mrs facility as an interim solution.see,id.at.the trial court found in effect that the nuclear industry,in the guise of edison electric institute vice president loring mills,understood the preliminary schedule in the plan as aspirational,not binding.indeed,the trial court quoted mills public announcement from that w e really were never under an illusion that we would get a fair and equitable contract with doe,with firm commitments and detailed performance standards,with penalties for.id.at.
in june,the doe issued another plan with two different schedules,one assuming an mrs facility,and one not.the schedule contemplating an mrs called for a acceptance rate of,and starting in.the schedule called for beginning in,ramping up to within five years.this plan noted that these schedules were illustrative only,and underscored the possibility of considerable variation.id.at quoting mission plan.
in,doe submitted an amendment to its plan to congress.this plan informed congress that opening a permanent geologic repository by was no longer a realistic goal and recommended authorization for doe to use an mrs facility to meet its obligations to accept as specified by the act.the amended plan also revised the waste acceptance schedule,estimating acceptance at a rate of in,assuming availability of an mrs facility,and ramping up to in and eventually to in.these numbers matched doe annual capacity report acr process numbers for that year.to dispel doubts about doe commitment to a permanent repository,doe proposed that the mrs facility would accept no waste until the nrc authorized construction of a permanent repository.commenting on the draft of this plan,the edison electric institute opposed this linkage because it would raise a significant question whether doe will be able to meet its statutory and contractual commitment to begin to accept spent fuel in january.id.at quoting eei comments regarding mission plan amendment.
on december,congress amended the nwpa by passing the nuclear waste policy amendments act of amendments act,stat.codified in scattered sections of the nwpa.the amendments act directed doe to develop a single permanent geologic repository at yucca mountain,and to cease activities at other sites.the amendments act also included a linkage provision.but unlike doe proposed linkage between mrs facility operation acceptance of waste and permanent storage authorization,the act precluded mrs facility construction until the nrc authorized a permanent storage repository.the amendments act also capped the total storage at an mrs facility at mtu.because of these provisions,the industry quickly realized that doe would be unable to get an mrs facility in place in time to meet its acceptance obligation.while appealing to congress to reconsider the linkage provisions of the act,doe issued additional acrs in,and.
in,doe issued another amendment to its plan.this amended plan proposed an mrs facility,but acknowledged that repeal of the linkage provision would have to occur first.the plan set forth a projected waste acceptance schedule that matched doe acr process numbers.assuming an mrs facility in place,the plan set the acceptance rate at in,ramping up to in.after,this plan held the acceptance rate steady until a permanent repository would come online in,at which time the mrs would begin accepting.like the earlier plans and amendments,this schedule was not guaranteed.instead,doe explained that the projected capacity would provide enough federal storage,between the start of operations at the mrs facility and at the repository,to substantially reduce the need for utilities to add new storage capacity at existing facilities after.pg e i.at quoting draft mission plan amendment emphasis added.
congress has not modified the linkages in the amendments to the nwpa.without a licensed permanent repository,doe has never built an mrs facility.in,doe issued a final interpretation of waste acceptance issues,concluding that doe had no statutory or contractual obligation to accept beginning on january,in the absence of a facility constructed under the nwpa and its amendments.several utilities challenged this interpretation.the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit vacated doe final interpretation,holding that doe does have a statutory obligation reciprocal to the utilities obligation to pay to dispose of waste beginning january.power dep t of energy.because doe failure to perform constituted a partial breach of the standard contract,pg e suit in the court of federal claims focused on damages owed to pg e by the united states to compensate for the expenses incurred as a result of doe partial breach.
the required acceptance rate under the standard contract 
this court interprets a contract in accordance with its language.see foley united states,citing gould,united states.generally,this court also construes contract terms in the context of the entire contract,avoiding any meaning that renders some part of the contract inoperative.see restatement second of contracts a a n interpretation which gives a reasonable,lawful,and effective meaning to all the terms is preferred to an interpretation which leaves a part unreasonable,unlawful,or of no effect.
in setting the proper acceptance rate to measure damages,the court of federal claims did not find doe had an obligation to accept at a rate that would prevent the utilities from bearing the costs of additional waste storage facilities after january.the hypothetical acceptance rate that would have obviated the need for onsite storage was around,according to pg instead,the court of federal claims concluded that the duty of good faith and fair dealing required reasonable performance under the existing circumstances and the requirements of the standard contract.pg e i.at.to determine the reasonable performance rate,the court of federal claims consulted doe acs reports and pg e approved schedules.according to the trial court,these reports,while not contractually binding,represented the parties understanding that this was the process under the express terms of the standard contract by which a firm acceptance rate and delivery schedule would be determined,and the parties substantially carried out this process before doe breach.id.at.
adopting the reports as a baseline,the court of federal claims found that doe would have accepted from the utilities at beginning in,in,and from.the trial court further found that doe would have accepted approximately all of the humboldt bay spent fuel by,but that doe would not have accepted any of diablo canyon spent fuel by the end of.id.at.
as noted by the trial court,the standard contract did not contain a specific acceptance rate.instead,the standard contract provided a mechanism for establishing an acceptance rate through the acs process.the contract sets forth doe responsibilities in article iv b 
a beginning on april,doe shall issue an annual acceptance priority ranking for receipt of snf hlw at the doe repository.this priority ranking shall be based on the age of snf hlw as calculated from the date of discharge of such material from the civilian nuclear power reactor.the oldest fuel or waste will have the highest priority for acceptance,except as provided in paragraphs b and d of article v and paragraph of article vi hereof.
b beginning not later than july,doe shall issue an annual capacity report acr for planning purposes.this report shall set forth the projected annual receiving capacity for the doe facility ies and the annual acceptance ranking relating to doe contracts for the disposal of snf hlw including,to the extent available,capacity information for ten years following the projected commencement of operation of the initial doe facility.
the utilities responsibilities appear in article v b 
delivery commitment schedule s for delivery of snf hlw shall be furnished to doe by purchaser.after doe has issued its proposed apr,as described in paragraph of article iv hereof,beginning january,the purchaser shall submit to doe the delivery commitment schedule s which shall identify all snf hlw the purchaser wishes to deliver to doe beginning months thereafter.doe shall approve or disapprove such schedules within three months after receipt.
id.from these clauses,the trial court declined to read a reasonable rate provision into the standard contract,and specifically rejected pg e proposed target.pg e i.at.the court of federal claims reasoned that adopting the rate would render the acs process meaningless or inoperative.id.at.the trial court approach,up to this point,adhered to standard contract interpretation principles.
the court of federal claims next considered restatement second of contracts,which governs the insertion of an essential term allegedly absent from the agreement when the parties to a bargain sufficiently defined to be a contract have not agreed with respect to a term which is essential to a determination of their rights
