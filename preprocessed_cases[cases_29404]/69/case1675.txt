the metropolitan water district of southern california mwd,a public agency founded in,supplies water to six southern california counties.in,mwd brought an eminent domain action to condemn a portion of land in san bernardino county owned by campus crusade for christ,and del rosa mutual water company collectively,campus crusade to construct a segment of a water pipeline to channel water from the inland areas to the coastal plains of southern california.prior to trial on the issue of just compensation,mwd persuaded the trial court to exclude valuation evidence offered by campus crusade experts to the extent such valuation was based on the property potential use as a planned residential development and resort area,which differed from its current use and which was not permitted under the zoning in effect at the time of the taking.the trial court also granted mwd request to exclude evidence of severance damages to the fair market value of the remainder of campus crusade property,the property not taken to the extent the damages were based on fear that the pipeline which crosses the san andreas fault on campus crusade property could rupture in an earthquake and to the extent the damages were based on certain other aspects of the pipeline and its construction process.finally,the trial court excluded evidence of temporary severance damages to the extent the damages were based on the adverse impact of the construction period on campus crusade ability to finance and market the property.
based on these rulings,campus crusade waived its right to a jury trial.the trial court fixed just compensation at,none of which was attributable to severance damages.campus crusade appealed,and the court of appeal reversed and remanded for a new trial,finding that judge john wade,who had replaced judge cynthia ludvigsen following her reassignment,had overstepped his authority in reconsidering and overruling her prior evidentiary rulings that a property owner does not bear the burden of proof on the amount of compensation or on any preliminary facts that may affect the jury determination of just compensation that the trial court had erred in preventing campus crusade from offering evidence that the property highest and best use was as a future planned residential and resort development,notwithstanding evidence of a reasonable probability the property could be rezoned in the near future,and had erred as well in taking that issue away from the trier of fact and that the trial court had erred in excluding evidence of severance damages arising from fear of a pipeline rupture and in excluding evidence of temporary severance damages arising from the adverse effects of construction on campus crusade ability to market and finance the property.
we granted review to clarify the respective roles of the trial court and the jury at a compensation trial in an eminent domain action and the nature of the damages that a property owner may recover.for the reasons outlined below,we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the court of appeal and remand for further proceedings.
background 
campus crusade,a charitable religious corporation,owns acres of land situated partly within the northern edge of the city of san bernardino and partly in unincorporated county territory within the city sphere of influence and slated for annexation.although most of the property is undeveloped,it is the site of the historic arrowhead springs hotel,the international school of theology,several office buildings,a conference center,a sports field,and a village.the property is also the primary source for arrowhead mountain spring water.
in early,campus crusade retained a land developer to assist with its plans to create a planned residential development on the property and to restore the existing resort and other buildings.the city seemed to be enthusiastic and supportive of campus crusade plans for future development.but campus crusade plans were disrupted when mwd decided to construct a portion of the inland feeder project,a water pipeline from devil canyon to diamond valley lake,across the property.now built,the pipeline is feet in diameter,constructed of welded steel,and buried hundreds of feet underground along most of its route.however,the pipeline enters covered trenches along the campus crusade property that are only to feet deep and,in some places,the pipeline is as close as four feet to the surface.the pipeline is designed to be close to the surface in these areas in order to facilitate repair in case of a rupture and to function as a safety valve in the event of an earthquake.the pipeline crosses the san andreas fault at this location.
mwd board of directors adopted their resolution of necessity on december.the resolution provided that mwd was to acquire the land at issue for the purpose of constructing,reconstructing,maintaining,operating,enlarging,removing,and replacing a line or lines of pipe at any time,and from time to time,for water transportation,with every appendage or structure necessary or convenient to be installed at any time in connection therewith.on december,mwd deposited funds into the state treasury,thereby setting the date of valuation.the following month,mwd filed its complaint in eminent domain and an ex parte application for possession.the first amended complaint sought acres in fee,acres of permanent easements,acres of temporary construction easements for a period of seven years,and two permanent tunnel easements,one below ground and the other above ground.
campus crusade submitted statements of valuation from three appraisers metcalfe,james smothers,and robert swing.the appraisers estimated the value of the property interests being taken at between and,and the temporary and permanent damage to the remainder at between and.the pipeline cut across campus crusade property at a location that was most valuable and most amenable to development.one of the permanent easements ran up against some of the existing buildings,and the resolution provided that campus crusade was not to interfere unreasonably with mwd rights over the permanent easements.further,the resolution restricted campus crusade ability to modify the topography,construct buildings,or plant trees in the areas covered by the easements.
the taking also interfered with campus crusade secondary access rights to the property by way of street,san bernardino,over a neighboring parcel.in addition,campus crusade contended that the pipeline,which crossed a branch of the san andreas fault at the site where the pipeline was raised to within several feet of the earth surface,posed a risk of rupture.a breach in the pipeline could cause a sudden outflow of millions of gallons of water onto campus crusade property at a rate of cubic feet per second.mwd analyzed this risk as a significant environmental impact in its environmental impact report.
finally,the temporary construction easements encompassed a row of mature trees that served as a natural entryway for the historic hotel.mwd use of these easements required the cutting of all the mature vegetation in the area.mwd disclaimed any obligation to restore the vegetation to its prior condition.
mwd submitted a revised statement of valuation of as just compensation for all the property taken,with no amount allocated for severance or temporary severance damages.on october,mwd filed a final offer of compensation for plus costs and interest,but subsequently increased its offer to.campus crusade revised its demand to for the property taken and severance damages.
prior to trial,mwd filed several motions in limine to exclude evidence.judge cynthia ludvigsen denied most of the motions and allowed campus crusade to present evidence to support its claim of severance damages,including damages caused by fear of a pipeline rupture.judge ludvigsen also allowed campus crusade to present evidence of damages if those damages were excessive and beyond the ordinary annoyances associated with a public works project.
after judge ludvigsen was reassigned and replaced by judge john wade,mwd filed additional motions in limine requests to exclude evidence of temporary and permanent severance damages,including evidence of damages caused by the period that would be needed to complete construction of the pipeline a request to exclude valuation evidence to the extent it was based on uses not permitted by current zoning a request to exclude evidence concerning impairment of campus crusade access to the property via street and a request to exclude evidence concerning the fear of a pipeline rupture.judge wade granted each of these motions,effectively precluding campus crusade from presenting evidence of severance damages,on the grounds that such damages were not recoverable as a matter of law,were too speculative,or assumed circumstances that did not exist on the date of valuation.
based on judge wade rulings,campus crusade reduced its demand for compensation to.because judge wade rulings effectively limited its recovery to compensation for the actual taking only,campus crusade also waived its right to a jury.on june,judge wade awarded campus crusade,which did not include any amount for severance damages.
the court of appeal reversed and remanded the matter for a new trial.the appellate court held that campus crusade had presented sufficient evidence of severance damages to warrant consideration of such damages by the trier of fact,that campus crusade had presented sufficient evidence of a likelihood that the property would be rezoned for residential and hotel development to permit the trier of fact to consider such potential uses in determining the property fair market value,and that the trier of fact should have been permitted to consider the effect of the construction on campus crusade ability to plan,finance,and market the property.
we granted mwd petition for review.
discussion 
this case arises under article i,section of the california constitution,which requires the owner whose property is taken or damaged for a public use be paid just compensation,ascertained by a jury unless waived.
the legislature has defined the measure of just compensation as the fair market value of the property taken.code civ.the fair market value of the property taken is the highest price on the date of valuation that would be agreed to by a seller,being willing to sell but under no particular or urgent necessity for so doing,nor obliged to sell,and a buyer,being ready,willing,and able to buy but under no particular necessity for so doing,each dealing with the other with full knowledge of all the uses and purposes for which the property is reasonably adaptable and available,subd.a.as section indicates,the fair market value of property taken has not been limited to the value of the property as used at the time of the taking,but has long taken into account the highest and most profitable use to which the property might be put in the reasonably near future,to the extent that the probability of such a prospective use affects the market value.city of san diego neumann cal th,d.this prospective use is to be considered,not necessarily as the measure of value,but to the full extent that the prospect of demand for such use affects the market value while the property is privately held.olson united states.
when the property taken is part of a larger parcel,the owner is compensated not merely for the injury to the part taken but also for the injury,if any,to the remainder,subd.a.compensation for injury to the remainder is the amount of the damage to the remainder caused by the taking,reduced by the amount of the benefit to the remainder caused by the taking,subd.b.such compensation is commonly called severance damages.city of san diego neumann,supra,cal th at,d.
the procedures governing eminent domain actions differ in some respects from those governing other actions.for example,all issues except the sole issue relating to compensation are to be tried by the court.people ricciardi cal d.the defendant,the property owner shall present evidence on the issue of compensation first and shall commence and conclude the argument,subd.a.and,e xcept as otherwise provided by statute,neither the plaintiff nor the defendant has the burden of proof on the issue of compensation,subd.b.in this respect,california law differs from that of most other states.see nichols on eminent domain ed,to,fn.
a.the reasonable probability of rezoning 
the court of appeal found that the trial court improperly thus prevented campus crusade appraisal experts from relying that the highest and best use of the property was comprehensive development for residential,commercial,industrial,and recreational uses.in the view of the court of appeal and echoed by campus crusade here,the trier of fact should have been allowed to consider these prospective uses in assessing the value of the property taken and the damage to the remainder instead,the trial court usurped the jury role by deciding for itself,prior to trial,whether there was a reasonable probability the property could be rezoned to permit these other uses.mwd,by contrast,argues that the question whether there was a reasonable probability of the property being rezoned is properly entrusted to the court,not the jury,and that the court pretrial determination that rezoning was not reasonably probable here is supported by substantial evidence.
there is no dispute that the existing zoning did not authorize the development envisioned by campus crusade.the portion of the property lying within the city of san bernardino was zoned residential low,which imposed a maximum density of dwelling units per gross acre and did not allow commercial uses.the remaining property was zoned rural living,which imposed a minimum lot size single residential,which permitted a slightly higher density and resource conservation,which imposed a minimum lot size.the existing buildings on the property,including the hotel,predated the current zoning and were operating as legal nonconforming uses.
prior to trial,mwd filed a motion in limine for an order prohibiting the presentation of any evidence treating campus crusade property as zoned for anything other than the uses permitted by the resource conservation zone unless,and until,campus crusade has borne its burden of proof and convinced the court,outside of the jury presence,that there is substantial evidence of a reasonable probability of rezoning on the date of value.after conducting a pretrial evidentiary hearing,judge wade granted the motion.he agreed with mwd that the question whether a reasonable probability of rezoning existed in the near future was for the court to decide,and he determined,based on the evidence presented by both sides at the pretrial hearing,that it is not reasonably probable that the subject property would be rezoned in the reasonably near future.as a result,judge wade prohibited campus crusade appraisers from valuing the remainder as anything other than resource conservation.unfortunately,the trial court thereby usurped the role of the jury in valuing the property.
where due to zoning restrictions the condemned property is not presently available for use to which it is otherwise geographically and economically adaptable,the condemnee is entitled to show a reasonable probability of a zoning change in the near future and thus to establish such use as the highest and best use of the property.city of los angeles decker cal d.the jury role in this assessment is settled.t he determination as to whether or not there is a reasonable probability of a use change is ordinarily a question of fact for the jury.redevelopment agency contra costa theatre,d,quoting people ex rel.pub.wks.arthofer d.see community redevelopment agency henderson d.the court correctly left to the jury the determination whether there was a reasonable probability of a zone change see also city of los angeles decker,supra,cal d at,the purported need for airport parking and the suitability of defendant property for that purpose were critical to the issue of valuation people ex rel.of public works donovan cal d,criticizing defendant proffered jury instruction concerning the probability of rezoning where the evidence was conflicting because of the possible implication that the court had concluded as a matter of law that there was a reasonable probability of a zoning change accord,nichols on eminent domain,supra,the existence of a reasonable probability of an imminent change in zoning is a question of fact,it is for the jury to consider the weight to be given the testimony based on such probability,whether there is such probability,and its effect on the fair market value.
before such evidence may be presented to the jury,however,the trial court must first determine whether there is sufficient evidence that would permit a jury to conclude there is a reasonable probability of rezoning in the near future.evidence of a reasonable probability of a zoning change in the near future must at least be in accordance with the usual minimum evidentiary requirements,and that which is purely speculative,wholly guess work and conjectural,is inadmissible.city of los angeles decker,supra,cal d at.the evidence,if credited,must also be sufficient to establish that rezoning is reasonably probable.people ex rel.pub.wks.arthofer,supra,d at.upholding the exclusion of testimony from an expert whose opinion was based on a reasonable possibility instead of a reasonable probability of zone change.if the trial court determines that no fact finder could find a reasonable probability of rezoning on the record presented,it may exclude all evidence and opinions of value based on a use other than that authorized by the existing zoning.id.at.accord,city of san diego neumann,supra,cal th at,d,evidence of a probability of rezoning is relevant only to the extent that the probability of such a prospective use affects the market value.if,on the other hand,the trial court determines that there is sufficient evidence of a reasonable probability of rezoning to warrant submitting the issue to the jury,it is for the jury,in considering the weight to be given valuation testimony based upon a reasonable probability of rezoning,to determine whether there was a reasonable probability of rezoning and,if so,its effect on the market value of the property.thus,before a jury may even reach the question whether a use that was unauthorized by the existing zoning otherwise meets the criteria of a highest and best use,the jury must first find that there was a reasonable probability of rezoning to permit that use.once that has been established,neither party bears the burden to persuade the fact finder of the effect of this probability on the valuation of the property,subd.b accord,judicial council of cal.civ.jury instns.caci,subd.c.
relying on language in certain court of appeal decisions,mwd contends that the property owner bears the burden of proving that a reasonable probability of rezoning exists.mwd relies in particular on county of san diego rancho vista del mar,th,d rancho vista del mar,which asserted that t he property owner has the burden of showing a reasonable probability of a change in the restrictions on the property,as well as on city of san diego rancho penasquitos partnership th,d,and city of san diego barratt american,th,d,which simply quote this passage from rancho vista del.but these statements must be interpreted against the backdrop of section,which provides a the defendant shall present his evidence on the issue of compensation first and shall commence and conclude the argument.b except as otherwise provided by statute,neither the plaintiff nor the defendant has the burden of proof on the issue of compensation.
what does section,subdivision b mean when it says that neither party has the burden of proof on the issue of compensation we begin with a discussion of key terms burden of proof and burden of producing evidence.attorneys,judges,and commentators often have confused these terms and the concepts they represent.as the united states supreme court observed,for many years the term burden of proof was ambiguous because the term was used to describe two distinct concepts.burden of proof was frequently used to refer to what we now call the burden of notion that if the evidence is evenly balanced,the party that bears the burden of persuasion must lose.but it was also used to refer to what we call the burden of party obligation to come forward with evidence to support its claim.sargent fletcher,able th,d,italics omitted.with those definitions in mind,we can now construe section.subdivision a articulates a burden of production,which is merely the burden of going forward with or producing some evidence of a material fact.redevelopment agency metropolitan theatres d,fn.see generally aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.here,the property owner has the burden to produce evidence to support a finding that rezoning is reasonably probable.once that burden has been satisfied,however,subdivision b makes it clear that neither party bears a particular burden of persuasion with respect to convincing the trier of fact that the reasonable probability exists or what effect such probability would have on the valuation of the property.
we thus understand the burden described in rancho vista del mar,supra,th,d,and its progeny to be the burden of production,not the burden of persuasion.this accords with the law revision commission comment to section,which explains that a bsent the production of evidence by one party,the trier of fact will determine compensation solely from the other party evidence,but neither party should be made to appear to bear some greater burden of persuasion than the other.cal.law revision com,west civ.proc.ed.foll.
accordingly,when presented with a proffer that there is a highest and best use that is not permitted by the property current zoning,the trial court should examine whether the proffer supplies sufficient evidence to permit the jury to find that there was a reasonable probability of rezoning to permit that use in the near future.the jury should then be instructed that it may consider the change in use,provided that it first finds a reasonable probability the property could be rezoned in the near future.in this case,however,the trial court collapsed these two steps into one by deciding,prior to trial,whether it was convinced there was a reasonable probability of rezoning.because the trial court examined the evidence of rezoning under an unduly rigorous standard,we direct the court of appeal to remand the matter to the trial court to reexamine the record under the correct standard in the first instance,ramirez yosemite water cal th,d,lindenstadt staff builders,th,d.
severance damages 
the court of appeal also found that the trial court usurped the jury role by purporting to determine whether campus crusade had proven an entitlement to severance damages and then excluding evidence of such severance damages from the trial.the court of appeal held that it was for the trier of fact to determine whether the fear of a pipeline rupture during an earthquake and whether the impact of the delay in construction on campus crusade ability to market and finance the property negatively affected the value of the property not,in other words,whether these factors established severance damages.mwd,on the other hand,contends that the trial court should decide first whether severance damages exist if so,only then does the jury determine the amount of those damages.we agree with the court of appeal,but only in part.
severance damages,as noted above,consist generally of the diminution in the fair market value of the remainder property caused by the project.where the property taken constitutes only a part of a larger parcel,the owner is entitled to recover,inter alia,the difference in the fair market value of his property in its before condition and the fair market value of the remaining portion thereof after the construction of the improvement on the portion taken.items such as view,access to beach property,freedom from noise,are unquestionably matters which a willing buyer in the open market would consider in determining the price he would pay for any given piece of real property.citation.severance damages are not limited to special and direct damages,but can be based on any factor,resulting from the project,that causes a decline in the fair market value of the property.los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority continental develo
