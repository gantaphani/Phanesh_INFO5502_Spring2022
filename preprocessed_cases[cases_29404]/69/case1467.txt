appeals the district court denials of its motion for judgment as a matter of law seeking to set aside a jury verdict in favor of felix kemp and its motion to reduce the jury punitive damages award.the jury determined that was guilty of fraudulent billing practices and the collection of illegal gambling debts in violation of the federal and georgia rico statutes.these gambling debts were incurred after kemp grandson called a named let make a deal,which offered callers a chance to win various prizes in exchange for a fee.attempted to collect these debts by including them in kemp phone bill as though they were long distance charges.the jury awarded kemp in actual damages,the costs of playing the game,which were then trebled under the rico statutes,and also awarded kemp punitive damages of one million dollars.for the reasons given below,we affirm the denial of motion for judgment as a matter of law.however,we conclude that the trial court erred by letting the jury punitive damages award stand and therefore reduce the award.
background 
the let make a deal game lmad was created by teleline,based on the famous television show of the same name.the game ran from early until december when participants called the line,they were asked to pick a number using their touchtone phones that corresponded to a figurative door that concealed a prize.if callers guessed correctly,they could either keep the prize or instead proceed to the next level.upon successfully completing all six levels of the game,callers were entitled to a cash prize of.the odds of winning this prize were approximately in.the cost of playing the game was per minute,and there was no set time for how long any particular call would last.
carried calls to lmad numbers over its long distance network and played the prerecorded messages that callers heard when they called the line.individuals who called lmad were not charged for the price of a phone call,but instead paid only for the content provided by teleline,namely,the ability to gamble using their phones.it was teleline who paid for the cost of each phone call to lmad notwithstanding that the charges incurred in playing the game were owed exclusively to teleline and were not debts for long distance calls,listed these charges in its long distance phone bill,interspersed with charges for long distance calls.billed individuals who called lmad from georgia and collected.this disparity is due in part to policy of erasing lmad fees for customers who complained sufficiently about the charges.in exchange for its billing services,received a commission of six percent of the fees it collected on behalf of teleline.
kemp was a long distance customer of who received a bill containing multiple charges for playing the lmad game intermingled among charges for long distance phone calls.the lmad charges appeared on pages marked with name and logo.the remainder of the bill contained charges for local phone service owed to bellsouth,in which only bellsouth name and logo appeared.despite the separate sections for local and long distance charges,the entire portion of the bill was to be paid to bellsouth,which purchased accounts receivable.
upon noticing the lmad charges,kemp called the number for bellsouth listed in his phone bill,seeking information about these debts.after a bellsouth representative told kemp that he owed the entire amount of the bill and would lose phone service if he refused to pay,kemp paid for the charges and later brought suit at trial,the jury agreed with kemp that billing practices were fraudulent and constituted a pattern of racketeering activity within the meaning of the federal and georgia rico statutes.in addition,the jury determined that actions amounted to illegal gambling under state law and that the collection of these unlawful debts also violated rico.the jury awarded kemp both compensatory damages and the aforementioned one million dollars in punitive damages.moved for judgment as a matter of law and for a reduction of the punitive damages award.the district court denied both motions and this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
motion for judgment as a matter of law 
a motion for judgment as a matter of law should be granted only if a court finds that there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the proper judgment.see bryan james holmes reg l med,cir internal quotation marks omitted.argues that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the jury findings were unreasonable given the evidence presented at trial.specifically,claims that kemp failed to offer sufficient evidence for the jury to reasonably conclude that actions violated the mail or wire fraud statutes and georgia theft by deception statute billing practices amounted to the collection of unlawful debts in violation of state and federal rico and kemp payments were made involuntarily within the meaning of state law.we address each contention in turn.
rico violations for racketeering activity involving mail and wire fraud and theft by deception 
in reviewing motion for judgment as a matter of law on this issue,we consider whether there was a reasonable evidentiary basis for the jury to conclude that actions constituted federal mail or wire fraud,under and,respectively,and theft by deception under state law,ann,which were the predicate crimes triggering rico liability.see racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,et,and the georgia rico act,ann.et.given the materially equivalent elements for establishing a claim of mail or wire fraud and theft by deception,the district court only required that kemp prove that committed mail and wire fraud.since neither party challenges the correctness of this decision on appeal,we consider only whether kemp established sufficient facts in order to prove mail or wire fraud.and because the elements of the mail and wire fraud statutes are the same,we consider these claims together.see pelletier zweifel,cir.
in order to bring a rico claim where mail or wire fraud serves as the predicate activity,it is necessary to show that the defendant intentionally participated in a scheme to defraud another of money or property,the defendant used the mails or wires in furtherance of that scheme,and the plaintiff relied to his detriment on the defendant misrepresentations.id.at.only intent and reliance are at issue in this appeal,since obviously used the mails when it sent kemp his phone bill.
argues that kemp failed to provide sufficient evidence that it intended to deceive him because none of the statements in its long distance phone bill were false.as this court has explained,however,it is not necessary for a plaintiff to point to affirmative misstatements in order to establish the requisite fraudulent intent of a defendant under the mail and wire fraud statutes.langford rite aid of,cir intent to defraud need not be shown through active omissions can be fraudulent if they are intended to create a false impression.the nondisclosure of material information,even in the absence of any patently false statements,can also constitute a violation of the mail and wire fraud statutes where a defendant has a duty to disclose.see ayres motors,cir.such a duty can be judicially created where there is a special relationship of trust between the parties,or may be based on other circumstances.see langford,at determinations as to whether a duty to disclose information exists must be made on a case by case basis,with appropriate attention given to the nature of the transaction and the relationship between the parties.
in this case,once included the lmad charges in the section of its bill for long distance calls,it had the duty to correct the mistaken impression it had fostered that the lmad debts were for long distance charges.see united states autuori,cir a duty to disclose can also arise in a situation where a defendant makes partial or ambiguous statements that require further disclosure in order to avoid being misleading.united states townley,cir noting that under the mail fraud statute,it is just as unlawful to speak half truths or to omit to state facts necessary to make the statements made,in light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.the lmad gambling charges appeared under the heading direct dialed calls in kemp phone bill and were interspersed among charges for regular long distance calls.name and logo were displayed on all the pages containing the lmad charges.it was clearly foreseeable that this formatting would cause some customers to think that the lmad charges were for a long distance phone call owed to and that the charges had to be paid in order to maintain phone service in fact,however,the lmad charges were not long distance charges but were gambling debts owed only to teleline,and as acknowledged at trial,individuals could not lose phone service for failing to pay these debts.moreover,as we explain below,the lmad fees constituted illegal gambling debts that could not be collected lawfully under georgia law.
in light of the circumstances here,and most specifically the way the charges were placed on the bill,we are satisfied that sufficient evidence supports the jury conclusion that intended to mislead customers into believing that they had to pay the lmad debts in order to maintain uninterrupted phone service.as a result,had a duty to place adequate information on its bill that would have disclosed the true nature of the lmad charges and corrected the misconception it had intentionally created see autuori,at.
because was under a duty to make this disclosure,the company can not argue that kemp failed to rely on omissions.although it was a bellsouth representative who erroneously stated that kemp service would be terminated if he did not pay for the lmad charges,had long distance bill contained the necessary disclosures,kemp need not have called bellsouth for an explanation.material omissions were thus an essential part of kemp decision to pay these gambling debts.the district court did not err in denying motion for judgment as a matter of law with respect to the jury finding of fraud.see eeoc,cir judgment as a matter of law should be denied unless the evidence is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.
illegal gambling and collection of an unlawful debt 
argues that the district court erred when it concluded that the lmad game violated georgia prohibition on illegal gambling.as a result,the company maintains that the jury finding that it collected unlawful debts in violation of the federal and georgia rico statutes should be reversed,since both rico claims are founded on a violation of georgia ban on gambling.see unlawful debt under federal rico statute includes debts incurred in activities that violate state gambling laws and ann.a xvii racketeering activity under georgia rico includes violations of state prohibition on commercial gambling.
under state law,the lmad game was an illegal lottery if it was a scheme or procedure whereby one or more prizes are distributed by chance among persons who have paid or promised consideration for a chance to win such prize.ann.this definition incorporates three key elements consideration,prize and chance.see tierce state.kemp maintains that all three elements were satisfied by showing that his grandson called a number that offered a chance to win a prize in exchange for a fee.responds that because could also participate in the game through the mail,the element of consideration was negated.
as the georgia court of appeals has explained,in order for a game to amount to illegal gambling,it is only necessary that among those persons who receive a chance to win a prize there must be some who have paid a consideration.id.at,see also barker state,the test is not whether it was possible to win without paying the test is whether that group who did pay were paying in part for the chance of a prize.internal quotation marks omitted.clearly,the element of consideration was present for those callers who called the line,since they were charged per minute to play and have the chance of winning a prize.therefore,lmad was an illegal lottery under georgia law and the district court did not err in rejecting motion for judgment as a matter of law 
whether georgia voluntary payment statute bars kemp recovery 
georgia voluntary payment statute,which claims bars kemp recovery,provides that 
payments of claims made through ignorance of the law or where all the facts are known and there is no misplaced confidence and no artifice,deception,or fraudulent practice used by the other party are deemed voluntary and can not be recovered unless made under an urgent and immediate necessity therefor or to release person or property from detention or to prevent an immediate seizure of person or property.filing a protest at the time of payment does not change the rule prescribed in this code section.
ann.emphasis added.
under section,a payment will not be deemed voluntary if it was the product of fraud.see decatur fed.sav.loan gibson.therefore,in light of the jury finding of fraud,we conclude that kemp payment was not made voluntarily under georgia law.
motion for remittitur of the punitive damages award 
given the jury findings that acted fraudulently and knowingly collected gambling debts,there was sufficient evidence to justify an imposition of some amount of exemplary damages under state law however,the fact that some amount of exemplary damages was warranted in this case does not end our inquiry.the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment prohibits the imposition of grossly excessive or arbitrary punishments on a defendant and creates substantive limits on the amount of punitive damages a state may impose.state farm mut.auto.ins.campbell,d.in determining whether the jury award crosses this substantive line and is constitutionally excessive,we are required by the supreme court to consider three guideposts the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant conduct the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award and the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.id.at.
we review the constitutionality of the jury punitive damages award de novo.cooper,leatherman tool group,d.
reprehensibility analysis 
the reprehensibility of a defendant conduct is p erhaps the most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award.bmw of,gore,d.in conducting this reprehensibility analysis,the supreme court has articulated several factors for a court to consider.these factors include whether the injury caused physical harm whether the tortious conduct demonstrated an indifference to,or a reckless disregard of,the health or safety of others whether the target was financially vulnerable whether the conduct involved repeated actions and whether the harm was the result of intentional malice,trickery,or deceit.campbell,at.
the district court found that the first two factors did not apply in this case,while the remaining three were met.we agree with the district court that conduct was deceitful and involved repeated actions.we think the trial court was also justified in finding that intended to target financially vulnerable individuals given the jury finding of fraud.efforts to misleadingly represent gambling debts,which were illegal under georgia law,as legitimate charges for long distance calls could be deemed by a jury to be designed to exploit customers who were unsophisticated and economically vulnerable.
furthermore,like the trial court,we find little evidence that made a genuine attempt to shutdown the lmad line before the events in this case transpired.it was not until was sued that it revised its guidelines in april to prohibit gambling lines for which it provided collection services from advertising or operating in georgia.despite the guidelines,teleline continued to advertise and operate the lmad game in georgia for another five months.it was not until september the calls at issue in this case had been teleline sought to block calls from georgia residents to lmad.however,as the district court noted in its order,at the time instructed teleline to stop accepting calls from georgia,teleline lacked the necessary technology to block calls on network.furthermore,although told
