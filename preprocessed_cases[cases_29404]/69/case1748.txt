facts and procedural history 
because this case arises out of a procedural decision the underlying facts are not generally relevant.suffice it to say that plaintiff,who had been employed by regents as an anesthesiologist at the university of california irvine medical center,filed a complaint under the california whistleblower protection act,et against regents,breen,and anderson,the latter two physicians at the medical center.setting out several causes of action,the complaint primarily pleaded plaintiff was wrongfully terminated after he reported alleged illegal conduct by defendants.regents filed a containing several causes of action,including breach of contract,intentional and negligent misrepresentation,and violation of the false claims act,et,which alleged plaintiff failed to pay regents sums in excess of earned from outside employment.
the parties attended mediation in and again in.several days after the last session in april they resumed the process,which resulted in a stipulation to settle the matter stipulated settlement,including payment of to plaintiff and a dismissal of the complaint and with prejudice.the stipulated settlement incorporated the p rocessing terms of a letter of the same date prepared by defendants counsel,which generally sets out the logistics to complete the settlement.the stipulated settlement also stated it was a ll subject to approval of regents.the stipulated settlement was signed by four people plaintiff,one of his three lawyers,one of regents counsel,carolyn yee,who had been appointed as the party representative and authorized to sign on behalf of regents,and defendants lawyer,sandra mcdonough.yee had attended all of the mediation sessions as the party representative for regents.approximately one week later plaintiff counsel filed a notice of settlement of entire case.capitalization omitted.
as per the stipulated settlement,defendants counsel prepared a settlement agreement and release final settlement agreement,making the minor changes plaintiff lawyer requested.in september regents approved the stipulated settlement and plaintiff counsel was also advised.
in the meantime,in july plaintiff personally sent a letter to the trial judge,stating he had just become aware of certain irregularities that occurred prior to and during the mediation,threats by defendants,which were upheld by his own lawyer,to file criminal charges.he mentioned he had spoken to the state bar and would like time to get an independent legal opinion on those issues prior to further any processing of the action.the trial judge replied to plaintiff,with copies to both parties lawyers,advising he could not communicate with plaintiff personally and forwarded a copy of plaintiff letter to the lawyers.
at a voluntary settlement conference in october,after regents had approved the stipulated settlement,plaintiff told the court he would not sign the final settlement agreement.this was the first time defendants received definitive confirmation plaintiff was not willing to execute the document.plaintiff reiterated his unwillingness to sign at a subsequent mandatory settlement conference.
regents then filed a motion to enforce the stipulated settlement under code of civil procedure section all further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise stated,which the court denied on the ground regents had not signed the stipulated settlement because yee was their lawyer and not a party.
regents then filed a petition for writ of mandate in this court arguing that yee,as its duly authorized representative,could sign the settlement and signature by an officer was not required.we issued an alternative writ requiring the order that denied the motion be vacated and the trial court to decide the motion on the other issues raised or show cause why the original order was correct.
at the rehearing,the trial court granted the motion,after which a judgment,stating all claims were released,was entered.this appeal is from that judgment.

defendants signatures on the stipulated settlement 
regents signature 
section declares a settlement may be enforced by motion if the writing is signed by the parties.levy superior court cal th.relying on levy and gauss gaf th,plaintiff argues the stipulated settlement is unenforceable because it was never signed by regents,asserting yee signature was ineffective.
in levy,lawyers for the two individual parties executed a writing settling the case.the plaintiff then refused to sign the formal settlement document and the defendant filed a motion under section to enforce the settlement.the supreme court determined that,although the word is reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation levy superior court,supra,cal th at,under the section,parties means the litigants themselves,and does not include their attorneys of record id.at,fn.omitted.
in reaching this conclusion the court examined the extent of the actions a lawyer may take on behalf of a client during the pendency of litigation,noting acts incidental to the management of a lawsuit,such as making or opposing motions,seeking continuances,or conducting discovery do not require a client explicit approval.levy superior court,supra,cal th at.but settling a case is not incidental and thus requires the client knowledge and express consent.citation.ibid.the court pointed to the rule that an attorney must be specifically authorized to settle and compromise a claim,that merely on the basis of employment the lawyer has no implied or ostensible authority to bind the client to a compromise settlement of pending litigation citations.ibid.
as a result,then,based on the court interpretation of the word party,because the settlement agreement in levy was signed only by plaintiff lawyer and not by plaintiff himself,it was not enforceable under section.levy superior court,supra,cal th at.
in gauss gaf,supra,th,relying on levy the court refused to enforce a settlement under section due to lack of a signature by a proper corporate representative,despite the fact the corporation had specifically designated the signatory as its sole agent and given it exclusive authority and discretion to settle the case.gauss gaf,supra,th.at.the court ruled that settlements signed only by a claims manager,or other agent of a party could not be enforced under section.gauss gaf,supra,th at.the appointed signer was an employee of an outside company defendant had formed and contracted with to handle the multitude of mass tort actions in which it was involved.the signatory was not an officer or employee of the defendant.
in gauss the defendant argued that a signature by its exclusive agent was sufficient because a corporation can act only through its employees and agents.citation.gauss gaf,supra,th at.the court rejected this argument,noting levy ma de no such distinction.ibid.but the rejection went to the insufficiency of a signature by an agent,not to the rule that a corporation acts through its agents and employees.gardner jonathan club cal d,avalonbay communities,county of los angeles th.
to interpret gauss to preclude enforcement of a settlement under section unless the document has been signed by a corporate officer is too narrow and also inaccurate.a careful reading of the case reveals that it contains no such requirement.although it did mention that the settlement documents in question had not been signed by a corporate officer gauss gaf,supra,th at,what gauss actually held was that the settlement was not enforceable under section because it was not signed by an authorized corporate representative id.at.in our case,the stipulated settlement was signed on behalf of the regents by yee,who was an authorized corporate representative.
yee was employed by regents in the office of the general counsel and designated as the party representative by charles robinson,regents general counsel and vice president of legal affairs.regents bylaw provides that he is an officer and the chief legal officer of the university,has general charge of all legal matters pertaining to the corporation and the university,and oversee s the provision of all legal services to the university.plainly,robinson had the authority to appoint yee.miklosy regents of university of california cal th,regents authority includes full powers of organization and government and its policies enacted as matters of internal regulation may enjoy a status equivalent to that of state statutes.as an employee of regents,yee could be designated as the party representative to execute the settlement on its behalf.
yee designation and action on behalf of regents fully satisfies the rationale of levy,which instructs that t he litigants direct participation tends to ensure that the settlement is the result of their mature reflection and deliberate assent.this protects the parties against hasty and improvident settlement agreements by impressing upon them the seriousness and finality of the decision to settle,and minimizes the possibility of conflicting interpretations of the settlement.citations.it also protects parties from impairment of their substantial rights without their knowledge and consent.citation.levy superior court,supra,cal th at.
regents direct ly participat ed with knowledge and consent levy superior court,supra,cal th at through yee,its employee.she was intimately and fully familiar with the case,understood the seriousness and finality of settling on those terms,and settled the case within regents guidelines,as evidenced by its ultimate approval.based on the unique facts of this case,yee was in as good or better a position as anyone to best protect regents interests in the settlement.
our decision should not be extended to apply to any employee of a corporation in any circumstance obviously some would lack the appropriate qualifications.on the other hand holding that an officer,as opposed to another designated and qualified employee,must sign a settlement for it be to enforceable under section makes no practical sense.one can hardly expect an officer of ford motor company or wal mart stores to participate in every settlement of every case,down to the smallest personal injury action,to be eligible to take advantage of the mechanism provided by section.
in gauss the plaintiff made a similar argument,claiming that refusing to enforce the settlement agreement because signed only by its designated agent would substantially interfere with settlement of mass tort actions.the court rejected this assertion,pointing out that the procedure under section was not exclusive but merely an expeditious,valid alternative citation.gauss gaf,supra,th at.rather,s ettlement agreements may also be enforced by motion for summary judgment,by a separate suit in equity or by amendment of the pleadings to raise the settlement as an affirmative defense.citations.ibid.
but when the signer is an employee,under the circumstances present here,there is no reason why,merely by virtue of their size,large organizations or entities that are involved in a multitude of lawsuits should be deprived of access to the summary process of section.after all,it was enacted to provide an expedient and cost effective means of enforcing a settlement agreement and as a valid alternative to a motion for summary judgment and the other methods of enforcement.city of fresno maroot d,see also kilpatrick beebe d.the legislature created this procedure to benefit not only parties but also the justice system,relieving it of the burden of more time consuming and expensive processes.
plaintiff maintains yee was counsel of record,thus making the stipulated settlement unenforceable under levy.but yee was not attorney of record as to the complaint and appeared only on the as one of six lawyers.more importantly,the facts here are not the same as in levy,where the agreement was signed only by outside counsel on behalf of the party and not by an employee of the party.yee was not authorized to sign merely by virtue of her retention in litigation as in levy.levy superior court,supra,cal th at.she did not bind regents as an see blanton womancare,cal d,but signed as a designated employee of the corporate party.just because yee happened to be an attorney should not and does not prohibit her from acting on regents behalf.further,plaintiff has not cited a case holding that a settlement agreement signed in mediation by someone who is both counsel and a party can not be enforced under section.
finally,plaintiff argues regents internal policies bar not only yee authority to sign but also robinson.but he is relying on documents not in the record they were attached to his supplemental points and authorities,which the trial court refused to consider because plaintiff had not obtained leave of court to file them.and plaintiff does not challenge that ruling.
signature by individual defendants 
plaintiff contends that even if the stipulated settlement is enforceable by regents,the individual defendants may not enforce it because they did not sign the document.it is true the individual defendants did not sign but they are not seeking to enforce the stipulated settlement as parties to it they did not make the motion.rather,they are third party beneficiaries of the stipulated settlement and the judgment in their favor is valid as well.
as discussed above,a settlement agreement may be enforced under section by the parties who signed it.but the statute does not require that the agreement be executed by every party to the action who benefits from it,even if indirectly,such as a third party beneficiary.
