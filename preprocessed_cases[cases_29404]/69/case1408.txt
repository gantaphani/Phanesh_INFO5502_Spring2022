background 
garrison applied for an assembly job in a centrilift manufacturing plant.shortly after,centrilift offered garrison the assembly position contingent upon the results of a medical examination conducted by centrilift physician.centrilift required all entering employees in assembly positions to undergo the same medical examination.during the course of the medical examination,centrilift required garrison to complete a medical history form.among other questions,the form asked whether garrison had ever suffered hearing loss pain in the shoulder,arms,or hands leg or foot problems and back pain,strain,or surgery.garrison untruthfully checked no in response to each of these questions.centrilift physician subsequently found no limitations on garrison physical abilities and recommended him for the position.
centrilift physician forwarded garrison medical history form to centrilift human resources department.the human resources department then obtained garrison past workers compensation records from the state of oklahoma.garrison had received workers compensation for several injuries arising from previous employment.he had suffered injuries to his hearing,neck,shoulder,elbow,hand,back,abdomen,lungs,knee,and feet.after learning of garrison previous injuries,centrilift withdrew its conditional offer of employment.
garrison telephoned steven wayne brown,centrilift manager of human resources for north american operations,to inquire why centrilift withdrew the job offer.referring to garrison previous workers compensation claims,brown explained 
so when we look at those kind of histories,we look at those in terms of where we are placing people for possible future injuries 
well,the positions that we were looking at you for are those positions that would put you in a position to likely be injured again and we do do that.
garrison sued centrilift in federal district court alleging he was denied employment on the basis of a disability or a perceived disability in violation of the americans with disabilities act.after an initial jury verdict in favor of centrilift,garrison appealed to this court.garrison baker hughes oilfield operations,wl,at cir,unpublished opinion hereinafter garrison i.we reversed the first jury verdict because of an incorrect jury instruction and remanded for a new trial on garrison claim of violation of d.id.at.
in the second trial,the district court submitted a mixed motive instruction to the jury.on a special verdict form the jury found centrilift withdrew its job offer in part for legitimate reasons.however,the jury also found centrilift would have employed garrison but for motives not and inconsistent with business necessity.the jury awarded garrison in compensatory damages.
in proceedings the district court also issued an injunctive judgment against centrilift.the injunctive judgment ordered centrilift to comply with the medical examination and inquiry provisions of the americans with disabilities act.among other specific restrictions,the injunction ordered centrilift not to gain medical or workers compensation information except to convey it to appropriate medical personnel who are reviewing it to determine job applicants abilities to perform the offered jobs.centrilift now appeals the jury verdict and the district court injunctive judgment.
discussion 
centrilift argues there is insufficient evidence to support the jury verdict in favor of garrison americans with disabilities act claim.specifically,centrilift argues it complied with d by similarly examining all entering employees,keeping exam results confidential,and using exam results only in accordance with the act.centrilift explains it withdrew garrison job offer because of false answers on his medical questionnaire,rather than because of a disability or perceived disability

under the americans with disabilities act covered employers may require a medical examination after an offer of employment has been made to a job applicant and prior to the commencement of employment duties.d employers may make this offer of employment conditional on the results of the examination,if 
a all entering employees are subjected to such an examination regardless of disability 
b information obtained regarding the medical condition or history of the applicant is collected and maintained on separate forms and in separate medical files and is treated as a confidential medical record 
c the results of such examination are used only in accordance with this subchapter.

the results of a medical inquiry or examination may not be used to disqualify persons who are currently able to perform the essential functions of a job,either with or without an accommodation,because of fear or speculation that a disability may indicate a greater risk of future injury,or absenteeism,or may cause future workers compensation or insurance costs.

the record on appeal shows substantial evidence centrilift misused garrison entrance examination results.brown,centrilift manager of human resources for north american operations,told garrison his offer was revoked because of a risk of possible future injuries,and because we do do that.moreover,at trial when asked what concerned him about garrison examination results,brown explained it was just the multitude of injuries in a short period of time.under these circumstances,the jury could have determined centrilift withdrew the job offer because of unsubstantiated speculation about future risks from a perceived disability while garrison admitted he falsely represented his medical history,it was within the province of the jury to ascribe withdrawal of the job offer to discriminatory use of medical exam results because substantial evidence supports this jury verdict,we leave it undisturbed.
centrilift argues the district court improperly enjoined lawful medical inquiries.centrilift believes the district court exceeded its authority by enjoining review of entering employees workers compensation records by personnel.at issue is whether the confidentiality protections of d b support the district court injunction.we review a district court imposition of injunctive relief for abuse of discretion.prows federal bureau of prisons,cir,cert.denied,d.the discretionary decision is not left to a court inclination,but to its judgment and its judgment is to be guided by sound legal principles.albemarle paper moody,d.the court discretion is to be exercised in light of the purposes of the statute on which the plaintiff suit is based.roe cheyenne mountain conference resort,cir.however,t o the extent the district court determined questions of law in interpreting a statute,we exercise de novo review.rural water district city of wilson,cir.

in this case,the district court injunction limited lawful review of workers compensation histories by employers.the injunction states,defendant is not to gain medical or workers compensation information except to convey it to appropriate medical personnel who are reviewing it to determine job applicants abilities to perform the offered jobs.while d b places significant restrictions on disclosure of entering employees medical information,it does not support the district court injunction.the plain language of the americans with disabilities act does not require only medical personnel view entering employees workers compensation histories.d b.moreover,regulatory compliance materials contemplate review of workers compensation material by personnel.equal opportunity commission technical assistance manual.it is lawful for employers to designate a individual or individuals to review workers compensation histories,provided other statutory requirements are met therefore,the district court injunction subjects centrilift to possible contempt proceedings for engaging in employment practices permitted both by statute and by regulatory compliance materials.while the district court equitable powers do include such a remedy,we are not convinced it is either necessary or appropriate in this case.holtzman,at.the district court injunction was based upon evidence of only a single instance of discriminatory behavior.moreover,the discrimination complained of occurred in.there is no evidence of continuing discrimination.it is true an employer defiant hostility during litigation may rise to a cognizable danger of recurrent violations necessitating injunctive action.roe,at.however,in this case,the record on appeal does not provide evidence of a danger of recurrent violations sufficient to justify the infrequently exercised restriction of otherwise legal activity.holtzman,at.accordingly,we reverse the district court injunction insofar as it prohibits review of medical or workers compensation information by personnel.
centrilift argues the americans with disabilities act does not provide for an award of compensatory damages based on a violation of section d.centrilift asserts compensatory damages are only available under the americans with disabilities act if the plaintiff alleges discrimination on the basis of disability.the availability of compensatory damages for d violations is a legal issue we review de novo.rural water district,at.in griffin,we held to recover compensatory damages under d,a plaintiff need only prove injury flowing from the statutory violation rather than injury from discrimination based on a disability.griffin,at.in our previous opinion in this case,we held the griffin analysis is equally applicable to claims under d.garrison i,at.see also griffin,at citing cossette.power light,cir americans with disabilities act claimants must establish a tangible injury caused by technical violation of d in order to recover compensatory damages.thus,a claimant may recover compensatory damages for tangible injury legally and proximately caused by violation of d.griffin,at quoting armstrong turner,cir.accordingly,centrilift argument is foreclosed by our recent precedent and the law of this case.
