james irvin,a citizen of arizona,appeals the judgment of the district court in favor of southern union company,a delaware corporation,on southern union claims of tortious interference with a business expectancy and tortious interference with contractual relations,as a result of which southern union was ultimately awarded in compensatory damages and in punitive damages.southern union the district court decision to keep its claim of lost profits from the jury.
we hold,first,that the appeals were timely filed second,that the compensatory damage award should be affirmed and third,that the punitive damages are constitutionally disproportionate to the harm found.
jurisdiction.the case was brought by southern union under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,and as a suit asserting diversity jurisdiction under.in the course of the proceedings,various defendants settled with southern union the rico claim dropped out and only the business and contract torts went to the jury.in this court,our first question is the timeliness of irvin appeal the timeliness of southern union is dependent on our finding irvin appeal timely.we state the facts relevant to this issue.
on december,the jury returned its verdict in favor of southern union.the jury awarded damages of on the contract claim,with liability assigned to irvin.the jury awarded on the business relationship claim with liability assigned to irvin.the jury awarded million in punitive damages.on january,irvin moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict jnov or in the alternative for a new trial or remittitur.on january,the district court issued a ruling as to the proposed form of judgment,taking into account that the jury had assigned different percentages of responsibility to irvin for the two torts for which the jury held him responsible.the court ruled that the two percentages should be averaged to determine irvin liability.on june,the district court denied irvin motion for jnov.on july,the district court again denied irvin motion for jnov and also his motion for a new trial or remittitur.this order,in its entirety,read 
pending before court is defendant irvin amended motion for jnov or in the alternative for new trial or remittitur.the court has reviewed the briefing,and will deny the motion.a written opinion will follow early next week.
accordingly,
it is ordered that defendant irvin amended motion for jnov or in the alternative for new trial or remittitur is denied.
dated this day of july.
this order was communicated to counsel and docketed on july.
on july,the district court signed a second order which dealt with irvin two motions,analyzed them in detail,and denied them.this order was docketed august.
on august,the district court signed what it termed final judgment.it read,in its entirety,as follows 
these consolidated actions came on for jury trial on october,the honorable roslyn silver presiding.on december,all remaining matters having been duly tried and submitted to the jury,the jury rendered its verdict in matter.judgment is hereby entered in favor of southern union company and against defendant james irvin as follows on southern union claim for intentional interference with contract,the sum of,adjusted by relative degrees of fault to on southern union claim for intentional interference with business expectancy,the sum of,adjusted by relative degrees of fault to the higher amount of constitutes the total actual damages assessed against defendant irvin,and in favor of southern union punitive damages in the sum of its cost of suit as taxed by the clerk and as approved by the court.
dated this day of august.
this order was docketed august.irvin notice of appeal was filed august,within days of the entry of this judgment.
southern union argues that irvin was late the appeal deadline was august,thirty days from the entry of the judgment of july.southern union relies on federal rules of appellate procedure frap a a,which reads as follows 
effect of a motion on a notice of appeal.
a if a party timely files in the district court any of the following motions under the federal rules of civil procedure,the time to file an appeal runs for all parties from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion 
v for a new trial under rule 
read literally,the rule applies.the district court on july,entered its order disposing of irvin motion for a new trial.the appeal period expired august.
we do not believe that the rule was intended to work in this way.on july,final judgment including the damages had not yet been entered.what would irvin have appealed in alice in wonderland,the rule is sentence afterwards.we could read our rule to mean appeal first,judgment afterwards.but we are not in wonderland.irvin appeal was timely,as was southern union,which was filed on september.
having determined that we do have jurisdiction,we turn to the merits of the two appeals.
james irvin was elected in january,to be one of the three commissioners of the arizona corporation commission the acc.this body regulates energy companies in arizona and has the power to approve or disapprove mergers of such companies.const.art.xv.irvin became chairman in november and served in this capacity until may.jack rose was a lawyer and friend of irvin and had worked on irvin campaign for election to the acc.in june,irvin nominated him to be executive secretary of the acc.rose served in this capacity until december.irvin and rose became defendants in this case because of their relationship to the merger deliberations of southwest gas company swg.
on december,swg announced its agreement to merge with oneok,an appropriate acronym for,a leading oklahoma natural gas company.the price offered by oneok was per share of swg stock.the parties agreed that a competing offer at a higher price would entitle swg to consider the higher offer.on february,southern union offered swg per share on terms otherwise the same.the value of this offer was over oneok.if accepted,the deal would have created the largest natural gas utility in the united states.any merger had to be approved by the acc and by the appropriate regulatory authorities in california,missouri,and nevada.on february,the swg board unanimously determined that southern union offer was a superior proposal as defined in the merger agreement with oneok.that determination meant that southern union financial plan was viable that the deal was doable and that southern union could get regulatory approval.swg was therefore free to negotiate with southern union.irvin and rose,however,worked to defeat southern union proposal.
on december,rose,still the executive secretary of the acc,sent a business proposal to prudential securities,psi,a new york investment house and wholly owned subsidiary of the prudential insurance company of america.rose wrote last week southwest gas corporation announced that it is being bought out in an all cash transaction.given my relationship with this company and my ability to advise them on important regulatory issues related to the merger,i believe that i am well positioned to get some of the underwriting business.neither rose as a regulator nor psi as an underwriter seemed aware of the implications of a regulator touting his ability to obtain business from a company within his jurisdiction.
on december,rose resigned as executive secretary.on january,he was hired at the acc by irvin as a loaned executive,without the knowledge or approval of other acc commissioners.
on february,irvin called larry brummett,chairman of oneok,and told him that he did want a bidding war between oneok and southern union and that he wanted to write swg.a few days later,rose,with irvin approval,traveled to oklahoma and met brummett.brummett agreed that rose could set up a meeting between representatives of psi and oneok.february,the day after southern union offer became public,rose called psi and told them that he was advising the chairman of oneok on the proposed merger and would arrange for psi people to meet the ceo and cfo of oneok.on march,rose met with john gaberino,general counsel of oneok.the next day,gaberino and rose met with irvin,who told gaberino that rose had given him a good report on oneok and that irvin intended to contact the other two relevant regulatory bodies,the california public utilities commission the cpuc and the public utilities commission of nevada the pucn.two days later,march,gaberino and another lawyer for oneok worked on a letter for irvin to send to the board of swg.gaberino went over the text of this letter with rose.this letter the letter was to become an instrument in irvin interference with the proposed southern union merger.
on march,david dubin of psi sent an email to joseph sebastian fichera,a managing director of the same company.this communication was titled referral business opportunity through jack rose.referring to rose,dubin stated 
jack says that the company ceo has a strong motive for wanting to reward him presumably for his work in helping the company obtain favorable regulatory action from the acc during his tenure as its chief executive.he would like to pursue the transaction on behalf of psi and is confident that he can persuade the company to name psi as a managing underwriter.
jack is concerned,however,about using up his goodwill with the ceo to obtain an engagement in which the fee income to ibg investment banking group or underwriter will be modest in comparison to the fees ibg would collect and that he in turn would share as an advisor on an acquisition.hence,jack has proposed that he and psi enter into a finder fee arrangement under which his contingent payout would be larger if he can deliver a more lucrative appointment for psi.specifically,he would propose the following percentage payouts of the fee income booked by ibg on the transactions 
time is of the essence.jack telephone in phoenix is.
on march,fichera passed this information on to another executive at psi 
a person we met on the administrative securitization trail in arizona says he can help deliver a significant piece of business to us.the client,he told us today,is oneok,a major midwestern gas company carol coale does not cover them though she tracks them.we do not have a relationship with this firm last warp call date from someone no longer here.it is an a rated company and someone we would like to do business with.he is willing to work completely on the comeno deliver,no pay.but,if he does deliver,he wants to be paid big time see below.
i think this is worth pursuingit is real but need your guidance as to how much to compensate if he really can deliver a senior managed or sole managed deal.
we need to get back to him on thursday am.
on march,fichera,on behalf of prudential securities,and rose entered into a contract providing as follows 
this letter is to confirm our mutual understanding with respect to compensation that may be payable to you from prudential securities incorporated psi with respect to certain public offerings of securities underwritten by psi.
you agree to introduce psi to oneok,and west each a company and to assist psi in securing the engagement of psi by each company collectively,the introduction.if during the next months either company consummates a public offering of its securities in which psi acts as a managing underwriter a psi underwritten offering,psi will pay to you a fee the fee based on a percentage of the management fee paid to psi with respect to such psi underwritten offering according to the following schedule 
the fee shall be paid to you within days of the receipt of the management fee by psi,provided that such fee is not prohibited by law.psi will only be obligated to pay you a fee hereunder when the entire fee payable to psi with respect to a psi underwritten offering has been received by psi free of adverse claim.
psi shall reimburse you periodically for your reasonable,travel and lodging expenses incurred with psi prior consent in connection with the introduction.
although only the proposed merger of oneok and west was referred to,this agreement,it could be inferred,was also to govern an oneok merger with swg.a series of telephone calls between rose and irvin punctuated rose negotiations with psi.
rose and irvin were at work even before rose contract was signed.in a memo dated march,mark dioguardi,a lawyer for oneok,had noted letter from one or more chair would sink southern union.on that date,irvin and rose were in san francisco.their trip was unknown to the acc,and their expenses were not charged to it.in san francisco they met with members and staff of the cpuc.according to harvey morris,who attended the meeting as counsel for the cpuc,irvin and rose together conducted a lobbying campaign for oneok.they presented the letter criticizing a union merger,stated that southern union would have to issue junk bonds to finance the merger,and added that southern union ratio would become.the meeting began and ended with irvin and rose urging the cpuc to send the letter to swg.everything said about southern union by the two arizonans was negative.
on march,irvin and rose traveled to reno,nevada and the following day met with judy sheldrew,the chair of the pucn.irvin introduced rose to talk about the swg merger proposals.rose told her that oneok was by far the superior candidate.irvin urged her to have the nevada commission issue the letter to swg that he had urged upon the cpuc.
on march,irvin and rose met with kenneth guinn,the governor of nevada and a former chairman of swg.they urged him,too,to send a negative letter to swg regarding southern union offer.governor guinn declined to do so but,instead,called the ceo of swg and advised him to read between the lines of the letter he would receive from irvin.the letter was faxed to swg by irvin on april,from his office at the acc.it was signed by him alone.
april was the same day the swg board was to meet to discuss the competing merger offers.after faxing his letter,irvin moved to rose home and from there called the ceo of swg.irvin told him that it was highly unlikely that a union merger would be approved by the acc and that the california commission was equally concerned about that proposal.this telephone call was and played to the board of swg.copies of the letter were distributed to the board.members of the board saw the regulators position as a big problem in the way of accepting southern union higher offer.
on april,fichera of psi and rose met with officials of oneok,who indicated their readiness to do business with psi.thereafter rose sent psi an amendment to their agreement of march.whereas the split of any customary m a advisory fee on the west merger gave only to rose,the amendment proposed the split of the advisory fee on an merger in this way to rose and to prudential up to million and to rose and to prudential for any fees in excess of million.rose proposal was formally accepted by psi in a contract signed by fichera and dated june.
on april,swg announced that it had rejected southern union offer.the press release of swg announced that its board believes that southern union would have a more protracted and difficult time in obtaining regulatory approvals,extending eighteen months or longer.swg went ahead with oneok.
rose guided oneok through the regulatory process and was congratulated by oneok for his help.oneok prepared a million debt offering to finance the merger with swg.psi was to be a manager of the underwriting.rose,however,did not collect his commission.shortly after southern union filed its complaint in this case in july,oneok canceled the offering.after southern union had conducted discovery in this case and in the course of it gained knowledge of psi agreement with rose on the fees he would earn,oneok withdrew entirely from the merger.
proceedings 
on july,southern union filed its complaint in this case.its second amended complaint,filed july,was the operative basis of the trial.before trial,on december,the district court dismissed the rico claims on the ground that they constituted a securities fraud claim and were therefore barred by the private securities litigation reform act of,c.
in,the multiple defendants moved for summary judgment.on january,the district court entered a comprehensive order disposing of these motions.we note the relevant rulings.granted was a motion to deny southern union the right to present a jury with evidence of its lost profits.denied was a motion for summary judgment by jack rose.the court observed that rose had invoked his privilege against as to the matters at issue and that his invocation of the privilege in a civil suit left the free to draw adverse inferences against him.denied was a motion for summary judgment by oneok,the court ruling that oneok characterization of the evidentiary record is demonstrably false.after discovery and various motions,on october,a jury of nine was selected,sworn,and empaneled.
prior to trial,an incident occurred that made a sharp impression on the district court and is best presented in the judge own words as she reviewed irvin motion for remittitur irvin participated in a scheme to impede the jury search for truth at trial.the scheme involved his wife,carol,fabricating notes of a telephone call of july,between herself and jack rose in the conversation rose appeared to exculpate irvin from any charge of wrongdoing.irvin gave the notes to his counsel,who presented them to the court.when counsel for southern union obtained the opportunity for its forensic examiner to inspect the notes,irvin counsel admitted that the notes were not contemporaneous with the telephone call but had just recently been written he withdrew his proffer of the notes.southern union then moved to admit the notes as evidence of irvin intentional fabrication of evidence.the court granted the motion.
after nearly two months of trial,the jury returned its verdict.the subsequent proceedings and the appeals have already been noted.
evidence supporting the verdict.irvin continues to argue that he is entitled to jnov because southern union failed to show that his efforts caused swg to reject its offer.he cites the testimony of a pair of swg officers who had doubts about southern union offer,but each of these witnesses tied their doubts to difficulties the regulators might raise.some members of swg board did not think irvin interventions significant.others did.that adverse inferences could be drawn against rose has already been observed.some of the strongest evidence from which the jury could draw inferences was the value oneok placed on rose services and relationship with irvin as well as rose own high evaluation of his help after the april,meeting of the swg board.enough evidence was presented to the jury for it to find that irvin caused at least of the harm to southern union by interfering with its contractual relations his interference was a significant cause.caudle bristow optical,cir as amended citing wagenseller scottsdale mem l.
irvin scope of authority defense.under arizona law,a statute regulates claims against public employees such as irvin.a.it applies if the suit is against the employee in his public capacity and is directed to cases making claims against the employee public employer.id.
irvin has found a decision of an intermediate arizona court that he contends fits his case 
i t is unnecessary for the claimant to sue the employer or file a notice of claim against either the individual public employee or the employer.instead,in such a case the issue of whether the defendant was acting within the course and scope of his employment remains to be decided by the trier of fact,and a plaintiff who fails to file a notice of claim does so at his own risk.the parties have not reached the point in the proceeding at which it is appropriate to raise and decide the question whether the acts were done in the scope of crum employment,but it is clear that it can not be resolved on a motion to dismiss.in any event,if the plaintiff does not file a notice,and the finder of fact concludes that the defendant was acting within the course and scope of his employment,the plaintiff can not have judgment against the defendant.
crum super.
a majority of this court holds that,under the rule stated in crum,irvin was entitled to have the jury consider his defense that his actions were within the scope of his duties as a member of the acc.despite this holding,a different majority concludes that the instructional error was harmless.assessing punitive damages of million against him,the jury provided a strong indication that it disbelieved irvin account of what he was up to.larez holcomb,cir.southern union view of the facts,accepted by the jury,was that irvin acts were connected with his official duties only as much as a judge accepting a bribe to decide a case in favor of the briber would be engaging in conduct connected to his duty as a judge.large punitives are evidence that an erroneous jury instruction was harmless.see swinton potomac,cir,cert.denied,d.in short,the award here makes it quite plain that the jury would have come to the same conclusion even if the crum instruction had been given.lambert ackerley,cir en banc,cert.denied,d.
the punitive damages.sixty million dollars in punitives after an award of compensatory damages against irvin of the ratio of over to immediately commands our attention.it can not survive the constitutional scrutiny required by the supreme court.state farm mut.auto.ins.campbell,d.
no bright line has been set beyond which punitives may not go.id.at.but we have been reminded that,under established principles,few awards exceeding a single digit ratio to a significant degree will satisfy due process.id.even an award more than four times the amount of compensatory damages might be close to the line of constitutional impropriety.id.history points to double,triple,or quadruple punitives these ratios are instructive.id.in the light of these admonitions and suggested boundaries,we review the jury award and the judge ruling sustaining it.
the most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant conduct.id.at.quoting bmw of north america,gore,d.briefed on campbell,the district court properly looked first at this factor.the court found irvin conduct to be marked by two factors repeated actions and harm caused by intentional trickery and deceit.irvin,the court stated,had abused his powers as a commissioner in favor of the private interests of a specific utility company,oneok,and his personal interests harm to southern union was inflicted by irvin by his letter and his telephone call to the april,board meeting of swg and by his instigation of governor guinn call.this actual harm was the culmination of two months of planning and activity directed to blocking the proposed southern union merger.
irvin purposeful persistence in this effort,the district court found,was matched by his efforts at concealment.as far as possible,his activities to block the merger were kept from his fellow commissioners,and,the court added,afterwards he covered up his wrongdoing to ensure the outcome of the scheme.
when southern union challenged him and began litigation,irvin effort at concealment continued he persevered in hiding his wrongful acts throughout the trial and in particular while testifying in court before the jury.the court marked as particularly egregious irvin manufacture of fabricated notes of his wife telephone conversation with rose,which irvin persuaded his counsel paid for him by the state of arizona to present as genuine to the court.the court found this intentional fabrication of evidence by irvin to show his consciousness of guilt and to go to the reprehensibility of his conduct.
the district court noted that neither campbell nor gore considered reprehensible conduct by a public official.the court noted that significant consideration must be given to the nature of the public trust embodied in the public office the official held.the court noted the broad power of the acc,which the supreme court of arizona said was treated as a fourth branch of government in arizona.polaris int l metals acc.
the court turned to the award of punitives in civil rights cases under and where the ratio of punitives to actual damages far exceeded a single digit ratio.
indeed nominal damages had been held sufficient to support the award of punitives against a public officer.gill manuel,cir.in holding that municipalities are exempt fro
