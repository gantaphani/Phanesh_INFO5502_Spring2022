iowa realty company and first realty,collectively iowa realty appeal from the district court entry of a preliminary injunction against them in coldwell banker action for breach of contract and breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.coldwell banker complaint also claims that iowa realty violated federal antitrust laws,but the district court found that coldwell banker was not likely to succeed on these claims,and they are not a subject of this appeal.we hold that the district court correctly decided that coldwell banker is likely to prevail on the merits of the claim,erred as a matter of law when it concluded that coldwell banker is likely to prevail on the merits of the claim,and abused its discretion in ruling that coldwell banker will suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction.we therefore dissolve the preliminary injunction.
iowa realty is a real estate brokerage firm in des moines,iowa.it holds a license which entitles it to exclusive use,in the des moines area,of a software system known as mlxchange.mlxchange is a database management system used to store,search,and communicate data on residential real estate listings.coldwell banker decided that the mlxchange system was better than the system it was using,so it approached iowa realty and asked for a sublicense to use the software.after some discussion,iowa realty assented and entered into a contract with coldwell banker.the parties dispute the precise terms of the arrangement,but agree that under it iowa realty granted coldwell banker a sublicense to use the software and guaranteed coldwell banker access to at least some of the listings that it iowa realty would store on the mlxchange system coldwell banker promised,in return,to help fund a mailing advertisement and permit iowa realty to access at least some of the listings that it would store on the mlxchange software.
after the parties entered into this contract,iowa realty announced that it intended to launch a new home marketing program named passport plus.passport plus is an program,meaning that if a seller were to agree to sell his or her house pursuant to it,only iowa realty agents would be able to show and sell the house.in other words,the listing would be an one.iowa realty would offer incentives to sellers who join this program,to offset the fact that there could be a smaller pool of buyers.the benefit of the program for iowa realty would be that it would receive the whole of the sales commission when two brokerages are involved in the sale of a house in the des moines area,they usually split the commission.iowa realty would store information about passport plus listings on a part of the mlxchange that would be inaccessible to coldwell banker.
before iowa realty implemented the program,coldwell banker filed its complaint,which requests both preliminary and permanent injunctions.the complaint claims that implementation of the program would effect a breach of the contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the primary claim is that the program would violate the provisions of the contract that entitle coldwell banker to access data that iowa realty stores on the mlxsystem.the claim is that the passport plus program would deny coldwell banker the opportunity to receive the fruits of the contract,to wit,the opportunity to sell houses and share in the resulting sales commissions.iowa realty agreed not to initiate the program before the district court ruled on the request for a preliminary injunction.
the district court concluded that coldwell banker was likely to succeed on the merits of its contract and claims and suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction.it therefore issued a preliminary injunction.the court enjoined iowa realty from,among other things,denying coldwell banker access to information on the mlxchange database,actively offering or soliciting exclusive listing contracts,refusing to cooperate with coldwell banker in the selling and buying of homes,and refusing to split commissions in accordance with the established course of dealing.
we note that the court also initially enjoined iowa realty conduct with respect to certain third parties,but later entered an order that partially eliminated this feature of the injunction.iowa realty insists that the court modification order is invalid and that the original restrictions on conduct thus remain in place.but we need not resolve this issue because our holding renders it moot the allegedly injunctive obligations those involving the third parties relate to claims on which coldwell banker can not prevail.
a district court decision to grant a preliminary injunction will not be overturned absent a clearly erroneous factual determination,an error of law,or an abuse of discretion.taylor four seasons greetings,llc,cir.whether a preliminary injunction is appropriate depends on four considerations the probability that the movant will succeed on the merits the threat of irreparable harm to the movant should the court deny the injunction the balance between this harm and the harm that granting the injunction will cause to the other litigants and the public interest.dataphase,c l,cir en banc.a court should balance these considerations when deciding whether to issue an injunction.taylor,at.but an injunction can not issue if there is no chance of success on the merits,firefighters local union stotts,d,concurring am general daimlerchrysler,cir,and must be dissolved if the district court findings of fact do not support the conclusion that there is a threat of irreparable harm.dataphase,at.
iowa realty contends that the district court erred in deciding that coldwell banker was likely to succeed on the merits of either of its claims.we turn first to the claim.section of the contract provides,coldwell users will have access to all application data in mlxchange software,and states,iowa realty group hereby grants to coldwell a license to use the listing information that iowa realty group shall enter into the mlxchange software.as part of the passport plus program,iowa realty would store listing information on a part of the database that coldwell banker would not be able to access.

iowa realty argues that the contract does not address listings and that extrinsic evidence proves that it would not need to provide coldwell banker access to listings that it might store on the mlxchange system.according to iowa realty brief,the sections of the contract which the district court cited as supporting coldwell right to access listing information which are the sections cited in the first paragraph of this part of the opinion,along with another similar section are limitations on coldwell rights under the agreement,and not affirmative grants of access to information that the customer specifically directed to not be disseminated to other brokers.in light of this supposed contractual silence,iowa realty urges us to look to the parties course of performance and to industry standards as aids in interpreting this agreement.these two considerations,it maintains,scotch the idea that the contract requires it to share listing information,as both demonstrate that such information is not to be disseminated.
we conclude that the district court correctly held that coldwell banker is likely to prevail on the merits of its clai
