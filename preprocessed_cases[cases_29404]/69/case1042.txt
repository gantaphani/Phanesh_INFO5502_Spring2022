background 
the following summary of pertinent background facts is based upon the evidence presented at trial,viewed in a light favorable to the jury verdict.
in september of,sellers began working for the faa as an air traffic control specialist at lambert international airport in louis,missouri.in or about march of,she became the victim of joseph unwanted sexual advances at work.on may,joseph unexpectedly showed up at sellers house.she initially allowed him into the house,but ordered him to leave when he started making sexual advances.instead of leaving,joseph walked down a hallway and into her bedroom.sellers followed him and again ordered him to leave.joseph pinned her down on the bed,pulled her shirt up and her pants down,exposed his erect penis,and made physical contact with her body.by this time,sellers was screaming,and she hit joseph on the head.he got off of her,backed away,and then left the house.sellers initially did not mention the incident to anyone,including her,scott sellers.
joseph continued to harass sellers,repeatedly telephoning her and leaving notes in her locker at work.on one occasion,he pinched her on the buttocks in the workplace.she complained to,supervisors,and union officials that she was being sexually harassed,sometimes mentioning joseph by name.eventually,an internal investigation was ordered.faa supervisor willie moore interviewed joseph and,at the end of the interview,told joseph to stay away from sellers.afterward,a letter officially reprimanding moore for inadequately handling the matter hereinafter the moore reprimand letter was placed in moore personnel file.the moore reprimand letter states as one of the grounds for reprimand failure to assess the proper penalty when the facts are known and disciplinary action is warranted including acts of sexual harassment or other types of prohibited discrimination.appellant appendix at plaintiff trial exhibit.
at trial,over the objections of both joseph and the secretary,sellers was permitted to introduce the moore reprimand letter into evidence during her.four days after the moore reprimand letter was introduced,joseph requested that the letter be stricken from the record or,alternatively,that a limiting instruction be given.the district court denied both requests.
prior to joseph presentation of evidence,the district court,for scheduling purposes,requested the names of the witnesses he intended to call.joseph indicated that he intended to call,among other witnesses,a,valerie warren.sellers objected on the ground that warren name was not on the witness list that joseph had submitted to the district court before trial pursuant to the district court case management order and its local rules.the district court sustained sellers objection.
at the close of all the evidence,the district court submitted to the jury instructions and verdict forms which included separate instructions and separate verdict forms for seller assault and battery claims against joseph related to the incident that occurred at her house on may.joseph objected to the submission of the separate claims,arguing that the two should be merged into one cause of action.the district court overruled his objection.
the jury awarded sellers,among other sums,in compensatory damages and in punitive damages on the assault claim and in compensatory damages and in punitive damages on the battery claim,both based upon the may,incident.the jury also awarded sellers in compensatory damages and in punitive damages on a separate battery claim based upon the incident in which joseph pinched sellers on the buttocks in the workplace.because sellers had not specifically asked for punitive damages for the pinching incident,the district court vacated the corresponding punitive damages award,and entered judgment setting forth total damages awarded to sellers from joseph in the amount of.
after the entry of judgment,joseph filed a motion to order production of work records of plaintiff wendi ferguson sellers for march.on the same day,joseph file a motion for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial,pursuant to,asserting,among other grounds for relief,that the district court erred in submitting both the assault claim and the battery claim arising out of the same incident,abused its discretion in admitting the moore reprimand letter into evidence,and abused its discretion in disallowing the testimony of valerie warren in the same motion,joseph argued that sellers work records for march,constitute newly discovered evidence,entitling defendant joseph to a new trial under.b.upon review,the district court denied all of joseph motions.sellers mineta,memorandum and order.the district court filed an amended judgment,again setting forth total damages awarded sellers from joseph in the amount of.this appeal followed.
discussion 
evidentiary rulings 
we begin by addressing joseph challenges to the district court evidentiary rulings.we first consider joseph arguments related to the moore reprimand letter.as indicated above,the letter sets forth as one of the reasons for moore reprimand failure to assess the proper penalty when the facts are known and disciplinary action is warranted including acts of sexual harassment or other types of prohibited discrimination.joseph argues that the district court abused its discretion in failing to exclude this highly prejudicial letter under.and in denying his request for an instruction to the jury that the letter was relevant only to the claims against the secretary.moreover,he argues,the district court improperly commented upon the letter when it stated moore obviously made a finding that there was a basis for a claim joseph argues that this comment was improper because moore informal investigation lacked the most fundamental protections provided by the administrative procedure act,the due process clause,and fundamental fairness.brief for appellant at.joseph also suggests that the letter was improperly admitted because it was hearsay evidence offered for the truth of the statement that acts of sexual harassment had occurred.
we review both the district court admission of the moore reprimand letter and its denial of joseph request for a limiting instruction for an abuse of discretion.see,beach yellow freight system,cir admission of evidence reviewed for abuse of discretion united states kime,cir failure to give a requested instruction reviewed for abuse of discretion,cert.denied,d.the moore reprimand letter was relevant not only to sellers sexual harassment claim against the secretary,but also to sellers battery claim against joseph arising out of the pinching incident that occurred in the workplace.the moore reprimand letter was relevant to show,not that sexual harassment had actually taken place,but that the faa did not take adequate steps to respond to the problem and that sellers found the pinching incident to be offensive an issue which joseph contested at trial.as to the district court comment that moore obviously made a finding that there was a basis for a claim,we disagree that the jury reasonably could have inferred from it that moore had conducted a formal investigation.in any case,the district court instructed the jury several times that its comments were not evidence and should never be taken as an indication of what the verdict should be.in sum,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the moore reprimand letter into evidence or in denying joseph request for a limiting instruction.
joseph also argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying him the opportunity to call valerie warren as a witness because he had not included warren name on his pretrial witness list.joseph maintains that warren testimony would have been contrary to sellers testimony that she sellers avoided joseph whenever possible and that she and joseph did not have an affair.at trial,joseph attorney asserted warren testimony will concern sellers seeking john joseph,looking for him or calling for him or something like that and perhaps having seen them together.brief for appellant at citing trial transcript,vol.viii,at.joseph also argues that,even though warren was not on his pretrial witness list,the prospect of her testimony could not have surprised sellers because warren name was on both sellers and the secretary pretrial witness lists.in any event,joseph suggests,the more appropriate remedy would have been to grant a continuance,not to exclude warren testimony entirely.brief for appellant at citing black case,cir,cert.denied,d.
we review a district court exclusion of a witness not named in the pretrial list of witnesses for a clear abuse of discretion.marti city of maplewood,cir.the power of the trial court to exclude exhibits and witnesses not disclosed in compliance with its discovery and pretrial orders is essential to the judge control over the case.boardman national medical enterprises,cir quoting admiral theatre douglas theatre,cir.in assessing whether a clear abuse of discretion has occurred,we may consider a variety of factors,including,for example,the reason for the failure to list the witness,the possibility of surprise or prejudice to the party against whom the witness would testify,the extent to which allowing the witness to testify would disrupt the order and efficiency of the trial,and the importance of the witness testimony.see marti city of maplewood,at setting forth factors in two different tests used by this court.
in the present case,joseph provided no justification for failing to include warren on his pretrial witness list,nor did he suggest any reason why sellers should have expected warren to testify on his behalf.had warren been identified on joseph witness list,sellers might have taken additional steps to prepare for her testimony,including,for example,taking her deposition.warren anticipated testimony,as described at trial by joseph attorney,that sellers had looked for joseph and perhaps that the two had been seen together,even if true,would not necessarily disprove or even undermine sellers allegations against joseph.finally,as to the suggestion that a continuance would have been appropriate,it does not appear that joseph ever asked for a continuance.even if he had,the district court could properly have denied the request.the issue arose late in the trial,at a point where a continuance would undoubtedly have been disruptive to the proceedings and everyone involved.the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow warren to testify on joseph behalf.
submission of assault and battery claims 
we next turn to the legal issues involved in the district court submission of both the assault claim and the battery claim arising out of the single confrontation at sellers house on may.as indicated above,the district court instructed the jury and provided the jury with a separate verdict form for each of these two claims.joseph timely objected to the submission of both claims,and he renewed the objection in his motion for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial.the jury awarded compensatory damages and punitive damages on each claim,for a total of of damages arising out of the one incident.the district court upheld the verdict,explaining as follows 
t he undersigned is persuaded by plaintiff argument that under missouri law,two causes of action exist for the tort of assault and the tort of battery,and the missouri approved instructions provide separate instructions as to each with identifiable separate elements.compare mai with ed.in the absence of any authority to the contrary defendant has failed to dissuade the court from its previous ruling that submitting assault and battery to the jury as separate claims is not error.
sellers mineta,slip op.at.
on appeal,joseph again argues that the district court erred as a matter of missouri law by submitting the two separate assault and battery claims to the jury where they are based upon the same events of may.he maintains that the general principle in missouri is that only one cause of action exists for a single transaction.brief for appellant at.in support,he cites dozens of cases in which a single tort claim was submitted to the jury for a single transaction or set of events,though arguably there could have been two or more claims submitted.see id.at.joseph states 
a search of the cases appearing under the topic assault and battery in the missouri digest reveals over fifty civil cases decided in the last years wherein assault,assault and battery,or battery has been submitted to the jury.not a single case has been found where separate counts have been submitted for assault and battery involving the same incident or transaction.put another way,not a single case has been found submitting both mai and mai.
id.at.joseph thus continues to support her verdict,sellers needs to show that there is some authority in missouri for submitting both mai and for the same event or transaction.id.at.
in response,sellers emphasizes that assault and battery are distinct causes of action with different elements of proof,and they do not necessarily rely on the same set of facts.an assault involves an unlawful attempt to injure another,with the apparent present ability to carry out that attempt,and circumstances creating a fear of imminent harm.battery involves intentional offensive contact.sellers contends that,while every battery includes an assault,a plaintiff may recover for a battery and for a separate assault arising out of the same series of events.in the present case,she argues,the events of may,occurred as a series of separate events.in this series of separate events,she explains,joseph engaged in offensive contact with plaintiff without her consent,which constituted a battery,and he also caused plaintiff to be in apprehension of further offensive contact or bodily harm,which constituted the assault.brief for appellee at.
we decide questions of state law de novo.salve regina college russell,d.our responsibility is to determine what the missouri supreme court decision would be in light of that court pertinent decisions and other sources of missouri law.see,union pacific reilly,cir our interpretation of minnesota law must comport with pertinent decisions of the minnesota supreme court,but,if none are available,we look to related state court precedents,analogous decisions,considered dicta,and other reliable sources in an effort to determine what the minnesota supreme court decision would be.
we begin by considering whether,under missouri law,the district court could submit to the jury both sellers battery claim and her assault claim arising out of the same events of may.on this question,stafford muster,en banc stafford,cited by neither joseph nor sellers,is instructive.in stafford,the plaintiff alleged several intentional tort claims against individuals involved in a series of actions taken against her,including two separate imprisonments for contempt of court,in connection with a custody dispute over her husband child from a previous marriage.the missouri supreme court noted that the plaintiff claims
