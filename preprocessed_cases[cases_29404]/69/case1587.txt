by a jury verdict,the united states district court for the eastern district of texas found that the directv group,directv holdings,llc,directv enterprises,llc,directv operations,llc,and directv,collectively directv had infringed patent the patent,assigned to finisar corporation finisar.finding directv infringement to have been willful,the jury awarded million in reasonable royalty damages.the district court sustained the jury verdict,except with respect to induced and contributory infringement,denied finisar request for injunctive relief,imposed a compulsory license,and awarded finisar million in enhanced damages.finisar directv group,wl.july,final judgment.the district court also denied directv motions for judgment as a matter of law jmol or a new trial.finisar directv group,case,wl,jmol order.
because the district court incorrectly construed a vital term featured prominently in each asserted claim,this court vacates the verdict of infringement.furthermore,the district court erred in ruling that the prior art did not anticipate claim.this error also infects the scope of the prior art for assessing the validity of the rest of the claims.therefore,this court remands for a new trial on both infringement and validity of claims,and.
the patent,issued on april,from an application filed on november,claims systems and methods for scheduling transmission of database tiers upon specific demand or at specific times and rates of repetition.the patent describes an information broadcasting system that gives subscribers access to video and audio programs through satellite or cable links.see patent,abstract.under the patented system,subscribers do not need to request the most popular and trendy movies,for example,or other programs.instead the system anticipates likely more popular requests and broadcasts those programs to users on an announced schedule at regular intervals.thus,most of the interaction between the user and the information server is unidirectional,meaning that the server sends most of the data to the subscriber without even receiving a request.
for scheduled transmissions,those not responsive to a specific user request,the system sends more popular data more frequently.to make this work,the system divides the information database into different tiers based on likely popularity.then the system broadcasts each tier of data at a particular repetition rate.see.thus,the system arranges all information in the database in a hierarchical structure.see.in this regard,the specification analogizes the claimed invention to accessing information in a large library 
it is important to note that while a user has access to perhaps a terabtye,or even terabytes or more,of data,the total amount of data that systems in accordance with the present invention system can transmit in any one day is much more limited,as will be described below.this is not unlike visiting the main library of a major university,such as yale or harvard university,having stacks containing several million volumes of books.having access to all those books every single day does not means sic that a user can receive them all in one day,nor does it mean that all the users can receive all the books in a single day.nevertheless,each particular book file or program is available on relatively short notice,and having access to such a large collection of books data is still very useful.
the specification also compares the claimed invention to other information distribution systems,like books and cds,estimating that the system saves vast amounts in distribution costs by avoiding shipment of each individual copy of the desired data.see.
directv began offering satellite broadcasting in the united states in.a directv subscriber accesses the broadcasting system through a small antenna generally a small satellite dish affixed to the exterior of a subscriber home and its associated electronics,along with a box,which attaches to the subscriber television set.directv generally broadcasts four types of information turnaround programming,playback programming,conditional access information,and program guide information.
turnaround programming constitutes the bulk of directv broadcasts.this category of programming or turns around content from other television channels like cnn,comedy central,espn,and animal planet,to name a few.the owners of these channels,rather than directv,schedule the airing of their programs.as discussed below with respect to infringement,the parties dispute the degree to which directv controls,or programs,the turnaround programming.a different company,tribune media services,collects scheduling information from the various channels.directv adopts the tribune schedule.
as noted above,directv also offers playback programming,which comprises movies and the like.directv itself schedules the broadcast of playback programming.directv broadcasts also include conditional access information,which allows an authorized subscriber to pay for and receive selected programs.directv controls access to this information by broadcasting it in an encrypted format.finally,directv broadcasts also include an electronic program guide,which provides the user with information about current and upcoming programs on the various channels.
finisar sued directv for infringement of the patent,initially asserting that directv direct broadcast satellite system infringed fifteen of the patent total claims.after a markman hearing and a claim construction order,finisar directv group,d markman order,the district court concluded on summary judgment that seven of the asserted claims claims,and,all claims were invalid for indefiniteness.finisar directv group,case,wl.may,invalidity order.before trial,finisar dropped its allegation of infringement of one claim claim.
a jury heard evidence on infringement of the remaining seven asserted claims claims,and.the jury concluded that directv infringed all seven claims directly and by inducement and contribution.finding directv infringement to have been willful,the jury awarded million in reasonable royalty damages.the district court sustained the jury verdict,except with respect to induced and contributory infringement,denied finisar request for injunctive relief,imposed a compulsory license,and awarded million in enhanced damages.final judgment.the district court also denied directv motions for jmol or a new trial.jmol order.
between directv appeal and finisar,this court confronts a variety of issues.directv appeal challenges the district court construction of two claim terms information database and downloading into a memory storage device and the jury findings of literal infringement,validity novelty and,and willfulness.finisar the district court denial of finisar motion for a permanent injunction,imposition of a compulsory license at a rate of per box,and grant of summary judgment of invalidity on claims,and as indefinite.
the district court denied directv motions for jmol or a new trial on,invalidity,and.on the motions for jmol or a new trial,this court applies the law of the regional circuit,in this case the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit.see harris ericsson,jmol imonex,munzprufer dietmar trenner gmbh,new trial.our sister circuit reviews a jmol motion without deference.cambridge toxicology group,exnicios,cir.jmol is appropriate only when a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue.id.quoting.a.to this end,the fifth circuit describes appellate review of a jmol denial as a determination whether the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of one party that the court concludes that reasonable jurors could not arrive at a contrary verdict.harris,at quoting bellows amoco oil,cir.in contrast,a district court denial of a motion for a new trial is reviewed for abuse of discretion.industrias magromer cueros y pieles.bayou furs,cir.
claim construction 
this court reviews claim construction without deference.cybor fas,en banc.generally this court gives claim terms their ordinary and customary meanings,according to the customary understanding of an artisan of ordinary skill at the time of the invention.see phillips awh,en banc.and the person of ordinary skill in the art is deemed to read the claim term not only in the context of the particular claim in which the disputed term appears,but in the context of the entire patent,including the specification.id.at.when construing claims,the claims and the rest of the patent,along with the patent prosecution history together,the intrinsic evidence of the meaning of the claims are the primary resources while helpful,extrinsic sources like dictionaries and expert testimony can not overcome more persuasive intrinsic evidence.see id.at.
in this instance,the united states district court for the eastern district of texas was not the only trial court to have construed the claims of the patent,including the two terms disputed on appeal.the united states district court for the northern district of california issued a markman order in a declaratory judgment action filed by comcast cable communications comcast against finisar for patent.comcast cable commc ns finisar,no.c,wl,dist.lexis,comcast markman order.given the importance of uniformity in the treatment of a given patent,markman westview instruments,d,this court would be remiss to overlook another district court construction of the same claim terms in the same patent as part of this separate appeal.in the interest of uniformity and correctness,this court consults the claim analysis of different district courts on the identical terms in the context of the same patent.here,the northern district of california efforts in the comcast case are particularly helpful because that court repeatedly referred back to the eastern district of texas subjects of this appeal.see,comcast markman order,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
directv appeals the district court construction of two terms,information database and downloading into a memory storage device.independent claim shows these terms in context 
an information transmission method comprising the steps of 
storing an information database on one or more memory devices 
generating and storing on said memory devices a hierarchically arranged set of indices for referencing data in said information database,including distinct indices for referencing distinct portions thereof,and embedding said indices in said information database 
scheduling transmission of selected portions of said information database,including assigning each selected portion of said information database one or more scheduled transmission times 
transmitting a stream of data packets containing said selected portions of said information database in accordance with said scheduled transmission times 
said scheduling step including dividing said selected portions of said information database into a prioritized set of tiers,wherein all the selected portions of said information database in each tier are transmitted at a corresponding repetition rate,wherein the repetition rate for higher priority tiers is higher than the repetition rate for lower priority tiers 
receiving said transmitted stream of data packets at subscriber stations 
at each subscriber stations,storing filter data corresponding to a subset of said indices,said filter data specifying a set of requested data packets which comprises a subset of said transmitted data packets and 
at each subscriber station,downloading into a memory storage device those of said received data packets which match said specified set of requested data packets.
patent,emphases added.
information database 
the eastern district of texas construed information database to mean a collection of computerized information which can be accessed.markman order,d at.the northern district of california construed this term somewhat differently,as a dynamic,structured collection of digitized data capable of being held in computer storage.comcast markman order,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
the construction reached by the district court in this case is unjustifiably broad because the information database as claimed requires searchability and retrievability beyond mere accessibility.in isolation,the term information database suggests a very broad coverage.in context,however,this claim term repeatedly appears within a framework that requires referencing,embedding,assigning,and transmitting portions of the database.these database functions and capabilities,in turn,presuppose searchability and retrievability.
beyond the context of the claim language,the patent specification supports this narrower reading of the term.as discussed,the specification analogizes the invention to a large library.this analogy suggests that a user can quickly obtain specific data from a large database.indeed,the specification confirms that the user has reasonably quick access to all the contents of the large database,but the amount of data available to a given library at any given time is much more limited,allowing the user to borrow a particular book file or program on relatively short notice.patent.once again,the specification underscores the searchability and retrievability of the database.this court emphasizes that its construction does not necessarily entail the searching available with electronic legal research systems lexisnexis or westlaw.the district court expressed some concerns on this point.see markman order,d at for example,common legal research systems allow very narrow searches,such as by case name,by judge name,and even by a particular word.in contrast,some of the data in the system can only be referenced in broader terms,such as a search for a movie by title,but not necessarily by words used in a movie or group of movies.and in the comcast case,the northern district of california did not require a database of this sort.comcast markman order,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.rather,the northern district observed that claim does not indicate any searchability beyond the navigability implied by the index itself,and that the requests are based on the system of indices.id.
the hierarchical indices recited later in the claims for referencing data in the information database actually confirm,rather than refute,that the claimed method must include search and retrieval features.such hierarchical indices facilitate the search and retrieval of data from the information database.thus the claims envision a more specific information database than provided by the district court construction.to return to the book analogy,an index at the back of a book correlates specific terms or concepts to the pages where they appear in the main text of the book by page number.such an index would have little or no value if the pages of the main text were not numbered or arranged sequentially.
the district court rejected the analogy of an index found at the back of a book referring to sequentially ordered pages because an index can be a single data item.markman order,d at.specifically,the district court cited the following passage from the specification indices each of which contains a packet id plus additional information form a single hierarchical structure that encompasses the entire information database.patent.even if this passage may suggest that the patent allows for the possibility that one data item can refer to the entire information database,the next sentence specifically requires a plurality of indices m ore specifically,software generates a hierarchical set of indices referencing all the data in the information database.thus according to the patent,the index is composed of a hierarchical set of indices that,taken together,reference all the data in the information database.continuing with the library analogy,the patent hierarchical set of indices is akin to a card catalog system,and the information database is like a library collection of books.to make the card catalog system relevant,the library must shelve the books according to some order,like the dewey decimal or library of congress systems.this court can not envision carefully organizing each book card catalog records,but then randomly heaping the books themselves into an inaccessible pile in the center of the library rather than shelving them by call number.likewise,the information database of the asserted claims must include search and retrieval features at least commensurate with the navigability implied by the index itself,as the northern district of california put it.this court therefore construes information database as used in the patent as a collection of computerized information which can be accessed and searched,and from which selected information can be retrieved,and where the search and retrieval capabilities are at least as specific as those of the hierarchically arranged set of indices.
downloading into a memory storage device 
the district court construed the downloading step in claim downloading into a memory storage device those of said received data packets which match said specified set of requested data packets to mean the data filter transfers into a memory storage device the data packets specified in the filter data.markman order,d at.in contrast,the northern district of california construed downloading into a memory storage device as transferring the desired data into a device capable of saving it for later access.comcast markman order,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
this court perceives that downloading into a memory storage device requires more than the mere transfer of data,but retention of data as well.thus the claims require a downloading that preserves the data for later use or retrieval of the transferred data.once again,the language of the claims,in context,specifies that the data downloads into a memory storage device.thus,the claim itself associates downloading with memory,retention,and preservation.indeed the northern district of california construed the term to require capacity for later access.
the patent specification supports this reading.in its description,the specification refers to the invention as an alternative to cds or paper publications.patent.both of these alternative forms entail preservation and retention of the downloaded or published data.similarly,the library analogy supports this court reading.when patrons borrow a book,they have access to the entire work until they return it to the library they could flip back and forth or reread portions at will,rather than only reading straight through the book at a predetermined time.
in this instance,the doctrine of claim differentiation also bolsters this court interpretation.indeed the northern district of california relied in part on the doctrine of claim differentiation to arrive at its construction of downloading into a memory storage device.comcast markman order,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.specifically,the comcast court compared claim,recited above,with claim,which further modifies the receiving and downloading steps of claim 
the information transmission method of claim,said receiving and downloading steps including 
at each subscriber stations,temporarily storing received data packets in a buffer,storing a filter list comprising said filter data referencing said specified set of requested data packets,comparing said data packets temporarily stored in said buffer with said filter data and then forwarding those data packets in said buffer which match said filter data to a predefined destination 
whereby each subscriber station receives all transmitted data packets but forwards only requested data packets to said predefined destination.
patent,emphases added.reasoning that the predefined destination recited at the end of claim must be a memory storage device by comparing claim to claim,the northern district of california noted that the use of the buffer in claim was not as a memory storage device.rather,it was a refinement on the filtering step.comcast markman order,wl,at,dist.lexis,at emphasis in original.turning to the specification consistently separate references to the filtering step and the downloading step,the northern district of california observed that s torage need not be permanent,but being able to view content at a time after it has been downloaded is a key feature of this invention,id.at,dist.lexis,at,and that the buffer used in the filter step will not do double duty as the storage memory device for the downloading step,id.at,dist.lexis,at.for all of the reasons outlined above,this court agrees.as such,this court adopts the northern district of california construction of downloading into a memory storage device as transferring the desired data into a device capable of saving it for later access.
this court observes that fleeting or transient retention does not qualify as the kind of downloading defined by these claims.the specification at one point describes the download ing of data corresponding to anticipated information requests into a smart cache,which is used as a temporary buffer,and which is overwritten upon receipt of new information in a later request.patent.this discussion of the smart cache in column is thus further evidence that downloading requires capacity for data retention,because only retained data could be used to service the user future information requests.also,the specification describes that selected data from the smart cache can be moved to other areas of the user hard disk,while unused data from the smart cache are overwritten with new data.patent.furthermore,column of the patent distinguishes fairly clearly between buffering and downloading the data packets received from the satellite are stored in a ring buffer,which in turn may vary in size,depending on the maximum possible delay before a selected packet is downloaded onto the subscriber host computer.thus,downloading as used in the patent requires something more than just transient retention of data.
literal infringement 
literal infringement is a question of fact,reviewed for substantial evidence when tried to a jury.acco brands,aba locks mfrs.where an infringement verdict relies on incorrect construction of the disputed claim terms,this court may grant jmol or order a new trial to correct the error,depending on the degree of difference between the incorrect construction and the correct construction.if no reasonable jury could have found infringement under the proper claim construction,this court may reverse a district court denial of jmol without remand.see harris,at.here,directv argues that it does not infringe under the proper construction of information database and downloading into a memory storage device.also,without disputing the district court construction of any particular additional term,directv asserts that its system does not satisfy the scheduling step recited in the asserted claims.
information database 
because the district court construed information database too broadly,this court must evaluate the effects of this erroneous construction on the jury infringement verdict,through which the jury necessarily concluded that directv system met the information database limitation.in this instance,this court reversal of the district court construction has no discernible effect on the jury verdict,because the difference between the correct construction of information database and the one relied upon by the jury depends on the specificity of the hierarchically arranged set of indices.because directv does not appeal the district court construction of set of indices for referencing data in said information database or hierarchically arranged set of indices,nor does directv dispute the jury implicit finding that that directv system met these limitations as part of arriving at its infringement verdict,this court considers the district court erroneous construction of information database as harmless.
downloading into a memory storage device 
this court construction of downloading into a memory storage device as transferring the desired data into a device capable of saving it for later access is markedly different than the construction used by the jury in its infringement inquiry.the instruction followed by the jury did not require this capacity for retention,so the jury verdict of infringement can not necessarily be said to have been predicated on a finding that directv system included it.moreover,the meaning of downloading necessarily informs the treatment of the data in the memory storage device.as a result,the jury infringement verdict must be vacated.
to be more specific,directv broadcasts consist of four types of data turnaround programming,playback programming,conditional access information,and the electronic program guide,as described above.the record shows that some directv subscribers use boxes that also function as digital video recorders dvrs dvr boxes,while others use standard boxes.dvrs allow users to select and record particular programs for later use,as well as to pause and play back live video.the four broadcast data types and two box types thus represent two different ways to subdivide directv service.the record and briefs on appeal are insufficient to accurately sort out these overlapping subsets with respect to the downloading limitation,especially in light of the new construction,thus necessitating remand.
one or more scheduled transmission times 
the claims also require the infringer to assign one or more scheduled transmission times.this limitation comes from the scheduling step,the third step in claim.this step recites 
scheduling transmission of selected portions of said information database,including assigning each selected portion of said information database one or more scheduled transmission times 
patent.directv alleges that the district court interpreted selected portions of the information database as each part of the information database selected for transmission.to the contrary,the district court construed dividing said selected portions of said information database into a prioritized set of tiers,wherein all the selected portions of said information database in each tier are transmitted at a corresponding repetition rate to mean placing each part of the information database selected for transmission into one or more groups of information,and transmitting each group at a chosen repetition rate.markman order,d at.
relying on its interpretation of the district court construction of each in the dividing step to inform the use of each in the scheduling step,or alternately on the plain meaning of each,directv argues that finisar had to prove that the selected portions of directv database it identified are each assigned a scheduled transmission time.the record shows that only of directv programming its data selected for transmission comprises playback programming that fits within this meaning of scheduled.the other is turnaround programming,received from content providers like cnn,espn,and others.directv argues,inter alia,that it does not infringe because these third parties schedule the programming,independently of directv.
nonetheless,even under directv interpretation of the district court construction,claim does not require scheduling for all transmitted information.rather the claim specifies scheduling for each part of the information database selected for transmission.thus the claim leaves room for transmission of other data in other,ways because claim is written using an format,using the transitional term comprising.claim simply does not require scheduling for all transmissions from the information database,but only for some,selected,portions.because both parties agree that directv assigns scheduled transmission times to its playback programming,comprising about of its content,the jury had substantial evidence to conclude that directv accused system meets the scheduling step of the asserted claims.
anticipation 
anticipation is a question of fact,reviewed for substantial evidence when tried to a jury,microsoft.if the claimed invention was described in a printed publication either before the date of invention,a,or more than one year before the patent application was filed,b,then that prior art anticipates the patent.although refers to the invention generally,the anticipation inquiry proceeds on a basis.see hakim cannon avent group,plc.to anticipate a claim,a single prior art reference must expressly or inherently disclose each claim limitation.celeritas,rockwell int l.but disclosure of each element is not quite court has long held that a nticipation requires the presence in a single prior art disclosure of all elements of a claimed invention arranged as in the claim.connell sears,roebuck,citing soundscriber united states,emphasis added.
in this case,the prior art alleged to anticipate is the architecture of videotex systems videotex architecture,a textbook by jan gecsei.this reference describes videotex as a medium based on a blend of television,communications,and computer technologies.id.at.the reference further notes that videotex is not a procedure based on some glamorous breakthrough its originality is rather in its combination of existing technologies.id.at.
with respect to claim,finisar expert,doug eaton,testified at trial that videotex architecture did not teach the scheduling,transmitting,and dividing steps 
scheduling transmission of selected portions of said information database,including assigning each selected portion of said information database one or more scheduled transmission times 
transmitting a stream of data packets containing said selected portions of said information database in accordance with said scheduled transmission times 
said scheduling step including dividing said selected portions of said information database into a prioritized set of tiers,wherein all the selected portions of said information database in each tier are transmitted at a corresponding repetition rate,wherein the repetition rate for higher priority tiers is higher than the repetition rate for lower priority tiers 
patent.the reference thus discloses the division of information into tiers,the transmission of information,and the scheduling of transmissions.the question on appeal,however,focuses on the interrelationships between these elements as claimed in claim.for instance,the claim requires dividing said selected portions of said information database into a prioritized set of tiers.therefore,to anticipate,a reference must disclose division of the portions of the database into tiers and further assignment of scheduled transmission times to the selected portions within the tiers.
to check for anticipation,this court examines the videotex architecture reference in some detail.in a section entitled transmission sequence in chapter,databases for videotex,the reference explains 
and reception can be mixed by controlling the repetition rate of transmitted pages.a few hundred pages of general interest can be repeated in a short cycle,whereas less important or less frequently updated pages are inserted in hourly or even daily intervals into specific slots in the cycle,or according to a predetermined schedule.this permits for the dissemination of very large amounts of data.
videotex architecture at emphasis added.this passage discloses two tiers with two corresponding repetition rates.still the very specific requirements of anticipation demand a further inquiry.particularly,this court must consider whether the jury could have reasonably concluded that this passage does not disclose assignment of scheduled transmission times to the pages in both tiers.because or according to a predetermined schedule appears at the end of the sentence and after a comma,this court must ask whether the jury could have reasonably construed this phrase as an alternative only for the less important or less frequently updated pages,rather than both tiers of pages mentioned in the preceding clauses.id.at.
although this reading of the reference seems a stretch even at first blush,this court discussed an analogous situation in anhydrides chemicals,united states.in that case,this court used general principles of english grammar for the proposition that r eferential and qualifying words and phrases,where no contrary intention appears,refer solely to the last antecedent,which consists of the last word,phrase,or clause that can be made an antecedent without impairing the meaning of the sentence for purposes of statutory construction.id.quoting dallas sands,sutherland statutory construction ed emphasis added.thus,this court has addressed this grammatical guideline referred to as the doctrine of the last antecedent.in anhydrides,a case without a contrary intention in the passage at issue,this court construed the qualifying
