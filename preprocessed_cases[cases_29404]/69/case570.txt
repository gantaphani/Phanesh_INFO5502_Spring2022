background 
nightingale is in the business of providing oxygen tanks and other medical equipment to homebound patients.in february of,arismendez began working as a customer service representative for nightingale at its mcallen branch.mccune was the regional manager in charge of operations in texas.from the time arismendez began working in until february,the mcallen branch operated without a branch manager.during that period,arismendez often reported to chris cruz,the corpus christi branch manager.
in november,arismendez discovered she was pregnant with her third child.she then discussed maternity leave with james goldstein,nightingale area manager for south texas.veronica vela was hired as the mcallen branch manager in february of.
arismendez began experiencing lower abdominal pain and,on march,saw her physician,who prescribed bedrest and signed a release that excused her from work until her next appointment on april.arismendez husband delivered the note to vela at the office.mccune granted arismendez a leave of absence until april.during this time,arismendez stayed at her home in mcallen.arismendez called vela on a daily basis for the first week of leave to assist with any questions about her work.arismendez also asked vela about the disability policy.pursuant to this conversation,jesus sanchez,arismendez,brought a disability form to arismendez.arismendez physician completed the disability form on april.the doctor restricted arismendez physical activity until april.vela instructed arismendez husband to send the completed form directly to the corporate headquarters,and he complied with her instructions.
on april,arismendez had another doctor appointment.her physician ordered two additional weeks of bedrest and signed another release that excused her from work until april.once again,her husband delivered the doctor note to vela at the office.vela,however,claims that she did not receive this note.during this period of leave,arismendez husband was away from home working on a job site,and arismendez stayed at her mother home in mexico to obtain help caring for her two young children.her mother home did not have a telephone but arismendez called the office at least two times when vela was out.during one of the calls,arismendez heard sanchez radio vela and ask if she needed anything from arismendez.arismendez told sanchez that she could not be reached by phone because she was staying with her mother in reynosa,and sanchez relayed that information to vela.
on april,arismendez had a doctor appointment,during which he ordered fifteen more days of bedrest and signed another work release.arismendez attempted to deliver the doctor note to vela at the office.vela refused to accept the note and told her she had been terminated several weeks ago.the employee separation report was signed by vela as the supervisor and dated april.the report listed the reasons for the involuntary separation were excessive sick leave job abandonment.vela also told arismendez that although vela knew it was illegal to fire her because she was pregnant,vela had a business to run and could not take having a pregnant woman in the office.
on may,arismendez brought a pregnancy discrimination and wrongful termination suit against nightingale in texas state court.nightingale removed it to federal district court.the jury found in favor of arismendez,awarding in back pay damages,in compensatory damages,and in punitive damages.nightingale objected to the entry of judgment on the plaintiff motion,asserting a texas statutory cap on punitive damages.the district court reduced the punitive damage award to pursuant to the statutory cap.nightingale subsequently renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law,and the district court granted the motion,entering judgment in favor of nightingale.arismendez now appeals.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.sobley southern natural gas,cir.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate if there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.a.this court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,and it may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.reeves sanderson plumbing,d.additionally,this court should disregard evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe.laxton gap,cir citing russell mckinney hosp.venture,cir.we must give credence to evidence supporting the moving party that is uncontradicted and unimpeached if that evidence comes from disinterested witnesses.id.citing wallace methodist hosp,cir.there must be more than a mere scintilla of evidence in the record to prevent judgment as a matter of law in favor of the movant.id.
discrimination 
arismendez brought suit pursuant to the tchra,which prohibits an employer from,among other things,discharging an employee because of her gender.ann.section provides that a n employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of sex the employer discharges an individual,or discriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection with privileges of employment.the tchra further explains that sex discrimination includes discrimination because of or on the basis of pregnancy.a.
a stated purpose of the tchra is to provide for the execution of the policies of title vii of the civil rights act of.see also quantum chem.toennies.accordingly,analogous federal statutes and the cases interpreting them guide the reading of the statute.pineda united parcel,cir quoting quantum,at.however,the tchra and title vii differ in their required proof of the employer motivation for the unlawful employment practice.under the texas statute,to establish an unlawful employment practice,arismendez need only prove that discrimination was a motivating factor in the employer decision,quantum,at,rather than a but for cause as title vii requires pineda,at.however,if an employer demonstrates that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor,then a court may grant declaratory or injunctive relief but may not award damages.b.
here,the jury specifically found that arismendez pregnancy was a motivating factor in the employer decision to discharge her.arismendez argues that the district court erred in finding insufficient evidence to support the verdict.she had the burden of persuading the jury either by direct evidence of discrimination or by an indirect method of proof,which is the pretext method set forth in mcdonnell douglas rachid jack in the box,cir.
nightingale responds that arismendez failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination because she did not present evidence that she was treated less favorably than employees outside her protected class,employees who missed a comparable amount of work.nightingale further asserts that arismendez leaps beyond her initial burden and centers her attack instead on her second burden,presuming that this court will ignore the fact that she never established a prima facie case to even reach the aspects of discrimination law.nightingale is mistaken.because this case was fully tried on the merits,the mcdonnell douglas framework drops from the case.united states postal serv.bd.of governors aikens,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.indeed,after trial,the sufficiency of the prima facie case as such is no longer relevant.russell,at aikens,at.
arismendez argues that the comments vela made while terminating her constitute direct evidence of discrimination.arismendez testified that vela said that she knew it was illegal to terminate arismendez because of arismendez pregnancy.nonetheless,vela said she had a business to run and could not handle having a pregnant woman in the office the district court ruled that because vela did not exercise any authority over mccune decision to terminate plaintiff,vela comments amount to nothing more than stray remarks.we disagree.this court has explained that remarks may serve as sufficient evidence of discrimination if the offered comments are pregnancy related proximate in time to the terminations made by an individual with authority over the employment decision at issue and related to the employment decision at issue.brown csc logic,cir the only dispute is whether vela had the authority to terminate arismendez.nightingale position is that mccune was the individual that had the authority to terminate arismendez.however,this court looks to who actually made the decision or caused the decision to be made,not simply to who officially made the decision.russell,at.thus,if the evidence indicates that the worker possessed leverage,or exerted influence,over the titular decisionmaker,the worker discriminatory animus may be attributed to the employer.id.
here,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the,the evidence is sufficient for a jury to find that vela exerted influence over the decision to terminate arismendez.vela was arismendez direct supervisor.vela signed the papers to terminate arismendez employment.there was evidence that arismendez husband hand delivered a doctor note to vela that extended the period of bedrest.that note was not in arismendez file,and mccune was never made aware of it.mccune testified that he would have considered the circumstances regarding arismendez bedrest if he had been made aware.mccune described arismendez as a superior employee and a key person in the office.vela communicated with nightingale human resources department regarding terminating arismendez.mccune testified that vela initiated the paperwork to terminate arismendez.indeed,mccune admitted that vela provided all the information that he had in order to make the termination decision.because the jury could therefore conclude that mccune conducted no independent investigation,the causal link between vela discriminatory animus and arismendez termination was not broken.long eastfield,cir.whatever the formal hierarchy of nightingale might be,the jury could reasonably find that vela contributed significantly to the termination decision officially made by mccune.russell,at.
thus,we conclude that the remarks made by vela at the time of arismendez termination serve as direct evidence of pregnancy discrimination.this case boils down to a question of credibility,and the jury believed arismendez over vela.there is more than a mere scintilla of evidence to support the jury verdict that arismendez pregnancy was a motivating factor in the employer decision to terminate arismendez.a.
nonetheless,as previously set forth,if an employer can show that it would have taken the same action in the absence of any discriminatory animus,then no damages may be awarded.b.nightingale argues that,in any event,it would have terminated arismendez based on either her job abandonment or excessive absenteeism.those terms are explained in the employee handbook and are the reasons listed for arismendez termination in her employee separation report.
the employee handbook defines job abandonment as follows failure to report an absence for three consecutive days will be considered a voluntary resignation.it is undisputed that arismendez reported her absence through april.indeed,it is undisputed that mccune granted her a leave of absence until april.there is evidence that,on april,arismendez husband delivered a doctor note prescribing bedrest for arismendez through april.pursuant to a hypothetical question,vela admitted that such a notification would be an acceptable way to report an absence.the employee separation report lists the termination date as april.drawing all reasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of arismendez,the evidence is legally sufficient to show that arismendez did not fail to report her absences.thus,nightingale has failed to demonstrate that it would have terminated her based on job abandonment.
with respect to the excessive absenteeism basis for termination,the employee handbook defines an occurrence as follows 
in most cases,each separate incident when you are absent,tardy or leave work early.however,an absence of consecutive workdays caused by the same reason will be treated as a single occurrence.any absence of or more workdays for the same medical reason will require a return to work authorization from a doctor.failure to produce this note will result in each absence being counted as a separate occurrence.
emphasis in original.the handbook provides that if an employee had six occurrences in a year,the employee should receive an initial counseling warning.it further provides that an employee will be terminated after occurrences in a period.it is undisputed that arismendez absence consisted of consecutive workdays caused by the same reason.mccune conceded,as he had to,that although the handbook provides that nine occurrences warrant termination,arismendez had one occurrence at the time she was terminated.thus,there is evidence that the termination was in violation of the handbook.
in further support of its excessive absenteeism argument,nightingale states that it was operating with a skeletal staff,and a hiring freeze prevented it from employing a temporary employee.on the other hand,the evidence demonstrated that the mcallen branch operated without a branch manager for an entire year february to february.nightingale also points to evidence that the mcallen branch was experiencing additional demand for its services because of seasonal winter texans.however,arismendez was fired in the spring and thus the jury could reasonably infer that the demand from the winter texans was abating.
ultimately,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of arismendez,we conclude that nightingale has not demonstrated that it would have terminated her in the absence of the discriminatory animus.b.in the instant case,the jury believed arismendez,and there is more than a scintilla of evidence to support the jury verdict.thus,the district court erred in granting judgment as a matter of law to nightingale,and we reverse and remand the judgment.
punitive damages 
arismendez contends that the district court erred in remitting the punitive damages awarded by the jury.applying texas law,the district court remitted the damages from to.civ.prac.section provides that 
a in an action in which a claimant seeks recovery of exemplary damages,the trier of fact shall determine the amount of economic damages separately from the amount of other compensatory damages.
b exemplary damages awarded against a defendant may not exceed an amount equal to the greater of 
a two times the amount of economic damages plus 
b an amount equal to any noneconomic damages found by the jury,not to exceed or 
the application of the above statute to the amount of damages awarded arismendez results in a cap of the punitive or exemplary damages at.arismendez argues that nightingale waived
