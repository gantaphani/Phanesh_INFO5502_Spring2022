factual background and procedural history 
decedent richard adams was a shade tree mechanic who,throughout his life,conducted routine maintenance on all of his used vehicles,five of which were manufactured by ford.following the death of adams from mesothelioma,a form of cancer associated with exposure to asbestos,his wife,billie jean adams,and their three children brought suit against numerous defendants,including ford motor company,alleging that the defendants actions and products caused the decedent to become exposed to asbestos specifically,with regard to ford and other automobile manufacturers,the complaint alleged that the decedent was exposed to high levels of asbestos dust while replacing brake pads on his vehicles,including vehicles manufactured by ford the complaint also named defendants in the construction trade construction defendants,and alleged that the decedent illness was also caused by his exposure to asbestos while working in construction.adams sought in medical expenses,in loss of earnings and in general damages.
by november,four years into the litigation,adams claims against most of the defendants had been settled or dismissed,with the exception of the claim against ford.adams had settled with construction defendants union carbide and la habra respectively for and.adams had also settled with automobile manufacturers isuzu and nissan,respectively for and,as well as with brake manufacturer honeywell for.another automobile manufacturer,volkswagen,successfully filed a motion for summary judgment in,and was dismissed from the case.finally,adams had secured larger settlements with automobile service companies pep boys and auto zone,in the amount of and respectively.the record is silent with regard to adams claims against the remaining defendants.
on november,ford served adams with a timely section offer to settle the case for per plaintiff,totaling.ford section offer also included a mutual waiver of costs.adams allowed the offer to expire and the parties proceeded to trial.on december,the jury returned a verdict in favor of ford,finding that it did not manufacture,sell or distribute the brakes that adams claimed had caused the decedent illness.
following trial,ford filed a memorandum of costs reflecting total claimed costs of,which included expert witness fees of.subsequently,adams filed a timely motion to tax costs,solely challenging the propriety of ford claim for expert witness fees.adams motion alleged that ford section offer was unreasonable and made in bad faith,and that ford expert witness costs were not reasonably necessary for the preparation of trial.
specifically,adams motion claimed that ford section offer was a token offer,made in bad faith with no reasonable expectation that adams would accept it.adams further alleged that,in light of the important amount of costs and damages sought by the complaint,ford offer could not carry any reasonable prospect of acceptance,and was therefore made with the sole purpose of recovering expert witness fees should ford prevail at trial.adams also argued that based on the evidence available to both parties at the time of the offer,a reasonable possibility existed that adams would prevail at trial,and,therefore,ford offer did not constitute a reasonable prediction of ford potential liability.finally,adams alleged that,even in the event that ford offer was found to be reasonable,ford was only entitled to postoffer expert witness costs under section,subdivision d.based on these allegations,adams demanded that the trial court strike ford memorandum of costs.
on april,the trial court held the first of two hearings on adams motion.at the hearing,the court expressed its tentative thinking on the motion and stated,ford is the prevailing party,and,the settlement amount offer,given that it included a substantial waiver of costs,was reasonable.the trial court also indicated that without information about the settlements adams had entered into with the other defendants,it would be difficult for the court to question the reasonableness of ford section offer,given that ford had secured a defense verdict at trial.moreover,in response to adams argument that ford section offer was unreasonable in light of the enormous costs and damages sought by adams,the trial court stated that adams evidence against ford at trial was pretty attenuated,and it was not surprised at all by the jury verdict.the court further noted that in automotive friction cases,causation is often very hard to establish.consequently,the court opined,adams had to evaluate ford section offer in the context of its limited chance at succeeding at trial.
regarding the reasonableness of the expert witness fees incurred by ford,the court expressed some concern with the extraordinary amount of fees,but recalled that expert testimony was very critical for ford in this case.the court ultimately decided to order supplemental briefing on the reasonableness of the expert fees.specifically,the court ordered ford to present additional evidence about its expert fees,and to provide the court with a yardstick against which to measure these fees.
finally,the trial court rejected adams argument that ford was only entitled to postoffer costs under section subdivision d,since ford was a prevailing defendant and could therefore recover,at the court discretion,the costs of expert witness fees,whether incurred before or after the settlement offer under section,subdivision c.
on june,the trial court held a second hearing on adams motion to tax costs.in its supplemental briefing,ford presented additional evidence regarding the expert witness fees it had incurred in preparation of trial.specifically,ford presented evidence of comparable expert witness fees it had incurred in other products liability cases,most of which amounted to similar or higher costs than those awarded in the present case ford also provided the court with evidence that adams experts charged similar hourly rates as ford experts.additionally,ford presented evidence of several defense verdicts in automotive friction cases against other automobile manufacturers,all of which required the work and testimony of expert witnesses similar to those used by ford throughout the litigation with adams finally,ford provided the court with a declaration of its lead trial counsel,james ostertag,who asserted,based on his experience litigating several other automotive friction cases,that the fees listed in ford memorandum were typical,reasonable and necessary for ford defense at trial.
adams also presented additional evidence,most of which detailed the settlements adams had entered into with other defendants named in the original complaint.as mentioned above,the settlements ranged from for defendant nissan to for defendant pep boys as adams claimed that section,subdivision d only allowed ford to recover expert fees incurred after adams had refused ford settlement offer,adams also argued that ford expert witness fees were unreasonable in light of the limited amount of time that elapsed between the offer and the end of trial.finally,adams alleged that the itemization of the expert fees in ford memorandum was woefully inadequate,since it simply provided for each expert a total amount of hours spent on the case,but failed to explain how these hours were spent,and what work was devoted to any specific task.
on the basis of adams prior settlements,the trial court concluded that ford offer was not out of the ballpark,and was therefore reasonable,particularly since it included a waiver of costs.the court noted that ford offer was not unrealistic,and that adams had to evaluate it not merely as an offer for,but as an offer for and the opportunity to avoid the possibility of exactly where we are today,which is looking down the gun barrel of in expert fees and costs.stating that,t he experts were very powerful at trial and that the money was well spent,the trial court also concluded that ford expert witness fees were reasonable and necessary for the preparation of trial.
the trial court denied adams motion it ruled that ford section offer was valid,and that the expert witness costs listed in ford memorandum were reasonably necessary in light of the experts importance at trial.adams filed this appeal.
discussion 
standard of review 
in reviewing a trial court award of costs pursuant to section,the appropriate standard of review is abuse of discretion.najera huerta th,d.the party appealing the trial court decision to award costs bears the burden to establish an abuse of discretion,and unless a clear case of abuse is shown and unless there has been a miscarriage of justice a reviewing court will not substitute its opinion and thereby divest the trial court of its discretionary power.citations.denham superior court cal d.to meet its burden,a complaining party must therefore show that the trial court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary,capricious or patently absurd manner.najera,at,d.
ii.applicable law 
section allows for any party in a civil suit to serve a settlement offer to any other party before the commencement of trial section,subdivision c provides that i f an offer made by a defendant is not accepted and the plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award,the plaintiff shall not recover his or her postoffer costs and shall pay the defendant costs from the time of the offer.in addition,the court or arbitrator,in its discretion,may require the plaintiff to pay a reasonable sum to cover costs of the services of expert witnesses actually incurred and reasonably necessary in preparation for trial or arbitration of the case by the defendant.
the purpose of section is to encourage the settlement of litigation without trial in wear calderon d,this court held that a good faith requirement must be read into section in order to effectuate the purpose of the statute.good faith in turn requires that the settlement offer be realistically reasonable under the circumstances of the particular case.ibid.the offer must therefore carry with it some reasonable prospect of acceptance.citation.elrod oregon cummins diesel,d.elrod.on one hand,a party having no expectation that his offer will be accepted will not be allowed to benefit from a offer made for the sole purpose of later recovering large expert witness fees.jones dumrichob th,d jones,citing pineda los angeles turf club,d.one the other hand,section punishes a party who refuses a reasonable settlement offer,and subsequently fails to receive a more favorable judgment at trial.elrod,at.
a prevailing party who has made a reasonable and good faith pretrial offer pursuant to section is entitled to specified costs,and may be awarded a reasonable sum to cover the costs of the services of expert witnesses.nelson anderson th,d huber,hunt nichols,moore d.moore.moreover,even though section,subdivision d limits a plaintiff ability to recover expert witness fees to those incurred after the settlement offer was refused,section,subdivision c contains no such limitation,and gives the trial court discretion to award a prevailing defendant the costs of expert witnesses whether incurred before or after the settlement offer.regency outdoor advertising,city of los angeles cal th,d,regency outdoor advertising.
whether a section offer was reasonable and made in good faith is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.elrod,supra,d at.similarly,the decision to award expert witness fees,and the determination of whether these fees were reasonably necessary,are issues left to the discretion of the trial court.moore,supra,d at.as the court in moore stated,the trial court was in a far better position,having heard the entire case and observed the demeanor of witnesses,to exercise its discretion and determine what was a reasonable amount and what was reasonably necessary.ibid.an appellate court may reverse the trial court determination only if the court finds that in light of all the evidence viewed most favorably in support of the trial court,no judge could have reasonably reached a similar result.marsh mountain zephyr,th,d.
iii.adams motion to tax costs 
we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying adams motion to tax costs.the trial court conducted two hearings on the motion,and determined that ford section offer was reasonable,and that the expert witness fees listed in ford memorandum of costs were reasonably necessary for ford defense at trial.
reasonableness of ford section offer 
where the offeror obtains a judgment more favorable than its offer,the judgment constitutes prima facie evidence showing the offer was reasonable and the offeror is eligible for costs as specified in section.santantonio westinghouse broadcasting th,d santantonio.in santantonio,the court held that a defendant section offer for was prima facie reasonable in light of the fact that the defendant had secured a verdict of no liability at trial,despite the fact that the plaintiff sought to recover in damages.id.at,d.the burden was therefore on the plaintiff to show that the trial court had abused its discretion in concluding that the defendant offer was reasonable.id.at,d.
here,the trial court properly noted that the fact that ford secured a defense verdict at trial strongly undermined adams claim that ford settlement offer was unreasonable.as the court stated,once you won the case,looks like you overpaying.the burden was therefore on adams to prove that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that ford section offer was reasonable.
further,a reasonable section settlement offer is one that represents a reasonable prediction of the amount of money,if any,the offeror would have to pay the offeree following a trial,discounted by an appropriate factor for receipt of money by the offeree before trial.elrod,supra,d at.the reasonableness of a defendant section settlement offer is evaluated in light of what the offeree knows or does not know at the time the offer is made,along with what the offeror knew or should have known about facts bearing on the offer reasonableness.santantonio,supra,th at,d.in other words,for a section offer to be reasonable,the defendant must reasonably believe that the plaintiff might accept his offer,and the plaintiff must have access to the facts that influenced the defendant determination that the offer was reasonable.
in santantonio,the defendant settlement offer was reasonable because the defendant had substantial evidence undermining the plaintiff claim that his employment was terminated because of his age,and the plaintiff himself knew about that evidence and nevertheless chose to proceed to trial.santantonio,supra,th at,d.
by contrast,in elrod,a offer by one of several defendants in a case where the plaintiff damages were ultimately found to be in excess of million was held to be unreasonable by the trial court,and that determination was upheld by the court of appeal.elrod,supra,d at.in elrod,the defendant was found to be liable for damages largely superior to his settlement offer,but fortuitously avoided paying anything because other settlements received by the plaintiff reduced the amount of his contribution to zero.ib
