california prisoner billy soza warsoldier appeals from the district court denial of his request for a preliminary injunction in his suit challenging a california department of corrections cdc hair grooming policy,which requires that all male inmates maintain their hair no longer than three inches.warsoldier refuses to adhere to the grooming policy because of his sincere religious belief that he may cut his hair only upon the death of a loved one.he argues that the policy,and cdc refusal to permit a religious exception,violates his right to religious freedom.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a,and for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the district court denial of warsoldier request for a preliminary injunction.
factual and procedural background 
the facts here are undisputed by the parties.billy soza warsoldier is a cahuilla native american.he has participated in his tribe cultural,social,and religious affairs throughout his life.one tenet of warsoldier religious faith teaches that hair symbolizes and embodies the knowledge a person acquires during a lifetime and that hair may be cut only upon the death of a close relative.in keeping with his religion,warsoldier maintains his hair long because he believes that cutting his hair would cost him his wisdom and strength.he further believes that if he were to cut his hair,he would be unable to join his ancestors in the afterlife and that instead,the deceased members of his tribe will subject him to taunting and ridicule.except upon his father death in,warsoldier has not cut his hair since.
from april,to may,warsoldier was an inmate at california adelanto community correctional facility accf,a minimum security prison located in adelanto,california cdc grooming policy prohibits male inmates from maintaining their hair longer than three inches.reg.e.on april,warsoldier was given a copy of a rules violation report,which alleged that he was not in compliance with cdc grooming policy.he received similar notices of violation on june and june.the prison held hearings on each of the violations,during which warsoldier pleaded not guilty and asserted that his religious beliefs and cultural background prevented him from complying with the grooming policy.nevertheless,after each hearing,warsoldier was found guilty of violating the grooming policy.for his violations of the policy,warsoldier was punished by confinement to his cell and the imposition of additional duty hours.
on july,the prison unit classification committee ucc designated warsoldier a program failure pursuant to section m of title of the california code of regulations for his refusal to cut his hair as punishment,warsoldier lost his assignment to particular duties lost his phone call rights was expelled from print shop and landscaping classes was removed from his position as a member of the executive body for the inmate advisory council was prohibited from going to the main yard for recreation had his monthly draw at the prison store reduced from to and was prohibited from making special purchases at the prison store.
after warsoldier pursued cdc appeal process and exhausted all of the available administrative remedies,he filed suit in united states district court.warsoldier suit challenges cdc hair grooming regulation as violating his right to religious freedom under the religious land use and institutionalized persons act of rluipa.warsoldier complaint seeks preliminary and permanent injunctive relief prohibiting cdc from punishing him for exercising his religious beliefs and compelling cdc to lift all disciplinary sanctions that have been imposed upon him as a consequence of his refusal to adhere to the grooming policy.he also seeks a declaration that applying the policy to him violates his rights under rluipa.
the district court denied warsoldier request for a preliminary injunction,reasoning that because cdc had not forcibly cut warsoldier hair and had no intention of doing so before his release,it was questionable whether warsoldier had suffered a constitutional injury.because warsoldier was scheduled to be released in eighteen days,the court concluded that the balance of hardships did not weigh in warsoldier favor and there was no need to grant a preliminary injunction.

discussion 
standard of review 
a district court decision regarding preliminary injunctive relief is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.see pharm.research walsh,d.we must reverse the district court if it abused its discretion or based its decision on an erroneous legal standard or on clearly erroneous findings of fact satava lowry,cir.where,as here,the district court ruling rests solely on conclusions of law and the facts are either established or undisputed,de novo review is appropriate.see sammartano first judicial dist.court,cir.
ii.preliminary injunctive relief 
to obtain a preliminary injunction,warsoldier must show either a likelihood of success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury or the existence of serious questions going to the merits and the balance of hardships tipping in warsoldier favor.see nike,mccarthy,cir quoting gilder pga tour,cir internal quotations omitted.these two alternatives represent extremes of a single continuum,rather than two separate tests.thus,the greater the relative hardship to warsoldier,the less probability of success must be shown.see walczak epl prolong,cir internal quotations omitted.
likelihood of success on the merits 
section of rluipa provides,in relevant part,that n o government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability,unless the government establishes that the burden furthers a compelling governmental interest,and does so by the least restrictive means.a.rluipa defines religious exercise to include any exercise of religion,whether or not compelled by,or central to,a system of religious belief.a.a person may assert a violation of rluipa as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government.a.
the supreme court recently upheld rluipa against a challenge under the establishment clause.cutter wilkinson,d.in cutter,the court found that rluipa provision was compatible with the court establishment clause jurisprudence and concluded that rluipa alleviates exceptional burdens on private religious exercise.id.at.in upholding the act,the court recognized rluipa a s the latest of congressional efforts to accord religious exercise heightened protection from burdens,id.at,and that congress sought to provide inmates a mechanism to seek redress against the frivolous or arbitrary barriers that impeded institutionalized persons religious exercise,id.at see also id.at noting that rluipa purpose is to protect institutionalized persons who are unable freely to attend to their religious needs and are therefore dependent on the government permission and accommodation of their religion.congress did this by replacing the legitimate penological interest standard articulated in turner safley,d,with the compelling governmental interest and least restrictive means tests codified at a.see also cutter.at.
under rluipa,warsoldier bears the initial burden of going forward with evidence to demonstrate a prima facie claim that cdc grooming policy and its punitive sanctions designed to coerce him to comply with that policy constitute a substantial burden on the exercise of his religious beliefs.see b if warsoldier establishes the prima facie existence of such a substantial burden,on which he bears the burden of persuasion,the cdc shall bear the burden of persuasion to prove that any substantial burden on warsoldier exercise of his religious beliefs is both in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.a b.by its terms,rluipa is to be construed broadly in favor of protecting an inmate right to exercise his religious beliefs.g this chapter shall be construed in favor of a broad protection of religious exercise,to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this chapter and the constitution.
substantial burden 
cdc regulations provide that 
a male inmate hair shall not be longer than three inches and shall not extend over the eyebrows or below the top of the shirt collar while standing upright.hair shall be cut around the ears,and sideburns shall be neatly trimmed,and shall not extend below the of the ear.
reg.e.in contrast,
a female inmate hair may be any length but shall not extend over the eyebrows or below the bottom of the shirt collar while standing upright.if hair is long,it shall be worn up in a neat,plain style,which does not draw undue attention to the inmate.
reg.f.section e makes no exception for religious adherents whose faith prohibits them from cutting their hair.warsoldier argues that cdc grooming particular its failure to provide for a religious a substantial burden on the exercise of his religion,which prohibits him from cutting his hair.
although rluipa does not define what constitutes a substantial burden on religious exercise,see,in the context of a land use suit brought under rluipa,we have explained that for a land use regulation to impose a substantial burden,it must be oppressive to a significantly great extent.that is,a substantial burden on religious exercise must impose a significantly great restriction or onus upon such exercise,san jose christian coll.city of morgan hill,cir.in addition,the supreme court has found a substantial burden as where the state denies an important benefit because of conduct mandated by religious belief,thereby putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs.thomas review bd.of the.employment sec,d ruling in first amendment context.although such compulsion may be indirect,the infringement upon free exercise is nonetheless substantial.id.at.
as a consequence of his refusal to cut his hair in violation of his religious beliefs,warsoldier has been subjected to a series of punishments designed by cdc to coerce him into compliance.he has been confined to his cell had additional duty hours imposed on him been reclassified into a workgroup where inmates do not receive time credits or as many privileges as others working in a higher work group lost his phone call privileges been expelled from print shop and landscaping classes been removed from his position as a member of the executive body for the inmate advisory council been prohibited from going to the main yard for recreation had his monthly draw at the prison store reduced from to and been prohibited from making special purchases at the prison store.according to cdc statement of reasons supporting its grooming policy,such punishments are necessary to make complying with the grooming standards more of an appealing choice to the inmate.
notwithstanding these assorted punishments,cdc advances the argument,accepted by the district court,that because warsoldier has not been physically forced to cut his hair,his religious practice has not been restricted.according to cdc,even though he has been subjected to a variety of punishments for refusing to yield on his religious beliefs,warsoldier is still free to exercise his religion in all respects.in other words,the grooming policy is not a substantial burden because warsoldier may practice his will just be punished for doing so in an effort to compel him to acquiesce with the grooming policy in contravention of his religious beliefs.such an argument flies in the face of supreme court and ninth circuit precedent that clearly hold that punishments to coerce a religious adherent to forgo her or his religious beliefs is an infringement on religious exercise.see,sherbert verner,d reasoning that forcing someone to choose between following the precepts of her religion and forfeiting benefits,on the one hand,and abandoning one of the precepts of her religion in order to accept work,on the other hand puts the same kind of burden upon the free exercise of religion as would a fine imposed against appellant for her saturday worship may baldwin,cir noting that putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs infringes on the free exercise of religion quoting thomas,at.
because the grooming policy intentionally puts significant pressure on inmates such as warsoldier to abandon their religious beliefs by cutting their hair,cdc grooming policy imposes a substantial burden on warsoldier religious practice.see may,at finding substantial burden where prison officials conditioned receipt of benefits upon of inmate was proscribed by rastafarian inmate religious faith see also thomas,at.sherbert,at.under some circumstances,indirect discouragements undoubtedly have the same coercive effect upon the exercise of first amendment rights as imprisonment,fines,injunctions or taxes.planned parenthood arizona,cir the supreme court has clearly articulated that government may not restrict exercise of constitutionally protected rights,even when that restriction takes the form of withholding a benefit,rather than applying a penalty,for that exercise.
compelling state interest 
because we find that cdc grooming policy imposes a substantial burden on warsoldier religious exercise,cdc must establish that the policy serves a compelling governmental interest.see a b.
according to cdc,three compelling interests are served by its hair grooming policy.first,the hair length standards facilitate the security of prison inmates and staff by allowing the quick and accurate identification of inmates.in addition,inmates may hide contraband or weapons in their hair or on their bodies.absent the grooming standards,prison guards would be forced to make physical contact with an inmate to check for contraband.during such contact,prison guards risk suffering a puncture wound from sharp implements possibly concealed in the inmate long hair.further,such policies reduce animosity and tension by removing a method by which inmates may signal a gang affiliation.second,because short hair is easier to keep clean,requiring that male inmates maintain short hair reduces the spread of parasites such as lice within the prison.health and safety are also further facilitated by short hair,because it reduces the risk of injury during the inmate use of heavy machinery.finally,cdc argues that requiring male inmates to cut their hair ensures public safety because it enhance s identification of inmates who are attempting to escape or who have escaped.in addition,requiring short hair prevents prisoners from easily disguising their identity by cutting their hair upon their escape.
in support of its argument,cdc cites three cases upholding prison grooming policies as serving a compelling interest under the standard of rluipa predecessor,the religious freedom restoration act rfra these cases are not dispositive,however.in two of the cases the regulations were upheld against challenges brought by inmates of maximum security facilities.see harris chapman,cir finding state compelling interest in security and order within their prisons especially applies in close custody facilities like mci which contain extremely violent offenders hamilton schriro,cir it is more than merely eminently reasonable for a maximum security prison to prohibit inmates from having long hair in which they could conceal contraband and weapons.it is compelling.in contrast here,warsoldier was incarcerated in accf,a minimum security facility.in the third case,diaz collins,the fifth circuit upheld a prison grooming policy requiring that male inmates maintain short hair without discussing whether any other less restrictive means that could accomplish the same compelling interest were offered by the inmate or rejected by the prison,cir.but,under rluipa,cdc is required to demonstrate not only that its policy serves a compelling interest,but also that it has employed the least restrictive means to achieve that compelling interest.see a b.
cdc also cites friedman arizona,cir,in support of its argument that its stated interests are legitimate.cdc reliance on friedman is misplaced because that case was decided under the standard articulated in turner,which upheld a prison regulation impinging on inmates constitutional rights where the regulation is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.at.rluipa replaced turner legitimate penological interest test with a compelling government interest test.see a.similarly,in arguing that it has met its evidentiary burden,cdc cites cases that all predate passage of rluipa and involve claims subjected to the lower standard of a legitimate penological interest versus rluipa compelling government interest standard.compare swift lewis,cir citing turner,at,and noting that p rison regulations that infringe on an inmate practice of his religion are valid if they are reasonably related to legitimate penological interests,with a government must establish that burden is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest.
nevertheless,the question here is not whether prison security is a compelling governmental interest.it clearly is.see pell procunier,d see also may,at noting that security during transfer of inmates is compelling interest.rather,the question is whether cdc grooming policy is the least restrictive alternative available to cdc to reach its compelling interest.
least restrictive alternative 
assuming that cdc has met its evidentiary burden,and that it has established that the grooming policy serves a compelling governmental interest,cdc must still establish that the grooming policy is the least restrictive alternative to achieve that interest.see a b.this it has failed to do.
in attempting to meet its burden,cdc presents only conclusory statements that the hair grooming policy is the least restrictive means to ensuring prison security.first,cdc states that a ll other modes of regulation would either overly burden the inmate or the penal institution,or conversely fail to meet the compelling penological interests achieved by the grooming standards.cdc does not elaborate why this is the case or what other modes of regulation it considered and rejected.instead,cdc relies on four cases where courts upheld grooming policies as the least restrictive means.as noted above,these cases dealt with grooming standards in maximum security prisons.
in contrast here,warsoldier was placed in a minimum security prison.inmates at facilities such as accf have a greater degree of freedom than inmates at higher security facilities precisely because they pose fewer security risks.accf inmates have less serious criminal histories,are serving minimal sentences,and are less likely to attempt to escape.additionally,inmates in security facilities may be permitted to leave the premises to work and may sleep in unlocked dorm rooms rather than locked prison cells.given the reduced security pressures at such minimum security facilities,the least restrictive means in a maximum security prison may not be identical to what is required for a minimum security facility.cdc does not address this difference.
moreover,even outside the context of a minimum security facility,cdc can not meet its burden to prove least restrictive means unless it demonstrates that it has actually considered and rejected the efficacy of less restrictive measures before adopting the challenged practice.see united states playboy entm t group,d finding,in context of first amendment challenge to speech restrictions,that a court should not assume a plausible,less restrictive alternative would be ineffective city of richmond croson,d holding that city minority program was not narrowly tailored in part because city had not considered whether raceneutral measures would have achieved government interest hunter ex rel.brandt regents of of,cir concluding that government neglected to undertake any alone serious,good faith consideration of alternatives internal quotation marks and citation omitted.for instance,one alternative to cdc rigid policy would be the creation of a religious exemption to the grooming policy.rather,cdc simply states that t o meet the penological interests furthered by the grooming standard,the prison must enforce the grooming policies upon all inmates regardless of their religious convictions.it does nothing to explain why this is so or to discuss whether it has ever considered a less restrictive approach.
equally problematic for cdc is that other prison systems,including the federal bureau of prisons,do not have such hair length policies or,if they do,provide religious exemptions.prisons run by the federal government,oregon,colorado,and nevada all meet the same penological goals without such a policy.nevada permits inmates freedom in personal grooming.dep t of corrections admin.reg.similarly,colorado department of corrections has no hair length requirement and expressly provides for a religious exemption to its grooming regulations.admin.reg.i iv a d oregon merely requires that an inmate h ead and facial hair be maintained in a clean and neat manner.or.admin.a nor does the federal bureau of prisons impose any mandatory restrictions on its inmates hair length,regardless of the prison security level.dep t of justice,fed.bureau of prisons,program statement indeed,f or more than a decade,the federal bureau of prisons has managed the largest correctional system in the nation under the same heightened scrutiny standard as rluipa without compromising prison security,public safety,or the constitutional rights of other prisoners.cutter.at quoting brief for united states at.
surely these other state and federal prison systems have the same compelling interest in maintaining prison security,ensuring public safety,and protecting inmate health as cdc.nevertheless,cdc offers no explanation why these prison systems are able to meet their indistinguishable interests without infringing on their inmates right to freely exercise their religious beliefs.instead,cdc argues that its prisons should not be hindered in addressing its compelling interests just because other jurisdictions have adopted policies that do not substantially burden inmates religious practices.
contrary to cdc argument,we have found comparisons between institutions analytically useful when considering whether the government is employing the least restrictive means.indeed,the failure of a defendant to explain why another institution with the same compelling interests was able to accommodate the same religious practices may constitute a failure to establish that the defendant was using the least restrictive means.see cheema thompson,cir finding fault with defendant failure to explain fact that another school district had managed to accommodate sikh students religious practices without sacrificing school safety.furthermore,w here a prisoner challenges the prison justifications,prison officials must set forth detailed evidence,tailored to the situation before the court,that identifies the failings in the alternatives advanced by the prisoner.may,at emphasis added.
cdc also fails to explain why its women prisons do not adhere to an equally strict grooming policy even in maximum security facilities.in contrast to the men grooming policy at issue here,cdc regulations provide that 
a female inmate hair may be any length but shall not extend over the eyebrows or below the bottom of the shirt collar while standing upright.if hair is long,it shall be worn up in a neat,plain style,which does not draw undue attention to the inmate.
reg.f.as warsoldier points out,the government interest in inmate health and security is no less compelling when the inmate is female rather than male.concerns about inmate identification,lice infestation,and the ease with which an escaped inmate may alter her or his appearance are the same regardless of the sex of the offender.that cdc compelling interests apply equally to male and female inmates suggests that there is no particular health or security concern justifying the policy,and,more importantly,that the hair length restriction is not the least restrictive means to achieve the same compelling interests.
challenging this comparison,cdc argues that the difference in treatment between male and female inmates is justified because women inmates are much less likely to commit violent crimes than male inmates and,hence,that women inmates p
