the court,sitting without a jury,found a property owner breached his contract to sell a large parcel of coastal property to an investment company.the court,however,refused to grant the buyer request for specific performance based on the court conclusion that monetary damages were adequate because the buyer primary motivation was to quickly turn the property for a profit.we hold the court erred in refusing to grant specific performance on this basis.the law generally presumes real property is unique and that the breach of an agreement to transfer property can not be adequately relieved by pecuniary compensation.the seller here did not overcome this presumption merely because the buyer purpose in purchasing the property was to earn profits from developing reselling the property.

factual and procedural summary 
in summarizing the factual record,we state the facts in the light most favorable to the court rulings.see weeks baker mckenzie th,d.
rea is a limited liability company formed by troy shadian.in january,shadian and his business partner,roshan bhakta,became interested in vallas property the lanikai lane property located in carlsbad near the pacific coast highway.the property contained a mobilehome park with individual mobilehomes and numerous amenities,including a pool,playground,laundry facilities,and a long winding street.vallas leased the property to a mobilehome park operator,which managed the park and subleased the spaces to residents who owned their mobilehomes.the lease began in and terminates in.
vallas,who was in his,owned the lanikai lane property,but had never been to the property because he considers the property to be his in name only.he inherited it from his maternal grandparents,and all income from the property is placed in a separate account which he does not use.his father,also named theodore vallas referred to in this opinion as father,is an experienced businessman who manages all aspects of the lanikai lane property on vallas behalf.the only authority that vallas did not delegate to father was the responsibility for signing legal documents.
beginning in january,rea principals and father engaged in negotiations regarding the purchase of lanikai lane.once they reached a deal,in march,rea and vallas entered into a written purchase and sale agreement.under the agreement,the sales price was million,with rea to pay an immediate deposit,and then pay million at closing.in return,vallas agreed to finance the remaining million,with the unpaid balance to be paid over a period,with the balance due on april.
rea primary goal in purchasing the property was to make a profit for its investors.one proposed business model was to subdivide the property and sell the subdivided lots to the property mobilehome park residents.shadian and bhakta intended to make a substantial monetary profit through this investment.
in late march,the parties opened escrow,and rea placed in cash as a deposit.escrow was scheduled to close on may.however,in a written modification,the parties agreed to extend this date to may.
in,rea sought a further extension to june,because of various remaining due diligence issues on both sides.on may,father,who had represented vallas in all previous negotiations,orally agreed to the extension.father thereafter engaged in conduct consistent with a conclusion that he and vallas had approved the extension.the parties continued with their due diligence during this period and met several times.however,father on vallas behalf also accepted a million offer from the mobilehome park residents,who had formed an association for the purpose of purchasing the property.
two weeks before the escrow was to close,on june,father called rea real estate agent and escrow agent and told them he was cancelling the deal.the next day,on june,father sent a fax to bhakta and shadian stating that vallas was cancelling the contract.on that same date,vallas sent a fax to rea stating he was cancelling the escrow.
the next day,on june,rea filed a superior court complaint against vallas,seeking specific performance of the real estate purchase contract.rea alleged vallas breached the agreement by anticipatory repudiation when he expressed his unequivocal intention not to sell the property to rea,and by failing to provide required due diligence documents.rea also alleged that vallas breach of the agreement could not be adequately relieved by pecuniary compensation and therefore rea had no adequate remedy at law and was entitled to specific performance.rea claimed the sales price constituted adequate consideration and the agreement was just and reasonable in all respects.rea recorded a notice of pendency of action.vallas did not move to expunge the lis pendens.
vallas against rea,shadian,and bhakta,alleging these parties failed to disclose that they had no financial ability to purchase the property at the agreed price,and breached the agreement by failing to close escrow on time.
at trial,rea primary legal theory was that vallas breached the contract by repudiating it on june without providing rea the opportunity to perform its contractual obligations of depositing the million into escrow.in defense,vallas argued that he was entitled to cancel the contract because rea breached the contract first by failing to make the million deposit by may.vallas testified that he never agreed to extend the escrow date beyond may,and that to the extent that father gave this extension,father was not his agent and therefore he was not bound by father acts.
in support of its request for specific performance,rea presented evidence of its ability to perform the contract at the time of the breach and at the time of trial.this evidence showed that shadian and bhakta were successful and experienced investors and had a large network of financially supporters who were interested in this property and from whom they could immediately raise the additional million needed to close the deal.rea also presented evidence that the contractual terms were fair and reasonable,and that the consideration was adequate.in this respect,rea called a real estate appraiser as an expert witness who testified that the fair market value of the property encumbered by the lease was million at the time of the contract formation and of the breach.
vallas countered that even if he breached the agreement,rea was not entitled to specific performance because rea was not ready,willing and able to deposit the million into escrow.he also argued that rea legal remedy was adequate because the subject matter of the transaction was commercial property and the loss of the investment could be adequately offset by a pecuniary award.
at the conclusion of the trial,the court announced its rulings.with respect to the agency issue,the court stated that substantial and credible evidence showed vallas gave father full authority to act on his behalf in all matters related to the subject property.the court further found that because father continued to operate as if the contract was in full force after the may closing,vallas waived his right to assert rea breached the contract by not placing the funds into escrow by that date.the court thus found that vallas june cancellation constituted a breach of the agreement.
but the court declined to award specific performance based on its finding that damages would provide rea adequate relief.as detailed in the discussion section below,the court found specific performance was not appropriate because rea purchased the property solely as a commodity to earn money for their investors,and not because of the uniqueness of the property itself.the court awarded rea,reflecting the difference between the contract price and the value of the property on the date of the breach,plus interest on the deposit.
rea then moved to vacate the judgment and for a new judgment on the remedy issue.rea argued that under california law a finding that the plaintiff sole purpose in purchasing real property was to make money is insufficient to support a finding that damages are an adequate remedy.after lengthy argument,the court denied rea motion,explaining that the purchase of this property was nothing more than a vehicle to make money and therefore monetary damages were adequate to compensate for the breach.
discussion 
vallas appeal challenge to the court actual agency findings 
ii.rea appeal specific performance 
rea contends the court erred in refusing to order specific performance of the parties real estate contract.
background information 
in its complaint filed one day after vallas cancelled the contract,rea requested specific performance because of the inadequacy of the legal remedy.during closing arguments at trial,rea counsel urged the court to grant this remedy,citing the statutory presumption that a damages remedy is inadequate for a breach of a real property sales contract,and emphasizing the unique coastal location and size of the property.
vallas counsel responded that specific performance was not an appropriate remedy because by the testimony of their appraisal expert,there are a number of ocean accessible,visible,mobile home parks that had sold on or around the time of the lanikai lane original contract and therefore for purposes of specific performance,damages should be adequate remedy in this case.when the court asked counsel to elaborate on this argument,vallas counsel stated that the rea principals did not meet their burden nor did they really present anything that it was a unique piece of property say it is by the ocean and a mobile home park,that is simply not sufficient there are similarly situated commercial properties that could at some point or another be purchased or not purchased i believe that the burden shifted to rea once the appraiser indicated that there were other properties similarly situated and they did not go further to substantiate that it was a unique piece of property.so i believe that they did not,once the burden shifted,meet their burden to establish the uniqueness.
after considering these arguments,the court ruled it would not grant specific performance because a damages remedy would provide rea adequate relief.the court explained its reasoning as follows a remedy at law is adequate for plaintiff and therefore it would be improper to specifically enforce the subject contract.in quoting reese wong at th d,a presumption of uniqueness is often inappropriate with respect to commercial real estate.the essence of commercial activity is the earning of money.loss of a commercial investment can normally be offset by a pecuniary award.rea,and specifically,shadian and bhakta purchased the subject property known as lanikai lane solely as a commodity.the evidence is overwhelming that their sole purpose in buying this property was to make money for their investors,as they have done on many,many occasions.the property uniqueness was not a concern.their goal was to turn a profit from the property as quickly as possible by potentially buying out the leaseholder or reselling the property to someone else.the long history of dealing with the issue of whether or not the property is unique can be analogized to art.courts oftentimes specifically enforce the sale of residential and other properties because of the uniqueness of the property itself and the fact that just like art,it can not be obtained by some other manner.in this particular case,rea was not concerned with the property.bhakta and shadian were not interested in going into the mobile home business or mobile home rental business.they were not interested in retaining the property for any length of time.they were simply interested,and the entire intent was to earn money for their investors and so therefore,this particular case is consistent with the thinking of reese and as such specific performance under the circumstances of this case would not be appropriate.underscoring omitted.
after the court entered judgment,rea moved for a new judgment on the specific performance issue,asserting that its investment motivation did not,as a matter of law,support the court legal conclusion that damages were an adequate remedy.rea also argued that the difficulty in estimating lost rea argued could be as high as million based on written projections provided to its the inadequacy of the damages remedy.
after full briefing and lengthy argument by each counsel,the court denied rea motion,stating i think that shadian and bhakta and rea,they viewed lanikai lane as a widget that they intended to purchase and i think that the evidence is clear that once they found out about lanikai lane from the realtor,their desire was to purchase it very quickly t heir desire was to make as much money as possible from the sale of that property and their investors are expecting for them to make a great deal of profit.in fact,i was struck by how we literally had several investors come in here and tell us that they had made in previous transactions inconceivable amounts of profit.i think the range was something between to percent.all of those factors in my estimation gave the court the impression that this property was nothing more than a vehicle to make money and given the circumstances and the evidence that was presented throughout the trial and i also certainly referenced the testimony of plaintiff appraisal expert i am satisfied that the only result,appropriate result in this case,is in the award of damages the court also stated it was unpersuaded by rea argument that damages were inadequate because of the difficulty in proving lost profits,noting that rea made the tactical decision to rely solely on its appraiser valuation of the property at million to establish the adequacy of the consideration.
general legal principles 
to obtain specific performance after a breach of contract,a plaintiff must generally show the inadequacy of his legal remedy an underlying contract that is both reasonable and supported by adequate consideration the existence of a mutuality of remedies contractual terms which are sufficiently definite to enable the court to know what it is to enforce and a substantial similarity of the requested performance to that promised in the contract.citations.tamarind lithography workshop,sanders d.see henderson fisher d.a grant or denial of specific performance is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.petersen hartell cal d.
in this case,the court refused to specifically enforce the contract based on its finding that the first element inadequacy of legal remedy was not satisfied because rea sought to purchase the property as an investment,and not for some particular use of the land.rea contends this finding was incorrect as a matter of law and,alternatively,unsupported by the evidence.
it is a familiar legal principle that a damage award is generally an inadequate remedy for a breach of real estate contract,and therefore courts routinely grant a plaintiff request for specific performance.see thompson sebert,remedies damages,equity and restitution ed.this rule arose in medieval england where land ownership was a primary indicator of the owner social status and voting rights.see kirwan,appraising a presumption a modern look at the doctrine of specific performance in real estate contracts mary,spyke,what land got to do with it rhetoric and indeterminacy in land favored legal status buff.specific performance was necessary because c ourts of law simply could not value expectations such as social status or the right to vote for a representative in parliament,and substitute performance was virtually impossible because of the unavailability of land for sale.kirwan,supra,mary.at.
although these historical reasons no longer apply,most jurisdictions have continued the rules requiring special treatment of land sale contracts,reflecting the enduring view that each parcel of land is unique and therefore there can be no adequate replacement after a breach and monetary damages are difficult to calculate after a party refuses to complete a land sales contract,particularly expectation damages.see rest d contracts.some legal commentators have questioned the continued validity of these grounds for specific performance in every case see kirwan,supra,mary.berkovich,to pay or to convey a theory of remedies for breach of real estate contracts ann.surv.am,miller starr,cal.real estate ed,but the concept has become well ingrained miller starr,cal.real estate,supra,and legislatures and the courts have largely adhered to the rule that specific performance is the appropriate remedy upon a breach of a real estate contract.
in california,these principles are embodied in section.section states it is to be presumed that the breach of an agreement to transfer real property can not be adequately relieved by pecuniary compensation.in the case of a dwelling which the party seeking performance intends to occupy,this presumption is conclusive.in all other cases,this presumption is a presumption affecting the burden of proof.
by imposing a conclusive presumption for certain residential transactions,the legislature decided that monetary damages can never be satisfactory compensation for a buyer who intends to live at a home,regardless of the circumstances.but by establishing a rebuttable presumption with respect to other property,the legislature left open the possibility that damages can be an adequate remedy for a breach of a real estate contract.the rebuttable presumption shifts the burden of proof to the breaching party to prove the adequacy of the damages.by so doing,the legislature intended that a damages remedy for a nonbreaching party to a commercial real estate contract is the exception rather than the rule.
as recognized by both parties and the trial court,there is a dearth of appellate court decisions in this state addressing the issue of the scope of the breaching party burden to rebut the presumption that the damages remedy is inadequate when the buyer sought to purchase the property for a commercial or investment purpose.courts generally assume the uniqueness of land and grant specific performance after a breach of a land sale contract in both residential and commercial contexts,with little or no discussion of the adequacy of remedy issue.
despite this lack of authority,we do not agree with rea argument that the presumption of the inadequacy of the remedy for commercial property is essentially conclusive,and can only be rebutted by a finding that specific performance is inappropriate for an independent equitable reason separate and apart from the inadequate remedy factor.a rule that the section presumption can be rebutted only by an independent equitable reason is inconsistent with the statutory language that pertains to the adequacy of remedy element.by imposing a rebuttable presumption on the inadequacy of remedy element for certain types of purchases,the legislature necessarily contemplated that there may be circumstances when the presumption that damages are inadequate can be overcome.otherwise,the statutory distinction between a purchase of a dwelling that the buyer intends to occupy and all other types of real property purchases would have no meaning.
vallas did not meet burden to rebut statutory presumption in this case 
but the specific issue presented here is not whether a defendant can ever rebut the inadequacy of remedy presumption.the issue is whether vallas did so in this case.and on this issue,we agree with rea that vallas did not make a sufficient evidentiary showing to establish damages were adequate to compensate rea for the breach.under section,the trial court was required to presume the inadequacy of damages.although it did not need to do so,rea produced strong evidence to support the presumption.this evidence showed that the lanikai lane property is unique in terms of its size,location,and existing consists of acres near the pacific ocean and contains an established mobilehome community.the property has ocean views and is close to several desirable local beaches,two major vacation resorts,the del mar racetrack,expensive neighborhoods,and major transportation routes.rea evidence also showed that lanikai lane is unique in terms of the potential profits resulting from ownership because of its existing use mobilehome park on a lease that would terminate in,and the fact that existing residents would like to obtain ownership interests in the property.rea purchased the property for investment purposes,and it intended to obtain the highest return on this investment by subdividing the property and selling it to the existing residents of the park,which could result in substantial profits.
given the statutory presumption that damages were inadequate and the largely undisputed evidence strongly supporting this presumption,vallas had a high threshold to satisfy his burden to show damages would be an adequate remedy.in attempting to do so,vallas relied primarily on the appraisal of the lanikai lane property by rea expert who considered five recent mobilehome park sales.the sales prices for the comparable properties ranged from million to million.the parks were located in los angeles county,san diego county and ventura county.none of these sales was subject to a ground lease.
this evidence was insufficient to satisfy vallas burden.the fact that other mobilehome parks had sold within a recent period does not mean that damages would be adequate to compensate rea for the loss of this property and accompanying investment opportunity.as one commentator has pointed out,to disprove the presumption,a seller must show not only abstract replaceability but concrete availability of reasonably interchangeable property at terms within the buyer means.bird,toward understanding california rebuttable presumption that land is unique,california real property journal summer.there was no information in the appraiser testimony or his report showing that rea could purchase one of these identified mobilehome park properties on similar terms,or whether rea would be in a similarly situated investment position if it did complete a purchase.because land is unique,different locations are not necessarily interchangeable,without evidence showing this to be the case.
perhaps recognizing this gap in the evidence,the trial court did not base its conclusion on the appraisal report or the appraiser testimony,which it found to be of marginal use because the appraiser ignored some important data in arriving at his conclusions.instead,the court found vallas satisfied his burden based on its findings that rea sole purpose and entire intent in buying the property was to earn money for its investors and turn a profit as quickly as possible by reselling the property.
this reasoning was flawed.standing alone,the fact that rea was motivated solely to make a profit from the purchase of the property does not overcome the strong statutory presumption that all land is unique and therefore damages were inadequate to make rea whole for the breach.the property was unique not merely because of its physical attributes and location,but also because of its investment potential and the reasonableness of the agreed upon contract price.these factors fully support the uniqueness of
