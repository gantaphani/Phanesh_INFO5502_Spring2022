appellee ren judkins sued appellant ht window fashion corporation ht for infringement of judkins patents relating to window coverings.ht counterclaimed for,among other things,unfair competition,alleging that judkins violated section a of the lanham act,a,by sending ht customers and potential customers letters stating that an ht product infringed his patents.
the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania denied ht motion for a preliminary injunction on the counterclaim.ht has appealed from the denial of the preliminary injunction.ht contended in the district court and argues on appeal that judkins acted in bad faith when he sent the letters because he knew that his patent the patent,which the letters suggest is infringed by ht polaris product,was unenforceable.we affirm the district court denial of the preliminary injunction and deny judkins motion for attorney fees.
background 
judkins developed the process for manufacturing window coverings in the early and had his lawyer draft a patent application in.he did not,however,file the application patent application the application until.in,another inventor filed a patent application for a similar product that issued the next year as patent the patent.
the patent was assigned to newell window furnishings.in early,newell filed a patent infringement suit involving the patent in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois.see newell window furnishings,springs window fashions,wl,the springs litigation.judkins was not a party to this litigation,but his invention was analyzed as prior art,and he and his attorney testified in the case.
also in early,judkins sought an interference between the patent and his own patent application the application,which was a continuation of his application.interference was declared in january,and the proceedings that flowed from it comprise a second,discrete chain of events underlying this appeal.
in october,the trial court in the springs litigation ruled that the defendant could not show that the patent was anticipated by judkins invention.specifically,the court ruled that the defendant in that case could not rebut the inference,drawn from judkins delay in applying for a patent,that he had suppressed,concealed,or abandoned his invention.newell window furnishings,wl,at.the court nonetheless held the patent invalid,albeit on unrelated grounds.id.at.the trial court ruling,although not specifically the part of it that touched on judkins inferred abandonment of his invention,was affirmed by this court in.newell window furnishings,springs window fashions,fed.appx.
also in,the board of patent appeals and interferences board ruled in the interference proceeding that judkins had abandoned his invention and awarded priority against him.both judkins and newell were thus in a difficult position in.the board had ruled that judkins had abandoned the subject matter of the application,precluding the issuance of a patent to him.for its part,newell had no valid patent because this court had affirmed the finding of invalidity in the springs litigation.
two months after the board ruling,in november,judkins filed suit under in the western district of pennsylvania seeking to overturn the board decision and specifically seeking a determination that the invention of the patent was derived from his invention.following a september settlement agreement between judkins and newell,judkins filed an unopposed motion asking the court to vacate the board ruling that he had abandoned his invention.as part of the settlement,newell received a fully paid,perpetual license to any patents that would issue on the process once the board ruling was vacated.judkins motion made no reference to the finding in the springs litigation that judkins had abandoned his invention.the finding had,however,been mentioned in a motion to dismiss that newell had filed early in,and a copy of the relevant ruling was attached to that motion.
when the judge in the western district of pennsylvania entered the proposed order without modifying it,the district court found that judkins did not suppress or conceal the invention and vacated the board determination that judkins was not entitled to a patent.the board responded by granting priority to judkins application over the patent.as a result,judkins obtained the patent in february.
shortly before the patent issued,judkins sent letters to ht customers and potential customers warning of likely infringement by ht polaris product.ht brought suit in the united states district court for the central district of california in an attempt to stop judkins from sending such letters.soon after,judkins filed an infringement suit in the western district of pennsylvania.the california case was transferred to pennsylvania because the california district court held it lacked personal jurisdiction over judkins.the two suits were then consolidated.
in the decision under review,the district court denied ht motion for a preliminary injunction.it held that ht could not establish bad faith or overcome the presumption of the patent validity by clear and convincing evidence and therefore could not show the requisite likelihood of success on the merits of its lanham act claim.according to the district court,in support of ht motion,it submitted only its recitation of the history of litigation regarding the application,to which the patent claims priority,and a statement of its belief that the patent is nothing more than a spawn of judkins abuse of the patent system.judkins ht window fashions,d.this,the district court held,was insufficient to show that ht had a likelihood of prevailing on its section a claim.
the district court also noted that the irreparable harm balance does not weigh in ht favor because patentees in judkins position have a right to protect their inventions by,among other things,warning the marketplace against infringement.id.at.in contrast,the court found any harm to ht was not particularly irreparable because it would only take the form of lost sales compensable through monetary relief.id.at.the court concluded that the balance of harms was an alternative basis to deny ht motion for a preliminary injunction.
discussion 
standard of review 
the grant or denial of preliminary injunctive relief in a lanham act case is generally a matter of procedural law not unique to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal circuit.mikohn gaming acres gaming,internal citations omitted.accordingly,we apply in this case the procedural law of the regional circuit where this case was brought.that said,the federal circuit has itself built a body of precedent applying these general considerations to a large number of factually variant patent cases,and we give dominant effect to federal circuit precedent insofar as it reflects considerations specific to patent issues.id.
in the third circuit,a party seeking an injunction must show that each of four factors favors the requested relief the likelihood that the moving party will succeed on the merits the extent to which the moving party will suffer irreparable harm without injunctive relief the extent to which the nonmoving party will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is issued and the public interest.mcneil heartland sweeteners,llc,cir citing shire barr labs,cir.instruments tessera,applying an essentially identical test.
the first of these movant chances for success on the critical in this case because it was the principal ground on which the district court denied ht the relief it sought.to prevail on an claim under section a of the lanham act stemming from a patentee marketplace activity in support of his patent,the claimant must first establish that the activity was undertaken in bad faith.zenith elecs.exzec.a patentee has a right to inform potential infringers of a patent and potentially infringing activity unless the communication is made in bad faith.gp,eran,citing hunter douglas,harmonic design,and.although bad faith in this context has both objective and subjective elements,the former is a threshold requirement a bad faith standard can not be satisfied in the absence of a showing that the claims asserted were objectively baseless,meaning no reasonable litigant could realistically expect to prevail in a dispute over infringement of the patent.id.at citing prof l real estate investors,columbia pictures,d.if a district court weighing a motion to enjoin a patentee from communicating its rights determines the patent in question is not necessarily invalid or unenforceable,the objective baselessness requirement is not met,and no injunction should issue.id.at.this court has made it clear that a n injunction against communication of patent rights is strong medicine that must be used with care and only in exceptional circumstances.id.at.indeed,once the court concludes that the claims of infringement are objectively baseless,the court must then consider whether the claims were made in subjective bad faith.prof l real estate investors,at.

likelihood of success on the merits 
ht argues the district court erred with regard to its chances for success on the merits in two primary ways.first,ht argues that the district court failed to consider judkins conduct during the prosecution of the patent.the patent,ht argues,was acquired through a combination of conspiracy and inequitable conduct,before both the patent office and a federal court,making it unenforceable,so that judkins threats to enforce it were in bad faith.ht also argues the district court improperly discounted the materiality of the abandonment finding in the springs litigation and improperly applied a presumption of validity to patents that,ht contends,were fraudulently obtained.second,ht argues,rather than using the objectively baseless standard for bad faith,the district court required ht to provide evidence of judkins subjective knowledge of bad faith and improperly failed to shift to judkins the burden of justifying his conduct after ht made out a prima facie case of bad faith.
we do not agree that the district court abused its discretion when it denied ht request for a preliminary injunction.we determine that the court did not clearly err in weighing the relevant factors and did not rely on erroneous legal or factual premises when it concluded that ht failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits of its lanham act claim.
sham litigation and settlement 
first,the evidence relating to judkins conduct during the patent prosecution does not point so unequivocally to bad faith that we are compelled to accept ht argument that the district court must have ignored this evidence and therefore based its ruling on clearly erroneous factual findings.ht says that two prior bad acts by judkins were causes of the patent issuance sham litigation aimed at overturning the board decision awarding priority against judkins,and judkins supposed failure to disclose the abandonment finding in the springs litigation to either the patent office or the western district of pennsylvania in the suit he brought to overturn the board interference decision.these acts,ht asserts,constitute a breach of the duty of candor owed by patent applicants under.see also manual of patent examining procedure c,mckesson info.solutions,bridge.
the suit was not obviously a sham.judkins was entitled to seek review of the board decision awarding priority to the ford patent,as well as all issues raised by that decision,in a district court pursuant to.see instrument.nothing in the record suggests judkins believed that he stood no chance of prevailing outright in that action.indeed,he pursued just that result for nearly two years before reaching a settlement with a span of time one would expect sham litigants to wait to reach a collusive bargain.moreover,newell moved the district court to dismiss the case in january.had newell prevailed on this motion,which the record shows was capably briefed by its attorneys,judkins would have been stuck with the board ruling.newell motion is not what one expects of a strawman or supposed opponent sued as part of a scheme to subvert the adversarial process,as ht asserts.for these reasons,the evidence relating to the suit does not suggest that the district court clearly erred in evaluating the facts ht asserts establish its likelihood of success on the merits.
ht assertion of a conspiratorial settlement of the lawsuit similarly fails to persuade us that the district court overlooked a breach of the duty of candor or other glaringly obvious misconduct.the fact that both judkins and newell took from the settlement something of value points to a constructive,mutually beneficial resolution to a legitimate dispute.ht argument that the settlement was a breakdown of the adversarial system is difficult to square with the principle that the law favors settlement of litigation.see bergh dep t of,citing united states contra costa county water,cir.when genuine adversaries reach a mutually agreeable compromise and present their agreement in detail to the court,and no fraud or other problems militate against the agreement enforcement,public as well as private interests are best served by giving effect to the settlement.bradley chiron,although the courts well recognize the public as well as private interest in the finality of settlements,a settlement will not be enforced if it is tainted by fraud or another condition that warrants its rescission.
was the settlement agreement resolving the section action obviously tainted by fraud ht argues it was,because judkins did not disclose the abandonment finding in the springs litigation to the court in connection with the settlement agreement.yet ht also acknowledges that newell had disclosed the abandonment finding to the pennsylvania district court when it moved to dismiss the suit.thus,ht argument assumes that the court confined itself to the stipulations the parties put before it in judkins agreed motion for summary judgment and ignored the rest of the record,including an earlier dispositive motion.we decline to make this assumption about that court diligence.the district court in this case did not clearly err when it failed to find that the settlement was collusive and therefore treat it as irrefutable evidence of judkins bad faith in later asserting the patent.
ht also asserts that judkins did not disclose the finding in the springs litigation to the patent examiners during the prosecution of the patent and thus again breached the duty of candor.ht does not,however,elaborate on this assertion in its brief.judkins countered at oral argument that newell submitted the illinois decision to the board during the interference proceedings and that record in turn went to the examiners who eventually approved the patent ht assertion does not rebut the inference that the patent examiners who approved the patent had access to the record from the interference,including the findings in the springs litigation supplied by newell.
materiality of the abandonment finding in the springs litigation 
ht next argues that the district court improperly discounted the materiality of the finding in the springs litigation that judkins had abandoned,suppressed,or concealed his invention.ht insists that the finding was per se material under,the manual of patent examining procedure,and caselaw.the district court erred,ht says,by analyzing whether the finding in the springs litigation was substantively correct without regard for its per se materiality and the issue of whether i
