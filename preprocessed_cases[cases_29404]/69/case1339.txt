plaintiff ae,ae suffered property damage caused by a defective heating system designed in part by defendant goodyear tire rubber company goodyear.after a jury awarded damages,the district court declined to award prejudgment interest under utah law.it employed a presumption that damages are not calculable when a plaintiff provides varying damages estimates over the course of litigation,as was the case here.because the jury had not adopted ae damages calculation,the court held that ae failed to rebut this presumption.ae now appeals,seeking reversal of the court prejudgment interest ruling.
this case requires us to revisit our understanding of utah standard for awarding prejudgment interest.although the utah supreme court established over one hundred years ago that such interest is appropriate when the injury and consequent damages are complete and must be ascertained as of a particular time and in accordance with fixed rules of evidence and known standards of value,fell union pac.ry,utah,subsequent courts have been inconsistent in describing the proper test.thankfully,the utah supreme court recently returned to this question to explain that the utah courts various formulations have not altered the fundamental fell question t he standard focuses on the measurability and calculability of the damages.encon utah,llc fluor ames kraemer,llc,utah.
we conclude that under encon utah,the district court employed an improper presumption that ae was not entitled to prejudgment interest simply because its damages estimates were inconsistent.however,even absent such a presumption,we affirm the district court ruling that ae is not entitled to prejudgment interest.the evidence at trial required the jury to exercise vast discretion in assessing the necessity,scope,accuracy,and precision of ae claimed damages.because such determinations are peculiarly within the province of the jury to assess at the time of the trial,fell,at,ae damages are not sufficiently calculable to serve as the basis for prejudgment interest under utah law exercising jurisdiction under,we affirm.
central to the dispute before us is a house in deer valley,utah the ae house owned and managed by ae,a colorado corporation created for this sole purpose.at a cost of approximately million,the foot house was built in the early for the katzenberg family by new star general contractors new star.at the time the ae house was built,goodyear produced a hose called entran ii for use in hydronic radiant heating and snowmelt systems manufactured by chiles power supply company heatway systems.the ae house utilizes a heatway system,and thus entran ii is embedded throughout the house and its outdoor areas.
in,ae learned that heatway systems in two other properties had failed due to problems with entran ii.at a meeting of companies responsible for installation and maintenance of the ae house heatway system,ae was told that those failures were due to batch problems and that the entran ii used in the ae house was manufactured well after the suspect batches.chiles wrote to jeffrey katzenberg assuring him that the entran ii in the ae house was in quite good condition and there were no visible signs of deterioration.around the same time,a katzenberg employee asked new star how much it might cost to replace the entran ii.based on a figure of per square foot,new star came up with a total of.
sometime after april,katzenberg and ae learned that the entran ii hose used in the ae house was,in fact,defective.on july,ae filed a products liability action against goodyear in the united states district court for the district of colorado among other claims,ae alleged negligent product design and manufacture,negligent failure to warn,strict liability for design and manufacture defect,and strict liability for failure to warn.
goodyear and ae stipulated to goodyear liability on these claims.ae remaining claims were dismissed,and the case went to trial on three issues goodyear statute of limitations defenses,the repair or replacement costs resulting from the defective entran ii,and the amount of other associated damages.goodyear agreed to pay of any damages award.
at trial,new star president david love testified for ae as a cost estimation expert for construction and remodeling projects.love first described the ae house construction,highlighting a number of unusual and expensive materials used in the house,including inland cedar and antique chestnut.he then testified regarding the estimates new star developed to replace the entran ii.regarding the estimate of,he explained that it was based on a bout five minutes worth of thought process.love stated that he did not begin to seriously consider replacement costs until approximately a year before trial.from that point,new star produced approximately ten different replacement cost estimates,ranging from about to million.
when asked what caused the estimates to shift,love explained that nobody really knew exactly what was going to have to happen to take out the entran.as an example,he explained that new star originally estimated only costs but realized that walls would likely be damaged during construction,requiring a guess about how far up the wall you going to have to keep taking off product.when describing the difficulty of removing floors from beneath the walls,he admitted,that another thing that quite frankly we did think about until i thought of it last night.
at the time of trial,new star replacement cost estimate was.based on a repair schedule,the estimate included a security guard and an cleanup crew,a permitting section which love admitted was a guess,and a number of items labeled allowances.as to the latter,love explained that because this job is so insane,he d id feel comfortable about doing this job on a basis.thus,the estimate included many round figures such as for landscaping and for cabinetry.he also testified that some calculations were disputed within new star,such as the amount of material that would be salvaged,saying,everybody thinks i wrong.they think there no way that you going to save as much product as you think you are,dave.time will answer that.finally,he testified that the estimate included a contingency of over for things that we do know about,and that what i think we going to need.
goodyear was evan farnsworth,the chief estimator for a park city general contractor.at goodyear request,he had prepared an estimate for replacing the entran ii in the ae house based on plans and documents provided by ae,concluding that the repair would cost.at trial,farnsworth explained why he disagreed with the necessity,cost,and scope of most of the items in new star estimate.according to farnsworth,the project would take five months and would not require many of the employees included in new star estimate.he also testified that the project could be completed with significantly less collateral damage than new star anticipated.
in addition,farnsworth explained large variations between his and new star estimates on specific line items.for example,farnsworth stated that,in accordance with accepted methods,his approach would eliminate the use of hose underneath the cabinetry,thus obviating the need for cabinetry work.another contrast,he explained,was that at the established market rate,the concrete work should cost five times less than new star estimated.further,farnsworth testified that his contingency,overhead,and profit figures were much lower than new star.ultimately,he averred that his company had committed to completing the project for the estimated price if ae hired it to do so.
at the close of trial,the jury concluded that goodyear failed to prove its statute of limitations defenses the reasonable repair and replacement costs were and other reasonable costs and losses totaled.because the parties had agreed before trial that goodyear would pay half of any damages award,the jury findings resulted in a total judgment against goodyear of.applying utah law,the district court held that ae was not entitled to prejudgment interest because its damages were not complete and because it had failed to overcome a presumption that its damages were not calculable.
ae appeals the denial of prejudgment interest.
it is that a federal court sitting in diversity applies state law,not federal law,regarding the issue of prejudgment interest.loughridge chiles power supply,cir quotation omitted.although an award of prejudgment interest is generally reviewed for abuse of discretion,any statutory interpretation or legal analysis underlying such an award is reviewed de novo.id.quotation omitted.
utah prejudgment interest rule on unliquidated damages has remained largely unchanged in the hundred years since it was established in fell.as the utah supreme court recently explained 
prejudgment interest may be recovered where the damage is complete,the amount of the loss is fixed as of a particular time,and the loss is measurable by facts and figures.prejudgment interest is appropriate when the loss has been fixed as of a definite time and the amount of the loss can be calculated with mathematical accuracy in accordance with rules of damages.
encon utah,at quotations,alteration,and footnote omitted.this standard has generally been applied as a two prong test whether the damages are complete and whether they can be measured by fixed rules of evidence and known standards of value.smith fairfax realty,utah.
in fell,the utah supreme court explained that i n the class of cases where the damage is complete,and the amount of the loss is fixed as of a particular time,there can reason why interest should be withheld merely because the damages are unliquidated.at.this is because the purpose of awarding prejudgment interest is to compensate a party for the depreciating value of the amount owed over time and,as a corollary,to deter parties from intentionally withholding that amount.encon utah,at quotation omitted.thus,under utah law,award of prejudgment interest should generally turn,not on the vagaries of litigation,but on whether the loss is fixed as of a particular time.it should be denied when the damages are incomplete and peculiarly within the province of the jury to assess at the time of trial.fell,at.
since fell,the utah supreme court has applied this principle and upheld or awarded prejudgment interest in a number of situations for the diminution in property value of a house due to a street grade change,measured from the date the street work was completed,kimball salt lake city,utah,for the diminution of the value of property due to construction of a railroad,calculated from date the railroad took possession of the land,san pedro,salt lake bd.of educ.of salt lake city,utah,for negligent engineering,determined from the date the affected property was destroyed,uinta pipeline white superior,utah for unpaid royalties,assessed from the date each payment was due,trail mountain coal utah div.of state lands forestry,utah for the breach of a fiduciary duty for an illegal property transfer,measured from the transfer date,smith fairfax realty,utah and for breach of contract,calculated from the date the claim was filed,encon utah,at.
we are also guided by cases in which the utah supreme court has denied prejudgment interest.in canyon country store bracey,utah,the court held that prejudgment interest was not available for canyon country lost profits 
while the basis of the formula used to determine canyon country lost profits may have been sufficient for the jury to render a verdict in favor of canyon country,it is too speculative to allow for the addition of prejudgment interest.the store was not an established business with a history of profits.
id.at.similarly,in cornia wilcox,utah,the court denied prejudgment interest on a claim for breach of an agistment contract because the jury heard conflicting and diverging evidence regarding almost every aspect of the loss of livestock their expected gender,weight range,mortality rates,and market prices.id.at.because the plaintiffs could not establish these elements as a matter of fact,and thus the jury was free to use its best judgment in ascertaining and assessing the damages,the court reasoned that this evidence failed the calculable prong of the prejudgment interest standard.id.
this court has previously had one occasion to address in depth the matter of prejudgment interest under utah law.in pro axess,orlux distribution,cir,we determined that pro axess was not entitled to prejudgment interest on the lost profits caused by breach of contract.id.at.we concluded that pro axess claim did not meet either of the requirements for prejudgment interest.id.at.with respect to the calculability of damages,we noted that pro axess provided varying lost profits calculations before and during trial and that it submitted virtually no evidence in support of its claim of a gross profit margin.id.at.given utah courts reluctance to award prejudgment interest for unrealized profits,we held that pro axess evidence of its gross profit margin is clearly inadequate to support the award of prejudgment interest.id.at citing canyon country store,at.
from these cases,we conclude that the propriety of prejudgment interest is not controlled by the cause of action or the legal theory under which a plaintiff prevails.in particular,prejudgment interest for property damage may be perfectly appropriate in some cases but not in others.the critical consideration under the fell test is the manner in which damages are proven.
with this background in mind,we turn to the circumstances of the case before us.the district court determined that ae damages failed both prongs of fell.rejecting ae contention that its damages were complete when the entran ii was installed in,the district court explained 
had the jury actually calculated the cost of replacing the system in,this the entran ii hold water.however,damages were not based upon the cost of the system in,or the actual cost of replacing the entran ii at any prior fixed moment in time,but instead were based on the estimated replacement costs as of trial.ae suggestion that i award prejudgment interest as of based on the cost to repair a system that functioned properly for over a dozen years stretches the bounds of logic and is contrary to utah law.see,saleh farmers ins,utah holding that when damages are not ascertained until trial,prejudgment interest is inappropriate.
with respect to fell calculability prong,the district court relied heavily on its understanding of pro axess.when a prevailing party is unable to calculate his damages consistently during the period before trial,the court held,a presumption arises that such damages are not calculable within a mathematical certainty.it then suggested that although this presumption can be overcome when a jury adopts the expert testimony as fact,ae had not rebutted the presumption because the jury verdict did not match any of ae estimates.
as noted above,although the decision to award prejudgment interest is generally reviewed for abuse of discretion,we review the legal analysis employed by the district court de novo.loughridge,at.with the added guidance of the intervening decision from the utah supreme court in encon utah,we perceive legal errors in the district court analysis under both fell prongs.first,the district court interpreted utah law to prohibit prejudgment interest when damages are not ascertained until trial.second,it incorrectly applied a presumption against prejudgment interest because of the evolving repair estimates provided by ae expert.nevertheless,we conclude that neither error leads to a reversal.
the district court erred in its explanation of the first fell prong,which requires that damages be complete.see smith,at.citing saleh,at,the district court stated that when damages are not ascertained until trial,prejudgment interest is inappropriate.this is a misreading of saleh.in that case,the utah supreme court simply endorsed the trial court reasoning that because damages were not ascertainable until additional evidence was presented at trial,prejudgment interest was inappropriate.id.emphasis added.there exists an important distinction between damages that are not ascertained until trial and damages that are not ascertainable until trial.in saleh,the latter was true.accordingly,the damages were incomplete and thus peculiarly withi
