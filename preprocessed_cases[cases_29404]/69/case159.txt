this appeal concerns efforts by the puerto rico horse racing industry and sport administration the administration to suspend the horse training license of jorge maymó for improperly administering drugs to certain race horses under his care.the district court granted a preliminary injunction preventing maymó suspension and the appellants now seek reversal of that order.
pursuant to the puerto rico horse racing industry and sport act,the administration was created as a public instrumentality to regulate everything connected with the horse racing sport in the commonwealth of puerto rico.id.the administration is comprised of a racing board,which is made up of three members,and a racing administrator the members of the racing board and the racing administrator are appointed by the governor of puerto rico.id.a,a.
the racing board is empowered to regulate everything connected with the horse racing sport,a,including t o prescribe,by regulations,the fines,administrative penalties and suspensions that can be imposed by the racing board,the horse racing administrator,or other authorized officials.id.b.the racing administrator is the administration principal executive officer,id.a,and has the power to e nforce compliance with the racing laws and regulations and the orders and resolutions of the horse racing board,id.a,and to g rant,suspend temporarily,or permanently cancel the licenses of horse trainers after notice and hearing.id.a.
in,the racing board promulgated the controlled medication program,a set of regulations that governs the administration of drugs to race horses.the controlled medication program prohibits some drugs outright others are allowed,but only if administered in accordance with established procedures by authorized personnel.two of the drugs regulated but not prohibited by the medication program are clenbuterol,given to horses with respiratory problems,and tramadol,which is an analgesic.
between june,and june,nine horses that had been trained by maymó underwent urine tests that came back positive for horse tested positive twice,thus making a total of ten positive tests.by august,then racing administrator juan alves rueda alves had filed ten corresponding charges against maymó,alleging that clenbuterol had been administered in violation of the controlled medication program.alves consolidated the charges the clenbuterol case,assigned irba cruz de batista cruz,an independent contractor for the administration,to act as hearing examiner,and ordered ricardo pacheco pacheco pacheco,an attorney employed by the administration,to act as prosecutor.a.
hearings in the clenbuterol case were held before cruz from august to october.in the midst of these proceedings,on september,a horse trained by maymó underwent a urine test that came back positive for tramadol.on october,cruz submitted a report to alves,concluding that,in all ten instances,maymó had administered the clenbuterol in violation of the controlled medication program.maymó filed objections to cruz report,but on november,alves adopted the report,accepting its findings of fact and conclusions of law.alves suspended maymó license to train horses for five years and imposed a fine.
maymó filed a petition for review of alves decision with the racing board,and moved for a stay of the license suspension and fine pending review.while maymó petition and motion were pending before the racing board,alves filed a new charge against maymó based on the positive tramadol test the tramadol case alves again assigned cruz as hearing examiner and pacheco as prosecutor.the racing board ultimately granted maymó requested stay in the clenbuterol case,and later maymó license was renewed for the following year.id.b.
on april,the racing board,by divided vote,sustained alves decision in the clenbuterol case,affirming the suspension of maymó license and the fine.pursuant to a,maymó sought review of the racing board decision in puerto rico circuit court of appeals.that court granted maymó a stay of the penalties that had been imposed upon him pending resolution of his appeal.
in june,julio álvarez ramírez álvarez succeeded alves as racing administrator.hearings in the tramadol case were held before cruz from january to may.on june,cruz sent a report to álvarez,concluding that maymó had violated the controlled medication program by improperly administering tramadol to the horse in question.
on june,the puerto rico circuit court of appeals affirmed the racing board decision in the clenbuterol case.however,álvarez took no immediate action to impose the license suspension and the fine,there being some uncertainty as to whether the court stay continued in effect until its mandate issued.on june,álvarez adopted cruz findings of fact and conclusions of law in the tramadol case.álvarez directed that maymó license be suspended for five years to run consecutively to the pending suspension in the clenbuterol case and imposed a fine 
on june,with the suspension of his license from the tramadol case set to begin on july,maymó filed suit under in federal district court in puerto rico against álvarez,pacheco,and cruz.the suit,directed solely to the suspension in the tramadol case because the clenbuterol case remained in limbo in the state court,alleged due process violations that the controlled medication program was unconstitutionally vague and arbitrary and that the named defendants were unfairly biased against maymó.the suit sought damages and to enjoin the racing administrator from suspending maymó license.
on july,notwithstanding the federal lawsuit,maymó petitioned the racing board for review of álvarez june,decision,adopting cruz findings of fact and conclusions of law in the tramadol case.on the same day,the federal district court held a hearing on maymó request for interim relief relating to the tramadol suspension.at the hearing,álvarez made clear that he intended to suspend maymó license based on the clenbuterol case when the stay expired.with respect to the tramadol case,the district court ultimately entered a temporary restraining order pending resolution of the request for a preliminary injunction.
on july,maymó having failed to obtain an extension of the stay,álvarez suspended maymó license based on the clenbuterol decision that same day,álvarez returned to maymó his petition for the racing board to review the tramadol decision,saying that review was pointless in light of the ongoing litigation in federal court.on july,maymó filed a second federal action,similar to the first except for the addition of alves as a defendant,to enjoin suspension based on either the clenbuterol or the tramadol case the district court consolidated the two federal cases and issued a second temporary restraining order.
from september,to october,the district court conducted a hearing on whether to issue a preliminary injunction barring the racing administrator from suspending maymó license.on the first day of this hearing,the defendants filed a motion to dismiss,arguing inter alia that the district court should refrain from deciding the consolidated cases based on the principles of abstention outlined in younger harris,d,and that the defendants were covered by or qualified immunity.
on november,the district court issued an opinion and order holding the following that the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity and immune from money damages that abstention under younger was not appropriate and that maymó was entitled to a preliminary injunction preventing the defendants from suspending his license and collecting the fines that had been levied against him.the defendants now appeal,arguing that younger abstention was required and,alternatively,that maymó failed to establish the prerequisites for a preliminary injunction.
younger is a rule of abstention built around the principle that,with limited exceptions,federal courts should refrain from issuing injunctions that interfere with ongoing litigation,or,in some cases,with state administrative proceedings.see generally younger,at.this core principle leaves open a host of peripheral questions to which the precedents provide only half answers or decisions in tension with one another.see chemerinsky,federal jurisdiction ed wright,miller cooper,federal practice and procedure,at,ed.this case poses several of those problems.
although initially applied to protect state criminal prosecutions against interference,the younger doctrine has been extended to coercive civil cases involving the state and to comparable state administrative proceedings that are in character and implicate important state interests in regulating thoroughbred racing,the commonwealth aims to ensure the integrity of the sport and to protect legitimate state interests.the proceedings within the racing board to cancel licenses after notice and hearing fit within the category of matters potentially subject to younger.see baffert cal.horse racing,cir applying younger.
the district court said that younger abstention did not apply because neither the clenbuterol nor the tramadol matters were ongoing at the time the principal injunction was granted on november.by that time the proceedings affirming the sanction in the clenbuterol case were effectively completed with the affirmance of the racing board action and in the tramadol case,the racing administrator had imposed penalties and had returned maymó review petition so no proceedings were pending before the racing board.
although the clenbuterol case had been decided by the state appeals court when maymó filed his second federal time at which the younger test is applied,bettencourt bd.of registration in,cir the state case was still technically ongoing because maymó had filed a petition for reconsideration.yet it would be a waste of time to reverse based on this technicality and,as it turns out,the injunction against the clenbuterol order is barred on other grounds to which we will shortly turn.
although younger is ordinarily described as applying where the state case or proceeding is ongoing,a moment reflection suggests that this can not be the whole story.there is some sense to a mechanical rule that younger does not apply where the state litigation has not yet begun after all,the underlying concern is that state proceedings,once begun,should be respected by federal courts so long as the federal claims or defenses can be litigated in the course of the proceedings.see younger,at.brooks supreme court,cir.
however,it makes little sense to ignore younger policy simply because the state process has come to an end.after all,how does it respect state proceedings to wait until they are concluded and then ignore or overturn them and yet the case law is something of a vacuum on this question,partly because of the variousness of the situations but mostly because other rubrics usually foreclose the collateral attack after the state proceedings have ended,making unnecessary any discussion of younger.
three such rubrics have special force where,as with the clenbuterol proceedings,judicial review of an administrative ruling has been undertaken and completed res judicata,the federal full faith and credit statute,and the doctrine although nominally independent doctrines,they are variations on the same theme the first embodies a bedrock respect for prior judgments,subject to exceptions the second,a statutory compulsion for the first where federal courts confront state judgments and the third,a broader and blunter version of the other two.
often the first resort of federal judges is to the peculiarly so in case of disbarment,revocations of licenses,and the like.see wright,miller cooper,supra,at.merger and bar doctrine is often hard to adapt to claims not cast in the traditional common law mode and collateral estoppel requires the precise identification of issues actually litigated and decided in the first case and sought to be in the second.restatement second of judgments cmt.so,despite the disapproval of scholars,federal courts regularly use to rebuff collateral attacks on prior state court judgments without purporting to apply the technical preclusion rules of res judicata 
one obvious reason is that when a state judicial proceeding does occur,federal judges usually say that the parties ought to raise all of their claims,defenses and objections.if the parties do,and are permitted to litigate the issues,the judges think that should ordinarily settle the matter,subject to certiorari review in the supreme court and if they do,they should not later come and complain to the federal courts.there are pluses and minuses to this approach but,with some exceptions,it has carried the day so far,and it does so here as to the clenbuterol case.
in that case,the racing administrator and the racing board may have been biased,unfair,or flat out wrong but the state provided a judicial remedy,maymó invoked it,and he lost.maymó conceded at oral argument that he had argued to the state court in the clenbuterol case both that the medication program was constitutionally flawed and that bias infected the administrative proceeding.although he disputes that he had a full and fair opportunity to litigate these issues,we address this claim below and find that it is unpersuasive.
to enjoin enforcement of the racing board sanction,after its affirmance by the state court,amounts to a collateral attack on a state court judgment.see,wang bd.of registration in,cir.does not depend on what issues were actually litigated in the state court and it is enough that granting maymó the injunction he seeks would effectively overturn the state court decision.the case law to this effect is extensive,mandel town of orleans,cir hill town of conway,cir 
there are exceptions to,see wright,miller cooper,supra,at,and the one that comes closest derives from cases saying that a general attack on a state law or regulation is not precluded by a prior judgment applying such a law or rule to the federal plaintiff.id.at wilson shumway,cir.the exception does not apply,however,if the relief sought in federal court is directed towards undoing the prior state judgment.see kenmen eng g city of union,cir in conducting analysis,we must pay close attention to the relief sought by the plaintiff.emphasis in original.
here,one facet of maymó due process claim was a general attack on the racing board drug regulations he argued that they were unconstitutionally vague and contradictory and the district court agreed.but,so far as advanced as a reason to grant an injunction overturning his license suspension,maymó challenge is an attack on the puerto rico circuit court of appeals decision affirming the suspension and is therefore barred by.see wilson,at hill,at.had he been suspended for a week and then sought to enjoin future enforcement of the regulations,that would be a different question.see hood keller,cir.
maymó assault on the tramadol suspension presents a different problem.as to it,there was no proceeding indeed,maymó was only to the stage of appealing the racing administrator decision to the racing board when he brought his initial federal action to enjoin the suspension.is based on the supreme court reading of a statute governing review of judgments,feldman,at.relying on does not insulate from federal challenge administrative rulings standing alone.van harken city of chicago,cir wright,miller cooper,supra,at.
however,younger as already noted does apply to administrative proceedings like this one.thus,we confront the district court conclusion that younger did not apply in this case because the administrative proceedings in the tramadol case were not ongoing when the first federal action to enjoin the administrator order was filed.true,thereafter maymó sought review by the racing board but,as the review petition was then returned because of the pending federal action,we will accept arguendo the district court premise that the federal action came after the conclusion of any pending administrative proceedings.
the question,then,is whether maymó can avoid younger abstention by failing to pursue his administrative remedy within the racing board.this question,although not identical,is related to the larger question whether,even if maymó had completed review by the racing board,he could have refused to seek judicial review in the state court and instead brought his federal claims to federal court in an injunction action.needless to say,this an exhaustion of remedies a matter of general importance that could affect an array of state proceedings.
to us,the answer is dictated by huffman pursue,d,and its progeny.in huffman,the supreme court said that once a state judicial proceeding had begun,the exhaustion of state judicial remedies was required by younger despite the formal break between trial and appellate review,the court deemed the proceeding ongoing for younger purposes until the state appellate process was complete.id.at.this was so even though the state court decision would then likely be preclusive of any new federal lawsuit.
at the time huffman was decided,younger had not formally been extended to state administrative proceedings and the court reserved the exhaustion question as to them but the supreme court thereafter extended younger to such proceedings in middlesex county ethics committee garden state bar association,d,and ohio civil rights commission dayton christian schools,d,its premise being that the administrative proceedings were subject to younger because they were judicial in character.at,at.in dayton,the court further stressed that if the constitutional mistakes were not remedied at the administrative level,state courts would be available to set the matter right.at.
given such rhetoric and the policy judgments underlying the recent decisions,younger now has to be read as treating the state the administrative proceeding is judicial in a continuum from start to finish.there are exceptions to younger to which we will return but,absent an applicable exception,there can not at any point on the continuum be an automatic right to detour into federal court because unhappy with an initial answer.
the principal author of these opinions has been chief justice rehnquist.when,following dayton,he summed up in a concurrence in new orleans public service,nopsi council of new orleans,d,he specifically described the younger rule as one that treats a matter as ongoing from the administrative proceeding into the state judicial proceeding 
nothing in the court opinion curtails our prior application of younger to certain administrative proceedings which are judicial in nature nor does it alter our prior case law indicating that such proceedings should be regarded as ongoing for the purposes of younger abstention until state appellate review is completed.citations omitted emphasis in original.
this conclusion does little more than spell out what is inherent in huffman,middlesex,and dayton,taken together and it is certainly the view taken by three out of four circuits that have addressed the exhaustion question the majority in city of philadelphia,cir is persuasive to us 
we have been given no reason why a litigant in a state administrative proceeding should be permitted to forego review of the agency decision in order to apply for relief in federal court.rather,we find the grounds offered by the supreme court to support its holding in state appellate review of a state court judgment must be exhausted before federal court intervention is equally persuasive when considered with respect to judicial review of a state administrative decision.
id.at.the opinion continues by quoting portions of huffman and other decisions that reinforce this view.id.at.
huffman is a reliable guide only where state administrative proceedings of a judicial character and,arguably,of a coercive nature,are directed against the federal plaintiff.see alleghany haase,cir.if maymó had been summarily suspended by the racing administrator and no administrative proceeding had been begun,he could have gone directly to federal court to challenge his dismissal.see patsy bd.of regents,d barry barchi,d see also dayton christian,at.admittedly,a line between summary action and administrative proceedings that are judicial in nature is bound to be fuzzy.
in,cir,a school superintendent kercado in puerto rico was terminated after an informal hearing at which she was given a chance to respond to allegations of incompetence,negligence,insubordination,and improper conduct.id.at.the termination order specified that it would take effect ten days after receipt,unless kercado chose to file an administrative appeal to the board of appeals of the public education system.id.instead,kercado filed a federal suit,alleging retaliation for activities protected by the first amendment.id.
the panel majority held that younger did not apply because puerto rico did not require any kind of formal procedure prior to the issuing of a termination order and because all proceedings were within the discretion of the aggrieved party and were not necessary to the order taking effect,at does maymó no good,however,because he was suspended only after administrative proceedings.there is a spectrum stretching from huffman to patsy and may be in the middle but maymó situation is clearly at the huffman end.
younger,even where it presumptively applies,is not implicated where the federal claims can not be raised and resolved somewhere in the state process.middlesex county ethics,at.how far the racing board would entertain constitutional objections to its regulations or practices is unclear,but the state court clearly would do so and this is enough.as noted above,in dayton the supreme court said it is sufficient that constitutional claims may be raised in judicial review of the administrative proceeding.at.
maymó says that one claim in alves harbored bias against not be developed because,in the administrative proceeding involving clenbuterol,he was not allowed to subpoena alves to develop that claim and so was limited by a truncated record on appeal.denial of an opportunity to develop a material issue is a standard basis for overturning an adverse administrative decision.power light lorion,d,and maymó has not persuasively explained why this remedy was inadequate in this case 
taking a related but somewhat different tack,maymó argues that an exception to younger permitted him to go to federal court directly to forestall an administrative action against him conducted by a biased tribunal.in substance,maymó says that alves,cruz,pacheco,and álvarez were prejudiced against him and,in addition,that he was singled out for discipline while other trainers similarly situated were not pursued.these facts,he says,he was entitled to develop in an independent action in federal court.his main reliance is upon gibson berryhill,d.
in gibson,a group of optometrists sued in federal court to enjoin disciplinary proceedings against them by a state board,at.and the supreme court said that younger did not bar a due process claim that the administrative tribunal was incompetent by reason of bias an alleged financial stake in the outcome to adjudicate the issues pending before it.id.at.the court also said n or,in these circumstances,would a different result be required simply because judicial review,de novo or otherwise,would be forthcoming at the conclusion of the administrative proceeding.id.at.
gibson was decided only two years after younger began the process of contracting remedies,but it has never been formally overruled.further,in huffman itself,the supreme court said that of course exceptions to younger bar remained,mentioning not bias but state proceedings brought to harass,or in bad faith,or to enforce a flagrantly unconstitutional statute.at.the opinion added,however,that irreparable injury would still be required for an injunction based on such an exception.id.at.
the scope and conditions of the various younger exceptions remain uncertain.underneath the surface is an unspoken policy debate as to how much should be done by federal courts and how far state courts are to be trusted the chief justice majority opinion in huffman plays out this debate in a counterpoint with the dissent,joined by three warren court veterans.compare at.rehnquist,with id.at.brennan,dissenting.about all that is certain is that there is some reason for interim federal court intervention where core constitutional values are threatened during an ongoing state proceeding and there is a show
