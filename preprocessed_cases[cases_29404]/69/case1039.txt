wendi sellers brought an action against the secretary of transportation pursuant to title vii of the civil rights act of,et,alleging that she was unlawfully discriminated against in her employment on account of her gender and in retaliation for filing a sexual harassment complaint.pursuant to c,with the parties consent,the claims were tried before a magistrate judge and a jury.after the jury returned a verdict in favor of sellers,she moved for equitable relief in the form of reinstatement or,in the alternative,front pay.the district court denied reinstatement but awarded sellers front pay in the amount of.the government appeals the front pay award.for the reasons stated below,we vacate the award and remand to the district court.
sellers was employed by the federal aviation administration faa as an air traffic control specialist at lambert airport in louis beginning in.sellers alleged that she was subjected to a hostile work environment beginning in and lasting through the time of her termination in.the harassment began when john joseph,who was also employed at lambert,made unwanted sexual advances toward sellers and,on one occasion,sexually assaulted sellers at her home.sellers complained of this conduct to her coworkers,supervisors,and union officials.although joseph harassing conduct ceased after sellers complaints,the workplace atmosphere at lambert deteriorated as sellers was subjected to harassment.because of the deteriorating atmosphere,the faa decided to terminate sellers effective september.
from october through april,sellers worked at the bank of america.the bank terminated sellers on april,after she attempted to process an unauthorized loan application in the name of her spouse former wife.when bank representatives questioned sellers about the loan application,she admitted her wrongful conduct,explaining that she had completed the application to obtain her spouse credit history.
sellers case was tried during march,when she was still employed by the bank.the jury awarded sellers in noneconomic compensatory damages and in backpay.on april,the district court entered judgment in accord with the jury verdict and then granted the secretary motion for remittitur,reducing sellers noneconomic damages award to the statutory maximum of.see b d.the district court also granted sellers motion for prejudgment interest in the amount of.sellers sought further equitable relief in the form of reinstatement or front pay.on april,the secretary moved for a stay of the proceedings with respect to the requested equitable relief,noting that he had recently received information regarding sellers discharge from bank of america that if proved,would have a direct impact on the plaintiff motion for equitable relief,defendant ability to even consider reinstatement and ultimately,therefore on the issue of front pay.appellee app.at.on november,the court held a hearing on the pay motion.the district court concluded that reinstatement was impractical because of the level of acrimony still present between sellers and her coworkers,supervisors,and the faa.in lieu of reinstatement,the district court awarded sellers front pay.on appeal,the secretary argues that the district court abused its discretion in awarding sellers front pay because her is,her termination from the bank of america for processing a false loan her unsuitable for reinstatement as an air traffic controller.the secretary argues in the alternative that the front pay award was excessive under the circumstances.
the primary issue presented is whether the misconduct of a discharged employee that would prevent reinstatement with the employer limits the equitable remedy of front pay.it is a question of first impression in this circuit.
waiver of evidence theory 
initially,we reject sellers argument that the secretary waived this issue by failing to raise it before the district court.even if the evidence theory advanced by the secretary is an affirmative defense that must be pleaded,as claimed by sellers,clearly the secretary can not be expected to raise the defense in an answer filed over two years prior to the events giving rise to the defense.further,the secretary filed a motion for a stay of proceedings within days of learning of the events,alerting the court that it was investigating alleged wrongdoing as the basis for sellers termination from bank of america and noting that the events would have a direct impact on the issues of reinstatement and front pay.a significant portion of the november hearing was devoted to testimony about the events surrounding sellers termination from the bank and how those events affected the faa consideration of reinstating sellers.see appellant app.at.the district court specifically found that sellers was terminated from the bank for the misconduct.that misconduct formed the basis for the faa decision not to offer reinstatement to sellers in april.order at.in these circumstances,although the secretary did not cite the specific legal theory to the district court,we conclude that he sufficiently raised the issue before the district court to allow us to consider it on appeal.see sexton martin,cir reaching issue where facts were alleged in district court brief though controlling authority was not stockmen livestock market,norwest bank of sioux city,cir reaching issue encompassed in general argument made before district court where party advancing argument did not present new evidence on appeal and both parties briefed the issue on appeal.
merits of evidence theory 
the most relevant supreme court case is mckennon nashville banner publ g,d.there,the plaintiff alleged that her employer terminated her in violation of the age discrimination in employment act adea.the employer learned during the plaintiff deposition that while the plaintiff was still employed with the firm,she had copied and taken home certain confidential documents in violation of her job responsibilities.see id.at.the mckennon court held that evidence of employee misconduct,which would have resulted in that employee discharge had the employer known of it,did not preclude recovery under the adea.see id.at.the court rejected the proposition,however,that the employee own misconduct is irrelevant to all the remedies otherwise available under the statute.id.at.the court explained that the employee wrongdoing becomes relevant to take due account of the lawful prerogatives of the employer in the usual course of its business and the corresponding equities that it has arising from the employee wrongdoing.id.at.most relevant to our discussion,the court concluded that 
the proper boundaries of remedial relief in the general class of cases where,after termination,it is discovered that the employee has engaged in wrongdoing must be addressed by the judicial system in the ordinary course of further decisions,for the factual permutations and the equitable considerations they raise will vary from case to case.we do conclude that here,and as a general rule in cases of this type,neither reinstatement nor front pay is an appropriate remedy.it would be both inequitable and pointless to order the reinstatement of someone the employer would have terminated,and will terminate,in any event and upon lawful grounds.
although mckennon involved the adea,its reasoning also applies in the title vii context.see id.at.the substantive,antidiscrimination provisions of the adea are modeled upon the prohibitions of title vii.trans world airlines,thurston,d recognizing the similarity between title vii and the adea because the substantive provisions of the adea were derived in haec verba from title vii internal marks omitted.only a few courts have addressed the question of whether the mckennon rationale should be extended to answer the question of whether evidence of misconduct that occurred after the employee has been terminated,but before the front pay decision is made,is relevant in fashioning equitable relief.
in ryder westinghouse,the district court answered this question in the negative.it reasoned that the evidence doctrine presupposes that there was an relationship at the time the misconduct occurred and that there can not be misconduct that the employer did not know about prior to making its adverse decision if the misconduct did not even occur until after the adverse decision was made.id.at.in sigmon parker chapin flattau klimpl,the plaintiff was terminated from her position as an associate at a law firm for allegedly discriminatory reasons after she returned from maternity leave.after her termination,the firm provided her with an office and telephone to conduct a job search.during this time,the plaintiff copied her personnel file as well as the personnel files of twenty other associates.the defendant argued that even if the plaintiff could prove discrimination,her damages should be limited due to her misappropriation,copying,and retention of the defendant documents.the district court rejected the argument.like the ryder court,it concluded that mckennon was premised on the employee misconduct occurring during her employment.id.at.the sigmon court then applied a rule,concluding that because the misconduct occurred outside the employment relationship,any complaint that the defendant may have had fell outside the mckennon rule.see id.because in this case,plaintiff alleged misconduct occurred after her termination,mckennon does not govern in the instant situation,defendant and plaintiff were not in an relationship at the time of the alleged incident.therefore any complaint defendant has against plaintiff for her conduct falls outside of the mckennon rule.
in carr woodbury county juv,the plaintiff was constructively discharged from her employment as a youth worker as a result of a racially and sexually hostile work environment.the plaintiff filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence of her marijuana use that the employer discovered during trial preparation.the defendant argued that carr marijuana use was probative of damages because it showed that the county would have fired carr because marijuana use violated county employment policies and because it showed that carr was unlikely to have remained at her position for any length of time as it was unlikely that a person with a marijuana habit could have maintained long term employment.the district court granted the motion,excluded the evidence,and declined to extend mckennon.like the aforementioned cases,the carr court reasoned that mckennon presupposes that the wrongdoing occurred during the existence of the employment relationship.see id.at.the court also reasoned that mckennon should not apply because the marijuana use simply had nothing to do with and did not occur during her employment and caused her former employer absolutely no detriment.id.at.third,the district court reasoned that the county employment policies could not properly be imposed upon a person after his or her employment has terminated because i t would be grossly inequitable to hold a plaintiff to all of the burdens of county policies at a time when she is not receiving any of the benefits of county employment.id.at.finally,the district court concluded that even if mckennon applied,the county had not established that the plaintiff conduct was so severe that it would have terminated her for it.see id.
the tenth circuit has also confronted this issue.in medlock ortho biotech,cir,cert.denied,d,medlock was allegedly terminated in retaliation for his filing and pursuing a claim of discrimination.at his unemployment benefits compensation hearing,medlock verbally abused defendant counsel.the defendant argued that the district court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that medlock conduct could serve to limit damages.the tenth circuit recognized that conduct could,in an appropriate case,limit a plaintiff remedies.see id.at stating that it could not foreclose the possibility that in appropriate circumstances the logic of mckennon may permit certain limitations on relief based on conduct.but it concluded that medlock was not such a case.see id.stating that in cases in which the alleged misconduct arises as a direct result of retaliatory termination,the necessary balancing of the equities hardly mandates a instruction on evidence.
we are of the view that the aforementioned district court cases gave too crabbed a reading to mckennon.the mckennon court used sweeping language,instructing lower courts to treat each case on a case by case basis considering all the factual permutations and the equitable considerations they raise.mckennon,at.see also mardell harleysville life ins,cir stating that the supreme court did not limit the general principles articulated in mckennon to cases involving misconduct,instead using the broader term wrongdoing.thus,like the tenth circuit,we can not establish a rule and foreclose the possibility that a title vii plaintiff conduct may,under certain circumstances,limit the remedial relief available to the plaintiff.a simple illustration will demonstrate why and how conduct may be relevant,in some circumstances,in limiting relief.let us suppose that after the faa had terminated her,and before the district court granted her equitable relief,sellers had been convicted of some crime wholly unrelated to her former position with the faa and was incarcerated such that reinstatement was now an impossibility.simple common sense tells us that it would be inequitable to award her front pay in lieu of reinstatement where she had rendered herself actually unable to be reinstated.
the nature of the front pay remedy itself is what makes the answer to the above illustration so intuitive.front pay is a disfavored remedy that may be awarded in lieu of reinstatement,but not in addition to it,where the circumstances make reinstatement impractical.see salitros chrysler,cir stating that front pay is a disfavored remedy kucia.cmty.action,cir stating that reinstatement should be the norm and that front pay is an exceptional remedy smith world ins,cir front pay is an equitable remedy,which may be awarded in lieu of,but not in addition to reinstatement.the availability of front pay as a remedy thus presupposes that reinstatement is impractical or impossible due to circumstances not attributable to the plaintiff.it would be inequitable for a plaintiff to avail herself of the disfavored and exceptional remedy of front pay where her own misconduct precludes her from availing herself of the favored and more traditional remedy of reinstatement.as such,we hold that a plaintiff conduct is relevant in determining whether a front pay award is available,and if so,in determining the extent of the award.
our conclusion that an employee conduct can,in some circumstances,limit an employee remedies for a wrongful discharge is not a new one.for example,we have previously concluded that a terminated employee could forfeit the remedy of reinstatement under the national labor relations act where he threatened his supervisors.see precision window,cir stating that a fired employee does not have an unlimited right to engage in misconduct without losing his remedial rights quoting precision window,raudabaugh,dissenting.we have also concluded that front pay would be unavailable where the plaintiff own conduct prevented reinstatement.see smith,at stating that an unreasonably rejected offer of reinstatement will bar entitlement to front pay.it requires no leap in logic to conclude that if an unreasonable rejection of an offer of reinstatement precludes a front pay award,then misconduct of a type that renders an employee actually unable to be reinstated or ineligible for reinstatement should also be one of the factual permutations which is relevant in determining whether a front pay award is appropriate.see christine neylon,the law of after acquired evidence in employment discrimination cases clarification of the employer burden,remedial guidance,and the enigma of misconduct,concluding that where misconduct is egregious,such conduct should bar reinstatement.
mckennon makes clear that the burden of establishing these facts rests on the employer.see mckennon,at.stating that employer must establish that the wrongdoing was of such severity that the employee in fact would have been terminated on those grounds alone.the court must look to the employer actual employment practices and not merely the standards articulated in its employment manuals,for things are often observed in the breach but not in the keeping.see mcdonnell douglas helicopter,cir stating that inquiry must focus on actual employment practices.the government argues that it has established the relevant facts showing that sellers is no longer eligible for reinstatement because faa hiring practices provide that a person who has been terminated from,or forced to resign,a position is unsuitable for employment as an air traffic control specialist.the district court concluded that the faa assertion that sellers was unsuitable for reinstatement because of her conduct was evidence of the acrimonious relationship between them,but there is no specific finding by the court that faa employment regulations and policies as applied to sellers do in fact bar her reinstatement or employment as an air traffic control specialist.there is no finding that the faa regularly adheres to this alleged policy or that the faa has made an official determination that sellers is,in fact,unsuitable for reinstatement solely because of her conduct.that the faa chose not to offer sellers reinstatement does not equate with finding that sellers conduct alone made her ineligible for reinstatement.
accordingly,we vacate the district court award of front pay and remand for further findings of fact and conclusions of law to be made on the existing record.no reopening of the evidentiary record shall occur,but the court may,of course,in its discretion call for additional briefing and argument.on remand,in order to establish that sellers front pay remedy should be limited by her conduct,the defendant must convince the court by a preponderance of the evidence that sellers conduct renders her ineligible for reinstatement under the faa employment regulations,policies,and actual employment practices 
length of front pay period 
the secretary also argues that even if sellers was entitled to a front pay award,the award as made was excessive because sellers failed to mitigate her damages by seeking a comparable job following her termination.if the district court determines on remand that sellers conduct did in fact render her ineligible for reinstatement,this issue need not be addressed.front pay is an alternative remedy to reinstatement and should be unavailable where the plaintiff own conduct prevented reinstatement.see smith,at see also mckennon,at.a s a general rule in cases of this type,neither reinstatement nor front pay is an appropriate remedy.we address this issue,however,in the event that the district court determines on remand that sellers conduct did not in itself bar her reinstatement.
sellers asked for front pay in an amount sufficient to compensate her for the difference between her salary of and her faa salary of at least until her mandatory retirement age of,a period of years.the district court awarded sellers front pay for the period between the time of the verdict and the time of the ruling on the front pay motion based on the difference between what she actually earned and what she would have earned had she remained employed by the faa.it found sellers request for front pay until retirement too uncertain and awarded her an additional seven years of front pay based on the difference between her current salary as an office manager and the faa salary to afford sellers the opportunity to obtain employment with comparable compensation and responsibilities.order at.
in declining to award sellers front pay until she reached retirement age,the district court considered a number of factors,including her relatively young age,her education and extensive experience in the aeronautical field,her minimal efforts at mitigation,and the status of the aeronautical industry.because we believe that eight years and eight months is the outside limit of an appropriate front pay award given sellers age,education,and extensive experience without considering any minimal mitigation attempts,we can not say that the length of the district court ultimate award was an abuse of discretion,especially when it considered the relevant factors.see salitros,at affirming front pay award until plaintiff normal retirement age united paperworkers int l union,local champion int l,cir expressing grave doubt that a front pay award could be upheld and stating that i nstead of warranting a lifetime of front pay,fiedler relatively young age should improve his future opportunities to mitigate through other employment hukkanen int l union of operating eng rs,hoisting portable local,cir affirming front pay award of ten years.
dollar amount of front pay award 
we believe,however,that the district court did abuse its discretion by not reducing the annual amount it used to calculate sellers award to reflect sellers failure to mitigate.following sellers termination,she worked as a loan officer and an office manager,both of which paid an annual salary of approximately.the district court specifically found 
although sellers air traffic experience would qualify her for employment with private aviation contractors,including jobs such as airline law enforcement dispatcher,consultant,or with private air traffic control towers,sellers sought no such employment.instead,sellers sought relatively low paying jobs,and the nature of the great majority of jobs for which sellers applied was in no way related to the field of aviation.
order at.to avoid a reduction in her front pay award,sellers had a duty to mitigate her damages by seeking comparable employment.see denesha farmers ins,cir.while the district court found that she did not adequately attempt to mitigate her damages,it failed to sufficiently reflect her failure in its award.see id.affirming reduction in front pay award where plaintiff failed to make some sustained minimal attempt to obtain comparable employment.the district court award at a differential between the actual and faa salaries does not adequately account for her failure to mitigate.as relevant on remand,the district court should determine an amount that sellers could have earned if she had attempted to find comparable work,and reduce any award accordingly.see id.a n amount equal to what denesha would have earned if he had made reasonable mitigation efforts was properly subtracted from his award.
the district court award of front pay is vacated,and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
i join the opinion of the court.i write separately to address an additional issue relevant to the proceedings on remand.judge bye in dissent observes,the record shows sellers reinstatement was impractical due to other circumstances,the hostile environment she would have faced working for an employer who still employed the man who sexually harassed her.ante at.if judge bye means to suggest that reinstatement is not potentially an issue on remand,i disagree.in my view,the issue of reinstatement will be very much alive if the faa fails to establish that sellers misconduct made her ineligible for reinstatement.
sellers motion for equitable relief properly sought the preferred remedy of reinstatement and included an alternative request for front pay if reinstatement was impractical.because joseph continued to be employed at lambert airport,sellers requested reinstatement at another faa facility,specifying three that would be convenient or suitable for her.thus,while judge bye is correct that joseph continued to be an faa employee,the reinstatement sellers requested would not have required her to work at the facility where joseph was employed,and where her relations with other staff had significantly deteriorated prior to her termination.the faa response opposed front pay relief and advised that the agency was considering the feasibility of reinstatement.after learning of sellers termination by bank of america,the faa decided in april not to reinstate her and argued to the district court that she was ineligible for reinstatement as an air traffic controller because of misconduct which resulted in her termination from bank of america.mem.order of,at.
the district court denied reinstatement,but not because of sellers bank of america misconduct.rather,the court concluded that reinstatement is impracticable in the circumstances because the faa expressed a continuing unfavorable disposition and hostility toward sellers.mem.order of,at.for this conclusion,the court cited our decision in cowan strafford school,cir.but in cowan,reinstatement would have reunited a terminated teacher with her antagonist,the school principal,at the same facility.thus,the hostility issue in cowan was comparable to the question whether sellers should be reinstated at lambert airport with joseph and other antagonistic,equitable relief sellers did not seek.in cowan,as in our earlier decision in standley chilhowee sch,cir,we were unwilling to order a reinstatement that would threaten the proper functioning of a school by admittedly hostile working relationships between a teacher and her principal cowan,or between a number of teachers standley.
as the district court acknowledged earlier in its memorandum and order,cowan and standley presented extraordinary circumstances which warrant denial of reinstatement.at.on the other hand,hostility engendered from litigation is not extraordinary and does not bar this preferred remedy.taylor teletype,cir,cert.denied,d accord dickerson deluxe check printers,cir.therefore,only s ubstantial hostility,above that normally incident to litigation,is a sound basis for denying reinstatement.united paperworkers int l union champion int l,cir,quoted in hammond northland counseling,cir.yet the district court never analyzed whether,assuming sellers was eligible for reinstatement despite her termination by bank of america,the faa demonstrated that its opposition to reinstatement was anything more than the lingering or hostility normally incident to this type of title vii litigation.
in these circumstances,the district court on remand must first explore,in accordance with this court opinion,whether sellers conduct renders her ineligible for reinstatement.if the faa meets its burden of proof on that issue,presumably neither reinstatement nor front pay will be appropriate equitable relief.on the other hand,if sellers prevails on this issue,then i think the district court should next revisit the issue of reinstatement,bearing in mind that the passage of time may soften the most acrimonious of relationships,united paperworkers,at,and determining whether there are terms of reinstatement reasonably comparable to those proposed by sellers that are not impractical because of either hostility above that normally incident to litigation or other sufficient reasons.in this regard,the parties must remember that reinstatement is the preferred equitable remedy.therefore,the faa,having violated title vii,must have strong reasons to avoid reinstatement,and sellers may not abandon her former willingness to accept reinstatement because she might now prefer a substantial front pay award.if the district court determines that equitable relief is appropriate despite the bank of america termination,and that reinstatement is impractical under these rigorous standards,the court should then return to the question of front pay,including the issues of the length and dollar amount of front pay discussed in the court opinion.
i disagree with the majority opinion in two respects.first,the secretary failed to argue in the district court that misconduct precludes an award of front pay,and therefore waived the claim now raised on appeal.second,if we were to reach the issue,i do not believe the record developed by the secretary establishes sellers reinstatement was impractical or impossible due to her misconduct.because the record establishes only that reinstatement was impractical due to circumstances not attributable to sellers,i believe she is still entitled to front pay,and i see no reason to remand this case.for both reasons,i respectfully dissent.
the secretary arguments in the district court regarding sellers misconduct,as well as his factual development of the record,all related to whether it was practical or possible to reinstate sellers as an air traffic controller.absent from the record is any argument sellers misconduct should preclude front pay as well.the record shows the following with respect to the misconduct issue.
first,the initial motion informing the district court about sellers misconduct focused on reinstatement rather than front pay.see ante at quoting appellee app.at.as the proceedings involving sellers misconduct unfolded,the secretary remained focused on reinstatement,not front pay.for example,on may,in response to sellers motion for equitable relief and prejudgment interest,the secretary stated defendant is still exploring the possibility or even feasibility of reinstating plaintiff.with respect to front pay,it is defendant position plaintiff is not entitled to front pay under the facts in this case.appellant app.at.the response did not,however,explain why front pay would not be warranted if sellers was not reinstated.
on march,the district entered an order for a hearing on sellers motion for equitable relief at which time the parties shall prepare to present evidence and argument in support of their respective positions.id.at district court docket entry emphasis added.the hearing was not held until november.in the interim,the secretary never filed a brief arguing misconduct should preclude an award of front pay.
at the hearing on november,sellers counsel represented it was his 
understanding that defendant opposes the reinstatement request in part,or perhaps in whole,as a result of an incident that occurred which resulted in the cessation of sellers employment with bank of america.that employment ceased about two weeks after the jury verdict in this case.apparently,the defendant alleges some kind of ethical or moral transgression on the part of the plaintiff.
id.at.the secretary response to that statement was limited to the issue of reinstatement and never suggested the bank of america incident precluded front pay as well.id.at.indeed,when the secretary presented evidence at the hearing,his focus was still on the issue of reinstatement,not front pay.
finally,at the end of the hearing,the district court specifically asked both counsel whether there was anything else the court needed to an opening for the secretary to make a legal or factual argument regarding front the secretary counsel replied,no,your honor.not once did the secretary cite mckennon or any other cases discussing whether misconduct should preclude an award of front pay.
nevertheless,the secretary argues he preserved the issue by presenting factual evidence on sellers misconduct and by generally opposing front pay.i respectfully disagree.the secretary never gave the district court reason to suspect a legal connection between those facts and the issue of front pay.the evidence doctrine requires factual as well as legal development.eeoc farmer,cir.that observation is particularly true here because the state of the law at the time was decidedly against the secretary on whether the evidence doctrine applied to conduct occurring after an employee termination.see carr woodbury county juvenile,declining to extend mckennon to misconduct that occurred after the employment relationship had ended sigmon parker chapin flattau klimpl,same ryder westinghouse,same but see medlock ortho biotech,cir stating that mckennon may permit certain limitations on relief based on conduct.
while the secretary developed a factual record that may have arguably been broad enough to encompass an evidence defense as it related to the impracticability or impossibility of reinstatement,he certainly never developed a legal or factual argument that the doctrine should preclude an award of front pay.thus,the district court had no opportunity to decide the issue now before this court,that is,whether the evidence doctrine should affect a plaintiff right to front pay when reinstatement is impracticable.the secretary waiver of this issue is apparent when examining the district court memorandum and order.the district court discussed the misconduct extensively in the section of the memorandum addressing reinstatement,but never me
