gary canova,virginia canova,ronald shelton,michael hodges and jimmie sexton collectively plaintiffs,current or former employees of imperial irrigation district the district,appeal a judgment entered in favor of the district,the trustees of imperial irrigation district employee pension plan and the board of directors of the imperial irrigation district employee pension plan collectively defendants after the trial court granted defendants motion for summary judgment based on plaintiffs failure to comply with the claim filing requirements of the government claims act,et the claims act,all undesignated statutory references are to this code.
in this case,we conclude that neither declaratory nor injunctive relief was not available and that mandamus could not be used to invalidate changes made to plaintiffs retirement plan because they had an adequate monetary remedy and were required to file a timely claim.mandamus,however,may be appropriate to attempt to invalidate defendants termination of plaintiffs defined benefit plan and compel defendants to perform their contractual duties under the defined benefit plan as this claim did not seek money or damages and did not require the filing of a government claim.accordingly,summary judgment of the entire action based on plaintiffs failure to comply with the claims act was improper.
factual and procedural background 
in,the district implemented the imperial irrigation district employee pension plan the pension plan as a defined benefit plan whereby benefit payments were only due and payable to participants upon retirement.benefit amounts under the pension plan did not become fixed until a participant retirement or separation from employment or the termination of the pension plan.before,employees participating in the pension plan received a monthly annuity upon retirement,with no lump sum option available.in,the district amended the pension plan to add a lump sum distribution option in addition to the annuity lump sum benefits were paid subject to a variable treasury bond interest rate,known as the gatt rate.
effective july,the district modified the pension plan to delete the variable gatt rate and adopt a fixed percent interest rate for employees choosing the lump sum option upon their retirement the rate amendment and add a new defined contribution plan the contribution plan,commonly known as a or a plan,which did not provide specific dollar benefits upon retirement.employees hired after july,had to participate in the contribution plan.
effective june,the district terminated the pension plan and gave participating employees the choice of transferring the lump sum value of their accrued benefits,plus an equity adjustment,into the contribution plan or receiving a deferred annuity payable upon retirement or separation.employees choosing the contribution plan received an employer contribution based on a percentage of their monthly base salary and could elect to contribute additional dollars.participants in the contribution plan had ten investment options to choose from and could only withdraw funds upon retirement or termination of their employment.
plaintiffs all chose to have their accrued benefits from the pension plan rolled directly into the contribution plan.in december,plaintiffs filed their original complaint,a proposed class action,alleging causes of action for breach of contract,accounting and breach of fiduciary duty based on the change,the rate amendment and the equity adjustment made after their accrued benefits were transferred into the contribution plan.the trial court sustained defendants demurrer to the complaint based on plaintiffs failure to properly comply with the claims act although it allowed plaintiffs leave to amend to seek relief.plaintiffs filed a government claim on february,but the claim was denied as untimely and they did not seek leave to present a late claim.
after more law and motion proceedings,plaintiffs filed a fourth amended complaint in april,seeking a writ of mandate or,alternatively,alleging breach of contract and impairment of contract in violation of the contract clause of the california constitution cal,art.i.it identifies two proposed classes those employees who received a lump sum distribution based on the rate amendment and employees who had their pension plan benefits rolled into the contribution plan using a percent equity adjustment,rather than a percent equity adjustment.the breach of contract cause of action alleges that defendants violated a contractual duty by adopting the rate amendment,and the contractual impairment claim asserts that defendants adoption of the rate amendment,termination of the pension plan and creation of the contribution plan were unreasonable and violated their ministerial duty under the contract clause of the california constitution.
plaintiffs allege that monetary damages would not provide adequate relief because their retirement benefits could not be restored to proper levels without forcing defendants to take a number of actions in the course of their official duties.accordingly,plaintiffs seek specific performance,injunctive or declaratory relief or mandamus and allege that compliance with the claims act was not required because they are not seeking money or damages or,alternatively,to the extent the action is deemed to seek money or damages,that such relief is secondary to the equitable relief sought.
the prayer for relief requests that the rate amendment be invalidated,the equity adjustment be recalculated and appropriate transfers be made into the contribution plan account of each plaintiff.alternatively,plaintiffs seek a writ of mandate declaring the rate amendment and rollover into the contribution plan invalid and an order requiring defendants to perform their contractual duties under the pension plan.
defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground the action was one for money or damages and was barred based on plaintiffs failure to properly comply with the claims act.the trial court granted the motion,concluding that the action was primarily one for damages and even assuming plaintiffs were entitled to equitable relief,the only result would be a present payment of money for plaintiffs direct benefit.it also concluded that plaintiffs claims accrued on june,when defendants terminated the pension plan,and all claims were barred based on plaintiffs failure to comply with the claims act.plaintiffs timely appealed.
discussion 
defendants moved for summary judgment,asserting that plaintiffs claims,although cast as ones for mandamus,declaratory or injunctive relief,actually sought monetary damages and were subject to the claims act.the trial court agreed and also concluded that plaintiffs were not entitled to a writ of mandate or declaratory relief.the question before us is whether plaintiffs failure to timely file a government claim precludes them from pursuing this action.although this issue comes to us on a motion for summary judgment,we need not engage in the traditional summary judgment analysis because the parties do not dispute the material facts underlying this issue.
as explained below,we agree that declaratory or injunctive relief is not available and that mandamus can not be used to invalidate the rate amendment or compel recalculation of the equity adjustment because plaintiffs had an adequate remedy at law via money damages and they were required to file a timely claim.mandamus,however,may be appropriate to attempt to invalidate the rollover and compel defendants to change the retirement plan back to the pension plan.this claim is not one for money or damages and did not require the filing of a government claim.accordingly,summary judgment of the entire action based on plaintiffs failure to comply with the claims act was improper.
under the claims act,no suit for money or damages may be brought against a public entity until a written claim has been presented to the entity and the claim either has been acted upon or is deemed to have been rejected.the purpose of the claims statutes is to provide a public entity with sufficient information to allow it to thoroughly investigation the matter facilitate settlemen
