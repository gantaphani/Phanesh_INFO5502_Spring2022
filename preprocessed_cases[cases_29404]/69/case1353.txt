the appellants are the parents of vanessa quinn,who was shot and killed by sulejman talovic in salt lake city on february.talovic purchased the gun that killed quinn from mackenzie glade hunter,who pleaded guilty to unlawfully transferring a firearm to a juvenile and being a drug user in possession of a firearm.in the district court the appellants,ken and sue antrobus,moved for quinn to be declared a victim of hunter crime of selling the gun.that designation would have given the antrobuses certain enumerated rights under the crime victims rights act of cvra,see,including the right to be heard at hunter sentencing hearing and the right to restitution.a,a.the district court denied the motion,concluding that quinn was not a victim of hunter crime as that term is defined in the cvra.the antrobuses petitioned this court for a writ of mandamus,as set forth under the cvra,to contest the district court order.see d.we denied the writ.in re antrobus,cir.
after the district court sentenced hunter to fifteen months imprisonment,the antrobuses filed a timely notice of appeal from his judgment of conviction and sentence.we hold that individuals claiming to be victims under the cvra may not appeal from the alleged denial of their rights under that statute except through a petition for a writ of mandamus as set forth by d.therefore,we dismiss this appeal.
background 
sometime during the summer of,hunter sold a handgun to talovic,who at the time was seventeen years old.on february,talovic entered the trolley square shopping center in downtown salt lake city,armed with the handgun from hunter,a shotgun,and ammunition for both.firing the weapons,he killed one person outside the mall and four more inside the mall.quinn,who had been shot twice with the handgun,was one of these victims.four other people were seriously wounded.talovic rampage ended when an police officer shot and killed him.
on may,a federal grand jury indicted hunter on two felony counts being a drug user in possession of a firearm,see g,and unlawfully transferring a firearm to a juvenile when knowing or having reason to know that the juvenile intended to use the firearm in committing a crime.see x id.a b ii.pursuant to a plea agreement,hunter pleaded guilty to the first count and to a new information that charged him with unlawfully transferring a firearm to a juvenile without any allegation about knowledge,a misdemeanor.see x id.a b i.the government agreed to drop the second count,to recommend that hunter receive full credit for acceptance of responsibility,and to recommend that hunter be sentenced at the low end of the range set forth by the united states sentencing guidelines.the district court accepted the agreement in november and set sentencing for january.
on december,the antrobuses moved under the cvra for quinn to be recognized as a victim of hunter unlawful transfer of a firearm.as the guardians of their deceased daughter,they sought,inter alia,the right to make a statement and the right to restitution see a,d.under the cvra,a crime victim is one who is directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a federal offense.id.e.
the district court concluded that quinn was not a victim of hunter criminal gun sale and therefore denied the antrobuses motion.the district court reasoned that the unlawful sale was not the proximate cause of quinn death because it was not foreseeable that talovic would use the gun in that manner.the court also noted the approximately eight month gap between the gun sale and talovic shooting spree.
the antrobuses then applied for a writ of mandamus under the cvra,see d,asking this court to declare their daughter a victim of hunter unlawful gun sale.in re antrobus,cir.applying the mandamus standard of review,this court stated the antrobuses right to the writ was not clear and indisputable.id.at.therefore,we denied the writ.id.
on january,the district court sentenced hunter to fifteen months in prison and dismissed count of the indictment,pursuant to the plea agreement.neither the government nor hunter appealed.the antrobuses,however,filed a timely notice of appeal.their brief states that they are appealing from the conviction and judgment entered by the d istrict c ourt sentencing mackenzie glade hunter to months in prison,as well as the district court denial of their motion to recognize vanessa quinn as a victim under the crime victims right s act.the government,supported by hunter,moved to dismiss the appeal because the antrobuses were not parties to the underlying criminal proceeding and therefore had no right to appeal from it.in the alternative,the government urges us to affirm the district court order.for the reasons explained below,we dismiss.
ii.discussion 
a crime victim does not have an express right under the cvra to appeal the defendant conviction and sentence based on alleged violations of the statute.rather,the cvra provides that if the district court denies a crime victim his rights,the victim may immediately petition the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus.d.the court of appeals must grant or deny the writ within hours.id.the government,however,may assert the victim rights in any appeal of the defendant conviction or sentence.see id.d in any appeal in a criminal case,the government may assert as error the district court denial of any crime victim right in the proceeding to which the appeal applies.see also in re antrobus,at while the cvra provides individuals seeking review of a district court victim status decision with mandamus review,it simultaneously affords the government with the ability to obtain ordinary appellate review of the same decision.
that the cvra does not provide for victim appeals is consistent with the precept that only parties to a lawsuit,or those that properly become parties,may appeal an adverse judgment.marino ortiz,d.see also united states wade,it is a general rule that may not appeal a criminal sentence awarded another.according to the government,this is not simply a prudential consideration that delimits the rights of litigants rather,it is a jurisdictional bar that inheres in.thus,the government argues that we do not have jurisdiction under and must dismiss the antrobuses appeal on that basis.
the government jurisdictional argument misses the mark.section limits our appellate jurisdiction to all final decisions of the district courts.it constrains what may be appealed,not who may bring such appeals.see bode clark equip,cir that appellant is a nonparty does not affect our consideration whether the order is appealable as a final judgment.whether a nonparty may appeal,either from an interlocutory order or from a final judgment,is a separate question.we therefore disagree with the government position that we lack jurisdiction under to consider this appeal.
the antrobuses central argument misses the mark for a similar reason.the format of their argument for a right to appeal traces our decision in united states hahn,cir en banc.in hahn,we held that a defendant who waived his rights under a specific sentencing statute had not waived his general right of appeal under.id.at.we stated that a specific statute does not repeal a more general statute absent a clearly expressed congressional intention.id.quoting branch smith,d.
the antrobuses argue that we have jurisdiction to hear their appeal under,and they rely on hahn in asserting that the cvra mandamus provision does not repeal the jurisdictional grant of.that argument fails,however,because it is based on the premise that appellate rights are founded in.actually,the issues of jurisdiction under and appellate rights are distinct.moreover,one can distinguish hahn by merely reading the first word of the opinion id.at.because the defendant in hahn was the appellant,that case does not address the appellate rights of.
our inquiry turns,then,to the issue of whether such as the antrobuses have the right to appeal following a criminal sentence.the antrobuses have cited several cases in which courts have heard appeals.we find these cases distinguishable.more important,we are aware of no precedent for allowing a appeal that would reopen a criminal case following sen
