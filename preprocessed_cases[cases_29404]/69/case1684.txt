declaring smoking to be the single most important source of preventable disease and premature death in california,the legislature in enacted a statute prohibiting cigarette companies from distributing cigarettes as free samples,as they might fall into the hands of children and lead them to become addicted to tobacco,and encouraging all persons to quit tobacco use.stats,ch,enacting former health,subd.a,repealed by stats,ch,and reenacted in as health,subd.a.this statute prohibits the nonsale distribution of cigarettes on public property,subd.b,except for public property leased for a private function to which minors are denied access,subd.f.each distribution of a single package to an individual member of the general public constitutes a violation and is punished by a civil penalty of not less than for one act,for two acts,and for each succeeding act,subd.d.
the trial court found that defendant tobacco company had violated section at six events in and assessed it a fine of.the court of appeal affirmed,and we granted defendant petition for review.
this appeal presents three issues.the first is whether defendant distribution of free cigarettes at a street fair and other events did not violate section because it occurred on property leased for a private function to which minors were denied access.the second is whether section is preempted by a federal statute that bars states from regulating the advertising or promotion of cigarettes.b.the third is whether the fine assessed against defendant violates state or federal constitutional provisions barring excessive fines,cal,art.i.each issue is a close and difficult one.
factual and procedural background 
the following facts are undisputed.at six different events held on public property between february and october of,defendant tobacco company gave away cartons and packages containing a total of packs of cigarettes to people.one event was the sunset junction street fair in los angeles the others were a motorcycle race at the del mar fairgrounds,an auto race at the los angeles county fairgrounds,a car show at verdugo park in los angeles,the san jose international beer festival,and the long beach jazz festival.on each occasion,defendant contracted with the event promoter to set up a booth or a tent.defendant posted security guards to bar minors from entering the booth or the tent.inside,defendant distributed cigarettes only to people who could prove that they were current smokers recipients had to show that they already had a pack of cigarettes and who presented identification showing that they were at least years old.defendant asked recipients to fill out a survey card on which the recipient agreed to be added to defendant mailing list and to receive promotional offers.
the state attorney general sued defendant in,charging it with violating section at the six events.the parties stipulated to the pertinent facts relating to defendant practices at the six events,and filed for summary judgment.the trial court found that federal law did not preempt section and that defendant violated that statute by distributing cigarettes on public property.it entered a judgment fining defendant the court of appeal affirmed the judgment in a decision.we granted defendant petition for review.
ii.the safe harbor provision of health and safety code section,subdivision f 
section,subdivision b,provides it is unlawful for any person,agent,or employee of a person in the business of selling or distributing smokeless tobacco or cigarettes from engaging in the nonsale distribution of any smokeless tobacco or cigarettes to any person in any public building,park or playground,or on any public sidewalk,street,or other public grounds italics added.a p ublic building,park,playground,sidewalk,street,or other public grounds is defined as any structure or outdoor area that is owned,operated,or maintained by any public entity,including,among other things,streets and sidewalks,parade grounds,fair grounds,and public recreational facilities,subd.c.
section,subdivision f,the safe harbor provision,operates as an exception to the prohibition of section,subdivision b.subdivision f states that the prohibition on nonsale distribution of tobacco products does not apply to any public property leased for private functions where minors are denied access by a peace officer or licensed security guard on the premises.
the attorney general first contends that notwithstanding defendant posting of security guards to exclude minors and nonsmokers from its tents and booths,the safe harbor provision does not protect defendant conduct because defendant did not lease the sites where it distributed cigarettes instead,according to the attorney general,defendant occupancy right to those sites is more properly described as a license or permit.defendant,however,points out that the law relating to leases of public property,the general leasing law pub.resources code,et,states as used in this chapter public resources code,division,part,chapter,lease includes a permit,easement,or license.because health and safety code section,the statute at issue here,is not part of the chapter containing the general leasing law,it is not governed by the definitions set forth in the general leasing law.we agree with defendant,however,that it is unlikely that the legislature intended that a cigarette company right to distribute free cigarettes would depend on the technical character of the cigarette distributor it falls into the category of a lease,a license,or a that has no bearing on the harm caused by the free distribution of cigarettes,an express concern of the legislature.
the attorney general primary contention,however,is that defendant did not exclude minors from the property within which cigarettes were distributed.as we noted earlier,the safe harbor provision,subd.f allows distribution within any public property leased for private functions where minors are denied access adopting the court of appeal construction of that statutory language,the attorney general argues that in the context of this case the safe harbor provision would apply only if minors were excluded from the event within which defendant was distributing free cigarettes,not merely from defendant booth or tent where cigarettes were distributed.defendant disagrees,contending that the statutory phrase pertaining to public property leased for private functions ibid.refers only to the specific site it leased and from which it distributed cigarettes.
when,as here,the statutory language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation,we look to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.people jefferson cal th,d,quoting granberry islay investments cal th,d.
both parties argue that the legislative history of section supports their position.the attorney general notes that in,state senator doris allen suggested to state senator marian bergeson,the author of senate bill reg.sess.which later became section,that the bill be amended to allow portions of public grounds used for a private function to be exempt from the statutory prohibition on free distribution of cigarettes.senator bergeson rejected that proposal.according to the attorney general,this exchange shows that the legislature rejected the view that a safe harbor could consist of a portion of public grounds used for a private function.not so.the legislature did not vote on senator allen proposed amendment and there is no evidence that other legislators were even aware of the exchange between senator allen and senator bergeson.see california teachers san diego community college dist.cal d.
defendant contends that the legislative history of section supports its position.it points to a third reading analysis of senate bill reg.sess,prepared by the senate staff,that stated the language about public facilities leased for private functions suggests that booths,tents or barricaded areas may be used for sampling if there is a uniformed guard present.reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.this analysis of senate bill is a document that the legislators had the opportunity to consult in enacting that bill,and hence it could be relevant to determining the legislators intent.see jevne superior court cal th,d.but the language of the analysis,although relevant,is not highly persuasive,because it merely suggests one possible interpretation of section without indicating that the suggested interpretation is what the legislators actually intended.
thus,the legislative history of section contains little that specifically addresses the scope of subdivision f safe harbor provision.subdivision f,however,is but one part of section,and the legislature,in subdivision a of section,has set out specifically the findings and intent underlying the statute as a whole 
smoking is the single most important source of preventable disease and premature death in california.
despite laws in at least states prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors,each day children start using tobacco products in this nation.children under the age of years consume million packages of cigarettes in this country yearly.
the earlier a child begins to use tobacco products,the more likely it is that the child will be unable to quit.
more than percent of all smokers begin smoking by the age of years,and percent begin by the age of years.
tobacco product advertising and promotion are an important cause of tobacco use among children.more money is spent advertising and promoting tobacco products than any other consumer product.
distribution of tobacco product samples and coupons is a recognized source by which minors obtain tobacco products,beginning the addiction process.
it is the intent of the legislature that keeping children from beginning to use tobacco products in any form and encouraging all persons to quit tobacco use shall be among the highest priorities in disease prevention for the state of california.
when the legislature has expressly declared its intent,we must accept the declaration.tyrone kelley cal d,see friends of mammoth board of supervisors cal d,souvannarath hadden th,d barker brown williamson tobacco th,d.consequently,we must here construe section,subdivision f safe harbor provision,allowing the free distribution of cigarettes on public property leased for private functions where minors are denied access,to conform to the legislature express intent to keep children from beginning to use tobacco products and to encourage all persons to quit using tobacco,subd.a.because free distribution of cigarettes encourages tobacco use,and in particular is a recognized source by which minors obtain tobacco products,subd.a,a statutory interpretation that restricts the free distribution of cigarettes conforms to the legislative purpose.when,as in this case,a civil statute is enacted for the protection of the public,it must be broadly construed in favor of that protective purpose.people ex rel.lungren superior court cal th,d.
we note that after defendant distribution of free cigarettes in,the legislature in amended section to extend the prohibition on nonsale distribution of cigarettes to any private property that is open to the general public stats,ch,amending section,subdivision b,which had previously only prohibited free distribution of cigarettes on public property.the legislature also added a new safe harbor provision for private property open to the general public,stating that the statutory prohibition on nonsale distribution of cigarettes does not apply to any private property that is open to the general public where minors are denied access to a separate nonsale distribution area by a peace officer or licensed security guard stationed at the entrance of the separate nonsale distribution area and the separate nonsale distribution area is enclosed so as to prevent persons outside the separate nonsale distribution area from seeing the nonsale distribution unless they undertake unreasonable efforts to see inside the area,subd.g.
thus,section now contains two safe harbor for public property,subd.f and one for private property,subd.g with significantly different wording.the safe harbor provision for public property permits free distribution of cigarettes on public property leased for private functions where minors are denied access by a peace officer or licensed security guard on the premises,subd.f.the safe harbor provision for private property open to public use permits free distribution of cigarettes where minors are denied access to a separate nonsale distribution area enclosed to prevent persons outside that area from observing the distribution,subd.g.
what is the significance of the difference between the two safe harbor provisions when the legislature uses materially different language in statutory provisions addressing the same subject or related subjects,the normal inference is that the legislature intended a difference in meaning.people trevino cal th,d,see people gardeley cal th,d.subdivision g of section,as we have noted,permits free distribution of cigarettes within a separate nonsale distribution area carved out from the whole of the property open to public use,thereby making it clear that minors need not be excluded from the entire property,but only from a portion of that property.subdivision f of section,on the other hand,applies only if minors are denied access to public property leased for private functions.reading the two provisions together,and mindful of the rule of construction that significant differences in language imply a difference in meaning,it is reasonable to conclude that the legislature intended to impose greater restrictions on cigarette distribution on public property than on private property,and hence that subdivision f should be construed to require that minors be excluded entirely from a private function that is held on leased public property.
defendant contends that interpreting the public property safe harbor provision,subd.f to require exclusion of minors from the event,and not merely from its own booth or tent,will effectively preclude it from distributing free cigarettes at street fairs,festivals,and other large public events,and will as a practical matter limit the safe harbor provision to smaller affairs with limited attendance where exclusion of minors is feasible.but this limitation appears to be exactly what the legislature intended when it made the safe harbor provision applicable only to public property leased for private functions,subd.b,italics added.the legislature has enacted other safe harbor provisions that,like section,subdivision f,refer to private functions for instance,health and safety code section,subdivision a,requires nonsmoking areas in restaurants except for banquet rooms in use for private functions business and professions code section,subdivision a prohibits the sale of alcohol at a marine park except during private events or private functions and business and professions code section permits wineries to sell other producers beers,wines,and brandies,but only during private events or private functions not open to the general public.in each of these provisions,the context suggests that by private functions the legislature primarily had in mind parties,receptions,meetings,and similar gatherings.accordingly,it is reasonable to infer that the phrase private functions in section,subdivision f,does not include fairs,festivals,and similar events open to the general public unless minors are excluded from the entire event.so limiting the events at which cigarettes may be freely distributed furthers the legislature goals to keep children from starting to use tobacco products and to encourage smokers to quit,subd.a.
in accord with the legislature expressed declarations and purpose,we construe section as banning nonsale distribution of cigarettes at events held on public property where adults and minors are present.we next consider whether section is preempted by federal law.
iii.preemption 
the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act fclaa prohibits states from regulating the advertising or promotion of cigarettes.fclaa,hereafter section.the issue here is whether a tobacco company free distribution of cigarettes is a form of promotion that states can not regulate.the united states supreme court has not construed the term promotion in the federal act,but in a number of recent cases it has described the scope of federal preemption of state laws,including two cases construing the term advertising in the federal act.lorillard tobacco reilly,d lorillard cipollone liggett group,d cipollone.we will review the text and history of the fclaa,analyze the leading united states supreme court cases,and then apply the principles established by those cases.
a.the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act 
the fclaa,enacted by congress in,prohibits manufacturing,packaging,or importing for sale or distribution any cigarettes whose package fails to bear specified surgeon general warnings.the phrase sale or distribution includes sampling or any other distribution not for sale.
the preemption provision of the federal act prohibited states from requiring tobacco companies to add statements relating to smoking and health to cigarette labels or advertising that were not required by federal law.see stat.in,however,congress amended the fclaa to require stronger warnings of the dangers of smoking,and it banned cigarette advertising in any medium of electronic communication subject to the jurisdiction of the federal communications commission.at the same time,congress expanded the scope of federal preemption by amending section b in the federal act to provide no requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under state law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.italics added.at issue here is whether section,by banning state regulation of the promotion of cigarettes,prohibits a state from regulating the free distribution of cigarettes.
although there is considerable congressional history explaining the enactment of the fclaa and the amendments to that act,it all concerns the effects of smoking on health.there is nothing to explain why congress,which in preempted states only from regulating cigarette advertising,amended the fclaa in to bar state regulation of advertising or promotion.and there is nothing in the congressional history to explain what congress meant to include within the term promotion,as used in section of the federal act.
defendant here contends that the plain meaning of promotion in section includes the nonsale distribution of a product to induce recipients to try the product.defendant points to various instances in which free distribution of product samples has been described as a promotional activity.the federal trade commission report to congress,for example,described the distribution of cigarette samples and specialty gift items as sales promotion activities.jones vilsack cir.and the surgeon general report stated promotional activities can take many forms,including f ree samples.of health human services,preventing tobacco use among young people a report of the surgeon general.also,defendant notes,two federal courts have held that the plain meaning of promotion in section includes the distribution of free samples.jones vilsack,supra,rockwood city of burlington d.
the problem with defendant contention that the plain meaning of section bars any state regulation of the free distribution of cigarettes is that,as defendant concedes,it is clear that congress did not intend section to preempt state regulation of the distribution of cigarettes to minors.to the contrary,congress has required states to ban tobacco distribution to minors as a condition of receiving federal funds for substance abuse treatment.see mangini reynolds tobacco cal th,d.there is no language in section,however,that distinguishes between distribution to minors and distribution to adults.hence,the state attorney general here contends that the only way to effectuate congress intent to bar distribution of cigarettes to minors is to draw a line distinguishing between promotion and distribution.under this theory,states could not regulate actions intended to persuade persons to smoke a particular defendant brand of cigarettes,but it could regulate the actual transfer of the cigarettes not only to minors but also to adults.
we examine below defendant contention that the plain meaning of section bars state regulation of the free distribution of cigarettes and the attorney general contention that section should be construed to distinguish between promotion and distribution so as to permit states to regulate distribution.
united states supreme court decisions 
no united states supreme court decision defines the term promotion in section or describes its preemptive scope.both parties,however,rely on the high court decisions involving related preemption issues,and both can point to language in those cases supporting their positions.as justice scalia of the united states supreme court has observed,the court members do not agree on the relative weight to be given to legislative context and history in the construction of federal statutes.engine mfrs.ass south coast air quality mgmt.dist,d.some justices put primary emphasis on the literal meaning of the statutory language others put greater emphasis on the legislative context and history.
cipollone,supra,d,decided in,was the first decision construing the fclaa.the issue there was whether the ban on state regulation of advertising in section preempted state common law actions accusing tobacco companies of failing to warn of the dangers of smoking,of fraudulent advertising,of breaching warranties that asserted that the use of cigarettes had no significant health consequences,and of conspiring to deprive the public of scientific and medical data showing the dangers of tobacco use.in a divided opinion,the high court held that the federal act preempted only the causes of action based on failure to warn of the dangers of tobacco use,but permitted the other causes of action.
justice stevens opinion,joined by chief justice rehnquist,justice white,and justice,stated in our opinion,the scope of the act and the act is governed entirely by the express language in each act.cipollone,supra,at.he noted that the preemption provision in the federal act spoke precisely and narrowly id.at,but that the plain language of the provision in the act is much broader id.at.preemption provisions,however,must be construed in light of the presumption against the of state police power regulations.id.at.
justice stevens concluded in cipollone that the fclaa preemption of state regulation of advertising and promotion did not preempt common law actions for breach of warranty,even though the warranty appeared in the cigarette company advertising,because a state law enforcing a warranty voluntarily undertaken by the company was not the same as a requirement imposed by state law.justice stevens also found no preemption of common law claims charging intentional fraud because the common law rule allowing tort actions for fraud was not a law primarily based on concerns about smoking and health.in reaching the latter conclusion,justice stevens relied on the stated purposes of the fclaa and a senate report that said t he preemption of regulation or prohibition with respect to cigarette advertising is narrowly phrased to preempt only state action based on smoking and health.it would in no way affect the power of any state with respect to the taxation or the sale of cigarettes to minors,or the prohibition of smoking in public buildings,or similar police regulations.cipollone,supra,at,fn,quoting,italics omitted.
justice blackmun,joined by justices kennedy and souter,wrote separately.justice blackmun asserted that w e do not,absent unambiguous evidence,infer a scope of beyond that which clearly is mandated by congress language.cipollone,supra,at.conc.opn.of blackmun.he concluded that there was no evidence of unambiguous congressional intent to preempt any common law causes of action.
justice scalia,joined by justice thomas,took the opposite view,asserting o ur job is to interpret congress decrees of neither narrowly nor broadly,but in accordance with their apparent meaning.cipollone,supra,at.conc.dis.opn.of scalia.in justice scalia view,all common law causes of action were preempted.
because justice stevens plurality opinion in cipollone relied on both the plain meaning of the fclaa and the context and purpose of that enactment,both parties here assert that cipollone supports their position.defendant points out that the four justices who signed justice stevens opinion chief justice rehnquist and justices white,stevens,and,as well as dissenting justices scalia and thomas,supported the use of plain meaning analysis the attorney general claims that seven justices the four justices who signed justice stevens opinion,plus justices blackmun,kennedy and souter,who wrote separately supported reliance upon legislative context and purpose.
another of the high court decisions discussed by the parties is medtronic,lohr,d medtronic.there,the issue was whether the medical device amendments mda of preempted state lawsuits for negligence and strict liability against a manufacturer of pacemakers.although the preemptive language of the mda does not parallel that of the fclaa,the high court decision in medtronic not to follow a plain meaning interpretation of statutory language when it found that interpretation inconsistent with the congressional purpose underlying the statute bears on our resolution of a similar issue here.
the plurality opinion in medtronic,supra,d,written by justice stevens and joined by justices kennedy,souter,and ginsberg,found no preemption of state law.it reasoned that because the purpose of the mda was to impose more stringent regulation on the makers of medical devices,it would be contrary to the congressional purpose to grant that industry an immunity from liability for defective devices enjoyed by no other industry.justice breyer,who supplied the fifth vote for the result,said that in some instances the statutory language would preempt state remedies,but did not do so in that case.medtronic,supra,at.justice,joined by chief justice rehnquist,justice scalia,and justice thomas,dissented,asserting that the plain language of the mda supported preemption.id.at.
in,the united states supreme court returned to the matter of interpreting the fclaa prohibition on state regulation of advertising in lorillard,supra,d.acting under the authority of a state statute banning unfair or deceptive trade practices,the massachusetts attorney general had issued regulations that,among other things,barred outdoor advertising of cigarettes within feet of schools,parks,or playgrounds writing for the majority,justice,joined by chief justice rehnquist and justices scalia,thomas,and kennedy,held that section preempted the massachusetts regulations justice stevens dissented,joined by justices souter,ginsberg,and breyer.
the lorillard majority rejected the state argument that federal preemption was limited to the content of advertising,not its location the distinction can not be squared with the language of the provision,which reaches all requirements and prohibitions imposed under state law.a distinction between the content of advertising and the location of advertising in the fclaa also can not be reconciled with congress own restriction,which bans advertising in electronic media,but not elsewhere.lorillard,supra,at.the majority also rejected the massachusetts attorney general contention that the state regulations were not based on smoking and health because they targeted only smoking by minors id.at.at bottom,the concern about youth exposure to cigarette advertising is intertwined with the concern about cigarette smoking and health.id.at.
the lorillard majority,however,recognized that s tates remain free to regulate conduct with respect to cigarette use and sales.lorillard,supra,at.lorillard also stated t he fclaa does not state laws prohibiting cigarette sales to minors having prohibited the sale and distribution of tobacco products to minors,the state may prohibit common inchoate offenses that attach to criminal conduct,such as solicitation,conspiracy,and attempt.id.at,italics added.
the united states supreme court decisions we have discussed agree that in determining whether federal legislation preempts state law,c ongressional purpose is the ultimate touchstone of our inquiry.lorillard,supra,at.when congress enacted the fclaa in,it explained its purpose in preempting state regulation to ensure that commerce and the national economy are not impeded by diverse,nonuniform,and confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations with respect to any relationship between smoking and health.b.congress amendment of the fclaa did not alter this statement of purpose.
state regulation of nonsale distribution of cigarettes would not conflict with the congressional purpose just described.although national commerce in cigarettes would be substantially impeded if a tobacco company cigarette labeling and advertising had to be altered to comply with the laws of every state,that is not the case for state regulation of free distribution of cigarettes.moreover,although congress has enacted extensive legislation governing cigarette advertising,and has authorized the federal trade commission ftc to impose further regulations,congress has never enacted any comprehensive laws governing nonsale distributions nor authorized the ftc to do so.in view of the health hazards of smoking expressly recognized by congress see,it would be unreasonable to conclude that congress intended nonsale distribution of cigarettes to continue entirely without regulation.
actions by congress after its amendment of the fclaa also bear on the scope of the act preemption of state law.while subsequent legislation interpreting a statute can not change the meaning of the earlier enactment,it does supply an indication of the legislative intent which may be considered together with other factors in arriving at the true intent existing at the time the legislation was enacted.citation.russ.partnership city and county of san francisco cal d,accord,aguimatang california state lottery d.see consumer product safety gte sylvania,fn,d.
first,in congress enacted legislation requiring states to prohibit nonsale distribution of cigarettes to minors as a condition of receiving federal aid for state programs to treat substance abuse.this enactment shows that congress did not regard the fclaa as barring state regulation of nonsale distribution of cigarettes to minors.
second,in congress enacted a law requiring all federal agencies to prohibit nonsale distribution of tobacco in or around any federal building.stat.defendant here points out that congress has the power to require certain conduct by federal agencies while prohibiting such conduct by state agencies.see engine mfrs.ass south coast air quality mgmt,supra,at,fn.federal statute bars states from imposing certain emission requirements in purchasing vehicles,even though federal agencies are required to follow similar standards.but it is difficult to conceive of a coherent policy that would bar nonsale distributions in or around federal buildings yet preclude states from barring such distributions on state property.
third,although the fclaa does not describe what powers are retained by the states,the high court in lorillard asserted that congress intended that the s tates remain free to regulate conduct with respect to cigarette use and sales.lorillard,supra,at.if the fclaa bar on state regulation of the promotion of cigarettes extends to barring state regulation of distribution,that prohibition could not logically be confined to nonsale distribution.discount sales of cigarettes,sales accompanied by rebate offers,and the distribution of coupons entitling a holder to receive free or discounted cigarettes could equally be considered a form of promotion of cigarette sales and use.thus,such a broad definition would infringe on the state retained powers to regulate cigarette use and sales.
indeed,in terms of smoking adverse effect on health,there is very little distinction between the sale of cigarettes at full retail price,the sale of cigarettes at discounted prices,and the free distribution of place cigarettes in the hands of the public.the fclaa itself does not draw a distinction between sales of cigarettes and free distributions it requires labeling of any package in which cigarettes are offered for sale or otherwise distributed to consumers,and it defines the term sale or distribution as including sampling or any other distribution not for sale.
defendant tobacco company contends that if the fclaa ban on state regulation of promotion of cigarettes does not include a ban on state regulation of free distribution of cigarettes,it will have little effect.defendant acknowledges that section will still ban state regulation of promotional activities,such as sponsorship of sports events,that do not involve free distribution of cigarettes.but defendant argues that free distribution of cigarettes is the most important method of promoting cigarettes sales and use,because permitting a prospective consumer to try a product and judge its quality is the best way to induce the customer to buy the product.
defendant argument actually points to the significant distinction between free distribution on the one hand,and a sports event sponsorship or similar promotional activity on the other.because it involves distributing cigarettes directly to the recipient,instead of merely trying to induce the recipient to purchase cigarettes,free distribution of cigarettes presents the more immediate risk of use.distribution of cigarettes in any form,whether free of charge,sold at a discount,or sold at full retail price,creates the same health hazard,and should be equally subject to state regulation.
i t is equally well established that c onsideration of issues arising under the supremacy clause start s with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states are not to be superseded by federal act unless that is the clear and manifest purpose of congress.dowhal smithkline beecham consumer healthcare cal th,d,quoting the high court decision in cipollone,supra,at.see bates dow agrosciences llc,d.the high court majority opinion in lorillard supra,at,and the plurality opinions in both medtronic supra.at.and cipollone supra.at.all endorse that principle we here find no clear and manifest purpose of congress to bar state regulation of the nonsale distribution of cigarettes to minors or adults.
iv.excessiveness of fine 
subdivision d of section provides that anyone violating this section is liable for a civil penalty of not less than two hundred dollars for one act,five hundred dollars for two acts,and one thousand dollars for each subsequent act constituting a violation.each distribution of a single package,coupon,or rebate offer is considered a separate violation.ibid.based on defendant tobacco company distribution of free cigarettes at six events in,the trial court fined defendant.
defendant argued in the trial court that it had attempted in good faith to comply with section.defendant and the attorney general exchanged letters in early november of concerning defendant plan to distribute cigarettes at auto races in pomona on november through.defendant offered to locate its booth within an opaque tent with no signage of any nature on the outside of the tent.defendant added we will,of course,continue to guard rigorously access to the tent so that only smokers years of age or older can enter.the attorney general responded this addresses our concerns about the booths as a locus of tobacco advertising and as a source of youth exposure visual and auditory to free sampling activity.we appreciate your making this important change in your marketing and promotional practices.
defendant maintains that these letters show that in,when the events at issue occurred,the attorney general considered defendant conduct to be protected by the safe harbor provision,section,subdivision f,which protects distribution on leased property from which minors are excluded.it claims that the attorney general later change of position and filing of charges took defendant by surprise.defendant also accuses the attorney general of delaying,until,initiation of legal action against defendant to induce it to continue to distribute free cigarettes at various events,because under section,subdivision d,each distribution would increase the amount of the fine defendant might have to pay.
the trial court,however,concluded that g iven the mandatory nature of the fines,defendant good faith is irrelevant.the court of appeal agreed,rejecting defendant contention that the amount of the fine violated the federal and state constitutions.
the eighth amendment to the united states constitution states excessive bail shall not be required,nor excessive fines imposed,nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.italics added.the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution makes the eighth amendment prohibition against excessive fines and cruel and unusual punishments applicable to the states.citation.the due process clause of its own force also prohibits the states from imposing grossly excessive punishments cooper industries,leatherman tool group,d.
the california constitution contains similar protections.article i,section,prohibits cruel or unusual punishment and excessive fines article i,section,prohibits the taking of property without due process of law.
the court of appeal here addressed separately whether the fine was unconstitutionally excessive and whether it denied defendant due process.a separate analysis of the two constitutional provisions is,however,unnecessary.due process analysis can be important when a defendant claims that a punitive damage award is unconstitutional,because the united states supreme court has held that the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment to the federal constitution does not apply to punitive damages.industries of,kelco disposal,d.but here the case involves a civil penalty subject both to the state and the federal constitutional bans on excessive fines as well as state and federal provisions barring violations of due process.it makes no difference whether we examine the issue as an excessive fine or a violation of due process.
the leading united states supreme court case on the eighth amendment prohibition of excessive fines is united states bajakajian,d bajakajian,which involved a federal statute a requiring any person transporting more than out of the united states to file a report with the united states customs service.bajakajian attempted to take out of the country without filing a report.the government claimed that the entire was forfeited.
the high court pointed out that t he touchstone of the constitutional inquiry under the excessive fines clause is the principle of proportionality.bajakajian,supra,at.it then set out four considerations the defendant culpability the relationship between the harm and the penalty the penalties imposed in similar statutes and the defendant ability to pay.id.at.see city and county of san francisco sainez th,d sainez.after reviewing those considerations,the high court held that the forfeiture of bajakajian currency constituted an excessive fine barred by the eighth amendment.
also pertinent here is this court decision in hale morgan cal d.it involved civil code section,providing for a civil fine of a day against any landlord who willfully deprived a tenant of utility services for the purpose of evicting the tenant.hale had moved his trailer into morgan mobile home park without morgan permission,but the parties agreed that hale could stay if he paid rent.hale never paid any rent,however,and eventually morgan cut off hale utility services.when hale finally moved out,services had been disconnected for days,so the trial court assessed a fine of.we held the fine violated the due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions,citing considerations similar to those the united states supreme court discussed in its decision in bajakajian,supra,d.see hale morgan,supra,cal d at.justice newman concurrence in hale expressed the view that the fine also violated the state constitutional provision barring excessive fines.id.at,conc.opn.of newman.
here,the court of appeal followed the high court propor
