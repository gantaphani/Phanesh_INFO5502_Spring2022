this case arises from the early termination of an employment contract between plaintiff,patrick swier,and defendant,delaware bay surgical services,dbss.after a bench trial,the superior court awarded compensatory and liquidated damages,costs and attorney fees under the wage payment and collection act wpca dbss appeals the superior court award of liquidated damages,costs and attorney fees to swier under the wpca because the final payment was not wages and it had reasonable grounds to dispute the final payment.swier the superior court ruling that he must pay liquidated damages to dbss because he contends the contract provided for an impermissible termination penalty.
we affirm the judgment against swier because the contract language was a permissible liquidated damages provision.we reverse the judgment against dbss because the wpca does not apply when a party has reasonable grounds to dispute a claim arising under the employment at issue.here,dbss deducted the liquidated damages due from swier final compensation payment,and therefore had reasonable grounds to dispute the final payment to swier.
in march swier began working at dbss.section of the contract set swier compensation at fifty percent of all his monthly collected receipts,adjusted by the salary advanced and expenses incurred for that month.the employment contract anticipated it would begin in march and last for two years.
swier did not sign a employment contract until june.both parties were represented by counsel.section of the contract provided for a payment of by whichever party terminated the contract early.section of the contract provided 
termination without cause.this agreement may be terminated by either party upon one month prior written notice.
in recognition of the expenses incurred by employer in employing employee and introducing employee to the medical community,and aiding the procurement by beebe medical center,of certain equipment needed by employee to perform certain procedures at the hospital,if employee terminates this agreement prior to the end of its term,employed agrees to pay employer an early termination penalty equal to.
if employer terminates employee prior to the completion of this agreement,for reasons other than for good cause,as defined above,the employer agrees to pay the employee an early termination penalty equal to.
regarding a final payment for compensation and expenses,section d of the contract provided in part 
upon termination of this agreement,all draw payments shall cease.if this agreement was terminated for reasons other than good cause as defined in paragraph,the employee shall be entitled to a final payment equal to of all collected receipts,for the period from the date of this agreement to days subsequent to the date of termination,less all salary and reimbursed expense payments made throughout this same period.the amount collected shall be payable to employee days subsequent to the date of termination.if this calculation results in a negative amount draws in excess of salary earned then this negative amount shall be repaid to the employer by employee days subsequent to the date of termination.
by letter dated february,swier gave notice to katz of termination of the agreement effective one month from the date of receipt of this notice.
on july,the practice administrator at dbss calculated the final compensation due to swier from dbss under section of the agreement at,then subtracted the due from swier to dbss under section.she sent a letter to swier requesting the balance of.swier refused to pay,and this lawsuit followed.
the superior court found that swier had terminated the agreement early and that he owed in the liquidated damages.the superior court then ruled for swier when it held that dbss improperly withheld wages from swier in violation of the wpca the court ordered dbss to pay swier in wages plus as a penalty under section b of the wpca and attorney fees.
we will first address swier and then the wpca claims.swier appeals the superior court ruling that the provision in section was a valid liquidated damages provisions and not an unenforceable penalty dbss appeals the holding that it violated the wpca by not paying swier when it had reasonably calculated that he owed the balance of all obligations to dbss because the final payment was not wages under the wpca and it had reasonable grounds to dispute the final payment.
the validity of a liquidated damages provision involves a review of the intent of the parties to the contract.if the parties intended that the payment be a penalty,it is legally unenforceable because contract law does not allow parties to impose a penalty for early termination contract law allows parties to establish only a good faith estimation of actual damages sustained as a result of a contract termination.in deliveries tristate courier carriage,the distinction between a penalty and a valid liquidated damages claim was explained 
liquidated damages are a sum to which the parties to a contract have agreed,at the time of entering into the contract,as being payable to satisfy any loss or injury flowing from a breach of their contract.it is,in effect,the parties best guess of the amount of injury that would be sustained in a contractual breach,a way of rendering certain and definite damages which would otherwise be uncertain or not easily susceptible of proof.by contrast,a penalty is a sum inserted into a contract that serves as a punishment for default,rather than a measure of compensation for its breach.in other words,it is an agreement to pay a stipulated sum upon breach,irrespective of the damage sustained.the distinction between a penalty and a liquidated damages clause is a provision is considered a penalty,it is void as against public policy and recovery is limited to actual damages if the provision is a true liquidated damages provision,it will be enforced according to its terms 
we review this issue as a mixed question of law and fact.determining the intent of the parties is a question of fact.we review the superior court factual findings to ensure they are supported by sufficient evidence and are the result of a logical and orderly deductive process.ordinarily,we review de novo a question of contract interpretation as a question of law.
swier did not object to the liquidated damages provision at trial.in fact,he relied on it when he requested that the superior court award him liquidated damages claiming that dbss breached.while failure to object at trial does not bar him from raising the issue on appeal,our review is limited to plain error.
in analyzing a contract provision that requires payment in the event of termination,we apply the rule from lee builders wells.this court has explained that 
in lee builders wells,a case involving a liquidated damages provision,the court of chancery articulated the following test for analyzing the validity of the amount of liquidated damages where the damages are uncertain and the amount agreed upon is reasonable,such an agreement will not be disturbed.
to be a valid liquidated damages provision under the first prong of the test,the damages that would result from a breach of the merger agreement must be uncertain or incapable of accurate calculation 
t o fail the second prong of lee builders,the amount at issue must be unconscionable or not rationally related to any measure of damages a party might conceivably sustain 
swier contends that,ex ante,the damages were easy to calculate with accuracy,definiteness,and certainty.swier also contends that we should not consider any of the expenses incurred between the time performance commenced in march and when the contract was actually signed several months later.swier finally contends that dbss breached the agreement first.
based on the testimony presented at trial there was sufficient evidence that calculation of damages at the time of contract for a breach one year later was uncertain or incapable of accurate calculation.the evidence showed that was a reasonable forecast,rationally related and not unconscionable,given katz testimony regarding the expenses dbss incurred as a result of hiring swier.we find no merit to swier conte
