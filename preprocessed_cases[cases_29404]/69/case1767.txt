the city of los angeles city appeals judgment granting a peremptory writ of mandate in favor of robert lanigan,a former los angeles police officer.the trial court reinstated lanigan to his employment,finding a settlement of pending disciplinary charges by the city against lanigan,pursuant to which he agreed to resign if similar misconduct charges were upheld in the future and gave up his right to pursue an administrative appeal,constituted an impermissible waiver of his rights under the public safety officers procedural bill of rights act pobra government code,et we hold that a waiver of pobra protections is permissible in the context of a settlement of a pending disciplinary action.
factual background and procedural history 
lanigan first disciplinary charges and settlement 
on april,officer lanigan was and wrongly driving his personal vehicle in the carpool lane when a los angeles unified school police department lauspd officer stopped him.lanigan was investigated for and ultimately charged on april,with three misconduct allegations arising from his interaction with the lauspd officer,including harassment and refusal to comply.the chief of police the chief referred lanigan to the board of rights bor with a proposed penalty of termination lanigan received notice of the proposed disciplinary action on april.
before the bor hearing commenced,lanigan attorney,randall quan,negotiated a settlement agreement agreement with the lapd.during the negotiations for the agreement with the city,quan stated to sergeant raymond jatkowski,the officer in charge of the lapd internal affairs group disciplinary settlement unit dsu,that quan goal was to prevent lanigan from appearing before a bor because quan believed the board would terminate lanigan for his conduct.accordingly,quan advised lanigan to sign the agreement.
under the agreement,which had no expiration date,in exchange for the city reduction of lanigan penalty to a day suspension,lanigan agreed to specific future discipline in the event of additional disciplinary charges being filed against him on the basis of a specific category of future misconduct,and agreed to waive several of his rights under pobra.
in particular,lanigan agreed to immediately resign from the lapd if he acquires any future complaints,while on off duty,based on actions that occur after signing this agreement,where he engages in any acts of harassment toward any officer s of an outside agency fails to cooperate with any on duty officer s of an outside agency which are sustained by the chief of police.lanigan agreed to submit a signed letter of resignation,which would be held in abeyance and not executed unless he violates the terms and conditions of this agreement.he confirmed he understood that,should he fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this agreement,his letter of resignation from the lapd previously submitted shall immediately take effect.lanigan further accept ed his penalty to be served at a time determined by the chief of police,agreed in advance to a factual basis for said discipline and penalty,and acknowledge d that the charges sustained and the discipline imposed will be reflected in his personnel record 
lanigan also made promises regarding future remedies,agreeing to forego legal or administrative remedies,and explicitly waive d all rights and remedies available either under the charter or state law in order to effectuate this agreement.he release d and forever discharge d the city from any and all past,present or future claims,and damages,including all claims or damages which he does not know or suspect to exist at the time of this agreement and lanigan agreed t his release and discharge shall be a fully binding and complete settlement between the parties to this agreement.
furthermore,lanigan confirmed that before signing this agreement,he has consulted with an attorney of his own choosing regarding the release of any such claims that he may have as a result of the alleged acts or omissions of the city and has been advised that he has days to consider this agreement and seven days after the date on which he signs this agreement within which to revoke it.moreover,he agreed that by signing the agreement he knowingly and intentionally waives the period for consideration and the revocation period.in the agreement last clause,lanigan confirmed that he had the opportunity to seek the advice of his counsel of choice regarding the terms,that those terms are fully understood and voluntarily accepted by each of the parties.
lanigan signed the agreement and resignation on february.at the time lanigan signed the agreement,sergeant jatkowski,who did not pressure or coerce lanigan to sign the agreement,did not recall lanigan making any statements to the effect that he felt pressured or under duress or otherwise had any hesitation at all in signing the agreement.
lanigan second disciplinary charges and resignation pursuant to the agreement 
on september,lanigan entered an emergency room seeking treatment for lacerations to his right hand.due to his behavior at the hospital,lanigan sustained new misconduct counts as set forth in the september,complaint.the new complaint alleged that lanigan entered the hospital intoxicated,unnecessarily identified himself as an officer,terrified other patients,and exhibited discourteous conduct that caused the hospital staff to call the los angeles county sheriff department lasd.the complaint further alleged that he lied to the lasd deputies,claiming he had been dropped off at the hospital by a friend and that his keys belonged to that friend.on september,deputy chief kirk albanese subsequently charged lanigan with providing false information and failing to cooperate with an lasd officer.
on september,the chief of police sustained the complaint,processed lanigan resignation pursuant to the agreement,and removed lanigan from employment.
lanigan petition for peremptory writ of mandate 
on december,lanigan filed a petition for writ of mandate to obtain judicial review of the lapd decision.lanigan argued that the agreement was unenforceable because it purported to waive statutory rights under pobra enacted for a public purpose and was therefore contrary to law and public policy,and the agreement was procedurally and substantively unconscionable.lanigan petition sought a peremptory writ commanding the city to reinstate him in good standing,award full back pay,and remove the record of misconduct charges and proposed penalties,or alternatively,to remand the case to the city with an order for a bor hearing.
lanigan argued that pursuant to civil code section the right to an administrative appeal under pobra was established for a public purpose and is thus not subject to a blanket waiver,relying on farahani san diego community college dist.th,farahani where the court held a professor could not waive the disciplinary protections of the education code.lanigan further contended that the agreement was procedurally unconscionable because the lapd forced him to either sign the agreement or risk termination,and that the agreement was also substantively unconscionable because the agreement gave the lapd and the chief unfettered discretion to determine when the contingent event under the agreement would occur,subjecting him to forced resignation.
in response,the city alleged that the petition should be denied because the agreement did not contain an invalid waiver of pobra rights relying on county of riverside superior court cal th,madrigal,where the court held pobra was subject to a limited waiver.the city distinguished farahani on the basis that the education code contained an express ban on disciplinary rights waivers,while pobra did not.in addition,the city argued lanigan failed to provide evidence of fraud,mistake,undue influence,or duress,and contended the agreement was not procedurally unconscionable because lanigan attorney had the opportunity to negotiate the terms,and it was not substantively unconscionable because lanigan obtained an immense benefit from the agreement the opportunity to save his job with certainty by eliminating the possibility of his termination after a bor hearing.
in reply,lanigan contended that farahani,supra,th was controlling because both pobra and the education code are laws established for a public purpose and were subject to the ban on waivers of such rights under civil code section.lanigan also argued that the madrigal,supra,cal th decision was limited to its facts and did not encompass an indefinite waiver of the right to appeal disciplinary action that had not yet occurred.finally,lanigan argued that the agreement was not enforceable because it was not made with sufficient awareness of the likely consequences.
the trial court granted lanigan petition,reasoning that the lanigan situation was indistinguishable from farahani,supra,th and held that the agreement was unenforceable and void.as a result of its ruling,the court did not reach the issues of whether the agreement was signed involuntarily and whether the agreement was unconscionable.the court issued a writ ordering the city to set aside its acceptance of lanigan resignation,reinstate him to his position as an officer in good standing,and take further action as enjoined by law this appeal followed.
discussion 
the city contends that the agreement waiver of pobra rights is valid,the agreement release of all claims is enforceable because it was not the product of fraud,mistake,undue influence,or duress,and the agreement is not unconscionable.lanigan contends the agreement is unenforceable because pobra rights are not waivable the release is not enforceable because the agreement is invalid as a matter of law and it is unconscionable based on the parties unequal bargaining positions and because the agreement improperly gave the chief of police unfettered discretion to terminate him if the condition were triggered.we find that the agreement is enforceable,and reverse.

ii.a waiver of pobra protections is permissible in the context of a settlement of a pending disciplinary action 
pobra explicitly declares that its purpose is to promote effective law enforcement by maintaining stable relations in law enforcement agencies.pobra,initially enacted in stats,ch,sets forth a list of basic rights and protections which must be afforded all peace officers by the public entities which employ them,and is a catalog of the minimum rights the legislature deems necessary to secure stable relations.baggett gates cal d.the various procedural protections provided by pobra balance the public interest in maintaining the efficiency and integrity of the police force with the police officer interest in receiving fair treatment.citation.mays city of los angeles,supra,cal th at.these rights include limits on and guidelines for investigations and interrogations of public safety officers in connection with disciplinary proceedings,the right to an administrative appeal and a statute of limitations for investigations,the right to notification of adverse comments placed in his or her personnel file and the right to comment thereon,the right to inspection of personnel files,the right to refuse to submit to a lie detector test,and the right to the protections of pobra,subd.a.
waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right after knowledge of the facts.roesch de mota cal d.civil code section provides any one may waive the advantage of a law intended solely for his benefit.but a law established for a public reason can not be contravened by a private agreement.nonetheless,statutory benefit may be waived if the statute does not prohibit waiver,the statute public purpose is incidental to its primary purpose,and the waiver does not seriously undermine any public purpose the statute was designed to serve.sharon superior court cal th,sharon.
madrigal,supra,cal th held that the provisions of pobra are not subject to a blanket waiver because pobra was established for a public purpose,recognizing labor unrest and work stoppage among police officers pose an obvious threat to the health,safety and welfare of the citizenry id.at.in madrigal,the supreme court evaluated the validity of an officer preemployment waiver of his right under pobra to view confidential documents prepared in connection with a routine background investigation of the officer who was transitioning from one law enforcement agency to another.id.at.the court concluded such a waiver was permissible and consistent with civil code section because the waiver was limited to the right to view background files by an employee who was already peace officer at the time of the waiver.id.at.
the officer in madrigal,supra,cal th obtained employment with the county of riverside as a lateral placement when his prior employer,the city of perris,discontinued its police department and contracted with the county for law enforcement within its boundaries.id.at.in connection with his change in employment,the officer waived his right to view his background report prepared by the county this release expired after one year.madrigal also signed a document entitled waiver of background investigation prior to hire,in which he acknowledged that his employment with the county was contingent upon completion of the background investigation,and if any information uncovered in the investigation was negative,the officer employment would be terminated.id.at.as a result of its investigation,the county dismissed the officer without giving him reasons for its action.ibid.
the court reasoned that i f law enforcement agencies could routinely require applicants to waive their prospective rights under pobra as a condition of employment,these employers could render pobra nugatory all new peace officers,essentially forcing these officers to opt out of the act before they even begin work.that result would be inconsistent with civil code section.id.at.however,to be enforceable,the waiver must be a voluntary and knowing act done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.id.at.
madrigal,supra,cal th reasoned the officer waiver of pobra was permissible because it was limited to the officer background investigation files,and concerned an officer who was on probationary status.id.at.a waiver of this kind raises a different issue than a blanket waiver.section requires peace officers to meet certain minimum standards including being of good moral character,as determined by a thorough background investigation,subd.d.if the minimum standards are to have any real meaning,a candidate has to meet the standards prior to becoming a peace officer.in other words,a law enforcement agency can not first grant peace officer status to a civilian,including full peace officer powers,and then conduct its background investigation.therefore,we think a waiver of this kind should only be sought in the case of an officer,like madrigal,who is already a peace officer at the time of the waiver and is merely applying to transfer from one agency to another id.at.
madrigal,supra,cal th stands for the proposition that under certain circumstances,a peace officer protected by pobra may waive those protections consistent with civil code section.while madrigal did not establish the precise boundaries of permissible waivers of pobra,other cases have permitted a waiver of statutory and other protections where the waiver is obtained as a quid pro quo for settlement of disciplinary charges 
in alhambra police officers city of alhambra police th alhambra police officers assn,an alhambra police officer was charged with misconduct arising out of the investigation of another officer.after an administrative hearing,in exchange for negotiated discipline,the officer gave up his right to an appeal before the city civil service commission.his agreement included findings that the disciplinary charges were sustained and that he agreed to the discipline imposed.id.at.in sum,the officer negotiated a settlement by which he received less severe discipline in exchange for admitting misconduct and waiving his right to appeal the discipline to the civil service commission.id.at.
the officer later sought to set aside the discipline on the grounds of,among other things,violations of pobra.alhambra police officers,supra,th at.the court refused to set aside the officer discipline.the police officer avoided the risk of a more severe penalty dismissal by settling and accepting lesser discipline.he may not,through an action under pobra,avoid the discipline to which he consented.id.at see also zazueta county of san benito th,zazueta officer who agreed to arbitration of disciplinary proceedings may not obtain judicial review through petition for writ of mandate stermer board of dental examiners th,stermer.
in zazueta,supra,th,a sheriff engaged in sexual harassment and was terminated.the county termination notice advised him that he could either appeal to the board of supervisors,or submit to an arbitration pursuant to a memorandum of understanding mou between the county and the sheriff department.id.at.the sheriff elected to submit the matter to arbitration,and in the arbitration proceedings contended the sheriff department had violated pobra during its investigation of him.the arbitrator upheld the sheriff termination,and he sought writ review in the superior court to overturn the arbitration findings pursuant to an exception in the mou,and contended that the narrow circumstances permitting review of an arbitrated termination was a contract of adhesion.id.zazueta denied relief,finding that the sheriff elected not to pursue his administrative remedies by appealing to the board of supervisors.p etitioner chose the forum in which to resolve his dispute with the county.had he wished to submit resolution of his statutory rights to judicial review,he could have done so.id.at.further,zazueta found that the sheriff waived any deficiencies in the mou by failing to raise them in the arbitration.ibid.
similarly,in stermer,supra,th,a dentist stipulated to a settlement of pending disciplinary charges before the board of dental examiners arising from misdemeanor domestic violence offenses by admission of the charges,acceptance of revocation of his license,and agreement not to challenge the settlement in the superior or appellate court.id.at.after the dentist conviction was vacated in a habeas corpus proceeding and the board of dental examiners refused to vacate his discipline,he sought writ review of the stipulated revocation of his license.id.at.stermer refused to set the discipline aside on the grounds of mistake of fact.the court found that at the time of the stipulation,the conviction existed and its later vacation by writ of habeas corpus did not constitute a mistake of fact.instead,the dentist received the full benefit of his bargain he proceeded with the settlement,despite the rejection of his proposal that the stipulation and order be deemed void if the habeas corpus petition was granted.by doing so,he avoided the hearing,the allegations of drug use,and the possibility of a more severe penalty.id.at.
these cases support the principle that peace officers protected by pobra may waive those protections when faced with disciplinary proceedings,provided that any settlement is a voluntary and knowing act done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.madrigal,supra,cal th at.we conclude that here,the agreement meets the requirements of madrigal.
first,lanigan waiver of the protections of pobra did not contravene civil code section.lanigan was not faced with a preemployment,blanket waiver of pobra rights.like the officer in madrigal,lanigan was already a peace officer at the time of the waiver madrigal,supra,cal th at.but the city position here is stronger than that of the county in madrigal because lanigan made his waiver postemployment,and not as a condition of being hired.indeed,in the context of disciplinary proceedings,lanigan was faced with a choice appear before the bor,and in his attorneys opinion face certain termination,or sign the agreement.by signing the agreement,lanigan enjoyed the benefits of continued employment,subject only to the happening of a future contingent event that was within his control.while he enjoyed such continued employment,lanigan never sought to void the agreement.thus,lanigan only complaint can be that he engaged in conduct triggering the condition of the agreement requiring him to resign,and he may not now avoid the discipline to which he consented.
second,the undisputed facts show that lanigan waiver was knowingly made with sufficient knowledge of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.lanigan was aware that if he did not sign the agreement,he would appear before a bor.although termination as a result of such an appearance was not a certainty,it was in quan opinion highly likely.on the other hand,by signing the agreement lanigan was aware he could enjoy continued employment with the lapd,but only on condition that he accept resignation and loss of certain pobra rights as a consequence of his conduct.by signing the agreement he acknowledged that he was doing so voluntarily and with a full understanding of its consequences.
ii.the agreement was not the product of fraud,mistake,undue influence,or duress 
settlements of disciplinary proceedings are binding in the absence of a showing of fraud,mistake,undue influence,or duress.alhambra police officers,supra,th at skrbina fleming companies th,written release valid unless obtained by fraud,deception,duress,undue influence,or misrepresentation.the doctrine of economic duress can form a basis for rescission of a settlement agreement.see rich whillock,ashton development,d.however,the courts,in desiring to protect the freedom of contracts and to accord finality to a privately negotiated dispute resolution,are reluctant to set aside settlements and will apply economic duress only in limited circumstances and as a last resort.san diego hospice county of san diego th,quoting rich,at.when a party pleads economic duress,that party must have had no reasonable alternative to the action it now seeks to avoid generally,agreeing to contract.if a reasonable alternative was available,and there hence was no compelling necessity to submit to the coercive demands,economic duress can not be established.crosstalk productions,jacobson th.
here,lanigan can not establish he had no reasonable alternative to signing the agreement.although he contends he signed the agreement under fear of losing his career and livelihood,lanigan could have exercised his right to appear before a bor.although quan believed lanigan would have been terminated had he appeared before the bor,lanigan termination was not a certainty.under these circumstances,he can not show duress.further,lanigan acknowledged in signing the agreement he had days to consider this agreement and seven days after the date on which he sign ed within which to revoke it.by signing the agreement,he knowingly and intentionally waive d the period for consideration and the revocation period.lanigan signed the agreement after five days and did not revoke it within the period.
iii.the agreement
