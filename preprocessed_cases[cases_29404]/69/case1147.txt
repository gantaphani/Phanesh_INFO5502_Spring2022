this is a putative class action challenging origination and foreclosure procedures for home loans maintained within the mortgage electronic registration system mers.the plaintiffs appeal from the dismissal of their first amended complaint for failure to state a claim.in their complaint,the plaintiffs allege conspiracies by their lenders and others to use mers to commit fraud.they also allege that their lenders violated the truth in lending act tila,et,and the arizona consumer fraud act,and committed the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress by targeting the plaintiffs for loans they could not repay.the plaintiffs were denied leave to file their proposed second amended complaint,and to add a new claim for wrongful foreclosure based upon the operation of the mers system.
on appeal,the plaintiffs stand by the sufficiency of some of their claims,but primarily contend that they could cure any pleading deficiencies with a newly amended complaint,which would include a claim for wrongful foreclosure.we are unpersuaded that the plaintiffs allegations are sufficient to support their claims.although the plaintiffs allege that aspects of the mers system are fraudulent,they can not establish that they were misinformed about the mers system,relied on any misinformation in entering into their home loans,or were injured as a result of the misinformation.if anything,the allegations suggest that the plaintiffs were informed of the exact aspects of the mers system that they now complain about when they agreed to enter into their home loans.further,although the plaintiffs contend that they can state a claim for wrongful foreclosure,arizona state law does not currently recognize this cause of action,and their claim is,in any case,without a basis.the plaintiffs claim depends upon the conclusion that any home loan within the mers system is unenforceable through a foreclosure sale,but that conclusion is unsupported by the facts and law on which they rely.because the plaintiffs fail to establish a plausible basis for relief on these and their other claims raised on appeal,we affirm the district court dismissal of the complaint without leave to amend.
the focus of this lawsuit and many others around the country is the mers system.
how mers works 
mers is a private electronic database,operated by merscorp,that tracks the transfer of the beneficial interest in home loans,as well as any changes in loan servicers.after a borrower takes out a home loan,the original lender may sell all or a portion of its beneficial interest in the loan and change loan servicers.the owner of the beneficial interest is entitled to repayment of the loan.for simplicity,we will refer to the owner of the beneficial interest as the lender.the servicer of the loan collects payments from the borrower,sends payments to the lender,and handles administrative aspects of the loan.many of the companies that participate in the mortgage industry by originating loans,buying or investing in the beneficial interest in loans,or servicing loans are members of mers and pay a fee to use the tracking system.see jackson mortg.registration.
when a borrower takes out a home loan,the borrower executes two documents in favor of the lender a promissory note to repay the loan,and a deed of trust,or mortgage,that transfers legal title in the property as collateral to secure the loan in the event of default.state laws require the lender to record the deed in the county in which the property is located.any subsequent sale or assignment of the deed must be recorded in the county records,as well.
this recording process became cumbersome to the mortgage industry,particularly as the trading of loans increased.see robert dordan,mortgage electronic registration systems mers,its recent legal battles,and the chance for a peaceful existence,loy.pub.int.it has become common for original lenders to bundle the beneficial interest in individual loans and sell them to investors as securities,which may themselves be traded.see id.at jackson,at.mers was designed to avoid the need to record multiple transfers of the deed by serving as the nominal record holder of the deed on behalf of the original lender and any subsequent lender.jackson,at.
at the origination of the loan,mers is designated in the deed of trust as a nominee for the lender and the lender successors and assigns,and as the deed beneficiary which holds legal title to the security interest conveyed.if the lender sells or assigns the beneficial interest in the loan to another mers member,the change is recorded only in the mers database,not in county records,because mers continues to hold the deed on the new lender behalf.if the beneficial interest in the loan is sold to a member,the transfer of the deed from mers to the new lender is recorded in county records and the loan is no longer tracked in the mers system.
in the event of a default on the loan,the lender may initiate foreclosure in its own name,or may appoint a trustee to initiate foreclosure on the lender behalf.however,to have the legal power to foreclose,the trustee must have authority to act as the holder,or agent of the holder,of both the deed and the note together.see landmark bank kesler.the deed and note must be held together because the holder of the note is only entitled to repayment,and does not have the right under the deed to use the property as a means of satisfying repayment.id.conversely,the holder of the deed alone does not have a right to repayment and,thus,does not have an interest in foreclosing on the property to satisfy repayment.id.one of the main premises of the plaintiffs lawsuit here is that the mers system impermissibly splits the note and deed by facilitating the transfer of the beneficial interest in the loan among lenders while maintaining mers as the nominal holder of the deed.
the plaintiffs lawsuit is also premised on the fact that mers does not have a financial interest in the loans,which,according to the plaintiffs,renders mers status as a beneficiary a sham.mers is not involved in originating the loan,does not have any right to payments on the loan,and does not service the loan.mers relies on its members to have someone on their own staff become a mers officer with the authority to sign documents on behalf of mers.see dordan,loy.pub.int.at jackson,at.as a result,most of the actions taken in mers own name are carried out by staff at the companies that sell and buy the beneficial interest in the loans.id.
the named plaintiffs 
the three named plaintiffs in this case,olga cervantes,carlos almendarez,and arturo maximo,obtained home loans or refinanced existing loans in.all three signed promissory notes with their lenders cervantes with countrywide home loans,and almendarez and maximo with first franklin.each executed a deed of trust in favor of his or her lender,naming mers as the beneficiary and as the nominee for the lender and lender successors and assigns.
all three plaintiffs are hispanic,and almendarez and maximo do not speak or read english.almendarez and maximo negotiated the mortgage loans with their lenders in spanish,but were provided with,and signed,copies of their loan documents written in english.
the plaintiffs subsequently defaulted on their loans.following cervantes default,trustee recontrust company initiated foreclosure proceedings by recording a notice of a trustee sale in the county records.the parties have not addressed the status of the noticed sale.following defaults by almendarez and maximo,their lender,first franklin,appointed lasalle bank as its trustee to initiate nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings.mers recorded documents with the county assigning its beneficial interest in the deeds of trust to la salle bank.later,michael bosco of tiffany bosco was substituted in as first franklin trustee.michael bosco sold almendarez house at public auction in february.the sale of maximo property was cancelled in april.
procedural history 
cervantes filed suit in march.almendarez and maximo joined the lawsuit,and the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint a few days later.the first amended complaint names several defendants,including the plaintiffs lenders,the trustees for the lenders,mers,and mers members who are named only as based on their role in using the mers system.the defendants filed several motions to dismiss,prompting the plaintiffs to file a motion for leave to amend,along with a proposed second amended complaint.the district court held a hearing on the various motions,at which the plaintiffs orally proposed to amend their complaint with a wrongful foreclosure claim.the district court granted the motions to dismiss the first amended complaint,and denied the motion for leave to amend on the ground that amendment would be futile.the plaintiffs appeal.

the plaintiffs challenge the dismissal of their complaint without leave to amend but,on appeal,only address the district court dismissal of their claim for conspiracy to commit fraud through the mers system failure to address their oral request for leave to add a wrongful foreclosure claim dismissal of trustee tiffany bosco from the suit denial of leave to amend their pleadings regarding equitable tolling of their tila and arizona consumer fraud act claims and dismissal of their claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.we address these claims in turn,and do not consider the dismissed claims that are not raised on appeal.entm t research group genesis creative group,cir we will not consider any claims that were not actually argued in appellant opening brief.
conspiracy to commit fraud through the mers system 
on appeal,the plaintiffs contend that they sufficiently alleged a conspiracy among mers members to commit fraud.in count seven of the first amended complaint,they allege that mers members conspired to commit fraud by using mers as a sham beneficiary,promoting and facilitating predatory lending practices through the use of mers,and making it impossible for borrowers or regulators to track the changes in lenders.
under arizona law,a claim of civil conspiracy must be based on an underlying tort,such as fraud in this instance.baker ex rel.hall brake supply,stewart title trust of phoenix.to show fraud,a plaintiff must identify a representation its falsity its materiality the speaker knowledge of its falsity or ignorance of its truth the speaker intent that it be acted upon by the recipient in the manner reasonably contemplated the hearer ignorance of its falsity the hearer reliance on its truth the right to rely on it and his consequent and proximate injury.echols beauty built homes.
the plaintiffs allegations fail to address several of these necessary elements for a fraud claim.the plaintiffs have not identified any representations made to them about the mers system and its role in their home loans that were false and material.none of their allegations indicate that the plaintiffs were misinformed about mers role as a beneficiary,or the possibility that their loans would be resold and tracked through the mers system.similarly,the plaintiffs have not alleged that they relied on any misrepresentations about mers in deciding to enter into their home loans,or that they would not have entered into the loans if they had more information about how mers worked.finally,the plaintiffs have failed to show that the designation of mers as a beneficiary caused them any injury by,for example,affecting the terms of their loans,their ability to repay the loans,or their obligations as borrowers.although the plaintiffs allege that they were deprived of the right to attempt to modify their toxic loans,as the true identity of the actual beneficial owner was intentionally hidden from them,they do not support this bare assertion with any explanation as to how the operation of the mers system actually stymied their efforts to identify and contact the relevant party to modify their loans.thus,the plaintiffs fail to state a claim for conspiracy to commit fraud through the mers system,and dismissal of the claim was proper.
while the plaintiffs allegations alone fail to raise a plausible fraud claim,we also note that their claim is undercut by the terms in cervantes standard deed of trust,which describe mers role in the home loan for example,the plaintiffs allege they were defrauded because mers is a sham beneficiary without a financial interest in the loan,yet the disclosures in the deed indicate that mers is acting solely as a nominee for lender and lender successors and assigns and holds only legal title to the interest granted by borrower in this security instrument.further,while the plaintiffs indicate that mers was used to hide who owned the loan,the deed states that the loan or a partial interest in it can be sold one or more times without prior notice to borrower,but that i f there is a change in loan servicer,borrower will be given written notice of the change as required by consumer protection laws.finally,the deed indicates that mers has the right to foreclose and sell the property.by signing the deeds of trust,the plaintiffs agreed to the terms and were on notice of the contents.see kenly miracle,explaining that a deed of trust is an essentially private contractual arrangement.in light of the explicit terms of the standard deed signed by cervantes,it does not appear that the plaintiffs were misinformed about mers role in their home loans.
moreover,amendment would be futile.in their proposed second amended complaint,the plaintiffs seek to add further detail concerning how mers works in general and how it has facilitated the trade in securities.but none of the new allegations cure the first amended complaint deficiencies the plaintiffs have not shown that they received material misrepresentations about mers that they detrimentally relied upon.accordingly,we affirm the district court dismissal,without leave to amend,of the claim for conspiracy to commit fraud through the mers system.
wrongful foreclosure 
the plaintiffs contend that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing their complaint without leave to add a wrongful foreclosure claim.the only mention of a wrongful foreclosure claim was during the hearing on the plaintiffs motion for leave to amend and the defendants motions to dismiss.although the plaintiffs expressed their intention to add a wrongful foreclosure claim,they failed to include it in their proposed second amended complaint.moreover,during the hearing,the plaintiffs stated only a general theory of the claim they posited that any foreclosure on a home loan tracked in the mers system is wrongful because mers is not a true beneficiary.as the plaintiffs describe it on appeal,their claim is that the mers system was used to facilitate wrongful foreclosure based on the naming of mers as the beneficiary on the deed of trust,which results in the note and deed of trust being split and unenforceable.
the plaintiffs oral request to add a wrongful foreclosure claim was procedurally improper and substantively unsupported.the district court local rules require the plaintiffs to submit a copy of the proposed amended pleadings along with a motion for leave to amend.see.civ.the plaintiffs failed to do so.further,they failed to provide the distr
