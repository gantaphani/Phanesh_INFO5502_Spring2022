this case comes to us following a bench trial that resulted in a judgment against the.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the district court judgment in all respects.
background 
factual history 
appellee kathleen lentini is a quadriplegic and uses a wheelchair for mobility.at all relevant times,lentini had a small,black shih mix named jazz.jazz functions as lentini service dog by providing minimal protection and retrieving small dropped items 
appellant california center for the the center is a public benefit corporation,founded to promote the advancement of artistic entertainment and education.at all relevant times,appellant alan corbin was the center house manager,and appellant randall vogel was the director of center sales and event services.at all relevant times,the center had a written policy stating that animals are not permitted in the theater,except for certified assistance animals accompanying people with disabilities.certified meant any animal officially trained to assist a person with a disability.the center also had an unwritten policy that ticket takers were to admit any recognizable service animals without any questions recognizable animals were those wearing an outer garment or some other identifying device.
lentini attended approximately ten or eleven events at the center with jazz during the center and seasons.on each of these occasions,she was initially told that she could not enter the center with her dog.however,after she explained that jazz was a service dog,lentini and jazz were both admitted.
in october,lentini and jazz attended an carlos nakai concert at the center.during intermission,jazz either yipped or barked when an individual approached lentini jazz made no further noises after lentini advised jazz that it was okay.vogel was on duty at this performance.he believed that he heard a dog bark,but he did not feel a need to stop the disturbance.he did not mention the noise to lentini despite the fact that he spoke with her after the concert about parking issues and a lack of a ramp for disabled persons.no patrons complained about the incident.
also in october,lentini and jazz attended a performance of the music man at the center.during intermission,jazz again yipped or emitted a small barking noise when individuals seated nearby were returning to their seats and jazz apparently perceived them to be in his and lentini territory.again,once lentini advised jazz that everything was okay,he made no further noises.no complaints were made to center staff.but at some point prior to january,vogel instructed center staff not to let lentini back in with her dog.
on january,lentini and jazz attempted to attend a dance performance at the center entitled tango buenos aires.on that night,corbin was the house manager on duty.he told lentini that she could not enter the theater with jazz.although lentini explained that jazz was a service dog,corbin still refused admittance to lentini and jazz because of jazz barking at the two prior performances notwithstanding corbin refusal,lentini entered the theater with jazz.corbin spoke with bruce beers,the center director of operations.beers believed that jazz was the dog that vogel had heard at the carlos nakai concert.he recommended that corbin tell the center security staff to instruct lentini to remove jazz from the premises and,if she refused,to call the escondido police to have the dog removed.
center security officer aaron sale spoke with lentini and told her that she was not permitted to bring her dog into the concert hall.sale told her that she could attend the performance if she left jazz in the car.apparently this was not an option because of cold weather that night.moreover,lentini and jazz work as a team and placing jazz in the car would disrupt the bond that was created between them as a result of jazz training.
when lentini refused to leave the premises with jazz,the center staff called the escondido police department at corbin direction.escondido police officers joe creed and paul woodward came and spoke with lentini and corbin.corbin told them that lentini was not allowed in the theater with jazz because the dog had caused a prior disturbance.corbin stated that lentini could attend the performance if she put jazz in her car.these conversations occurred in a calm manner,and jazz made no disturbances at that time.nevertheless,the attempted mediation by the police officers failed,and corbin indicated that he was prepared to sign a citizen arrest in order to have lentini arrested and removed from the premises.upon learning this,lentini agreed to leave in exchange for a promised refund of her tickets.
immediately after this incident,lentini suffered from severe body shakes,which created difficulty in steering her wheelchair.lentini required the assistance of her companion,richard maciel,before she was able to drive safely home.on or about february,the center sent lentini her refund and included a brochure for the upcoming performance season.
procedural history 
lentini filed suit against the center,corbin,vogel,and does through on august.her complaint included claims under title iii of the americans with disabilities act,et the ada,under california unruh and disabled persons acts,california civil code et,et,and et,and for negligence.the complaint included additional claims for declaratory and injunctive relief.
on for summary judgment,the district court disposed of claims related to architectural barriers in the center as well as lentini claim that she was acting on behalf of all persons similarly situated.a bench trial was held between march and april.on august,the district court filed its findings of fact and conclusions of law,finding in favor of lentini on all counts except for her claims of retaliation and negligence.
in addition to detailed findings of fact that related to the general chronology of events,the district court made findings of fact that related specifically to the discriminatory treatment lentini suffered at the center on january.among them,the district court found that corbin had told lentini that only dogs were allowed in the theater and that corbin refused to listen to lentini explanation that jazz was her service dog.the court found that,in both a house manager report written on january,as well as in conversation with tina ostrem,the assistant director of sales,corbin stated that lentini was excluded and the police were called because lentini failed to produce her tickets at the door and the performance was being mentioning the fact that jazz had previously created a disturbance.the court found that vogel told ostrem the same story.the court found corbin and vogel explanation regarding tickets,not to mention untrue.the district court found that corbin,vogel,and other staff members had simply did not jazz was a service animal,and the court found that corbin true reason for excluding lentini was his mistaken belief that jazz was not a service animal.moreover,the court found that corbin used beer recommendation to call the police as an affirmation of his already existing desire to eject lentini 
the district court also made a number of findings regarding the effect of admitting service animals on the center.in this context,the court found that the center principle business of generating revenue for the support of its museum,education,outreach and access programs is a highly laudable purpose.moreover,it found that diminished revenue due to a loss of patrons or artists would negatively impact the center core business.the court found that yipping is an acceptable service behavior although,in certain instances,it may be inappropriate.it concluded that a service dog who barks during a performance for an improper or inappropriate reason would disrupt performing artists and likely disturb and disgruntle other patrons.it would also deprive the center of the advantages it has over other concert halls due to its intimate setting and wonderful acoustics.
the court found that the center had an unwritten policy to exclude service animals that have made sounds at prior events regardless of the level of the noise and regardless of whether the animal noises were made for a legitimate reason,such as alerting its owner of an oncoming medical emergency or dangerous condition.however,the court found that the center did not have a similar policy applicable to humans to exclude a human who made a noise at a prior event for similar reasons or an individual who suffered a medical emergency or condition that caused him or her to make a noise or scene that might have disrupted the performance.the noises jazz made at the carlos nakai concert and the music man performance were,the court determined,intended to alert lentini to a possibly dangerous situation.
the district court ordered the center to modify its policies to give persons with disabilities the broadest feasible access to the center.the focus of this appeal is a portion of the order regarding admittance of service animals 
the center policies,practices and procedures may not exclude a service animal who has made a noise on a previous occasion,even if such behavior is disruptive,if the noise was made and intended to serve as means of communication for the benefit of the disabled owner or if the behavior would otherwise be acceptable to the center if engaged by humans.
the district court held the appellants jointly and severally liable to lentini for,representing the statutory minimum of for each of the performances lentini was deterred from attending as a result of the appellants discrimination the district court held corbin individually liable to lentini for,and it held vogel individually liable to lentini for.although premised at least in part on ada violations,all of these awards were made pursuant to the unruh act because it found that the appellants actions were not willful or malicious,the district court did not award punitive damages.

a.the ordered modification of the center policies 
the appellants contend that the ordered modification of the center policies is unnecessary and unreasonable and will fundamentally alter the services and facilities provided by the center 
title iii of the ada establishes that n o individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations of any place of public accommodation a.discrimination is defined as,among other things,a failure to make reasonable modifications in policies,practices,or procedures,when such modifications are necessary to afford such goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations to individuals with disabilities b a ii.the department of justice has issued regulations stating that,g enerally,a public accommodation shall modify policies,practices,or procedures to permit the use of a service animal by an individual with a disability.c.by this regulation the department of justice intended that the broadest feasible access be provided to service animals in all places of public accommodation pt,app.b at.however,the failure to make such modifications does not constitute discrimination where the entity can demonstrate that making such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of such goods,services,facilities,privileges,advantages,or accommodations b a ii.the supreme court has clarified that the statute contemplates three inquiries whether the requested modification is reasonable,whether it is necessary for the disabled individual,and whether it would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods,services.pga tour,martin,d quoting b a ii.
reasonable and necessary 
the appellants argue that the ordered modifications are not reasonable or necessary.see b a ii.they contend that the center prior policies already accommodated individuals with disabilities and that those policies represent the fewest possible restrictions on access of service animals.they further contend that the modifications are not necessary to accommodate lentini because on january she had a human companion who could have assisted her and because the center had special ushers available to assist lentini.we find that the modification is both reasonable and necessary.
reasonable 
t he determination of what constitutes reasonable modification is highly,requiring inquiry.crowder kitagawa,cir.here,there is abundant evidence that the district court weighed the center concerns and lentini needs.the ordered modification strikes a and balance between these two allowing access for service animals but providing that they can be excluded under certain circumstances.this is clearly in line with the ada.see pt,app.b at department of justice statement that it intends that the broadest feasible access be provided to service animals in all places of public accommodations.
the only real issues of reasonableness involve practical concerns relating to the implementation of the modification.the first of these is the requirement that the center make comparisons between human and animal behavior.the district court ordered that the center may not exclude service animals that make noise,if the behavior would otherwise be acceptable to the center if engaged by humans.the appellants contend that this test is impossible to apply.in this respect,the appellants submitted testimony about the way in which yipping or barking at the same decibel level as a human noise such as coughing would be more disruptive because it is an unexpected sound in a performance space.
clearly,humans generally do not bark like dogs and dogs generally do not cough like humans.but that does not render the ordered modification unreasonable.the order requires a general comparison of disruptiveness,and this does not seem an especially difficult task.for instance,the acceptability of a given or be gauged by patrons responses.in this case,no patron complained on the two occasions that jazz made noise in the center it seems clear that jazz behavior was not disruptive.
the second practical issue relates to the requirement that the center staff determine the intent of the service animal.the district court ordered that the center could not exclude service animals that make noise,if the noise was made and intended to serve as means of communication for the benefit of the disabled owner the record in this case clearly demonstrates that the intent of a service animal is something that can be sufficiently discerned by circumstantial evidence.for instance,the district court specifically found that t he sounds emitted by jazz during the nakai concert and the music man performance were yips meant to alert lentini of a possibly dangerous situation.
therefore,we find that neither of these practical concerns renders the modification unreasonable.
similarly,we find that the appellants have failed to demonstrate that the ordered modification is not necessary.jazz has made noise at performances in the past and would be subject to exclusion under the center prior policy.because of the bond lentini maintains with jazz,she does not have the option of separating from jazz for the duration of a concert.the modification is therefore necessary because,but for the modification,lentini would effectively be excluded from future performances at the center.martin pga tour,cir use of a golf cart is also necessary there was ample evidence to support the district court finding that martin could not walk the course,even with artificial aids.the fact that lentini had an companion at the january performance does not alter this conclusion nowhere have the appellants claimed that lentini must always bring a human companion to the center performances in lieu of her service dog.further,although the center contends that its staff is specially trained to assist disabled individuals,the record fails to support the conclusion that these ushers could and would provide the same assistance to lentini that jazz does.therefore,we find that the ordered modification is necessary.
fundamental alteration 
the appellants also contend that the ordered modification will fundamentally alter the nature of the services or facility provided by the center.whether an accommodation fundamentally alters a service or facility is an affirmative defense.see.cross disability coalition hermanson family,cir describing the fundamental alteration component of b a ii as an affirmative defense johnson gambrinus spoetzl brewery,cir same.this court has recognized that whether an accommodation causes a fundamental alteration is an intensively inquiry.martin,at.
in this regard,the appellants presented the testimony of john haynes,the center president and chief operating officer.speaking generally about the effect of a barking dog in the center concert hall,haynes stated that it may offend and drive away other patrons.haynes testified that although people are increasingly accustomed to the presence of service animals in public areas of all kinds,a barking dog will pierce through the veil of patrons expectations.haynes also testified that a barking dog in the concert hall would adversely affect the center ability to attract artists.haynes stated that these problems could cause lost ticket revenue for concert hall events,which could affect the other core businesses of the center such as education,museum programs,and outreach programs.haynes testified specifically that a dog barking would fundamentally alter the service that the center provides in its concert hall.
however,as described above,the facts of this case provide evidence contrary to hayne testimony.jazz made noises at two performances.at one of the incidents,appellant vogel believed that he heard a dog bark,but he did not feel a need to stop the disturbance.in fact,he did not even mention the incident to lentini when he spoke with her after the show.no complaints were made about jazz behavior as a result of either incident.this is especially significant because the appellants point to the incidents with lentini and jazz as a basis for their concerns regarding the ordered modification.haynes testified that the center is not necessarily concerned about and would not exclude a random animal but is particularly concerned about jazz because jazz had barked in the concert hall previously.because the incidents involving jazz apparently did not cause any significant disturbance,haynes use of those incidents as a premise for his argument that the ordered modification would fundamentally alter the services and facility renders his conclusion highly questionable.
at best,haynes testimony provides some reasonable speculation about the effect of a barking dog at a performance.this speculation,however,is undercut by evidence that whatever noise jazz made in the center,he did not cause a significant disturbance or trigger patron complaints.moreover,the ordered modification does not completely tie the appellants hands instead,it sets forth reasonable limitations on when the center can exclude a service animal.we affirm the district court in this regard and find that the appellants have not made out their affirmative defense that the ordered modification would cause a fundamental alteration of the services and facility provided by the center.
intentional discrimination and the unruh act 
as a challenge to all of the damages awarded in this case,the appellants claim that the district court award under the unruh act required a showing of intentional discrimination.the district court expressly found that the appellants did not intentionally discriminate against lentini but the district court concluded that proof of discriminatory intent was not necessary to award damages under the unruh act in this case.significant in this regard is the fact that the district court found that the appellants violated the ada.
in,the california supreme court declared in harris capital growth investors xiv,cal d,that a plaintiff seeking to establish a case under the unruh act must plead and prove intentional discrimination in public accommodations in violation of the terms of the act.in,the unruh act was amended to provide that a violation of the right of any individual under the americans with disabilities act of shall also constitute a violation of this section.cal.f presta peninsula corridor joint powers,d.it is undisputed that a plaintiff need not show intentional discrimination in order to make out a violation of the ada.see martin pga tour,congress intended to protect disabled persons not just from intentional discrimination but also from thoughtlessness,indifference,and benign neglect,aff by martin,see also b a ii a a congressional finding that individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination,including outright intentional exclusion,the discriminatory effects of architectural,transportation,and communication barriers,overprotective rules and policies,failure to make modifications to existing facilities and practices,exclusionary qualification standards and criteria,segregation,and relegation to lesser services,programs,activities,benefits,jobs,or other opportunities emphasis added.therefore the question arises whether,by virtue of the amendment to the unruh act,harris requirement of intentional discrimination still exists in a suit such as this.apparently no binding authority addresses this question.
we find that,regardless of whether harris may continue to have relevance to other unruh act suits,no showing of intentional discrimination is required where the unruh act violation is premised on an ada violation.this result is mandated by the plain meaning of the unruh act language,which states that a violation of the ada is,per se,a violation of the unruh act.see biehl,cir statutory interpretation begins with the plain meaning of the statute language.citation and quotation marks omitted.because the unruh act has adopted the full expanse of the ada,it must follow,that the same standards for liability apply under both acts.presta,d at.therefore,we affirm the district court conclusion that,insofar as the appellants violated the ada,a showing of intentional discrimination was not required in order to award damages under the unruh act 
sufficiency of the evidence that lentini was deterred from attending performances at the center 
the district court found that,b etween january,and february,lentini was deterred from attending seven performances at the center.under california civil code,a court can award actual damages and an amount up to three times the actual damages for a violation of the unruh act,but in no case less than cal.a,historical and statutory notes indicating that in the statutory minimum was increased from to.following botosan fitzhugh,d,which held that this damages provision applies to each incident of deterrence,the district court awarded lentini based on the statutory minimum of for each of the performances lentini was deterred from attending as a result of the appellants discrimination 
the appellants claim that lentini failed to present sufficient evidence of deterrence.we disagree.lentini testified as follows 
q.but for this incident,you would have gone back to the center 
i would have gone back if it had not been for this incident.i had almost bought season tickets for that year.
is that because you had read a program and determined that there flier and determined that there were programs that you wanted to attend 
a.they send out seasonal brochures listing everything that coming up for the season.
q.did you see in that brochure any event that you wanted to go to that would take place after january,that you missed because of this incident 
absolutely.
q.how many 
a.there are at least ten 
so,based on what you saw in the promotional brochure,you determined that there were ten events that you would have gone to after tango buenos aires,but for the incident that is the subject of this case is that correct 
absolutely.
