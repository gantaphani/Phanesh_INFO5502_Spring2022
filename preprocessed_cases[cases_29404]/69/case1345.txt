in,the united states department of housing and urban development hud terminated its contractual relationship with normandy apartments.pursuant to this contract,normandy had received financial subsidies for making housing available to tenants who were qualified to receive assistance under the section federal housing program.normandy sought injunctive and declaratory relief against hud in the united states district court for the western district of oklahoma,seeking to prevent hud from abating its subsidy payments.it alleged that hud had violated its regulations and breached its contractual obligations by the manner in which it terminated its payments to normandy.the district court construed normandy claim as one for specific performance of a contract,and concluded that only the court of federal claims had jurisdiction.because we conclude,however,that the district court should have exercised jurisdiction over normandy claim that hud violated its own regulations by terminating the section payments,we reverse and remand for consideration on the merits.
background 
normandy apartments has contracted with hud since to provide section rental housing for qualified tenants at its tulsa apartment project.under section assistance program,tenants pay a portion of their rent,according to their means,but the bulk of the rent is paid by hud.the district court determined that the value of the funds paid out by hud to normandy amounted to roughly per month.normandy apartments,united states dep t of hous.and urban,no,wl,at.
under hud regulations and normandy contract with hud,normandy was required to maintain the units it makes available for section tenants in decent,safe,and sanitary condition.b.about once a year,hud real estate assessment center reac conducted a physical inspection of the property to ensure compliance with hud standards,and issued a numerical score on a scale.a facility fails to meet hud standards when it receives a score below sixty.
in november,reac inspected normandy complex and issued a failing score of.although the parties contest normandy efforts to correct deficiencies at the complex following this initial inspection,it is undisputed that normandy failed an august inspection,receiving an even lower score of.this was the sixth time in eight inspections that normandy complex received a failing score.
in june,hud informed normandy that it was in default of its obligation to maintain the complex in decent,safe,and sanitary condition and indicated that all section subsidy payments would be terminated.see.normandy sought reconsideration of this determination to no avail.after receiving notice on september,that all subsidy payments would be suspended and abated effective november,normandy filed the instant suit,seeking injunctive and declaratory relief in the united states district court for the western district of oklahoma.in particular,it sought a preliminary and permanent injunction preventing hud from following through on its decision to terminate assistance payments.
normandy asserted that,in terminating their relationship,hud had violated both its regulations and the terms of its contract.count i of normandy complaint alleged that hud had violat ed its regulations by,among other things,fail ing to consider normandy request for an adjustment of its reac physical condition score and failing to give normandy a reasonable amount of time in which to cure the default.complaint citing c and.count ii averred that hud had breached its contract for similar reasons,by failing to allow it to implement corrective actions within a reasonable time following its default complaint.
the district court heard oral argument both on the question of whether it had jurisdiction to issue a preliminary injunction against hud and on the merits of normandy claims.the court first concluded that it was without jurisdiction to issue a preliminary injunction.construing normandy claim as an action against the government seeking specific performance of a monetary contract,the value of which exceeded,the court determined that the tucker act,endowed the united states court of federal claims with exclusive jurisdiction to entertain normandy claims.normandy apartments,wl,at.it therefore concluded that the united states had not waived its sovereign immunity to suit in federal district court.see id.at.because the district court recognized the jurisdictional issues to be complex,however,it also proceeded to address the merits of a preliminary injunction.id.at.although it found that normandy had not made a sufficient showing of irreparable injury in order to justify a preliminary injunction,it noted that t he evidence was likely sufficient to establish the other elements necessary,id.at,including a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.id.at.
normandy subsequently filed a motion to set aside the district court dismissal of its motion for preliminary injunction.this too was denied on december.this appeal followed 
ii.discussion 
sovereign immunity generally shields the united states,its agencies,and its officers acting in their official capacity from suit.wyoming united states,cir.the defense of sovereign immunity is jurisdictional in nature,depriving courts of jurisdiction where applicable.robbins bureau of land,cir.because general jurisdictional statutes,such as,do not waive the government sovereign immunity,a party seeking to assert a claim against the government under such a statute must also point to a specific waiver of immunity in order to establish jurisdiction.see lonsdale united states,cir.here,neither party disputes the existence of a federal issue sufficient to confer jurisdiction under the general federal question statute,at issue is only whether normandy can demonstrate that the government has waived sovereign immunity to suit in federal district court 
on appeal,normandy primarily asserts that the government has waived sovereign immunity by virtue of the administrative procedure act apa,which provides that,in most circumstances,a n action in a court of the united states seeking relief other than money damages shall not be dismissed nor relief therein be denied on the ground that it is against the united states.see also robbins,at.we have noted,however,that this waiver does not apply where any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.robbins,at internal quotations omitted.as the district court correctly recognized,we have found the tucker act to impliedly forbid certain relief in district court,such that the apa waiver of sovereign immunity does not apply.the tucker act vests exclusive jurisdiction with the court of federal claims for claims against the united states founded upon the constitution,acts of congress,executive regulations,or contracts and seeking amounts greater than.burkins united states,cir.in robbins,we joined several other circuits in concluding that the tucker act impliedly forbid s federal courts from ordering declaratory or injunctive relief,at least in the form of specific performance,for contract claims against the government,and that the apa does not waive sovereign immunity for such claims.at emphasis added.
the district court understood normandy claim to fall within the ambit of this proscription.see normandy apartments,wl,at.as a result,it concluded that the united states had waived sovereign immunity to suit only in the court of federal claims,leaving federal district courts without jurisdiction.we review its conclusion that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction de novo.west,tristani,cir.in so doing,we must resolve two questions.first,does normandy claim seek relief other than money damages,such that the apa general waiver of sovereign immunity is even implicated second,does the tucker act expressly or impliedly forbid the relief that normandy seeks,such that the apa waiver does not apply these questions require us to characterize the nature both of normandy claim and of the relief it seeks.
does normandy claim seek relief other than money damages 
whether a claim seeks relief other than money damages actually encompasses two distinct questions is the claim for mon
