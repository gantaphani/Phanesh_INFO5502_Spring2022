the humphries hereinafter respondents were accused of child abuse in california,but were later exonerated.however,under california law,their names were added to a child abuse central index index,where they would remain available to various state agencies for at least years.the statute has no procedures for allowing individuals to challenge their inclusion in the index,and neither california nor los angeles county has created such procedures.respondents filed suit under,seeking damages,an injunction,and a declaration that public officials and petitioner los angeles county had deprived them of their constitutional rights by failing to create a mechanism through which they could contest inclusion in the index.the district court granted the defendants summary judgment,but the ninth circuit disagreed,holding that the fourteenth amendment required the state to provide those on the list with notice and a hearing,and thus respondents were entitled to declaratory relief.the court also held that respondents were prevailing parties entitled to attorney fees,including from the county.the county objected,claiming that as a municipal entity,it was liable only if its policy or custom caused the deprivation of a plaintiff federal right,monell new york city of social,but a state policy caused any deprivation here.the ninth circuit,inter alia,found that respondents did prevail against the county on their claim for declaratory relief because monell did not apply to prospective relief claims.
held monell policy or custom requirement applies in cases irrespective of whether the relief sought is monetary or prospective.
a in monroe pape,this court based its holding that municipal entities were not person s under on the provision legislative history,particularly congress rejection of the sherman amendment,which would have made municipalities liable for damages done by private persons riotously and tumultuously assembled,at,and.reexamining this legislative history in monell,the court overruled monroe.it concluded that congress had rejected the sherman amendment,not because it would have imposed liability on municipalities,but because it would have imposed such liability solely based on the acts of others.the court,on the basis of the statutory text and the legislative history,went on to explain what acts are the municipality own for purposes of liability.the court held that a municipality can not be held liable solely for the acts of others,solely because it employs a tortfeasor,at,but it may be held liable when execution of a government policy or custom inflicts the injury,at.
b section,read in light of monell understanding of the legislative history,explains why claims for prospective relief,like claims for money damages,fall within the scope of the policy or custom requirement.nothing in suggests that the causation requirement should change with the form of relief sought.in fact,the text suggests the opposite when it provides that a person who meets elements shall be liable in an action at law,suit in equity,or other proper proceeding for redress.thus,as monell explicitly stated,local governing bodies can be sued directly under for monetary,declaratory,or injunctive relief where,as here,the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy or custom,at.to find the policy or custom requirement inapplicable in prospective relief cases would also undermine monell logic.for whether an action or omission is a municipality own has to do with the nature of the action or omission,not with the nature of the relief that is later sought in court.
c respondents arguments to the contrary are unconvincing.

los angeles county,california,petitioner craig arthur humphries et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
in monell new york city of social,this court held that civil rights plaintiffs suing a municipal entity under must show that their injury was caused by a municipal policy or custom.the case before the court in monell directly involved monetary damages.the question presented is whether the policy or custom requirement also applies when plaintiffs seek prospective relief,such as an injunction or a declaratory judgment.we conclude that it does so apply.
the case arises out of the following circumstances the california child abuse and neglect reporting act,cal.penal code ann.et west supp,requires law enforcement and other state agencies to investigate allegations of child abuse.these agencies must report to the california department of justice all instances of reported child abuse the agency finds not unfounded,even if they are inconclusive or unsubstantiated.a,a.the statute requires the department to include all these reports in a child abuse central index index,where they remain available to various state agencies for at least years.a.the statute also says that if 
a report has previously been filed which subsequently proves to be unfounded,the department of justice shall be notified in writing of that fact and shall not retain the report.a.
the statute,however,does not set forth procedures for reviewing whether a previously filed report is unfounded,or for allowing individuals to challenge their inclusion in the index.nor,up until the time of this lawsuit,had california or los angeles county created any such procedures.but a the submitting agencies are responsible for the accuracy,completeness,and retention of the reports described in this section 
the two plaintiffs in this case were initially accused of child abuse.but they were later exonerated.they sought to have their names removed from the index.unable to convince the los angeles sheriff department to remove them,they filed this case against the attorney general of california,the los angeles county sheriff,two detectives in the sheriff department,and the county of los angeles.they sought damages,an injunction,and a declaration that the defendants had deprived them of their constitutional rights by failing to create a procedural mechanism through which one could contest inclusion on the index.see,amdt.stat.the district court for the central district of california granted summary judgment to all of the defendants on the ground that california had not deprived plaintiffs of a constitutionally protected liberty interest.but on appeal the ninth circuit disagreed.
the ninth circuit held that the fourteenth amendment required the state to provide those included on the list notice and some kind of hearing.thus the circuit held that the plaintiffs were entitled to declaratory relief,and it believed that on remand they might prove damages as well.ibid.
the ninth circuit also held that the plaintiffs were prevailing parties,thereby entitled to approximately in attorney fees.b providing for payment of attorney fees to parties prevailing on claims.see june,app.to pet.for cert.hereinafter first fee order,app.to reply to brief in opposition hereinafter second fee order.the ninth circuit wrote that los angeles county must pay approximately of this amount.first fee order second fee order.
los angeles county denied that it was liable and therefore that it could be held responsible for attorney fees.it argued that,in respect to the county,the plaintiffs were not prevailing parties.that is because the county is a municipal entity.under monell holding a municipal entity is liable under only if a municipal policy or custom caused a plaintiff to be deprived of a federal right,at emphasis added.and it was state policy,not county policy,that brought about any deprivation here.
the ninth circuit responded to this argument as follows first,it said that county policy might be responsible for the deprivation.it is possible,the ninth circuit said,that the county,b y failing to creat e an independent procedure that would allow the plaintiffs to challenge their listing,adopted a custom and policy that violated the plaintiffs constitutional rights.a
