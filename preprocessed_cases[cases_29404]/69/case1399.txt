robert schrier,a professor of medicine at the university of colorado university,filed a civil action in colorado state court against the university and three of its employees,president elizabeth hoffman,dean richard krugman,and chancellor james shore,in their official capacities.schrier complaint alleges that defendants termination of his appointment as chair of the university department of medicine in retaliation for his acts of speaking publicly about a matter of public concern violated his constitutional rights pursuant to and constituted a breach of contract.defendants removed the suit to federal court pursuant to.subsequent to removal,schrier filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction seeking reinstatement as chair of the department of medicine.the magistrate judge,designated pursuant to c by consent of the parties,denied schrier motion and this appeal followed.while we disagree with certain legal conclusions reached by the court below,in the final analysis we nonetheless affirm denial of the injunction.
the university of colorado is comprised of four campuses,one of which is the health sciences center.in turn,the health sciences center embraces five schools,one of which is the school of medicine.the school of medicine consists of department chairs,eight basic science departments,and sixteen clinical departments,including the department of medicine.
schrier,a nephrologist and medical academician,was appointed professor of medicine in the school of medicine on or about july.he received continuous tenure and was subsequently appointed head of the renal division of the department of medicine.in,the doctor was appointed chair of the department of medicine,the largest department within the school of medicine.department chairs are responsible for the organization of their department and for implementing policies initiated by the chancellor and dean of their respective units.james shore became chancellor of the health sciences center in and richard krugman has served as dean of the school of medicine since.
in the,the university began considering the possibility of moving the health sciences center,then located at ninth avenue and colorado boulevard in denver,colorado,to a campus to be established at the former fitzsimons army medical center in aurora,colorado.in october,the university board of regents approved the move.it is undisputed that the possibility of the transition of the health sciences center from its ninth avenue location to fitzsimons was the subject of extensive debate within the university community.
schrier concedes he has been an active participant in that debate since the initial announcement of the move proposal.he also maintains that his concerns about whether and how the health sciences center should be migrated to the fitzsimons site have evolved over time,as we detail more fully below.as summarized in the magistrate judge findings of fact,b oth before and after the regents approval of the move,schrier expressed to the university community and to others his concerns about the fiscal implications of the move and his view that the move would disrupt integrated programs within the school of medicine,vol.i at.
on october,upon receipt of approval from chancellor shore,dean krugman summarily removed schrier from his position as chair of the department of medicine.the university maintains that dean krugman was not required to consult with faculty before dismissing schrier because department chairs within the school of medicine serve at the will of the dean.moreover,the university asserts that the termination of a department chair appointment does not constitute a disciplinary action and,as a result,has no effect on the terminated chair faculty position.thus,schrier retained his tenured appointment as faculty member and full professor of medicine within the university and currently draws a salary identical to the one he received as chair.
the termination of his chairmanship prompted schrier to file suit in the district court for the city and county of denver.in his complaint,schrier alleges that the university decision to remove him as chair of the department of medicine in retaliation for publicly speaking out about the fitzsimons move constitutes a deprivation of his constitutional rights as well as a breach of his employment contract.defendants removed the action to federal court where the doctor filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking reinstatement as chair pending the resolution of his claims on the merits.upon conclusion of a three and a half day evidentiary hearing,the court issued an order denying schrier motion 
on the basis of three separate theories,schrier contends the court order requires reversal.he claims that the application of a heightened standard to his preliminary injunction motion constitutes reversible error the conclusion that the university interest in suppressing his speech outweighed his first amendment rights was contrary to the balancing test established in pickering board of education,d and the court sua sponte invocation of eleventh amendment immunity to bar his breach of contract claim was spurious and should be reversed.we address each argument in turn.
preliminary injunction standard

because the limited purpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held,of camenisch,d,we have identified the following three types of specifically disfavored preliminary injunctions preliminary injunctions that alter the status quo mandatory preliminary injunctions and preliminary injunctions that afford the movant all the relief that it could recover at the conclusion of a full trial on the merits.o centro espirita beneficiente uniao do vegetal ashcroft,cir en banc internal citations and quotations omitted,cert.granted sub nom on other grounds,gonzales o centro espirita beneficiente uniao do vegetal,d.such disfavored injunctions must be more closely scrutinized to assure that the exigencies of the case support the granting of a remedy that is extraordinary even in the normal course.o centro,at.
schrier concedes the magistrate judge correctly articulated the four factor test he was obligated to satisfy in order to be entitled to a preliminary injunction.he disagrees,however,with the court conclusion that the requested relief is disfavored and thereby warrants a heightened standard of proof.specifically,schrier maintains that because the injunction he seeks preserves rather than disturbs the status quo and is prohibitory as opposed to mandatory,it was erroneous for the court to require him to prove that each of the four preliminary injunction factors weighed heavily and compelling in his favor.
relying on our decision in scfc ilc,the magistrate judge order declared 
t he following kinds of preliminary injunctions are disfavored that disturb the status quo that are mandatory as opposed to prohibitory and that afford the movant substantially all the relief he may recover at the conclusion of a full trial on the merits.a movant seeking these kinds of injunctions must show that the four factors weigh heavily and compelling in his favor.
mandatory injunctions affirmatively require the nonmovant to act in a particular way.injunctions that disturb the status quo alter the parties existing relationship.the status quo is not defined by the parties existing legal rights it is defined by the reality of the existing status and relationships between the parties,regardless of whether the existing status and relationships may ultimately be found to be in accord or not in accord with the parties legal rights.
robert schrier seeks to be reinstated to his former position as chair of the department of medicine.reinstatement would disturb the status quo and would require that i enter an injunction mandatory in nature.consequently,schrier must show that the four preliminary injunction factors weigh heavily and compellingly in his favor 
vol.i at emphases in original citations omitted.defendants contend the court application of the heavily and compelling standard should be affirmed because the injunction schrier seeks would alter the status quo by removing the interim chair who replaced schrier prior to this litigation,as well as end the ongoing search for a permanent chair.aple.br.at.they also maintain the injunction warrants a heightened standard because it is mandatory.according to defendants,reinstatement would place the court in position where it may have to provide supervision,and r einstatement would be disruptive and detrimental to the essential functioning of university business.id.at.thus,the threshold issue we are tasked with resolving is whether schrier requested reinstatement as chair disturbs the status quo is mandatory,or merely preserves the status quo and is prohibitory.see o centro,at.
both defendants and the magistrate judge misunderstand the legal distinction between injunctions that disturb the status quo and those that do not.we have explained that the status quo is the last uncontested status between the parties which preceded the controversy until the outcome of the final hearing.dominion video satellite,echostar satellite,cir quoting scfc ilc,at.in determining the status quo for preliminary injunctions,this court looks to the reality of the existing status and relationship between the parties and not solely to the parties legal rights.id.in the instant case,the last peaceable uncontested status existing between the parties before the dispute developed,charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure,at ed,was on october,when schrier was still serving as chair of the department of medicine,a position he had held in excess of years.schrier request that he be reinstated as chair seeks to preserve rather than disturb the status quo,regardless of whether or not he is legally entitled to such reinstatement.as such,it was erroneous for the magistrate judge to conclude that schrier injunction was disfavored on the basis that it alters the status quo.
schrier further contends that the injunction he seeks is prohibitory rather than mandatory because it requires the university to do nothing more than continue to do something it was already doing during the last uncontested period preceding the injunction,permitting schrier to retain his chairmanship until the litigation is resolved on the merits.aplt.br.at internal quotation marks omitted.as we have recently made clear,however,injunctions are not necessarily prohibitory merely because they preserve the status quo.o centro,at.although mandatory injunctions also generally alter the status quo,that is not always the case.it is not at all difficult to envision situations where a mandatory injunction would preserve the status quo and a prohibitory injunction would alter the status quo.id.wright,et,supra,at it has long been established that where a defendant with notice in an injunction proceeding completes the acts sought to be enjoined the court may by mandatory injunction restore the status quo quoting porter lee.
there is no doubt that determining whether an injunction is mandatory as opposed to prohibitory can be vexing.o centro,at seymour,dissenting in part.indeed,
t he distinction between mandatory and prohibitory injunctions can not be drawn simply by reference to whether or not the status quo is to be maintained or upset.as suggested by the terminology used to describe them,these equitable cousins have been differentiated by examining whether the party is being ordered to perform an act,or refrain from performing.in many instances,this distinction is more semantical than substantive.for to order a party to refrain from performing a given act is to limit his ability to perform any alternative act similarly,an order to perform in a particular manner may be tantamount to a proscription against performing in any other.
id.quoting abdul wali coughlin,cir,overruled on other grounds by estate of shabazz,d.we characterize an injunction as mandatory if the requested relief affirmatively require s the nonmovant to act in a particular way,and as a result place s the issuing court in a position where it may have to provide ongoing supervision to assure the nonmovant is abiding by the injunction.id.at quoting scfc ilc,at.while merely seeking restoration of the status quo,schrier requested relief nonetheless affirmatively require s the university to act in a particular way,that is,to reinstall him as chair of the department of medicine.moreover,we agree with defendants that reinstatement would place the court in position where it may have to provide supervision.aple.br.at.thus,the relief sought here is properly characterized as mandatory and,as a result,constitutes a specifically disfavored injunction.
notwithstanding our conclusion that the requested injunctive relief is mandatory and therefore disfavored,the magistrate judge application of the heavily and compelling standard was,as it turns out,erroneous.it is clear scfc ilc,concluded that a movant seeking a disfavored injunction must satisfy an even heavier burden of showing that the four preliminary injunction factors weigh heavily and compellingly in movant favor before such an injunction may be issued.at.subsequent to issuance of the magistrate judge order,however,a majority of our court sitting en banc voted to affirm the core holding of scfc ilc,but with one significant alteration.we jettison ed that part of scfc ilc which describes the showing the movant must make when the movant requests a disfavored injunction as heavily and compellingly.o centro,at.instead,the en banc court held that 
courts in this circuit must recognize that any preliminary injunction fitting within one of the disfavored categories must be more closely scrutinized to assure that the exigencies of the case support the granting of a remedy that is extraordinary even in the normal course.furthermore,because a historically disfavored preliminary injunction operates outside of the normal parameters for interim relief,movants seeking such an injunction are not entitled to rely on this circuit standard.instead,a party seeking such an injunction must make a strong showing both with regard to the likelihood of success on the merits and with regard to the balance of harms,and may not rely on our modified standard.
id.at emphasis added.
simply stated,the requirement that a movant requesting a disfavored injunction must make a showing that the traditional four factors weigh heavily and compellingly in his favor is no longer the law of the circuit.accordingly,the magistrate judge erred,albeit unknowingly,in relying on that standard.see id.at the failure of the district court to apply the correct standard in evaluating a disfavored request for preliminary injunction amounts to an abuse of discretion.the closer question is whether the court application of the inappropriate standard warrants a remand.in order to make that determination,we must evaluate the requested injunction on the merits.see id.noting that while the failure of the district court to apply the correct standard amounts to an abuse of discretion,because the record on appeal is sufficiently well developed,it is appropriate for the court to determine in the first instance whether the plaintiff has met the requisite burden.if schrier,regardless of the standard employed,failed to establish the required preliminary injunction factors,then the magistrate judge erroneous application of the heavily and compelling standard is of no legal consequence.
first amendment claims 
as noted previously,schrier contends defendants violated his first amendment right of free speech and his rights to academic freedom by terminating his chairmanship in retaliation for public statements he made concerning the heath sciences center move to fitzsimons.the magistrate judge held that schrier first amendment claims failed to establish either a substantial likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable injury sufficient to satisfy the preliminary injunction test.see kikumura,at listing four elements of the preliminary injunction test we agree.

first,we must determine whether the employee speech involves a matter of public concern.if so,we then balance the employee interest in commenting upon matters of public concern against the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.third,if the balance tips in favor of the employee,the employee then must show that the speech was a substantial factor or a motivating factor in the detrimental employment decision.fourth,if the plaintiff establishes that speech was such a factor,the employer may demonstrate that it would have taken the same action against the employee even in the absence of the protected speech.

in evaluating this type of claim,it is essential to identify the speech which resulted in the alleged retaliation.hulen,at.the magistrate judge order characterized schrier speech as follows 
schrier comments included his concerns about the financial feasibility of the move.schrier expressed his concern that too much of the financing consisted of bond debt and that the debt could eventually impact patient care.schrier comments also included his concern that the move imposed a separation of the basic sciences from the clinical sciences and that this disruption of integrated programs within the school of medicine would affect patient care,education,and research.
at.b ecause schrier speech concerned the expenditure of public funds and the potential impact a relocation would have on patient care,education,and research,the magistrate judge held that his speech addressed matters of public concern.id.we agree.schrier speech addressing the use of public funds and regarding the objectives,purposes and mission of the university of colorado and its medical school fall well within the rubric of matters of public concern.see gardetto mason,cir the objectives,purposes,and mission of a public university are undoubtedly matters of public concern.moreover,in general,speech about the use of public funds touches upon a matter of public concern similarly,complaints about the proposed closing of a branch of a university or its spending priorities,when these decisions affect the basic functions and missions of the university,also constitute speech on matters of public concern.internal citations and quotations omitted.therefore,schrier satisfied the first prong of the pickering analysis.

as to the second step,we balance the plaintiff right to speak out about the matter of public concern with whether exercise of that right impairs discipline by superiors or harmony among,has a detrimental impact on close working relationships for which personal loyalty and confidence are necessary,or impedes the performance of the speaker duties or interferes with the regular operation of the enterprise.
hulen,at quoting rankin mcpherson,d.
schrier submits that the magistrate judge misapplied the second prong of pickering when it determined that the university interest in suppressing his speech outweighed his right to free expression without requiring the university to produce evidence of actual disruption.relying on hulen and kent,schrier argues that defendants were obligated to demonstrate actual disruption as a result of his speech in order to prevail on the second pickering prong because they delayed executing their decision to terminate him for approximately five months.
the record supports schrier contention that defendants did not terminate him for some five months after deciding to take such action.dean krugman made the decision to terminate schrier on or about may,aplt,vol.iv at but did not actually do so until october,vol.vii at termination letter.our case law also supports schrier argument that an employer must proffer some evidence of actual disruption where there has been a delay of several months between the employee protected speech and the challenged action.see hulen,at kent,at.
