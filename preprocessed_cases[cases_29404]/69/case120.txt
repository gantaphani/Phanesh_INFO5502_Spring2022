this case raises a novel issue of the proper construction of k,a civil forfeiture provision concerned with interbank accounts of foreign banks,which was added as part of the usa patriot act,a,stat.
section k provides for the forfeiture of amounts in interbank accounts held by a foreign bank at banks in the united states when forfeitable funds are deposited into an account at the foreign bank.k a.frequently,however,foreign banks are innocent of the underlying wrongdoing that forms the basis for the forfeiture.as a result,if a foreign bank were allowed to file a claim for amounts seized from its interbank account,as was the case before enactment of section k,it would often succeed in recovering the seized amounts as an innocent owner of the funds,see id.d,even when the foreign depositor might not qualify as an innocent owner.
to avoid this result,congress in enacting section k also provided that generally the foreign depositor,and not the foreign bank,is considered an owner of the seized funds,eligible to challenge the forfeiture on innocent owner or other grounds.see id.k b i.an exception to this designation of ownership applies,however,and the foreign bank is the owner of the funds,to the extent that the bank has discharged all or part of its obligation to the prior owner of the funds by the time of the seizure.id.k b ii ii.it is this exception that is at the heart of this case.
in this case,the united states seized over million from an interbank account held by union bank for savings investment jordan at the bank of new york,claiming that,under section k,these funds corresponded to proceeds of a canadian telemarketing fraud conspiracy.a parallel indictment charged sixteen defendants with violations of federal rico,mail fraud,and wire fraud statutes in that conspiracy to defraud more than eighty americans,many of them elderly widows and widowers.proceeds of the fraud,in the form of cashier checks sent by those defrauded,had been eventually deposited into two accounts at a branch of union bank jordan in ramallah in the west bank,one in the name of samir esseileh and the other in the name of his brother,mohammed ghaleb esseileh.in response to the seizure,union bank jordan,but not the esseilehs,claimed ownership of the seized funds,arguing that the exception at section k b ii ii applied.the bank of new york,the bank at which the interbank account was located,is not a party in these proceedings.
in ruling on for summary judgment,the district court held that the obligation referred to in section k b ii ii is the obligation of a bank to repay amounts on deposit.in so holding,the court rejected the contention of union bank jordan that the discharge of its obligations should be measured against its ability to obtain recourse from its depositors under banking law.we agree with the district court on this point the interpretation posited by union bank jordan is contrary to the language of the statute and would undermine congress intent in enacting section k.
the district court also held that while the relevant obligations are not limited to those arising from the specific account into which the forfeitable funds were deposited,obligations that do not arise from and are not in any way connectable to the obligation that arose from the receipt of the forfeitable funds do not count as obligations under section k.the court based this on the view that the principle in section a limiting the forfeiture of substitute property to that found in the same place or account should inform the interpretation of the term obligation in section k b ii ii.on this point,we do not agree.in attempting to chart this middle course between the government and the bank positions,the district court borrowed concepts relevant to determining the forfeitability of funds in ordinary accounts to decide the question of ownership of funds in interbank accounts.both the language and the legislative history of section k demonstrate that congress did not intend to apply analogous substantive limits to forfeitability in determining ownership under section k.thus,we hold that for purposes of section k,obligations include amounts in any account held at the time of the seizure by anyone who was an owner of the funds at the time they were deposited.
union bank jordan makes other arguments,which were rejected by the district court,and which we also reject.we reject the bank claim that the forfeiture is excessive under the eighth amendment because we find the forfeiture is not punitive relative to union bank jordan.we also hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in requiring a joint statement of undisputed material facts for purposes of the for summary judgment.
in addition,we find no abuse of discretion in the district court striking as untimely the claim of reuven krauzer,an earlier holder of the cashier checks at issue,who also appeals.
the facts we describe are drawn from the joint statement of undisputed material facts filed by the government and union bank jordan,or are otherwise undisputed,except as noted.
union bank jordan was chartered by the central bank of jordan in and has its main branch in amman,jordan.since,it has operated a branch in ramallah,in the west bank in the palestinian territories.
on october,the united states seized from a interbank account held by union bank jordan at the bank of new york,as part of a seizure of over million from the interbank accounts of a number of different foreign banks.the government simultaneously filed a complaint against the seized funds in federal district court in new hampshire for forfeiture in rem.on november,the united states seized an additional from the same union bank jordan account at the bank of new york,of which was subsequently released,for a total seizure from this interbank account of more than million.proceedings under the second seizure were consolidated into the first.
this million corresponded to the combined face value of cashier checks drawn on banks and deposited into customer accounts at union bank jordan.the government alleged that these cashier checks and others corresponding to the balance of the million seized were forfeitable as the proceeds of a canadian telemarketing fraud scheme that victimized american citizens.the perpetrators of the scheme convinced dozens of individuals to send cashier checks of to or more to designated post office boxes in montreal,purportedly to cover expenses associated with large prizes from a canadian sweepstakes or lottery.
after receiving the checks,the perpetrators of the fraud sold them to a restaurant owner in montreal in exchange for canadian currency.he in turn sold the cashier checks to a person with connections in israel.the checks at issue in this case were all eventually sold to reuven krauzer,a money changer in jerusalem.
krauzer then sold the checks to mohammed ghaleb esseileh.mohammed ghaleb esseileh and his brothers samir and talal,together with other family members,operated a money exchange business in east jerusalem.at times relevant here,various members of the esseileh family maintained bank accounts at union bank jordan in the course of their money exchange business the business as a whole did not have a business account at the bank.
each of the cashier checks was deposited into one of two esseileh accounts at union bank jordan,both of which the esseilehs used for the deposit of checks received in the ordinary course of business.the first account,opened on february,was in samir name,although,pursuant to a written agreement with the bank,his brother mohammed ghaleb also had authority on this account,including the authority to make deposits and withdrawals.this account was closed on february,before the date of the seizures in this case.
the second account,opened sometime in,was in mohammed ghaleb name.on january,the bank approved a credit facility on this account,allowing for the deposit of dollar instruments to the account without prior bank approval.samir and talal were both guarantors on this credit facility,jointly liable with mohammed ghaleb for paying any deposited items that were returned.shortly before the account in samir name was closed,all or nearly all of the funds in that account were transferred to the mohammed ghaleb account.the parties agree that most of the checks were deposited into the samir account,rather than the mohammed ghaleb account,but they dispute the precise division between the two accounts.
on and just after the date of the first seizure,samir did not have any account at union bank jordan in his name,nor did he have deposit authority on the mohammed ghaleb account.on the dates of the seizures,talal had at least one account at the bank,but none of the checks had been deposited into talal accounts.as of the dates of the seizures,the amount seized was more than the total funds in mohammed ghaleb accounts alone,but less than the total funds in mohammed ghaleb and talal accounts combined.
once the checks were deposited with union bank jordan,the bank transmitted the checks to its interbank accounts to obtain payment on the checks the checks were primarily,but not exclusively,transmitted to its account at the bank of new york.the bank of new york then presented the checks to the issuing banks for payment,giving union bank jordan a provisional credit on its interbank account in the interim.if an item had been properly returned by the issuing bank,the bank of new york would have then debited the union bank jordan interbank account and forwarded the returned item to union bank jordan,to allow it to collect on the item from the esseilehs.in this case,none of the issuing banks sought to reverse payment,and the applicable statutory and regulatory time periods for seeking such a reversal expired as a result,the credit on the union bank jordan interbank account became final.
had any items been returned to union bank jordan,the bank could have sought recourse from the esseilehs based on their customer agreements and the guarantee signed by samir and talal.those agreements provided that the esseilehs would be responsible for all liabilities which may result from depositing cheques in foreign currency in case such cheques are proved to be invalid,counterfeited or unacceptable for cashing due to any reason whatsoever.the bank position is that neither these customer agreements nor general banking law provide any basis for it to recover from the esseilehs based on the seizures in this case.
following the initial seizure,union bank jordan transferred approximately million from mohammed ghaleb accounts into a restricted trust account.the bank has stated under oath that it had no legal basis for this transfer.the esseilehs sent to union bank jordan a notorial warning that they would file suit to recover these funds,but following the bank request to postpone any such suit pending the outcome of this case,the esseilehs have not filed suit to date.the bank and the esseilehs discussed the ability of the esseilehs to file a claim in this case.the bank ultimately decided that it would be stronger to do it alone,and the esseilehs did not file a claim to challenge the forfeiture of the seized funds.
on february,union bank jordan filed a claim in the in rem proceedings to the amounts initially seized from its interbank account,and on january,it filed a claim to the amounts subsequently seized.following discovery,on july,both parties filed motions for summary judgment.the bank argued that it was an innocent owner of the funds,that the forfeiture of the funds would be an excessive fine under the eighth amendment,and that section k unconstitutionally treated foreign banks differently from american banks.the government argued that the bank was not an owner of the funds under section k,and that as a result,the bank lacked both article iii standing and any right under section k to challenge the forfeiture.
on october,the district court denied the bank motion for summary judgment on the merits of its innocent owner defense.in all other respects,both motions were denied without prejudice.the court invited the bank to renew its motion to the extent that it raises constitutional challenges and to the extent that it asserts that it is an owner under the statute.similarly,the government could renew its motion as a cross motion to defendants motions for summary judgment raising the same issue.the court further ordered that t he parties shall each be limited to a single brief limited to pages and the parties shall submit a joint statement of undisputed material facts in support of the motion.on november,the parties filed a joint statement of undisputed material facts and renewed for summary judgment on the issue of ownership.
on january,the district court held an extended hearing on the summary judgment motions,at the conclusion of which it granted the government motion and denied the bank motion.the court held that the obligation referred to in section k b ii ii is the bank obligation to repay funds on deposit,so that the bank ownership status is measured against the amounts that remain on deposit in the prior owner accounts on the date of the seizure furthermore,the court found that the evidence demonstrates unequivocally that the activities at issue here,the deposits of the checks into the two account s,were the activities of a jointly conducted business operated by s amir,m ohammed ghaleb,and talal thus,amounts in the mohammed ghaleb account represented an obligation to the prior owners of funds deposited into either the samir account or the mohammed ghaleb account.because t he bank ha d not presented the court with evidence suggesting that the mohammed ghaleb account did not contain enough money,the court found that the bank was not an owner of any of the seized funds,without considering whether to include funds in talal accounts as obligations under the statute.
on february,union bank jordan filed a motion for reconsideration,presenting exchange rate information to show that the amount of the first seizure exceeded the balance in mohammed ghaleb accounts on that day by at least,and also arguing that talal account should not be considered because it had never been used for any money changing purposes.union bank jordan also renewed its eighth amendment challenge.
on may,the district court held a second hearing,at which it granted the motion for reconsideration.the court held that the only obligations that needed to be discharged under k b ii ii in order for the bank to be an owner were those that arise from the bank receipt of forfeitable funds.because there was no evidence that there were any transfers between the mohammed ghaleb account and talal esseileh account,talal account was not an obligation that the bank had to discharge in order to be considered an owner.a factual dispute remained on whether an account used as security for the mohammed ghaleb account should be counted as part of that account,and hence part of the relevant obligation.that issue was set for trial,together with the merits of the bank innocent owner defense.the court also rejected the bank eighth amendment challenge,on the basis that the forfeitures at issue were entirely remedial 
thus,following these rulings,union bank jordan was found not to be the owner of more than million of the seized funds,with approximately still in dispute.the parties then agreed to a settlement of the remaining issues,which provided for the forfeiture of approximately,the return of approximately to union bank jordan,and a stipulation as to the remaining nearly that its disposition would depend on whether the government successfully obtained on appeal a final decision that the bank was not the owner of these funds.the bank appeal thus concerns the million,while the government relates to the.
meanwhile,on september,reuven krauzer filed a claim and motion to intervene,asserting an interest in the more than million that the district court had held was not owned by the bank.krauzer alleged that he had been forced to indemnify the esseilehs after the bank had frozen million from the esseilehs accounts,and that he had thereby succeeded to the esseilehs ownership interest in the seized funds.earlier in the litigation,on march,krauzer had filed claims to certain amounts seized from other banks interbank accounts.those claims had been settled,and the corresponding final order of forfeiture with respect to those claims had entered on december.krauzer explained the delay in filing the september claim on the basis that it was dependent on the court ruling that union bank jordan was not the owner of the funds in question.
on october,the district court struck krauzer claim as untimely,finding the delay inexcusable,the potential prejudice to the government severe,and the disruption to the court management of the proceedings significant.subsequently,final orders of forfeiture entered in accordance with the district court rulings and the settlement between the government and union bank jordan.
in,as part of the usa patriot act,congress added a new provision to the federal civil forfeiture statute,k,which established special rules for forfeitures from interbank accounts held by foreign banks at banks in the united states usa patriot act a,stat.at.
interbank accounts,also known as correspondent accounts,are used by foreign banks to offer services to their customers in jurisdictions where the banks have no physical presence,and otherwise to facilitate transactions involving such jurisdictions.see generally minority staff of permanent subcomm.on investigations,report on correspondent banking a gateway for money laundering comm.print.given the international importance of currency and the market,many foreign banks have such interbank accounts in the united states.id.at.there are banks that conduct virtually all transactions external to the bank through their interbank accounts.id.at.
because interbank accounts can be used to complete transactions in the united states without the need to directly establish an account in the united states,they can be vehicles for money laundering,with or without the complicity of the foreign bank.id.at.before the enactment of section k,it was difficult for the government to seek the forfeiture of laundered funds in the interbank accounts of foreign banks.id.at.this was because the bank,like any other account holder,was considered the owner of the funds in its interbank account,and hence the bank was entitled to assert an innocent owner defense to an attempted forfeiture.id.in most cases,the bank was not criminally complicit in the underlying wrongdoing,and thus most such forfeitures would fail.see id.
section k broadened the government civil forfeiture power in two important ways.first,section k a provides 
for the purpose of a forfeiture under this section or under the controlled substances act,if funds are deposited into an account at a foreign financial institution,and that foreign financial institution has an interbank account in the united states with a covered financial institution,the funds shall be deemed to have been deposited into the interbank account in the united states,and any restraining order,seizure warrant,or arrest warrant in rem regarding the funds may be served on the covered financial institution,and funds in the interbank account,up to the value of the funds deposited into the account at the foreign financial institution,may be restrained,seized,or arrested.
thus,it is the deposit of forfeitable funds into an account at a foreign bank,rather than the continued existence of forfeitable funds in that account,that triggers the forfeitability of an equivalent amount of funds in the foreign bank interbank account.
the funds in the interbank account are forfeitable even if those funds have no connection to the forfeitable funds deposited in the foreign account.this is made clear by section k,which provides that in a forfeiture action under section k,it shall not be necessary for the government to establish that the funds are directly traceable to the funds that were deposited into the foreign financial institution,nor shall it be necessary for the government to rely on the application of section.the net effect is to treat a deposit made into an account in a foreign bank that has a correspondent account at a bank as if the deposit had been made into the bank directly.i,at.
the provisions just described expand the reach of the forfeiture statute,but would not prevent the foreign bank from asserting an innocent owner defense.the statute further provides that the owner of the funds deposited into the account at the foreign financial institution may contest the forfeiture.k.owner is,however,defined as follows 
i in general.except as provided in clause ii,the term owner 
i means the person who was the owner,as that term is defined in section d,of the funds that were deposited into the foreign financial institution at the time such funds were deposited and 
ii does not include either the foreign financial institution or any financial institution acting as an intermediary in the transfer of the funds into the interbank account.
id.k b.thus,the general rule is that the foreign depositor,and not the foreign bank,is deemed the owner of funds seized under section k,with the right to challenge the forfeiture and assert an innocent owner or other defense.
the statute provides two exceptions to the rule that the foreign bank is not an owner of the seized funds 
ii exception.the foreign financial institution may be considered the owner of the funds and no other person shall qualify as the owner of such funds only if 
i the basis for the forfeiture action is wrongdoing committed by the foreign financial institution or 
ii the foreign financial institution establishes,by a preponderance of the evidence,that prior to the restraint,seizure,or arrest of the funds,the foreign financial institution had discharged all or part of its obligation to the prior owner of the funds,in which case the foreign financial institution shall be deemed the owner of the funds to the extent of such discharged obligation.
id.k b ii.it is the exception in subsection k b ii ii that we must construe here.
we turn now to the central issue on appeal whether union bank jordan fits within the second exception to the general rule,such that it is the owner under section k b ii ii of some or all of the funds seized from its interbank account.we review the district court rulings on summary judgment de novo.united states v.one parcel of real,cir.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,but where that party bears the burden of proof,it must present definite,competent evidence from which a reasonable jury could find in its favor.one parcel of real,at.
under section k a,once the cashier checks in this case were deposited into accounts at union bank jordan,those checks were deemed to have been deposited into the interbank account of union bank jordan in the united states,and the government then could and did seize an equivalent amount of funds from that interbank account.because the checks were deemed deposited into the interbank account,funds from that account were forfeitable regardless of any subsequent fluctuations in the samir and mohammed ghaleb accounts,into which the checks were actually deposited.union bank jordan does not challenge this aspect of the statute on appeal rather,the question is whether subsequent fluctuations in the samir and mohammed ghaleb accounts affected who is to be considered the owner of the seized funds.
it is clear that union bank jordan is the foreign financial institution excluded under section k b i ii as a general rule from ownership of the seized funds.instead,absent an exception,section k b i i places ownership in the hands of the owner of the funds that were deposited into union bank jordan at the time such funds were deposited.owner is in turn defined by reference to section d,the provision that defines ownership for purposes of determining who can raise an innocent owner defense outside of the interbank context.this makes clear that,for the purpose of determining ownership,congress intended to simply treat the foreign deposit as a domestic one.
thus,putting aside the exception for the moment,ownership of the deposit is determined as if the transaction were wholly domestic.section d a defines owner to be a person with an ownership interest in the specific property sought to be forfeited,including a leasehold,lien,mortgage,recorded security interest,or valid assignment of an ownership interest.under a prior incarnation of an innocent owner defense,we noted congress instruction that,absent contrary statutory language,the term owner should be broadly interpreted to include any person with a recognizable legal or equitable interest in the property seized.united states dana,cir quoting joint explanatory statement of titles ii and iii,sess,reprinted in,internal quotation marks omitted.there is no indication that congress intended to narrow that definition when it established a statutory definition of owner in section d,as part of the civil asset forfeiture reform act of,stat.
under this definition,the esseilehs were the owners of the checks at the time the checks were deposited into the union bank jordan accounts.the district court found,and we agree,that on the state of the evidence,any reasonable would be compelled to find that the esseilehs business was a joint venture or partnership among them and that the cashier checks at issue had been acquired and deposited in the normal course of that business.thus,the checks were property of the joint venture,and the esseilehs,as joint venturers,were owners of the funds at the time they were deposited,regardless of which account the funds were deposited into.united states currency,cir finding that the name on a bank account is not conclusive of ownership.
the question then becomes whether union bank jordan had discharged all or part of its obligation to the esseilehs,so as to become the owner of the seized funds under the exception to the general rule at section k b ii ii.the statute does not define the term obligation.nevertheless,in the context of bank deposits,the meaning of the term is clear.a deposit of a certain amount into a bank account creates a corresponding obligation on the part of the bank to repay that amount on demand.see fdic,cir b ank deposits represent obligations on the part of a bank to repay funds to depositors.such an obligation is discharged by repaying the appropriate amount.thus,a bank obligation to a depositor is measured by that depositor account balances.in this case,it is undisputed that on the dates of the seizures,the esseilehs together had funds on deposit exceeding the amount of the seizures because the esseilehs,including talal,were the prior owners of the funds,union bank jordan does not fit within the exception because it had not discharged its obligation to the prior owners,and it is thus not an owner of any portion of the seized funds.
union bank jordan disputes this interpretation of obligation,arguing that the term should be read more narrowly.while the district court rejected the bank interpretation,it adopted a different interpretation also narrower than the one we have described.neither of these two narrower interpretations is consistent with the language of the statute or its purpose,as reflected in the legislative history.
the primary argument of union bank jordan is that the bank obligation should be tied to its ability to obtain recourse for the seizure from its depositor,through setoff or otherwise.the bank then argues that because no recourse or setoff was possible in this case,it discharged its obligations and should be deemed the owner of the seized funds.this definition of obligation is said to stem both from the statutory language and from a purported congressional intent to equalize in all respects the treatment of foreign and domestic banks.neither claim is correct.
far from being supported by the statutory language,the bank interpretation is entirely unmoored from that language.recourse available to the bank is hardly an obligation it is in the nature of a legal right or a contingency on an obligation.if a bank is left without recourse,then its obligation remains in full force,rather than being discharged.nothing in the language of the statute ties the definition of obligation to the foreign bank rights of recourse or setoff.
indeed,the provision in section k b strongly indicates that congress did not intend to tie the bank lack of ownership over the funds to its recourse rights.section k b provides that the attorney general 
may suspend or terminate a forfeiture under this section if the attorney general determines that a conflict of law exists between the laws of the jurisdiction in which the foreign financial institution is located and the laws of the united states with respect to liabilities arising from the restraint,seizure,or arrest of such funds,and that such suspension or termination would be in the interest of justice and would not harm the national interests of the united states.
if,as union bank jordan asserts,the foreign bank were always able to assert ownership over any funds it could not recover from its depositors,section k b would not have been necessary.moreover,as section k b recognizes,the contours of the foreign bank rights may well be governed by foreign law and may well vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.there is every reason to think that congress intended to avoid such complexities in a statute meant to make forfeiture more efficient and more available.see.i,at.
as to the argument that congress intended to equalize the treatment of foreign and domestic banks,any such intent appears to have had more to do with subjecting foreign deposits to forfeiture as if they were domestic deposits than with protecting foreign banks from liabilities not faced by domestic banks.see cong.rec,at statement of levin describing the foreign bank lack of wrongdoing as a strange reason for letting the foreign depositor who was engaged in a wrongdoing escape forfeiture.furthermore,the legislative history indicates that the intent of the added money laundering provisions was not only to close the loopholes in existing law,but also to provide additional tools for law enforcement to use.id.at.
in the context of this case,the bank tries to further narrow the term obligation by arguing that its obligation arose under the cashier checks and that any obligation was discharged when the payment of those checks became final.but defining the bank obligation in terms of an obligation under a cashier check would tie the statutory language to the use of checks in this case,and there is no indication,either elsewhere in the statute or in the legislative history,that congress intended ownership to turn on whether cash or checks were deposited.in any event,the argument is backwards.the primary obligation under a cashier check is an obligation on the part of the issuing bank to pay a properly endorsed check.see united states boren,cir.such an obligation was one owed to union bank jordan,at least while it was the holder of the check it was not an obligation owed by union bank jordan.
union bank jordan relies heavily on the policy argument that absent some ability on the part of the foreign bank to collect from the foreign depositor,that depositor will have lost nothing in the forfeiture and hence will have no incentive to appear in the forfeiture proceeding,thus thwarting the expressed purpose of congress in crafting the ownership provisions.whether or not the bank is correct that it lacks recourse or setoff rights in this case,it has not explained why,as a general matter,banks are not in a position to protect themselves by contract or other means,so as to give the foreign depositor the appropriate incentive to appear landers heritage bank,considering whether a bank customer signature card was effective to permit the bank to debit the customer account based on a debit to the bank own account also freese regions bank,noting as a general principle that t he ucc permits parties to a contract of deposit to agree between themselves as to their duties and the legal consequences which flow therefrom.by imposing the loss on the bank as intermediary between the government and the foreign depositor,as the statute does,the bank has an incentive to explore all available options for passing on the loss and thereby forcing foreign depositors such as the esseilehs into courts where they will be subject to discovery.otherwise,the foreign bank would have every incentive,as union bank jordan has done here,to step into its customers shoes as claimants in the forfeiture proceeding,exactly the result congress wanted to avoid.
as a position,union bank jordan argued to the district court that its obligations were limited to those arising from the account into which particular funds were deposited.since most of the checks were deposited into the samir account,which was closed before the first seizure,the bank argued that it was the owner of at least those funds.the district court rejected such an limitation,finding the money in different accounts potentially fungible.
the court did,however,adopt a different limitation that it had fashioned,holding that the only relevant obligations were those that arise from the bank receipt of forfeitable funds.the court explained that the government would have had to provide evidence of transfers between the mohammed ghaleb account and talal esseileh account in order to have included obligations under talal account.union bank jordan pursues both its original theory and that of the district court on appeal.
the flaw with these theories is that they are premised on a conception of section k as reaching through the foreign bank to seize amounts in particular accounts,whereas the language and structure of the statute indicate that congress intended to use the ownership provisions to reach through the bank to particular depositors.the obligation at issue in section k is the bank obligation to the prior owner of the funds,k b ii ii,not the obligation under a specific account or the obligation arising from the deposit of forfeitable funds.congress could have added language limiting the relevant obligations,but it did not do so 
indeed,had congress intended to limit forfeitures under section k to amounts corresponding to the balance in particular accounts,section k a would have been the natural place to do so.but as we have noted,the deeming language in that section makes the deposit of forfeitable funds in the foreign account,not the continued presence of funds in that account,the trigger for a forfeiture from the interbank account.there would have been no reason to craft such language if congress had intended to limit forfeitures to the amounts in particular accounts.union bank jordan is correct that,as a formal matter,its argument relates only to the ownership provision in section k b and not the forfeiture provision in section k a.one of the key purposes of congress in enacting section k,however,was to expand the ultimate reach of the civil forfeiture statute by eliminating the foreign bank ability to assert an innocent owner defense in most cases.see.i,at.since congress was keenly aware that granting ownership to the foreign bank would often defeat forfeiture,we can not believe that congress would have intended the ownership provision to implicitly incorporate an limitation,when the forfeiture provision carefully avoids such a limitation.
there appears to be no legislative history directly addressing the meaning of the term obligation in section k b ii ii.statements in the legislative history,however,do support our view that ownership is to be measured in terms of the bank relationship to its depositor,and not in terms of its relationship to particular accounts.the house committee report notes that section k would treat the deposit in the correspondent account as a debt owed directly to the depositor,and not as a debt owed to the respondent bank.id.at.in describing the effect of the provision,no mention is made of the foreign account.id.instead,the focus is on the debt represented by the amount in the interbank account.the ownership provisions create the fiction that this debt is owed to the foreign depositor.the statutory exception at section k b ii ii ensures that this debt corresponds to a real debt owed by the foreign bank to the foreign depositor.for those purposes,it does not matter in which account that debt is located.
the district court expressed discomfort with the result we reach,finding that it would effectively expose foreign deposits to forfeiture that would not have been exposed had they been domestic deposits.that is the unequivocal result of the deeming language in section k a,however.the district court relied on the fact that under section a,in a domestic forfeiture,only amounts in the same place or account as the forfeitable funds are themselves subject to forfeiture.section k a contains no such limitation,nor does section k reference the application of section,except to disclaim it.see k n or shall it be necessary for the government to rely on the application of section.thus,whatever disparity exists between foreign deposits and domestic deposits under section k has been created by section k a.as we have already described,we do not believe congress would have intended to use the ownership provisions in section k b to alter this result.
lastly,both the district court and union bank jordan invoke the canon of construction that forfeitures are to be narrowly construed in support of their different limiting interpretations of the term obligation.to begin with,such a canon only has application in resolving ambiguities,and,as we have described,the language at issue here can not support the interpretations of the district court and union bank jordan.see sedima,imrex,d the principle is merely a guide to statutory interpretation.like its identical twin,the rule of lenity,it only serves as an aid for resolving an ambiguity it is not to be used to beget one.quoting callanan united states,d.
moreover,it is not clear the canon would cut in favor of a narrow interpretation of obligation.if the bank is deemed the owner of some part of the funds,no other person shall qualify as the owner of such funds.k b ii.thus,to allow the bank claim for ownership as to certain funds is to deny ownership to all other claimants to the same funds.as a result,when multiple claimants are involved,the interpretation of obligation that we find compelled by the statute actually works to promote the broadest set of claimants.
because we find that the district court unduly limited the obligations that the bank must discharge in order to claim ownership,we reverse the district court holding that union bank jordan was the owner of some portion of the seized funds and hold that union bank jordan was not the owner under the statute of any of the funds.as such,union bank jordan does not have the statutory right to assert an innocent owner defense to the forfeiture.
we turn next to the claim of union bank jordan that the forfeiture in this case is an excessive fine under the eighth amendment.at the outset,the government appears to have challenged the district court jurisdiction to entertain this claim,and hence our jurisdiction,arguing that union bank jordan lacks article iii standing.an issue of article iii standing is one that we must resolve before proceeding to the merits.steel citizens for a better env t,d.
here,it is clear that regardless of whether union bank jordan is an owner under section k,it has article iii standing to challenge the forfeiture.to have constitutional standing,a claimant generally need only show any colorable claim on the defendant property,a requirement that we have characterized as very forgiving.united states share of james bulger in all present future proceeds of mass millions lottery ticket no,cir.the funds seized in this case were taken from the bank account of union bank jordan,an account over which it exercised full dominion and control.this suffices to establish article iii standing.see currency,at.that union bank jordan is not a statutory owner of the funds does not,and can not,alter its article iii standing.see united states v.one lincoln navigator,cir.
nevertheless,prudential concerns limit the bank ability to raise an eighth amendment challenge to the forfeiture of funds of which it is not a statutory owner.prudential standing doctrine encompasses,among other principles,the general prohibition on a litigant raising another person legal rights.allen wright,d.thus,to the extent that the bank is claiming that the forfeiture in this case is an excessive fine against the esseilehs,or other statutory owners of the funds,the bank lacks prudential standing.given congress goal in section k of bringing foreign depositors into forfeiture proceedings in lieu of foreign banks,there is no reason to allow foreign banks to assert the rights of those foreign depositors.
union bank jordan does have standing to argue that the forfeiture is an excessive fine against the bank itself,but this argument fails on the merits.a forfeiture is limited by the eighth amendment only if it is punitive,at least in part.see austin united states,d.a forfeiture under section k,however,is not intended to punish the foreign bank at all,at least when the foreign bank is not a statutory owner indeed,the ownership provisions in section k b were drafted as such precisely because the foreign bank would often be innocent and congress wanted to make this innocence irrelevant in most cases.id.at.finding that innocent owner defenses serve to focus the forfeiture provisions on the culpability of the owner,thus making such provisions look more punitive.congress evident intent was to use the foreign bank merely as an intermediary to reach the foreign depositor.regardless of whether union bank jordan might be left to bear the cost of the forfeiture in this case,the forfeiture does not treat the bank as an object of punishment,and hence the eighth amendment does not limit the government ability to extract funds from the bank interbank account in the first instance 
union bank jordan also argues that the district court erred in requiring single,simultaneous for summary judgment and a joint statement of undisputed material facts.our review of such a case management order is for abuse of discretion see vélez awning windows,cir.
there was no abuse of discretion here.the district court required the filing of a joint statement of undisputed material facts and limited each side to a single brief,but nothing in the district court orders can be read to have limited the parties to referencing only undisputed facts.the district court orders simply required the parties to place on the record the facts to which they could agree.the orders did not remove from consideration those facts that were still disputed,and they certainly did not preclude union bank jordan from arguing in its brief that genuine issues of material fact remained.as the district court noted at the hearing on reconsideration to suggest that the court would attempt to foreclose one of the bank options for resisting summary judgment is absurd.the court found that n o lawyer could reasonably have construe d anything the court said to mean that the bank was prevented from raising disputed factual issues.
in any event,if the bank in fact believed that the district court orders were preventing it from meeting its burden on summary judgment,it was the bank responsibility to contemporaneously object or seek clarification.had the bank done so,the district court would have had the opportunity to correct any misunderstandings and to adjust the procedure as appropriate.raising the issue on reconsideration,after the district court opportunity to address the situation had passed,was too late.see cmm cable rep,ocean coast,cir.
finally,we address krauzer claim that the district court erred in striking his september claim as untimely.our review is for abuse of discretion.united states v.one dairy farm,cir.
krauzer admits that his september claim was untimely but he argues that the district court should have permitted the claim as an equitable matter because the untimeliness of the claim was the result of excusable neglect.see pioneer inv.servs.brunswick assocs,d.in pioneer,the supreme court articulated a list of factors relevant to determining whether a party proffering an untimely submission has made a showing of excusable neglect.these factors include the danger of prejudice to the opposing party,the length of the delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings,the reason for the delay,including whether it was within the reasonable control of the movant,and whether the movant acted in good faith.id.at.krauzer cites the same factors in defense of his claim.
a consideration of the pioneer factors,however,clearly demonstrates that the district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting krauzer claim of excusable neglect.importantly,krauzer offers no valid excuse for the late filing of his claim.krauzer argues that because the bank filed a claim to these funds,he should have been excused from filing a competing claim until after the district court had rejected the bank claim.this is simply not true.the deadline for filing a claim in a forfeiture proceeding exists precisely to force all claims,competing or not,to be made known at the outset of the proceeding.this procedure not only permits,but requires,the filing of competing claims,in the interest of judicial economy.see dea,cir.
despite krauzer argument to the contrary,it makes no difference that this case involved a novel issue of statutory interpretation.krauzer can not reasonably argue that his claim was based on an interpretation of the statute that caught him by surprise.the interpretation that led to the denial of the bank claim was precisely the interpretation that the government had been proposing from the beginning.krauzer argument in this regard boils down to the assertion that he assumed the bank would win.it was not reasonable to forgo filing a competing claim on the basis of such an assumption.united states santa barbara drive,cir just because the claimants claims were not obviously winning ones does not excuse their failure to file in a timely fashion.
krauzer does not suggest that inadvertence explains his failure to file a timely claim to the amounts seized from the interbank account of union bank jordan.any such suggestion is undermined in any event by his having filed claims to amounts seized from other banks interbank accounts.thus,krauzer appears to have made a tactical decision to forgo the filing of a claim,just as the esseilehs appear to have made a tactical decision to forgo filing their claim.krauzer offers no reason not to hold him to his decision.
moreover,allowing krauzer late claim,filed almost two and a half years after the deadline,would have resulted in prejudice to the government and disruption of the judicial proceedings.both the government and the district court were entitled to know at the outset what competing claims would be made to the seized funds.the government may well have made different litigation and settlement choices had krauzer filed his claim alongside that of the bank.and the district court could have structured its case management orders and rulings to resolve the parties competing claims of ownership simultaneously.
in addition,krauzer claim depends on his assertions about his indemnification of the esseilehs.these assertions were never explored in discovery because they were neither relevant to krauzer earlier claim nor relevant to the claim of union bank jordan.the potential need to reopen discovery would also prejudice the government and disrupt the proceedings.given the significant costs of permitting krauzer claim,together with the lack of an excuse for its untimeliness,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in striking the claim.
the judgment of the district court finding that union bank jordan was the owner of some portion of the seized funds is reversed.in all other respects,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.costs on appeal are awarded to the united states.
the court first held that,contrary to the bank argument,union bank jordan was the foreign financial institution under k b i ii and hence was excluded by that provision from the definition of an owner unless one of the exceptions in k b ii applied.union bank jordan does not challenge thi
