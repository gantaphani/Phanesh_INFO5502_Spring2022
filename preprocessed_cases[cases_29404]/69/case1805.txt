michael sean huitt and matt nino hereafter collectively plaintiffs were injured while attempting to light a water heater at a construction site hereafter the school site or school owned by the porterville unified school district hereafter the school district.after initial attempts to light the water heater pilot light failed,huitt decided to bleed any accumulated air in the natural gas pipe.this action caused natural gas to accumulate in the water heater closet.after huitt sealed the natural gas line,he again attempted to light the water heater pilot light.the accumulated natural gas exploded,resulting in serious injuries to plaintiffs.
plaintiffs filed suit against the southern california gas company hereafter the gas company,alleging that the natural gas that had accumulated in the water heater closet lacked any odorant.natural gas,in its natural state,is a colorless and odorless gas.federal regulations require odorant be added to natural gas so that it is detectable by a person with a normal sense of smell,subd.a.
the evidence established that the odorant added to natural gas is adsorbed by new steel gas pipes until the pipes become seasoned or saturated.it was undisputed that the natural gas supplied by the gas company to the school site was odorized properly at the meter,but the odorant was adsorbed as it traveled through the new steel gas pipes owned and installed by the school district.
plaintiffs argued the gas company had a duty to warn them that new steel gas pipes adsorb the odorant in the natural gas and,had they known of this fact,they would not have bled the gas pipe into a confined closet.the jury agreed and awarded each plaintiff in excess of million in compensatory damages.in addition,the jury found that the gas company acted with malice and awarded each plaintiff million in punitive damages.
the gas company urges us to reverse the judgment for a variety of reasons.it contends it did not owe a duty to plaintiffs and,even if it did,plaintiffs failed to establish a causal connection between the failure to warn and plaintiffs injuries.it also alleges that the trial court was without jurisdiction to hear the case because it was preempted by the authority of the public utilities commission hereafter puc or commission.finally,the gas company argues there was no evidence to establish it acted with malice.
we find it unnecessary to address each of these arguments because we conclude there was no evidence that,had the gas company issued a warning,either huitt or nino would have been aware of it.the lack of evidence that the gas company failure to issue a warning was the cause of the accident precludes recovery by plaintiffs.accordingly,we will reverse the judgment and order judgment be entered in favor of the gas company.
factual and procedural summary 
in the first amended complaint,plaintiffs alleged they were hired to perform various tasks at the school site,including the lighting of a hot water heater.natural gas escaped from natural gas pipes and,when plaintiffs attempted to light the water heater,fire filled the room,causing them serious and permanent injuries.
plaintiffs specifically alleged the gas company negligently installed,maintained,and inspected its equipment,resulting in a gas leak that resulted in the fire that injured plaintiffs in a separate cause of action,plaintiffs alleged the gas company product was unsafe because the odorizing agent added to the natural gas was neutralized when it ran through the new pipes at the school site.therefore,when gas escaped from the pipes,plaintiffs were unable to smell it and attempted to light the water heater,even though the room was filled with natural gas.the gas company responded with a general denial to the unverified complaint and asserted affirmative defenses.
ii.testimony 
this was a lengthy trial with numerous witnesses.although we have reviewed the entire transcript of the trial,we limit our factual summary to the witnesses we deem relevant to the issue of causation.
michael sean huitt 
huitt,an experienced plumber,was employed by todd plumbing and was told to go to the school site to work on a list of items that needed completion.when he arrived there on november,he was told there was no hot water on one side of the building.huitt went into the water heater closet and followed his standard procedure for starting a water heater.he turned on the gas valve,turned the valve to pilot,held down the red button,and hit the striker to light the pilot light.the pilot light did not light.huitt glanced at the lighting instructions but did not pay attention as he had lit many water heaters in the past.
when the water heater would not light,huitt shut off the natural gas valve and then opened a valve to bleed out any air that might have been in the gas pipe.a high pressure stream of what later was determined to be natural gas came out of the gas pipe.this caused huitt to believe the gas pipe was still under air test pressure.in a normal natural gas pipe there should be only about pound per square inch of pressure.there was considerably more pressure in this pipe,causing huitt to believe air test pressure had been retained in the pipe.the only odor huitt smelled was of pipe machine oil.he did not smell natural gas.had he smelled natural gas,he would have opened the door and aired out the room before again attempting to light the water heater.
huitt left the gas pipe open for a matter of seconds.he then put the cap back on and followed the same procedures to light the pilot light.when he hit the igniter,he heard the whoosh of the flame.huitt held his breath,closed his eyes,and pushed nino into the small room next to the water heater closet.the door shut behind nino and huitt fell to the ground.he could smell his hair and skin burning and knew he would be severely scarred.he tried to open the door,but the skin on his hand peeled off.nino eventually opened the door and helped huitt out of the closet.
huitt was in severe pain and was taken to the local hospital where he was treated.he was transferred to the burn center at university medical center umc for further treatment.huitt was diagnosed with superficial first and second degree burns on his left and right upper extremities,including his hands,totaling percent of his body.the pain was severe and huitt lost consciousness several times during treatment.
huitt insisted on going home the following day.his wife assisted in his care.his bandages had to be changed twice a day,and each time the pain was excruciating.huitt also suffered three outbreaks of mrsa staphylococcus aureus,a severe infection.two of huitt sons also contracted mrsa infections.he returned to work a few weeks after the accident.thankfully,he did not have any residual scarring.
at the time of the accident,huitt did not know odorant in natural gas could fade.
nino was working as a plumber helper on the day of the accident.he had gone with huitt to the school site to work on a punch list.the superintendent on the school site showed them to the water heater closet,which was inside of a janitor closet.huitt and nino tried to start the water heater but it would not light.they decided to bleed the gas pipe for five to seconds.huitt then attempted to light the water heater and the natural gas in the room ignited.nino reached for the door but the skin came off of his hands.he eventually was able to open the door and exit the room.the door closed before huitt was able to get out of the room.nino opened the door with his elbow and huitt was able to escape.they went outside and were sprayed with water by one of the other workers.when the ambulance arrived,they were given morphine and taken to the local hospital.from there they were transported to the burn unit at umc,where they were admitted to the intensive care unit.
nino went through the debridement process,which caused incredible pain.initially,the bandages had to be changed daily,but then nino was given a different bandage that had to be changed every other day.it was extremely painful when the bandages were removed.nino had to make sure the bandages did not dry out,so every four hours he had to squirt distilled water on them.
after discharge,nino returned to the hospital every other day to have his bandages changed.after approximately two weeks,he began using a bandage that had to be changed daily,but could be changed at home.he was required to keep his injuries bandaged for three to four weeks.
nino eventually contracted an mrsa infection in his leg that caused him to miss a few days of work.he has not had an outbreak since early.he did not need skin grafts after the accident.
nino admitted that neither he nor huitt read the instructions when attempting to light the water heater.
ronald aaron marks 
marks,a mechanical engineer who was retained by plaintiffs,examined the water heater huitt was attempting to light.no flaws were found in the water heater.he opined that when huitt pushed the igniter button,the spark ignited the natural gas huitt had bled into the room.marks went on to opine that there was no odorant in the natural gas because,if there had been,huitt,an experienced plumber,would have smelled the odorant and would not have attempted to light the water heater.
marks did not fault huitt for not reading the installation manual for the water heater because huitt had worked with the same unit before and was familiar with it.
marks reviewed the manual for the water heater and noted it advised the installer that conditions such as odor fade can cause the odorant to diminish intensity or fade and not be readily detectable.prior to this case,marks had not heard of odor fade.nor had he seen a warning in the installation manuals of various plumbing appliances with which he was familiar.
after learning of odor fade,marks spoke with numerous individuals in the field.none of the individuals with whom marks spoke had heard of odor fade.he researched the issue on the internet,however,and discovered a lot of information about odor fade.
marks,who has reviewed warnings from gas companies,has never seen a warning involving odor fade.on,he was presented with several instruction manuals for various appliances that all had warnings about odor fade.
marks opined that huitt did not violate the plumbing code requirement that prohibits the purging of natural gas into confined spaces because neither huitt nor nino smelled any natural gas 
paul bladdick 
bladdick,a plumber called as an expert witness by plaintiffs,has written a few articles about odor fade in publications directed at the plumbing trade bladdick did not know of any gas company in the united states that warned about odor fade.he searched the internet and found numerous articles on the topic.
edward saltzberg 
saltzberg,a mechanical engineer specializing in plumbing engineering,has been working in the plumbing field for over years and has published over articles in various plumbing related publications.he had never heard of odor fade before this case.when he learned of the topic,he discussed it with the los angeles chapter of the american society of plumbing engineers aspe and the los angeles chapter of the international association of plumbing and mechanical officials iapmo.no one at either meeting had heard of odor fade,including a representative of the gas company.nor had any of the gas company representatives who attended the meetings ever mentioned odor fade as a potential problem in new construction or any other context.
saltzberg opined that the accident would not have occurred if huitt had smelled the odorant in the natural gas because he would not have attempted to light the water heater with gas in the room.saltzberg further opined that huitt complied with the requirements of the plumbing code when he attempted to light the water heater.it is normal practice to continue bleeding a gas pipe until you smell gas,so saltzberg did not fault huitt for bleeding the gas pipe when the water heater initially did not light.
thomas liston 
liston,a mechanical engineer who specializes in heating,ventilation,air conditioning,and plumbing,was retained by the school district insurer to investigate the cause of the fire.
liston did not find any problem with the two pressure reducers in the gas pipe.he calculated that huitt must have purged the pipe for about two minutes to build up a sufficient quantity of gas in the water heater closet to ignite.it would have been impossible for enough natural gas to accumulate in the water heater closet to cause the explosion if the pipe had been purged for approximately five seconds.
liston found a lot of literature on odorant and odorant fade on the internet.he opined that the cause of this accident was a lack of odorant in the natural gas.he also opined that gas companies should provide information about new steel pipes adsorbing the odorant in natural gas.
patrick mcshane 
mcshane was employed as a measurement and regulation technician for the gas company at the time of the accident.one of his duties was to check the level of odorant in the natural gas.the tests were conducted monthly.on october,five weeks before the accident,mcshane checked the odorant of the natural gas in the springville gas pipe and recorded that it was readily detectable to strong.mcshane expected the odorant to be at approximately the same level at the school site meter.in november,the test results indicated the odor was readily detectable.the same result was reached when the springville pipe was checked in december and january.
mark wurtenberger 
wurtenberger had worked for the gas company for years turning on gas.wurtenberger turned on the gas at the school site on september.the water heater in question had not been installed,but the kitchen was functional.there was a leak at that time and he issued a written notice of a dangerous condition.
ivan zelada 
zelada was a senior engineer with the gas company.as part of his job,he was responsible for pickling new natural gas pipes.he explained that pickling pipes occurs when additional odorant is injected into natural gas transmission pipes so that the natural gas does not lose its odorant when it passes through new transmission pipes.
zelada thought that a possible cause of the loss of odorant at the school site was adsorption of the odorant by the new gas pipes installed by the school district.this was the first time zelada had seen a situation where the customer pipes had adsorbed the odorant in the natural gas.
larry sasadeusz 
sasadeusz managed the engineering analysis center for the gas company.the engineering analysis center is similar to a research facility,and one of its tasks is to ensure that the gas company natural gas is odorized properly.he explained the gas company policy was to contact the engineering analysis center when a project included around feet of new diameter steel pipe.various factors would be examined then to determine if,and how,a new pipe would be pickled.
sasadeusz explained that united states department of transportation regulations require natural gas to be odorized at the lower explosive limit.he explained that natural gas will not ignite in the air if it is diluted below percent.nor will it ignite if the concentration is above percent.it will ignite only if the concentration of natural gas is between and percent.therefore,the regulations require that sufficient odorant be added to natural gas so that it is readily detectable whenever the concentration level reaches of percent,or percent one part natural gas to parts air.
bernard cuzzillo.
cuzzillo,a consulting mechanical engineer called as an expert witness by the gas company,opined that huitt must have bled the natural gas pipe for a minimum of two and minutes for enough gas to accumulate and explode when huitt attempted to light the water heater.he explained that if the pipe had been bled for a shorter time,the concentration of gas in the room would have been insufficient to support combustion.he also explained that the pipe could not have been under test pressure because it was in use for appliances other than the water heater and excessive pressure would have damaged not only the water heater but also these other appliances.
iii.the judgment 
the jury found that the gas company should have warned about odor fade,and the failure to do so was a substantial factor in the plaintiffs injuries.huitt was awarded lost earnings of,medical expenses of,no future economic damages,past noneconomic damages of,and future noneconomic damages of.nino was awarded lost earnings of,medical expenses of,no future economic damages,past noneconomic damages of,and future noneconomic damages of.
huitt was found to be percent at fault,while nino actions were found not to have contributed to the accident.
the jury also found that the gas company acted with malice and that such action was authorized or approved by its officers and awarded huitt and nino each in punitive damages.
plaintiffs were required to prove the gas company failure to warn about odor fade was a substantial factor in causing their injuries.johnson american standard,cal th,d,johnson.the trial court instructed the jury that plaintiffs were required to prove that lack of sufficient warnings was a substantial factor in causing their injuries.
the gas company contends there was no evidence that its conduct was a cause of the accident.plaintiffs argue,however,that had they known natural gas odorant could be adsorbed by new steel pipes,they would not have bled the natural gas pipe for over two minutes into a confined area,thus avoiding the accident.
definition of causation 
causation consists of two separate questions was the gas company conduct the cause in fact of plaintiffs injuries,and are there policy factors that may preclude the imposition of liability.viner sweet cal th,fn,d.an act is a cause in fact if it is a necessary antecedent of an event.citation.whether defendant negligence was a cause in fact of plaintiff damage is a factual question for the jury to resolve.citation.by contrast,the second element focuses on public policy considerations.because the purported causes of an event may be traced back to the dawn of humanity,the law has imposed additional limitations on liability other than simple causality.citation.these additional limitations are related not only to the degree of connection between the conduct and the injury,but also with public policy.citation.thus,proximate cause is ordinarily concerned,not with the fact of causation,but with the various considerations of policy that limit an actor responsibility for the consequences of his conduct.citation.ferguson lieff,cabraser,heimann bernstein cal th,d.while this case implicates both aspects of causation,we conclude that plaintiffs have not established that the gas company failure to warn was a cause in fact of their injuries.
analysis of evidence 
we must determine whether the gas company failure to issue a warning about the propensity of new steel pipes to adsorb the odorant in natural gas was a substantial factor in causing plaintiffs harm.we review the record for substantial evidence.romo ford motor th,d,overruled on other grounds in people ault cal th,fn,d.we are required to review the whole record,looking for evidence that is reasonable,credible,and of solid value.people hillhouse cal th,d,people superior court jones cal th,d.we presume the existence of every fact the trier of fact reasonably could deduce from the evidence that supports the judgment.people kraft cal th,d.we will not substitute our evaluations of a witness credibility for that of the trier of fact.people koontz cal th,d.
plaintiffs counsel argued to the jury that the accident was caused by the lack of odorant in the natural gas.plaintiffs urge us to find substantial evidence of causation because two of their experts testified that once they learned of odor fade,they began doing whatever they could to spread the word throughout the industry.one of their experts brought the issue up at local meetings of the iapmo and the aspe.another expert testified he had made it a personal campaign to get the word out.finally,plaintiffs argue that causation is a matter of common sense and the jury could have inferred from the facts that a warning would have prevented huitt actions leading to the accident.
plaintiffs arguments confuse knowledge with causation.their argument,in essence,is that if they had known that the odorant in natural gas could fade,they would not have bled the natural gas pipe servicing the water heater for over two minutes we agree with this contention.but causation,in this case,requires the plaintiffs to prove that if the gas company had issued a warning,they would have acquired the knowledge they lacked.a warning that never reached plaintiffs would not have changed the events that occurred on the day of the accident.
plaintiffs fail to address this issue,perhaps because of the difficulties of providing an effective warning in this case.in many instances,a manufacturer issuing a warning has a simple and expedient method to do so.a manufacturer of cigarettes can print a warning on the package containing the product.similarly,a manufacturer of a table saw can include warnings with its product,even placing warning labels directly on the product.
not so here.the product,natural gas,is conveyed over great distances directly to the consumer through pipelines,most of which are never seen by the consumer.in most instances,the consumer never handles the product,but uses the product in other appliances for the consumer benefit.the consumer has no direct contact with the product itself.even if the consumer has direct contact,the product can not be seen.
therefore,if a warning is required it must be delivered in some other form.so,how can the gas company effectively warn consumers and tradesmen about odor fade this is a question plaintiffs did not answer in the trial court,and have not answered in this court.several possible vehicles for issuing a warning have been posited but,as we shall explain,none withstand analysis.
at one point plaintiffs argued to the jury that a notice could be included in customers bills,or a warning could be posted on the gas company internet web site.plaintiffs also seemed to suggest the gas company could have its employees,who attend meetings of various plumbing organizations,inform those organizations about odor fade.
every one of these examples requires some proof that the warning would have reached the plaintiffs.if a warning had been included in each of the bills sent to customers by the gas company,the plaintiffs would not have received the warning unless they purchased natural gas from the gas company.if they were the gas company customers,they would not have received the warning unless they opened the family mail and saw the warning by reading the material enclosed.there was no testimony that plaintiffs bought natural gas from the gas company,opened their bills,or reviewed each enclosure in detail.
moreover,issuing a warning in this fashion would be ineffective.although the record is silent on the issue,we are confident that the vast majority of the gas company customers receive their natural gas in established natural gas pipes.from this record it appears that odor fade occurs in new steel gas pipes.few,if any,established customers would be concerned with issues related to new steel pipes.an effective warning must be directed at new construction and the customers of new construction.
the lack of causation also is apparent if other forms of warnings,even those directed to the new construction industry,are examined.a warning to design professionals may result in the warning being added to the plans prepared for the project,but it is uncertain that such a warning would reach a plumber working on a project,especially in a case like this where plaintiffs were sent to the job site to perform minor tasks after the pipes were installed.
perhaps warnings could be given to building inspectors.again,however,there is no guarantee that a plumber working on a large project would have contact with the building inspector,or the topic would be addressed if the plumber happened to meet with the building inspector.even if the gas company employees informed the job foreman at every large job site of the possible loss of odorant in the natural gas,we can not be certain that the job foreman would pass the word on to every individual plumber.we are certain that this record contains no evidence that would permit us to
