utah gospel mission,first unitarian church of salt lake city,utah national organization for women,and lee seigel appeal the district court denial of a preliminary injunction and grant of the motion for dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b made by salt lake city corporation,ross anderson,and corporation of the presiding bishop of the church of jesus christ of saints.we exercise jurisdiction under and affirm.
background 
in,salt lake city the city sold a section of main street to appellee corporation of the presiding bishop of the church of jesus christ of saints the lds church.the city allowed public expression on main street before it was sold.main street was sold to enable the church to build a plaza,which the city hoped would promote downtown pedestrian traffic and stimulate business.the plaza objective attributes and primary purpose are different from the former main street.for example,the walking surface differs from that of an ordinary sidewalk or street,the entrances are marked by large planters,waterfalls,and stone signs,and the plaza stated purpose is to act as an ecclesiastical park.utah gospel mission salt lake city,d.the city deed reserved an easement for public access and passage,but provided that the lds church could prohibit expressive conduct on the property.the property was valued at million without reduction for the value of the easement,and the church paid the entire amount with the easement.id.at.the church prohibited soliciting,begging,demonstrations,protests,leafleting,and other activities perceived as disruptive.after the plaza was built,a group of plaintiffs sued,claiming that the city access and passage easement constituted a public forum.we agreed,holding that the easement was a public forum upon which restrictions on speech could not be enforced.first unitarian church of salt lake city salt lake city,cir.
following first unitarian church,the city sold the easement,valued at approximately,in return for acres of land in a low income neighborhood and a million recreation center to be built on that land.the settlement agreement and amended deed specifically stated no right of public is the intent of the parties to eliminate any right of public access or passage enforceable by the city or by members of the public in relation to the main street plaza property.utah gospel mission,d at.however,the city retained a right of reentry that could be exercised if the church failed to maintain the plaza as a landscaped space.additionally,the city retained certain utility easements allowing pipes and electrical conduits to pass under the plaza.
on august,another group of plaintiffs sued the city and the lds church,claiming that the plaza remains a public forum despite the sale of the access and passage easement,and that the sale of the easement to the church violated the establishment clause.plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction to prevent the church from restricting free speech activities on the plaza on november.the church then moved to dismiss the complaint.on may,the district court denied plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction and granted the church motion to dismiss,holding that the plaza is now entirely privately owned and thus beyond the reach of the first amendment,the secular purposes supporting the easement were both obvious and numerous,and the sale of the easement,as a matter of law,did not advance or endorse religion because the sale was in exchange for adequate consideration.utah gospel mission,d at.plaintiffs filed timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
we review a dismissal under.b de novo.summum callaghan,cir.accordingly,we must accept all the allegations of the complaint as true and must construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.id.internal quotations and citations omitted.the court will uphold a rule b dismissal only when it appears that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the claims that would entitle him to relief.id.internal quotations and citations omitted.
the district court relied upon materials outside the complaint in resolving the motion to dismiss,including an amended deed and settlement agreement,which were referenced,but not included in the complaint.generally,a district court must convert a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment when matters outside the pleadings are relied upon.b miller glanz,cir.a motion to dismiss considers the conduct alleged in the complaint,whereas a motion for summary judgment considers the evidence or lack thereof upon which the allegations are based.bell fur breeders agric,cir.we have recognized however,that a document central to the plaintiff claim and referred to in the complaint may be considered in resolving a motion to dismiss,at least where the document authenticity is not in dispute.county of santa fe pub.serv.of,cir gff associated wholesale grocers,cir.the district court also properly took judicial notice of a ordinance.zimomra alamo,cir.
the district court declined to convert the motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment,so of course no notice issue is presented.utah gospel mission,d at.it declined a motion to strike other evidentiary material in support of the motion to dismiss after stating that it did not rely on such material.id.at.the court then stated that plaintiffs could not have claimed surprise had it converted the motion to one for summary judgment without notice.id.at.this was because plaintiffs were allowed discovery in connection with their request for a preliminary injunction,and plaintiffs argued in a supplemental authority letter that the city motivation to sell the easement was uniquely factual and could not be dismissed under rule b or rule.id.the court then observed that consideration of extrinsic evidence bolsters the court conclusion that plaintiffs claims must be dismissed because plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that a material disputed fact existed about any genuine issue.id.
we reject this dicta.it is true that constructive notice or a reliance upon evidentiary materials in response to a motion to dismiss may obviate the need for formal notice by the court of conversion.alexander oklahoma,cir.but neither exception seems applicable here,and the should not have to guess about the court intention.not having provided such notice,it is at best premature for the district court to express such an opinion.we treat the district court disposition as a ruling on a motion to dismiss.
on appeal,plaintiffs contend that this case is about motives,arguing that the motives of both the city and the lds church are totally transparent.aplt.br.at.plaintiffs claim that at the very least,they are entitled to the benefit of the allegations in their complaint that the city vacating the easement was a pretext for content and viewpoint discrimination,id.at,and a sham or facade adopted to conceal an improper religious motive.id.at.they suggest that such motivation is a uniquely factual determination that is inappropriate for disposition under rule b.id.at.while this might be the case,the plaintiffs position can permissibly be evaluated within the context of the hundreds of factual allegations contained in their complaint,and the express purposes of the transaction contained in the settlement agreement,amended deed,and ordinance.having reviewed those items,and for reasons discussed below,we conclude that the district court was correct in concluding that the complaint failed to state a claim.
failure to state a free speech claim 
it is,of course,a commonplace that the constitutional guarantee of free speech is a guarantee only against abridgment by government,federal or state.hudgens nlrb,d.thus,to prove a violation of the first amendment right to free speech,plaintiffs must either demonstrate that the church,as the sole owner of the plaza,is a state actor,or that the plaza is nevertheless a public forum in spite of its sale to a private owner.the court first found that a private property owner can be a state actor for first amendment purposes in marsh alabama.in that case,the court concluded that the property interests of gulf shipbuilding corporation,the private owner of a company town that did not function differently from any other town,id.at,did not allow the company to regulate speech more strictly than a municipality.id.at.
applying this theory,the court found that a private entity performs a public function when it operates a park that is public in nature and attempts to enforce racial restrictions.evans newton,d t he public character of this park requires that it be treated as a public institution subject to the command of the fourteenth amendment,regardless of who now has title under state law.evans has since been limited to the unique facts involved.flagg.brooks,d noting that evans involved extraordinary circumstances and distinguishing that case because there was actual involvement of the city in the daily maintenance and care of the park.at one point,the court expanded the public function doctrine to encompass the activities of a private shopping center.amalgamated food employees union local logan valley plaza,d.however,the court later overruled this expansion.hudgens,at.w e make clear now,if it was not clear before,that the rationale of logan valley did not survive the court decision in lloyd tanner,d.
accordingly,the public function doctrine has essentially been limited to the facts of marsh and evans,which differ greatly from the facts of the instant case.while marsh involved a privately owned town with all the normal attributes of a typical municipality,such as stores,churches,utilities,sidewalks,and streets,the plaza is an open space clearly delineated from the surrounding streets and sidewalks.similarly,evans involved a city attempt to enforce racially restrictive covenants governing a privately owned park that the city maintained.the plaza at issue here is maintained solely by the lds church it is not operated or maintained by the city.moreover,following marsh and evans,plaintiffs can point to no case in which a court has found that a private entity control is so pervasive that it is performing a public function.marsh and evans are factually inapposite the speech restrictions by the lds church do not constitute state action under the public function doctrine.
alternatively,plaintiffs argue that even if the church is not a state actor,the plaza,by its nature,is still a public forum.certainly,property does not become a public forum simply because a private owner generally opens his property to the public.hudgens,at.lloyd,at.on appeal,plaintiffs argue that notwithstanding its private ownership,the plaza is a public forum.
first,plaintiffs seem to argue that a public forum may never be sold to a private entity,or that if it is sold,it remains a public forum.this argument is foreclosed by our precedent.the fact that the plaza used to be a public street does not render it a traditional public forum.hawkins city county of denver,cir determining that a former public street that was converted into an,glass covered pedestrian walkway that led to a performing arts center is not a public forum.moreover,the government always retains authority to close a public forum by selling the property.int l soc y for krishna consciousness,lee,d kennedy,concurring see also first unitarian church,at stating that city may relinquish easement so property becomes entirely private.plaintiffs argument to the contrary is without merit.
next,plaintiffs claim that for a street or sidewalk to be changed from a presumptively public forum to private property,the physical characteristics must also change.see,lee,at.kennedy,concurring explaining that to change a property public forum status,the state must alter the objective physical character or uses of the property venetian casino resort local joint exec.bd.of las vegas,cir finding no alteration because the sidewalk still performed the same role as it did previously.
however,plaintiffs reliance on justice kennedy concurrence in lee and the ninth circuit opinion in venetian is not persuasive in this case.the test for a public forum proposed by justice kennedy asks if the objective,physical characteristics of the property at issue and the actual public access and uses that have been permitted by the government indicate that expressive activity would be appropriate and compatible with those uses,then the property is a public forum.lee,at.kennedy,concurring.in this case,because of the signs posted at all entrances to the plaza and its differentiation from the surrounding sidewalks,the objective,physical characteristics demonstrate that the plaza is privately owned.further,although the easement required the government to allow expressive activity,the plaza is no longer owned or controlled by the government.id.at.
plaintiffs urge us to look at the history,function,and purpose of the plaza and conclude that the plaza is a public forum in accordance with the principles employed in first unitarian church.we did not go so far in first unitarian church.there,we concluded that the easement,not the surrounding plaza property,was a public forum and our holding was so limited.first unitarian church,at.any doubt about the limitation of our holding is belied by our extensive prior discussion concluding that an easement allowing the government rights to the property subjects it to forum analysis.id.at.absent the easement,we have no reason to doubt that p roviding for a religious park is now the purpose of the entire property held in private ownership.id.at.the city simply does not own the plaza,having sold it in the first instance for over million.it relinquished its legally significant remaining ownership interest,namely the easement,for consideration valued at million.
third,plaintiffs argue that the city retained right of reentry,requiring that the plaza be maintained as a landscaped space,is sufficient to render the plaza a public forum.clearly,e ither government ownership or regulation is sufficient for a first amendment forum of some kind to exist.id.at.however,unlike the case with an easement,our precedent dictates that a similar future interest,the possibility of reverter,is not a present estate.woodville,united states,cir a possibility or right of reverter does not constitute an actual estate all the estate rests in the first grantee,notwithstanding the qualifications annexed to it.internal quotations and citations omitted mount olivet cemetery ass salt lake city,cir possibility of reverter owned by the united states was minimal and speculative and insufficient to constitute property owned by the united states for purposes of preempting state authority.moreover,because such future interests are not entitled to compensation under the fifth amendment,woodville,at see also restatement first of property,the right of reentry is not a constitutionally cognizable property interest.see first unitarian church,at.thus,the city right of reentry is insufficient to render the plaza a public forum.
plaintiffs also argue that the right of reverter is a property interest substantial enough to support their claims,citing hampton city of jacksonville,cir,united states mississippi,cir,and eaton grubbs,cir.in each of these cases,courts found state action where the government owned a reversionary interest in a segregated,privately operated golf course,school or hospital.we think that those cases are readily distinguishable.in hampton and eaton,the governmental entity was inextricably intertwined with the ongoing operations of the private entity,and the property served the same primary function as before.in united states mississippi,the local governmental entity leased an unused school facility to a civic association which in turn leased it to a private segregated school.the court determined that the arrangement resulted in the establishment and continuation of a segregated school using state resources,in obvious contravention of a directive to the local governmental entity to desegregate.united states mississippi,at.
as noted,the property in this case serves a very different primary function than when under city ownership,and the right of reverter does not require that the plaza be used only for a particular purpose,grant the public a right of access,give the city the right to control expressive activities on the plaza,or prohibit the lds church from erecting fences or closing the plaza altogether.the right of reverter merely acts to preserve the property as a landscaped space,maintain the view corridor,and allow for public utility easements.to the extent that these subsidiary functions are encouraged,the city is not inextricably intertwined with the ongoing operations of the lds church or the plaza.
finally,plaintiffs argue that cases from our sister circuits,which have found sidewalks to be public fora because they so closely resembled ordinary public sidewalks,dictate that we find the plaza to be a public forum.we disagree.in venetian,the ninth circuit was faced with the issue of whether a sidewalk constructed on private property to replace a public sidewalk,accommodating pedestrian traffic adjacent to las vegas boulevard,is a public forum subject to the protection of the first amendment.at.in that case,the court noted that the function of the sidewalk in question was the same as those on either side of the property,the purpose was the same as any other sidewalk,there was a recorded servitude on the property requiring the venetian to dedicate it to public use,and the sidewalk was indistinguishable from adjoining sidewalks.id.at.
our consideration of these factors militates a decision in favor of defendants.first,the function of the plaza,at least when the church chooses to leave it open to the public and pedestrians use it as a shortcut to other downtown destinations,is similar to that of any other sidewalk or designated pedestrian thoroughfare.thus,although the plaza might at other times have different functions,if left open to and used by the public,it still performs the same role as a thoroughfare for pedestrian traffic.venetian,at.however,the similarities between venetian and the instant case begin and end there.
the asserted purpose of the plaza,unlike that of a normal sidewalk or other public forum,is to act as an ecclesiastical park.next,unlike the sidewalk in venetian,there is no recorded servitude requiring that the church allow public access.rather,the deed conveying the servitude,as referenced in plaintiffs complaint and relied upon by the district court,specifically states that the church is in no way required to allow public access to the plaza.utah gospel mission,d at see also venetian,at while the mall owners in lloyd and hudgens were free to barricade their walkways,or close their malls outright,without giving patrons any legal ground to complain,the venetian is not.finally,the plaza absent an easement is not seamlessly connected to public sidewalks.venetian,at see also united states grace,d there is no separation,no fence,and no indication whatever to persons stepping from the street to the curb and sidewalk that they have entered some special type of enclave.instead,the plaza is landscaped,the walking surface is different from that of the city sidewalks,and waterfalls,planters,and stone signs announce to entrants that the plaza is the property of the lds church.utah gospel mission,d at.although the function of the plaza is the same as any public thoroughfare,every other factor considered by the venetian court requires a result in favor of defendants.
plaintiffs also argue that united church of christ gateway economic development,cir,is controlling.in that case,the sixth circuit considered whether the common areas and sidewalks surrounding gateway park in cleveland are public fora in spite of the fact that the stadium is privately owned.the court noted that the sidewalk encircling the complex looks and feels like a typical public sidewalk and blends into the urban grid.id.at.second,the court found that the sidewalk was a public thoroughfare,which contributes to the city downtown transportation grid and is open to the public for general pedestrian passage.id.on these facts,the court found that the sidewalks surrounding the stadium were public fora.
united church of christ also weighs in favor of defendants.first,the plaza does not look like a typical public sidewalk,since it is composed of a different material and is clearly marked as private property owned by the lds church.second,although the plaza contributes to the downtown transportation grid by facilitating pedestrian passage,the easement deed and sale agreement specifically stated that the plaza need not be held open to the general public and the lds church could restrict entry.thus,both of the factors considered by the sixth circuit weigh against finding that the plaza is a public forum.because plaintiffs have failed to show either that the church is a state actor or that the plaza constitutes a public forum under the first amendment,the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs claims.
failure to state an establishment clause claim 
the traditional standard used for analysis of establishment clause claims was developed in lemon kurtzman.under lemon,the given municipal action must have a secular legislative purpose second,the action principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion and,finally,the action must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.no consideration of the second or third criterion is necessary if a statute does not have a clearly secular purpose.wallace jaffree,d.thus,to succeed,plaintiffs must allege facts which suggest a violation of any part of the analysis.bauchman high,cir.although this analysis has come under vigorous attack by justices and commentators alike,see id.at listing cases and articles,lemon has not been overruled and thus remains the starting point for our establishment clause analysis.summum,at citation omitted see also lamb chapel ctr.moriches union free sch,d reiterating that lemon has not been overruled.
secular purpose 
the first amendment requires that a governmental action be invalidated if it is entirely motivated by a purpose to advance religion.wallace,at.in making this determination,it is appropriate to ask whether the government actual purpose is to endorse or disapprove of religion.lynch donnelly,d.the court has invalidated legislation or governmental action on the ground that a secular purpose was lacking,but only when it has concluded there was no question that the statute or activity was motivated wholly by religious considerations.id.at.
when the government professes a secular purpose for an arguably religious policy,the government characterization is entitled to some deference.santa fe indep.sch.dist.doe,d.it remains our duty,though,to distinguis h a sham secular purpose from a sincere one.id.quoting wallace,at,concurring.however,we are reluctan t to attribute unconstitutional motives to the states,particularly when a plausible secular purpose for the state program may be discerned from the face of the statute.mueller allen,d see also bowen kendrick,d legitimate secular purpose behind a program created to eliminate or reduce social and economic problems caused by teenage pregnancy and parenthood lynch,at.legitimate secular purpose behind the annual display of a nativity scene in place to celebrate the secular aspects of christmas mcgowan maryland,d legitimate secular purpose behind sunday blue laws in place to improve public health,morals,and safety.
secular purposes exist for the sale of the easement.first,the city was well compensated,receiving million in exchange for an easement valued at.second,the city was able to extricate itself from perceived entanglement with the church and thereby reduce public outcry by eliminating joint ownership of the plaza.similarly,the city could reasonably conclude that if it were left with the responsibility of regulating protected expressive activities on the plaza,this responsibility would likely result in litigation.utah gospel mission,d at reiterating city reasons for selling the easement.finally,in first unitarian church,this court specifically stated that i f it wants an easement,the city must permit speech on the easement.otherwise,it must relinquish the easement so the parcel becomes entirely
