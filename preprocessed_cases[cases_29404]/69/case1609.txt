this is the third time this case has been before us.in the first appeal,we affirmed the district court entry of a preliminary injunction in favor of the plaintiff,monsanto company,and against the defendant,homan mcfarling.monsanto mcfarling,mcfarling i.in the second appeal,we upheld the district court rulings holding mcfarling liable for breach of contract and rejecting mcfarling counterclaims and affirmative defenses.we reversed the judgment in that case,however,holding that the liquidated damages provision in the parties contract was an unenforceable penalty,and we remanded for a determination of monsanto actual damages.monsanto mcfarling,mcfarling ii.after a damages trial,the district court entered an award of damages for patent infringement,rejected mcfarling arguments for vacating the judgment of liability,and refused monsanto request to modify the permanent injunction.we affirm on both mcfarling appeal and monsanto.
monsanto developed a system for weed control that employs genetically modified crops that resist glyphosphate herbicide.upon planting such crops,farmers can spray glyphosphate herbicide over their fields to kill weeds while sparing the resistant crops,a technique that allows for much more efficient weed control than is possible with unmodified plants.monsanto sells the glyphosphate herbicide under the trade name roundup and sells seeds of the genetically modified crops,in this case soybeans,under the trade name roundup ready.
two patents of importance here protect aspects of monsanto roundup ready technology.first,monsanto patent the patent claims a plant cell containing a dna molecule that encodes a genetically modified enzyme.that enzyme allows plants to survive exposure to glyphosphate herbicide.second,monsanto patent the patent claims a plant cell containing a genetic promoter sequence that facilitates a plant production of the modified enzyme.although the patent does not explicitly claim a seed containing a specific genetic sequence,as does the patent,the parties do not dispute that roundup ready soybeans contain the plant cells and the promoter sequences claimed in the patent.
monsanto distributed the patented seeds by authorizing various companies to produce the seeds and sell them to farmers.monsanto required those seed companies to obtain a signed technology agreement from purchasers.the technology agreement licensed the and patents to farmers on several conditions and required that farmers promise not to violate those conditions.of relevance here,farmers promised not to replant seeds that were produced from the purchased seeds or to supply those seeds to others for replanting.those promises ensure that a farmer who uses roundup ready seeds buys the seeds that he plants each year.
the purchasers also paid a fee to monsanto for the license.for the time periods relevant here,monsanto charged a license fee of per bag of roundup ready soybean seed.mcfarling also would have had to pay a seed company between and for each bag of the seed that he purchased.
in,mcfarling purchased roundup ready soybean seeds from a seed company.he signed the technology agreement for that year and paid the required fees.in violation of the license agreement,however,he saved seeds from his soybean crop and planted those seeds in.he did the same thing the next year,saving soybeans from his crop and planting them in.the saved seeds contained the patented genetic traits,but mcfarling did not pay the license fee for the or growing seasons.
upon learning of mcfarling conduct,monsanto sued him in the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri,asserting that he had breached the technology agreement and infringed the and patents.the district court granted monsanto motion for a preliminary injunction prohibiting mcfarling from continuing to plant saved roundup ready soybeans,and we affirmed that decision on appeal.mcfarling i,at.
monsanto then moved in the district court for summary judgment on some but not all of the pending,the breach of contract claim,the claim of infringement of the patent,and all of mcfarling counterclaims.monsanto did not move for summary judgment on its patent claim.in response,mcfarling raised various defenses,including patent misuse and preemption by the plant variety protection act.the district court rejected those defenses and granted monsanto motion in full except as it concerned damages for breach of contract and infringement of the patent.with liability resolved,the parties stipulated to the amount of liquidated damages under the license agreement,and the district court entered judgment on monsanto breach of contract claim and on mcfarling counterclaims.the court then entered an order under federal rule of civil procedure b allowing an immediate appeal on the decided claims.
on appeal,we affirmed the dismissal of mcfarling antitrust counterclaim and the rejection of his defenses of patent misuse and preemption by the plant variety protection act.however,we vacated the liquidated damages award as an unenforceable penalty and remanded for further proceedings.mcfarling ii,at.
after our decision in the second appeal,monsanto withdrew all of its claims other than the patent claim,on which it had already secured a liability ruling it then proceeded to try the issue of damages to a jury on that claim alone.during the trial on damages,mcfarling moved for judgment as a matter of law based on his patent misuse defense,contending that the patent misuse defense was given new life by monsanto withdrawal of one of its two claims for patent infringement.the district court denied that motion.
during the damages trial,mcfarling also moved for a directed verdict that an established royalty for his infringing conduct limited the size of a damages award.the district court denied the motion and submitted the issue of damages to the jury.
the jury returned a damages verdict of per bag of saved seed,well in excess of the per bag for which mcfarling had argued,but substantially less than the per bag for and per bag for urged by monsanto based on the analysis of its expert.mcfarling again moved to limit the damages award to what he contended was monsanto per bag established royalty for use of its patented technology.the district court denied the motion,adopted the jury verdict,and awarded monsanto approximately in damages.the district court also permanently enjoined mcfarling from future unauthorized use of the patented technology.
on appeal,mcfarling first argues that monsanto withdrawal of its claim for infringement of the patent undermines the rationale of our decision in mcfarling ii and requires that we revisit our rejection of his defenses and counterclaims.we disagree.
in mcfarling ii,we addressed mcfarling argument that monsanto license terms impermissibly restricted the use of roundup ready soybean seeds.we rejected that defense because the licensed and patented product the first generation seeds and the good made by the licensed product the seeds are nearly identical copies.thus,given that the patent reads on the seeds,it also reads on the seeds.at.accordingly,we held that there was no patent misuse,because the prohibition against use of seeds was simply a prohibition against unlicensed use of the patented invention.
mcfarling now seizes upon our reference to the patent to argue that our rejection of his patent misuse defense was undermined by monsanto withdrawal of its claim for infringement of the patent.our reasoning in mcfarling ii,however,is equally applicable to the patent.although that patent does not explicitly claim seed containing a roundup ready genetic trait,it claims plant cells having that genetic trait,and roundup ready soybeans undisputedly contain such cells.thus,as in the case of the patent,monsanto patent reads on both purchased and roundup ready soybeans.there is no patent misuse in the license terms for either patent.
mcfarling asserts that the unpatented germ plasm and second generation of soybeans is not a invention.but the fact that the germ plasm and the soybeans are not is irrelevant to infringement.what is are the chimeric genes claimed in the patent,which are found in all of the i
