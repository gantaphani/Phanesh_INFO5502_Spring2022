phelps roper is a member of the westboro baptist church wbc in topeka,kansas.phelps alleges members of her church believe god is punishing america for what wbc considers the sin of homosexuality by killing americans,including soldiers.as part of her religious duties,she believes she must protest and picket at certain funerals,including the funerals of united states soldiers,to publish the church religious message that god promise of love and heaven for those who obey him in this life is counterbalanced by god wrath and hell for those who do not.phelps believes funerals are the only place where her religious message can be delivered in a timely and relevant manner 
on august,phelps roper and other wbc members held a picket and protest near the location of the funeral of army edward lee myers in joseph,missouri.in direct response to the protest,missouri enacted section,which criminalizes picketing in front or about a funeral location or procession,and section,which criminalizes picketing within feet of a funeral location or procession,in the event section is declared unconstitutional.section states,in pertinent part 
this section shall be known as edward lee myers law.
it shall be unlawful for any person to engage in picketing or other protest activities in front of or about any location at which a funeral is held,within one hour prior to the commencement of any funeral,and until one hour following the cessation of any funeral.each day on which a violation occurs shall constitute a separate offense.violation of this section is a class b misdemeanor,unless committed by a person who has previously pled guilty to or been found guilty of a violation of this section,in which case the violation is a class a misdemeanor.
for the purposes of this section,funeral means the ceremonies,processions and memorial services held in connection with the burial or cremation of the dead.

peaceful picketing is an expressive activity protected by the first amendment.olmer lincoln,cir.it is law that a loss of first amendment freedoms,for even minimal periods of time,unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.elrod burns,d plurality.if phelps roper can establish a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits of her first amendment claim,she will also have established irreparable harm as the result of the deprivation.see marcus iowa pub.television,cir kirkeby,at.likewise,the determination of where the public interest lies also is dependent on the determination of the likelihood of success on the merits of the first amendment challenge because it is always in the public interest to protect constitutional rights.connection distrib.reno,cir quotation omitted kirkeby,at citing frisby schultz,d.the balance of equities,too,generally favors the freedom of expression.in a first amendment case,therefore,the likelihood of success on the merits is often the determining factor in whether a preliminary injunction should issue.mcqueary stumbo,d,granting preliminary injunction to wbc precluding enforcement of kentucky statute imposing time,place and manner restrictions on gatherings near funerals citing connection distrib,at.
we begin with an assessment of the likelihood of success on the merits.in planned parenthood,at,this court clarified what is required to demonstrate a sufficient showing of likelihood of success on the merits.in general,courts should still apply the familiar fair chance of prevailing test where a preliminary injunction is sought to enjoin something other than government action based on presumptively reasoned democratic processes.id.where a party seeks to enjoin preliminarily the implementation of a duly enacted statute as is the case here district courts must make a threshold finding that a party is likely to prevail on the merits.id.emphasis added.the court reasoned that by this more rigorous standard for determining a likelihood of success on the merits in these cases,we hope to ensure that preliminary injunctions that thwart a state presumptively reasonable democratic processes are pronounced only after an appropriately deferential analysis.id.at.in such cases,it is only after finding a party is likely to prevail on the merits that a district court should weigh the other dataphase factors.id.at.
when analyzing the merits of phelps roper claim,the district court correctly concluded the statute speech restrictions are and subjected the statute to intermediate judicial scrutiny.see turner broad,fcc,d.we reject phelps roper contention that section is because it targets funeral picketing and was enacted for the purpose of silencing her speech in particular.the plain meaning of the text controls,and the legislature specific motivation for passing a law is not relevant,so long as the provision is neutral on its face.city of alameda books,d kennedy,concurring stating whether a statute is content neutral or content based is something that can be determined on the face of it hill colorado,d stating the contention that a statute is viewpoint based simply because its enactment was motivated by the conduct of the partisans on one side of a debate is without support and finding a statute despite being enacted to end harassment outside clinics by abortion opponents frisby,at.finding statute despite being enacted in response to antiabortion protesters.
section regulates traditional public fora.a traditional public forum is one traditionally used as a forum for expression,such as a public street or a sidewalk.boos barry,d olmer,at.while we recognize a cemetery is a nonpublic forum section restricts expressive activity not just within or on the premises of a cemetery or a church,but also on traditional public fora such as the adjacent public streets and sidewalks.the statute must therefore satisfy the
