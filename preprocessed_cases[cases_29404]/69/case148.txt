factual background 
we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.see wennik polygram group distribution,cir.happ was a director,chairman of the board of directors audit committee,and the acknowledged financial expert on the board of directors of galileo corporation galileo,formerly a sturbridge,massachusetts manufacturer of and products.
on april,happ participated by telephone in a galileo board of directors meeting.at that meeting,william hanley,the chief executive officer of galileo,provided information to the board about two areas of particular concern.one was that shipments had been impacted for the second quarter due to a jurisdictional dispute between the united states departments of commerce and state with respect to export of some products.hanley testified that t he impact was rather small for the second fiscal quarter,but he had discussed with the board the fact that if it continued,it could be substantial in the june quarter.hanley informed the board that galileo believed that the export issues would be resolved in the june quarter,but if they were,they would further impact shipments of those products.hanley also provided the board with information that imagyn,a galileo customer,was past due on of the it owed galileo.he indicated that imagyn had made some payments in the march quarter,and that galileo had assurances from both the cfo of imagyn and the ceo that galileo was going to be paid.hanley also noted that galileo was negotiating an exclusive marketing agreement with a company called ethicon.
by late june,galileo was having third quarter financial difficulties.hanley and gregory reidel,galileo chief financial officer,met on thursday,june,two business days before the end of the third fiscal quarter,to discuss these problems.during that meeting,they decided to seek happ advice.
hanley testified at trial that he left two voicemail messages for happ,one on thursday,june,and another on sunday,june.in the first voicemail message,hanley told happ that galileo was having some difficulties during the quarter and he would like happ advice on these issues,and he requested a meeting with happ the following monday or tuesday.the second voicemail message was a duplicate of the previous message,reiterating that galileo was having some difficulties and that hanley wanted to meet with him monday or tuesday.hanley rarely telephoned happ or requested a meeting with a director in his office.on monday,june,happ called hanley assistant to schedule a meeting with hanley.thereafter,on the same day,happ sold all of his shares of galileo stock,excluding stock options,for approximately,resulting in a profit of approximately.
the following morning,happ met with hanley and reidel to discuss galileo difficulties,including the company difficulties in obtaining export licenses,the potential uncollectibility of the imagyn receivables,and the fact that the ethicon agreement had not yet been consummated.at the end of the meeting,happ mentioned to hanley that he had sold his galileo stock the previous day.happ told hanley that he sold the stock because he needed money from the sale to pay some bills.
on july,galileo board met to discuss the financial results for the third quarter.on july,galileo issued a press release publicizing the difficulties from the third quarter and their impact on galileo financial performance.while galileo had forecast a net profit of for the quarter,it reported losses of million.the following day,galileo stock price dropped from to per share.soon thereafter,happ purchased shares of galileo stock.
ii.procedural background 
on october,the sec filed a complaint against happ alleging that he traded on material,nonpublic information when he sold shares of galileo stock on june,thereby avoiding losses of,in violation of section b of the securities exchange act of,b rule promulgated thereunder,and section a of the securities act of,a after extensive discovery,the case went to a jury trial on september.
the court denied happ motions for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the sec case and at the close of the evidence.on october,the jury returned a special verdict against happ.after entering final judgment on the verdict,the district court denied happ renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,for a new trial,as well as happ motion for a new trial based on allegedly improper remarks made by the sec counsel in its closing argument.the district court ordered happ to pay as disgorgement for loss avoided,in prejudgment interest,and an additional as a civil penalty.sec happ,d.happ appeals from the district court denial of his motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial,and from the portion of the judgment imposing disgorgement and the civil penalty as part of its final judgment,the court also imposed sanctions on the sec in the amount of for refusing to stipulate until the middle of the trial that the june call did not take place from hanley office to happ home.id.at.the sec from the sanctions.
iii.analysis 
motion for judgment as a matter of law 
we review de novo the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law,viewing the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.tapalian tusino,cir.we will reverse the district court only if the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the movant that a reasonable jury could not have reached a verdict against that party.santos sunrise,cir.
judicial estoppel 
happ argues that the judgment should be reversed because the district court refused to hold the sec to its original description of the material,nonpublic information happ allegedly received prior to selling his stock.happ says that the sec initially argued,in successfully opposing his motions to dismiss and for summary judgment,that the material,nonpublic information upon which he had acted was galileo serious difficulties adversely affecting its third quarter earnings.at trial,however,the sec proof was merely that happ received information from hanley that galileo was having some difficulties during the third quarter and that hanley would like happ advice on these issues.even if these difficulties were of a financial nature,the sec did not show,according to happ,that they specifically impacted third quarter earnings.
happ insists that this variance was so fundamental as to call for application of judicial estoppel.this court has stated that j udicial estoppel should be employed when a litigant is playing fast and loose with the courts,and when intentional is being used as a means of obtaining unfair advantage in a forum provided for suitors seeking justice.patriot cinemas,cinema,cir quoting scarano central of,cir.the proponent must show that the party to be estopped succeeded previously with a position directly inconsistent with the one it currently espouses.fleet bank gray in re bankvest capital,cir quoting lydon boston sand gravel,cir.
accepting that the sec successfully urged in pretrial proceedings that galileo was having serious difficulties affecting its third quarter earnings,the doctrine of judicial estoppel is nonetheless inapposite.the sec trial theory was not directly inconsistent with its earlier theory.whatever the distinction between difficulties affecting third quarter earnings and financial difficulties emerging during the third quarter,the distinction falls short of a direct inconsistency.compare,alternative.concepts,synopsys,cir holding that manufacturer was judicially estopped from claiming a breach of an oral contract where it successfully argued on a prior motion that its claim was not a breach of contract theory but rather a claim for failure to negotiate in good faith,and cadle schlictmann,conway,crowley hugo,cir holding that plaintiff was estopped from arguing it was the agent of a note owner where it had previously argued that it was the owner of the note,with united states shea,cir finding that government assertion at defendant detention hearing that he possessed an assault weapon was not inconsistent with later representations that a codefendant possessed and used the same assault weapon,given its pursuit of accomplice and principal theories of liability.happ points to no precedent imposing an estoppel in a comparable situation.we find no legal error in the district court failure to hold that the sec was estopped by inconsistency or from pursuing the theory it presented at trial.
the district court also declined to grant judgment as a matter of law for the sec failure to prove an element of its complaint,namely,that happ knew that galileo difficulties would adversely affect its third quarter earnings.in dismissing that theory,the court stated in its january,memorandum and order,it is elementary that a variance between allegations and proofs,in order to be fatal,must be substantial and material.quoting farris meyer schuman,cir.it concluded,and we agree,that the variance between the sec complaint and what it proved at trial was not substantial and material.
the amended complaint alleged that happ possessed material,nonpublic information that galileo was experiencing third quarter difficulties,which he knew,or was reckless in not knowing,would adversely impact galileo third quarter earnings.as more fully discussed below,the sec presented evidence at trial that happ was told by hanley at the end of galileo third fiscal quarter that we were having some difficulties during the quarter and he would like happ advice on these issues.because happ was the chair of the board audit committee and the financial expert on the board,and because he received a telephone call from hanley just a few days before the end of the third quarter requesting an immediate meeting,a rational jury could infer that happ was aware those difficulties in the third quarter would likely indeed,would almost certainly relate to financial issues,and might well impact third quarter earnings.hence,what the sec proved at trial was not substantially and materially different from what it alleged in its complaint 
sufficiency of evidence 
happ insists that hanley voicemail messages to him that galileo was having some difficulties during the quarter did not amount to material,nonpublic information.merely being told of corporate difficulties,happ says,is too generic and too true of all public companies to be material in and of itself.see ronconi larkin,cir much of any business consists of having problems and dealing with them a company could experience serious operational problems,substantial difficult ies,and difficult problems and still have increasing revenues.
a fact is deemed material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote.tsc,northway,d.t here must be a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.basic levinson,d expressly adopting the tsc industries standard for section b and rule violations.the supreme court has made clear,however,that the role of the materiality requirement is not to attribute to investors a simplicity but to filter out essentially useless information that a reasonable investor would not consider significant.id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.certain information may be so basic that any investor can be expected to understand its implications.see levitin painewebber,cir certain information is so basic that any investor could be expected to know it quoting zerman ball,cir.
here,happ was a financial expert and had closely followed the affairs of galileo.the jury could therefore find him capable of drawing reasonable inferences from hanley messages.banca cremi,brown sons,cir a sophisticated investor requires less information to call a mis representation into question than would an unsophisticated investor likewise,when material information is omitted,a sophisticated investor is more likely to know enough so that the omission still leaves him cognizant of the risk.citation omitted.
happ had participated in an earlier nonpublic meeting of the galileo board of directors on april.during that meeting,hanley told the board of two areas of potential financial concern the departments of state and commerce were holding up the shipping of certain of galileo products,a policy that hanley indicated could,unless resolved,have a substantial impact on the june quarter and galileo largest endoscope customer,imagyn,was past due on of the it owed galileo.hanley testified to calling happ two months later and leaving voicemail messages on june and that galileo was experiencing third quarter difficulties,that he desired happ advice on these issues,and that he wanted to meet with happ in his office the following monday or tuesday.there was evidence that a call from hanley to happ and an meeting between hanley and happ in hanley office were unusual occurrences.
happ argues in response that the only negative information about galileo he was shown to have possessed at the time he sold his stock were hanley vague statements of difficulties in his voicemail messages seeking to arrange a meeting.all other information he then possessed concerning galileo financial health was positive,he says.the positive information included the other matters discussed at the april board meeting and the contents of a may boston business journal bbj article about galileo.hanley had devoted most of the april board meeting to discussing positive developments and expectations he spent less than ten minutes discussing the unfavorable export restrictions and imagyn matters.the article in the bbj was not entirely favorable it mentioned the loss of the xerox business a year and a half before,a major blow to the company,that had precipitated losses during six consecutive fiscal quarters.but as hanley testified,the article as a whole paint ed a very positive picture of the current status of galileo in may of.based on this information,happ urges that,in late june,he believed galileo was performing well,and that his sale of stock on june could not reasonably be found to have been triggered by the vague information in the voicemail messages.
in the circumstances,however,we believe a rational jury could find that the information that galileo was experiencing difficulties,communicated by hanley to happ in voicemail messages near the end of the third quarter,constituted material,nonpublic information triggering his stock sale.happ knew from the april board meeting that galileo potentially faced certain financial problems in the third quarter.he also knew that a telephone call from hanley was unusual,and that a meeting between him and hanley at hanley office was likewise uncommon.happ was chair of the board audit committee he was regarded as the board financial expert.in this context,hanley statement that galileo was experiencing difficulties in the quarter,his expressed desire for happ advice,and his summonsing of happ to a meeting,could be found to imply that the difficulties were financial in nature and,quite possibly,urgent.why else would hanley wish to schedule,on,the unusual meeting with happ as happ would know,the third quarter would close within a few days.hence,we believe a reasonable jury could find that happ inferred from the voicemail messages that galileo faced significant financial problems affecting its third quarter,and that this information altered significantly the total mix of information available to a reasonable investor in his posture.see basic,at.
happ argues that his subjective inferences from the bits and pieces of information he received would not equate to knowing possession of material,nonpublic information.in support of this argument,happ cites sec sargent,cir.there,the sec charged sargent with insider trading for purchasing and selling stock of purolator while in possession of an alleged tip from defendant shepard,regarding purolator pending acquisition by another company.id.at.sargent asserted that he had acted on a hunch based on two pieces of information he had learned at a dinner with shepard,namely the statements by shepard that his partner aldrich was on the board of purolator,and that he knew of a company that was going to be acquired,but in which he could not invest because he was too close to the situation.id.at.on appeal,we stated 
t here could be no violation if sargent traded on a mere hunch arrived at by putting together the fact that aldrich was on the purolator board,which was public information,with the statement made by shepard that he knew of a company being pursued.to prevail on its claims,the commission must show that shepard communicated nonpublic information about purolator to sargent.
id.at alteration omitted.happ argues that the sec theory here is no better than the type of hunch that we rejected in sargent.happ neglects to indicate,however,that the sargent court concluded that a jury could reasonably infer from the evidence that sargent was operating on more than just a hunch and that he had received nonpublic information from shepard about purolator.id.at emphasis added.on that basis,we reversed the entry of a directed verdict for the defendants.id.similarly,here,after resolving all doubts and credibility issues in favor of the verdict,we find that a jury could reasonably infer from hanley testimony that happ operated on more than just a hunch,and had received material,nonpublic information just before he sold his stock.
happ suggests that there is insufficient evidence for the jury to have found that hanley actually called him and left him one or more voicemail messages requesting a meeting the following monday or tuesday to discuss the difficulties galileo was experiencing during its third fiscal quarter.the first such call hanley testified to was on june.hanley said that his best memory was that he telephoned happ from his office that day,requesting such a meeting about those difficulties.he said he remembered the call because he met with reidel the same day and because his office desk ledger for that date shows that he wrote down happ phone number.according to hanley,it was his usual practice to write down a phone number and then call the number.
hanley testimony to a june call from his office to happ was seriously contradicted,however,by at t billing records.these failed to show the making of any such call.the sec ultimately stipulated with happ as follows 
t he at t billing records for galileo corporation for june,do not reflect a call from galileo to happ home on june,or,for that matter on june,or.the call did not take place from hanley office on the of june or on the,the,or the.emphasis added.
having been stipulated,the emphasized language denying any call on the or earlier dates from hanley office was binding.see ppx,audiofidelity,cir under federal law,stipulations and admissions in the pleadings are generally binding on the parties and the court.jackson united states,cir it is a general rule of law that facts which are stipulated during the course of a trial are to be taken by the jury as conclusively proven.notwithstanding so,the district court expressed the opinion that the jury could rationally have credited hanley testimony to the limited extent of finding that hanley made the purported call on june but from some other location.hanley testified that,in june of,he had a phone in his car that he sometimes used when he was in the car and needed to return messages or make phone calls,although he never said he made the call in question from that phone.
while the stipulation and telephone records left hanley testimony of a june call in some doubt,there was solid evidence of a second,identical call prior to happ sale of the stock.hanley testified that,on june,he called happ again,this time from his home,and again left a voicemail message.hanley telephone records reflected such a call on that date.according to hanley,this voicemail was a duplicate of the june voicemail.hanley testified he again mentioned that galileo was experiencing some difficulties.happ himself acknowledged a telephone message from hanley requesting a meeting,although he testified that hanley said nothing about difficulties or troubles.hence,even omitting the earlier call on june,there was sufficient evidence of at least one call having been made prior to the time happ sold his stock during which,if the jury credited hanley,a voicemail message alluding to galileo difficulties was left for happ 
additionally,happ own testimony can be said to lend some support to the jury conclusion that he possessed and used material,nonpublic information.according to happ,he himself initiated contact with hanley on june,to get an update on what was going on within the company,because he was thinking about selling his stock.happ said that he called to see if there were any negative developments at galileo that might lead someone later to say that he had inside information when he sold his stock.hanley told him there were developments at galileo,but happ admitted he never asked hanley about the nature of the developments or whether they were positive or negative.happ said he assumed from hanley upbeat tone that they were positive.the jury could have reasonably concluded,however,that happ would have held onto his stock if he had interpreted hanley as saying the company was doing well.the jury could also have reasonably inferred that he sold his stock,just after hearing from hanley and just one day before their meeting to discuss difficulties at galileo,in an attempt to avoid being charged later with insider trading.although s uspicious trading by itself can not suffice to warrant an inference that a trader traded on the basis of material information,sec truong,d,there is sufficient evidence in addition to the timing of the sale for the jury to have found that happ possessed and used material,nonpublic information in deciding to sell when he did.
motion for new trial 
the denial of a motion for a new trial is reviewed for abuse of discretion.johnson spencer press of,cir.generally speaking,motions for a new trial are directed to the trial court discretion and th e remedy is sparingly used.dall coffin,cir quoting united states,cir.
happ argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for new trial,relying broadly upon three grounds the sec counsel misstatements in closing argument allegedly erroneous evidentiary rulings by the court and,alleged errors relating to the jury instructions.we address these matters in turn.
sec counsel misstatement of law in closing argument 
first,happ asserts that he is entitled to a new trial because counsel for the sec misstated the law during the sec closing argument.happ testified at trial that,inter alia,he sold his shares of galileo stock on june,because he had a profit in the stock.he testified he did not sell his galileo stock earlier because the securities laws prohibited the sale of stock by an insider until six months after the insider most recent purchase,and he had purchased some of his shares on december.the parties agree that the profit rule,section b of the securities exchange act,b,forbids an insider of a company to sell any shares of that company for profit within six months of the most recent purchase of any shares,regardless of whether the shares sold are the same shares as those purchased because happ most recent purchase of galileo stock occurred on december,the restrictions of the profit rule would have expired on june.
in closing argument,counsel for the sec attacked happ testimony as to why he sold his stock when he did 
now,why did he say he sold his stock he claims he sold his stock simply because he saw a profit in the stock,as if it were simply a coincidence that he saw a profit exactly at the same time that he was receiving these calls from hanley.if he had truly wanted a profit in the stock,he could have sold at even higher profit if he had sold in march,april,may,or anytime earlier than june of that year.
he now claims the reason that he did sell his stock earlier was because of the profit rule.however,this is a new story.this is something that he did tell sandra bailey of the sec when she called on the telephone.and,indeed,he admitted that with respect to half the shares,that at the expiration of that period in,the period was up and he was permitted to sell those shares.
while happ made no immediate objection to the sec argument,he later asked the court,following argument and before the jury began deliberations,for a curative instruction,citing the profit rule and counsel misstatement of law.the court denied the request.happ renewed his request after the jury submitted a question about the second to last question on the special verdict form concerning scienter.the court again denied the request.the next morning,happ requested a curative instruction for the third time,submitting a supporting memorandum.that same morning,the jury posed a question about the last question on the special verdict form concerning the interstate commerce element.
after further argument,the district court at last gave the jury the precise curative instruction that happ had earlier requested in writing.that instruction was as follows 
during closing arguments,in reference to happ,counsel for the sec made the following statement if he had truly wanted a profit in the stock,he could have sold at even higher profit if he had sold in march,april,may,or anytime earlier than june of that year.i am instructing you to disregard that statement in its entirety.under federal law,happ was not permitted to sell galileo stock for a profit for a period of six months after his most recent purchase of galileo stock.
approximately fifteen minutes after receiving the curative instruction and the answer to the final question on the special verdict form,the jury returned its special verdict in favor of the sec.happ moved for a mistrial,and the district judge denied the motion.happ,d at.on appeal,happ claims that the curative instruction came too late to undo the prejudice of the sec misstatement because it apparently came after the jury had already decided the questions of credibility and liability against happ.
absent an abuse of discretion,this court defers to a district court denial of a motion for a new trial based upon improper argument or conduct of counsel.aqueduct sewer auth.constructora lluch,cir.in assessing the effect of improper conduct by counsel,the court must examine the totality of the circumstances,including the nature of the comments,their frequency,their possible relevancy to the real issues before the jury,the manner in which the parties and the court treated the comments,the strength of the case,and the verdict itself.id.at this court will only reverse upon a showing of prejudice.santos,at.
the misstatement by the sec counsel was real and serious.counsel misleadingly proposed to the jury that happ might have sold his securities for a profit at a time when the law,in fact,disallowed such a sale.a representative of the sec,the agency charged with enforcement of the securities laws,is expected to know those laws and to refrain from either inadvertent or intentional misstatements regarding them.the court,however,rendered a curative instruction,albeit late in the day.moreover,happ counsel could have pointed out the error to the jury in the course of his own later closing argument,which he did not do.overall,we are not persuaded that happ was prejudiced by sec counsel closing remarks,though they were.
happ argues that the misstatement was especially heinous in light of the record before trial.at oral argument on happ motion for summary judgment,the sec had asserted that happ could have sold the shares he bought in june at any time six months thereafter.happ informed the court in his trial brief,served on counsel in advance of trial,that this assertion was based on an error of law,because he was prohibited,under the profit rule,from selling any galileo stock for six months after his purchase in december of.the sec does not now disagree with happ reading of the rule,but instead argues that counsel remarks were inadvertent and not intended to mislead the jury about the law,but rather simply to describe happ own understanding of the situation when he sold his shares.
we find little to commend in the sec excuses for its misconduct.even if the remarks were intentional,however,the district court curative instruction cures any error.the district court gave the instruction happ requested.to be sure,happ contends that he was prejudiced by the late timing of the instruction.the curative instruction was given after the jury began its deliberations and only in response to happ third request.the district court itself stated that the lateness of its response create d special problems.nevertheless,the instruction received special emphasis because it was in writing and was separate from the other jury instructions.we are not disposed to conclude that a jury will not follow a curative instruction.see refuse envtl,indus.servs.of,cir a basic premise of our jury system is that the jury follows the court instructions.happ contends that the fact the jury returned its verdict against happ only fifteen minutes after receiving the curative instruction indicates the jury mind was already made up.but a more likely explanation is that the jury simply thought the sec misstatement was not a material factor in reaching its verdict.
moreover,whether happ could permissibly have sold his stock earlier is a relatively small point in the overall case.the jury had before it a vast reservoir of evidence including happ testimony concerning his reasons to sell when he did.aspects of happ own testimony might well have seemed inconsistent and implausible to the jury.given the weight of the evidence,the district court could reasonably determine that the sec erroneously premised argument would not likely have affected the outcome of the trial.accordingly,we think it was within the court discretion to deny the motion for a new trial on this ground 
allegedly erroneous evidentiary rulings and jury instructions 
as a second basis for a new trial,happ asserts alleged evidentiary errors.evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion.united states marino,cir,cert.denied,d.
as a third basis,happ contends he is entitled to a new trial because of errors in the court jury instructions.we review jury instructions de novo.seahorse marine supplies,sun oil,cir.we reverse the giving of an instruction if it was misleading,unduly complicating,or incorrect as a matter of law,and adversely affected the objecting party substantial rights.sheek asia badger,cir.
admission of evidence of galileo insider trading policies 
happ argues the district court erred in admitting evidence of galileo insider trading policies and in instructing the jury that it must decide whether galileo had such a policy.he argues that such evidence is irrelevant,and,even if it were relevant,that there was no evidence happ knew about the policy.
no error in the admission of evidence is ground for granting a new trial unless refusal to take such action appears to the court inconsistent with substantial justice.ordinarily,the admission of evidence is not prejudicial if the facts have already been shown by admissible evidence,but it would be inconsistent with substantial justice if the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict without the erroneously admitted evidence.demars equitable life assurance soc y of united states,cir.
here,the evidence of galileo insider trading policy was arguably relevant to establish that happ had a duty of trust or confidence,which he violated,to refrain from using material,nonpublic information.see supra note quoting dirks sec,d chiarella united states,d.in this case,the further evidence was of questionable necessity,as the parties stipulated that happ was a galileo director,and the court instructed the jury that a director of a corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders.see id.happ testified that he knew of his fiduciary duty not to engage in trades of galileo stock while in possession of nonpublic information.given that happ duty to galileo shareholders was by the above,the court might possibly have excluded as cumulative the evidence of galileo own insider trading policies.however,we need not and do not decide whether the court decision to admit this evidence was error.at the very worst,assuming error,the error was harmless.see demars,at admission of cumulative evidence was harmless error by the same token,we see no adverse effect on happ substantial rights in the court instruction to the jury that it should find whether galileo had such a policy.see sheek,at.
ii.admission of evidence of correspondence with cai wireless 
happ also challenges the admission of two letters he wrote to counsel for cai wireless,a company for which he had been a director in early.the letters related to happ improper purchase of cai wireless stock during a period that he believed an approved trading window was open.as a result of happ purchase of cai wireless stock,he was asked to sell the stock,causing him to violate the profit rule and to disgorge his profits to the company.happ testified that he wrote to counsel for cai wireless in both letters that he would in the future confirm in advance with the company that a trading window was open before purchasing its stock.happ argues that the letters were irrelevant and constituted impermissible impeachment evidence under.b designed to show that,because happ knew that cai wireless had an insider trading policy when he was a cai wireless director,he should have known that galileo did.but the sec responds that this evidence was admissible under.b to show happ state of mind when he sold his galileo stock.we agree.
this circuit applies a test to determine whether evidence of extrinsic acts is admissible.united states frankhauser,cir.first,the evidence must be probative of an issue in the case,such as intent or knowledge,without including bad character or propensity in the inferential chain.b.second,its probative value must not be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury.see frankhauser,at.
here,evidence of the correspondence from happ to counsel for cai wireless was probative of happ state of mind when he sold his galileo stock.the government had the burden to prove that happ had the requisite scienter,which the supreme court has defined as a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.ernst ernst hochfelder,d.happ testified at trial that his purchase and sale of cai wireless stock made him more aware of insider trading policies.he also testified that he first learned of the profit rule during the incident with cai wireless,and that this incident was on his mind when he contemplated selling his galileo stock.due to the similarity of the violations alleged here and in the cai wireless episode,we think the letters were admissible to show happ understanding of what he could do under the securities laws and why he sold his galileo stock when he did.moreover,given happ awareness of insider trading policies and his expressed intent to seek prior clearance of future cai wireless trades,his failure to clear his sale of galileo stock in advance and his failure to inquire as to galileo insider trading policies were probative of his intent.we also think the court could reasonably determine that the probative value was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury.see.
iii.instruction concerning the federal securities laws and the sec 
happ argues that the district court erred in instructing the jury about the purposes of the federal securities laws and the sec role in enforcing them.he claims that the instruction invited the jury to find him liable without considering the elements of an insider trading claim,and that the instruction prejudiced him by presenting the sec in a very positive light.we find no error.although the district court gave the jury background on the sec and the statutes it enforces,it also gave detailed instructions concerning each element of an insider trading claim and instructed the jury not to favor the sec by virtue of its role as a government agency.we have no reason to believe that the jury did not follow these instructions.see indus.servs.of,at.accordingly,we find no error in the given instructions.
iv.instruction on scienter 
happ also contends that the district court improperly injected a negligence standard into its instruction on the scienter element.the court instructed the jury that an element of the section b claim was that the defendant engaged in an act,practice,or course of business that operated,or,by an ordinarily prudent person in his position at the time he acted,would be expected to operate as a fraud or deceit upon some person.this appears to be an attempt to restate one type of act which rule makes unlawful.see it shall be unlawful for any person c t o engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.although this instruction,standing alone,could be said to inject an incorrect negligence standard,the district court plainly instructed the jury that it must find intentional or knowing conduct in order to find the requisite scienter.the jury special finding that happ acted with intent and with knowledge further demonstrates that there was no prejudice.
monetary awards against the defendant 
disgorgement amount 
happ challenges the district court disgorgement order.he argues that the sum awarded was inappropriately based on the loss avoided,the difference between the value of his galileo stock when sold on june,and the value of the same number of shares on july,the day after galileo july press release.happ contends that the most he should be required to disgorge,if anything,is the profit on the sale of his galileo stock,the difference between his proceeds on june,and his cost basis for the shares.
the district court disgorgement order is reviewed for abuse of discretion.sec first jersey,cir.in an insider trading case,the proper amount of disgorgement is generally the difference between the value of the shares when the insider sold them while in possession of the material,nonpublic information,and their market value a reasonable time after public dissemination of the inside information.sec macdonald,cir see also sec patel,cir sec shapiro,cir.the amount of disgorgement need only be a reasonable approximation of profits causally connected to the violation.sec first city fin.the risk of uncertainty in calculating disgorgement should fall on the wrongdoer whose illegal conduct created that uncertainty.id.at patel,at see also macdonald,at doubts are to be resolved against the defrauding party.once the sec shows that the disgorgement is a reasonable approximation,the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that the amount of disgorgement is not a reasonable approximation.first city,at.
happ contends that the amount of disgorgement ordered was not causally connected to the violation because he did not know the information contained in the july press release when he sold his stock on june.the sec argues that the fact that happ did not possess the exact information in the july statement does not detract from the fact that he received information that galileo was having difficulties in the third quarter.
the disgorgement order in the amount of the loss avoided was not an abuse of the district court discretion.although the sec bears the ultimate burden of persuasion that a disgorgement figure is a reasonable approximation of the amount of unjust enrichment,the sec showing of the stock price drop after galileo publicly disclosed its third quarter difficulties on july presumptively satisfied that burden.the stock price drop occurred after the release of the july press release,which informed the public both that galileo had experienced difficulties during the third quarter and indicated the nature of some of those difficulties.among other things,the press release contained information about the imagyn receivable,the unsuccessful attempt to negotiate a marketing relationship with ethicon,decreased orders,continued difficulty in obtaining export licenses due to the jurisdictional dispute,a reorganization and a reduction in force that would lead to substantial fourth quarter charges,and a violation of galileo bank loan covenants.the loss in galileo profits was causally connected to those difficulties.although the information happ had earlier received did not disclose the actual nature of galileo difficulties,happ impropriety nonetheless consisted of selling his shares upon learning of the as yet unspecified difficulties.it is not unreasonable to hold happ accountable for the drop in value attributable to those same difficulties when fully revealed.
once the burden shifted to happ,he failed to show that the amount of loss avoided was not a reasonable approximation.happ failed to demonstrate,for example,any clear break in or considerable attenuation of the causal connection between the illegality and the ultimate profits.id.happ offers an alternative calculation,based on his actual profits,but offers no causal link between his cost basis and the losses he avoided through insider trading.as the wrongdoer,happ must bear the risk of uncertainty in calculating the amount of disgorgement.see patel,at.we find no error.
additional civil penalty 
the insider trading and securities fraud enforcement act itsfea authorizes courts to impose a penalty of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided as a result of the insider trading.a.itsfea civil penalties were enacted to enhance deterrence against insider trading,and where deterrence fails,to augment the current methods of detection and punishment of this behavior,at,reprinted in.we review an order imposing a civil penalty for abuse of discretion.sec sargent,cir.a court may consider several factors in evaluating whether or not to assess civil penalties,such as 
the egregiousness of the violations the isolated or repeated nature of the violations the defendant financial worth whether the defendant concealed his trading what other penalties arise as the result of the defendant conduct and whether the defendant is employed in the securities industry.
id.at.the district court found that factors,and favor happ while factors and favor the imposition of a civil penalty.happ,d at.the court found the factors decidedly mixed and exercised its discretion to impose a penalty equal to the loss avoided,or,in order to effectuate the congressional intent to punish those who violate securities law.id.happ does not appear to challenge the court findings as he raises no arguments concerning factors and.instead,he simply argues that a penalty was not appropriate here.we are satisfied that the court acted within its discretion to impose a civil penalty on happ,not only to punish him but to serve as a deterrent on insider trading generally.
sanctions against the sec 
during discovery,happ served requests for admission,which asked the sec,inter alia,to admit that hanley did not make a telephone call from galileo offices in sturbridge,massachusetts to happ residence in weston,massachusetts,telephone number,on june.on november,the sec denied the request based on hanley testimony that he made the call from his office.happ claimed that galileo at t billing records,which did not show a call on june,to happ,established that no call was made from hanley office to happ that day.in order to prove that the call did not take place from hanley office,happ deposed at t,deposed bell atlantic galileo other telephone service provider during june,deposed galileo facilities manager who was responsible for tracking telephone bills,and retained an expert concerning business telephone systems and telephone service provider facilities and records.on september,three weeks before trial,the parties stipulated to the authenticity and accuracy of the phone records,but not to their completeness.it was not until happ was about to call the first of two witnesses,including one expert witness,to establish that the telephone records were complete,that the sec agreed to stipulate that the telephone records did not reflect a call from galileo to happ on june,and that t he call did not take place from hanley office on the of june or on the,the,or the.
in its judgment,the district court imposed sanctions on the sec in the amount of for its refusal to stipulate until that the june call did not take place from hanley office to happ home.happ,d at.the court specifically rejected the sec contentions that,in declining to stipulate earlier,it had both reasonable grounds to believe it might prevail on the matter and that the admission sought by happ was of no substantial importance.see.c b and c,infra.while the sec now contends on appeal that the court was wrong on both counts and should have awarded no sanction,the sec does not now question the actual amount of the sanction,which was based on happ attorneys evidence of additional counsel fees and costs related to preparations to prove that the call in question was not made from hanley office.
c provides 
if a party fails to admit the truth of any matter as requested under rule,and if the party requesting the admissions thereafter proves the truth of the matter,the requesting party may apply to the court for an order requiring the other party to pay the reasonable expenses incurred in making that proof,including reasonable attorney fees.
the rule requires an award of expenses unless the court finds that 
a the request was held objectionable pursuant to rule a,or b the admission sought was of no substantial importance,or c the party failing to admit had reasonable ground to believe that the party might prevail on the matter,or d there was other good reason for the failure to admit.
c.we review for abuse of discretion an award of rule c sanctions.marchand mercy med,cir.we will not reverse a rule c award of sanctions unless we have a definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment.id.
in contending that the district court abused its discretion in awarding sanctions,the sec argues that hanley testimony gave it reasonable ground to believe it might prevail on the matter.c c.t he true test under rule c is not whether a party prevailed at trial but whether he acted reasonably in believing that he might prevail.advisory committee notes,amendment.here,the sec eventually stipulated that the call did not take place from hanley office on the or on earlier dates but argues that prior to that time it entertained reasonable doubts on the outcome of the issue.
whether the district court ruling was the right one is perhaps a close question,but we are not called on to engage in de novo review but only to say whether the court abused its discretion.see marchand,at.favoring the court ruling is the fact that hanley deposition testimony prior to trial concerning the june voicemail was somewhat equivocal.he testified in his deposition merely that he believe d he called happ from his office on june.later at trial,he testified only that his best memory was that he called happ from his office on june.he said he remembered making the call that day because he met with reidel that day and because his office desk ledger for that date contains happ name and phone number consistent with his habit of writing down a phone number and then calling the number.the telephone company records were,however,unequivocal in their failure to show a call from hanley office to happ phone number on june.there was nothing whatever to suggest the telephone records were less than accurate or were incomplete.by the government tossed in the sponge.the district court concluded that the government should have
