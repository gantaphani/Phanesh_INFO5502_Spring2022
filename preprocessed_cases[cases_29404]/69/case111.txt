this decision addresses the doctrine of laches in claims for wages by seamen under,where the claims are meant both to compensate and to encourage compliance with the requirement in that the seamen be given written agreements.
from to,the plaintiffs,timothy doyle,greg hagaman,brian lague,anthony richards,and eric edwards,worked as fishermen on a number of trips aboard the vessels persistence and relentless,owned by defendants huntress,and relentless,respectively.the vessels are the only fishing boats operating out of the port at davisville,rhode island.in,the seamen brought suit against the vessel owners in federal district court,alleging that because the defendants had never put in writing their compensation arrangements with the fishermen,the defendants violated.that statute requires owners of certain fishing vessels to enter into written fishing agreements with each seaman employed aboard the vessel prior to the voyage.the seamen claimed relief under,which allows seamen to recover wages for employment under conditions contrary to federal law.
the district court granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs,finding that the defendants had violated and concluding that the plaintiffs had a cause of action under.doyle huntress,doyle i,d.the district court also found,however,that trial was necessary to resolve genuine issues of material fact as to the defendants defenses of laches and waiver.id.at.
before trial,the defendants filed an interlocutory appeal with this court challenging the district court grant of partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs.we affirmed the district court in doyle huntress,doyle ii,cir.the district court then held a bench trial to resolve the issues of laches and waiver.doyle huntress,doyle iii,d.it awarded three of the seamen,and,plus interest two received nothing.id.at.additional facts are to be found in the three earlier published decisions.
in doyle ii,we held that a cause of action is created for seamen under.at.that statute provides that a seaman engaged contrary to a law of the united states may leave the service of the vessel at any time and is entitled to receive the higher of two amounts the highest rate of wages at the port from which the seaman was engaged or the amount agreed to be given the seaman at the time of engagement.
the entitlement to this statutory remedy under is dependent on a showing that the employment was contrary to a law of the united states.it is now undisputed that the seamen plaintiffs were engaged to work on voyages from to through lay share contracts which did not comply with the requirements of.that statute requires written fishing agreements signed by each seaman prior to the voyage that specify the terms of each seaman compensation arrangement,including the amount of the seaman anticipated share in the proceeds of the catch.doyle i,d at the defendants used various types of fishing agreements with plaintiffs oral agreements,form agreements that described the lay share compensation scheme but not the exact share,form agreements that left the share terms blank,and crew roster sheets with disclaimer language.id.the district court found none of these agreements satisfy the requirements of.id.
to be clear,the seamen were all paid for their services.they were paid according to the lay share system,under which each fisherman received some share of the net profits of each voyage,with the exact share determined by the captain based on the fisherman skill,experience,and performance on the voyage this court noted that in this instance,where the fishermen have already received a lay share portion of the proceeds from the fishing voyages,there does not appear to be any other real remedy for the vessel owners failure to comply with,absent.doyle ii,at.
the case then returned to the district court for the determination of an appropriate remedy for the violation.the vessel owners had asserted a laches defense,which the court found meritorious as to all claims for wages before august,three years before the filing of the complaint.doyle iii,d at.as a result,only three of the five plaintiffs received any damages.id.at.
each side has appealed.
laches in admiralty cases 
this case,concerning seamen wages,was brought within the admiralty jurisdiction of the federal courts.doyle ii,at.the statutes on which relief is sought,and,do not contain a statute of limitations.
in an admiralty case,maritime law and the equitable doctrine of laches govern the time to sue,pan am.grain,cir.the use of laches is governed by an initial determination,on which the court relies to establish both burdens of proof and presumptions of untimeliness.id.the initial determination requires the district court to choose the most analogous statutory limitation period.this may be located either in federal law or in state law.id.at.
once the most analogous statutory limitation period is determined,claims filed outside that period are subject to a presumption of laches and the plaintiff bears the burden of showing these claims are not barred.id.at.as to claims filed within the analogous statutory limitation period,the burden of showing laches falls on the defendant.id.at.
the substantive content of the laches doctrine requires focus on whether the plaintiff delay in bringing suit was unreasonable and whether that delay caused prejudice to defendant.id.at.in the end,laches is an equitable doctrine,within the sound discretion of the district court.puerto ins.benjamin shipping,cir quoting azalea fleet dreyfus supply mach,cir.
the district court correctly recited this framework of analysis.doyle iii,d at.here,the delay in filing the complaint was from to,an period.
choice of analogous limitation period 
the initial determination of the most analogous statute of limitations is an issue of law,which we review de novo.see telink,united states,cir union carbide state bd.of tax comm rs,cir.each side has appealed from the district court choice of the limitation period for unpaid wage claims in rhode island law.laws.the seamen argue that they should get the benefit of the general limitation period for civil actions in rhode island general laws section a.
the vessel owners argue that state law is the wrong source and that federal law is more appropriate,because the use of federal law serves the interests of national uniformity.the federal law which is most analogous,they argue,is the statute of limitations in the fair labor standards act flsa.see a.
we think the district court got it exactly right.
the more serious of the two arguments is that federal law should apply,in the form of the flsa statute of limitations.some district courts have applied this federal limitation period to similar claims.see,brown royal caribbean cruises,wl,at.while using a uniform federal standard has some attraction,we think the flsa can not be used as most analogous to claims under,and no other federal statute has been suggested.
first,the flsa expressly excludes from its coverage claims of maritime fishermen.a excluding from wage and hour requirements any employee employed in the catching or taking of any kind of fish,shellfish,or other aquatic forms of animal and vegetable life see also do ocean peace,cir.there is no reason to think congress wanted this exclusion to apply to everything except flsa limitation period.when congress recodified in,see doyle ii,at,it could easily have chosen to include a limitation period or to refer to another federal statute,but did not.
further,the general admiralty rule of applying laches to untimely claims,against which congress legislated,frequently chose state law as an analogous limitation period.see,larios victory carriers,cir friendly,recognizing the relevance of the analogous state statute of limitations in laches analysis see also,sandvik.packers ass n,cir in applying the doctrine of laches,weight is generally given to the statute of limitations that would apply to a comparable action filed in state court in the state in which the cause of action arose.uisdean vass xia chen,the admiralty doctrine of laches,recognizing the state law statute of limitations as a good rule of thumb to determine the analogous prescriptive per
