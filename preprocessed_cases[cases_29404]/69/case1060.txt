american airlines american appeals from the judgment entered on the jury verdict in favor of stephanie,lauren,and emily manus collectively,the manuses in their action for damages resulting from the crash of american flight in little rock,arkansas,on june,american did not contest its liability for compensatory damages,leaving only the amount to be determined by the jury.after a trial,the jury awarded stephanie for her pain and suffering and lost earning capacity and to lauren and emily for their respective medical costs and to lauren and to emily for their respective pain and suffering.following the entry of the verdict,the district court denied american renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law,its motion for a new trial,and its alternative motion for remittitur.we affirm.
the manuses boarded flight from dallas,texas,to little rock,arkansas,as the second and final leg of their return home after visiting family in phoenix,arizona.they were seated in row,two rows behind an emergency exit row.at the time of the crash,lauren was four and emily was two.the flight was delayed at least twice and did not approach little rock until almost midnight on june.the plane touched down in a raging thunderstorm.instead of decelerating in a normal fashion,the plane ran off the runway and came to a stop only after striking an electrical stanchion and breaking into three pieces.the body of the plane split open between rows eighteen and nineteen,and the left wing was completely detached from the body of the airplane.jet fuel from the detached wing spilled into the fuselage and caught on fire.
after the plane came to a stop,stephanie released her and the girls seat belts,picked up emily,grasped lauren hand,and looked out into the aisle.seeing fire coming from the rear,she moved out into the aisle and began to make her way forward toward the exit row located at row.because the aisle was littered with debris,she immediately encountered problems keeping hold of lauren.passenger arnold bowden testified that as he was trying to navigate the aisle he came across a small child trying to crawl through the debris.he picked the child up,carried her to the emergency exit over the right wing,and handed her through the window to another passenger,charles fuller,who was outside on the wing assisting passengers as they exited the aircraft.fuller immediately passed the child off to another passenger,who took the girl away from the plane.fuller testified that he heard a passenger calling out repeatedly,save my babies.
meanwhile,stephanie encountered an elderly man who had fallen in the aisle and who was calling for help.although desirous of helping the fallen passenger,who reminded her of her grandfather,stephanie,whose arms were wrapped around emily,was unable to pause to do so.guided by the light from the burning fuel,stephanie continued down the aisle until she reached the emergency exit,where she and emily were able to escape from the aircraft.stephanie walked down the length of the wing searching for a place that was close to the ground.she then sat down on the wing and slid off onto the ground.after reaching the ground,she sought out and found lauren,who was with the passenger who had taken her from fuller.she and the girls moved away from the plane and waited for rescue workers to arrive.stephanie then borrowed a cell phone from a passenger and called her husband to let him know that they were still alive.
stephanie testified that her experiences outside the aircraft were just as harrowing as those inside.the thunderstorm continued to rage,leaving stephanie and her daughters soaked by the rain,exposed to the thunder and lightning,and pelted by larger than hail.as the three moved away from the plane,stephanie experienced pain in her left knee and lower back.both lauren and emily were crying,and repeatedly asked where their father was.while she and her daughters waited,stephanie heard screams coming from inside the airplane and witnessed severely burned passengers who had escaped the wreckage.with renewed fears that the airplane might explode,stephanie led her daughters even farther from the wreckage,walking through a swampy area to do so.
eventually the manuses were transported to the airport fire station.from there,still clad in their wet clothes,they were taken to a theater that was used as a triage site from which passengers were transported to area hospitals.stephanie knee and back pain became so severe that she was transported to a hospital by ambulance.she was treated and released,and the family returned home at daybreak.
following the crash,stephanie,lauren,and emily were diagnosed as suffering from stress disorder ptsd.in addition,stephanie has been diagnosed as suffering from major depression.her symptoms include nightmares,flashbacks,insomnia,bouts of crying,and episodes in which she has locked herself in the bedroom or bathroom.she continues to see joan hemingway,a psychotherapist,for counseling and charles lewis,a psychiatrist,for periodic review and medication.stephanie has been prescribed numerous medications for her symptoms,and at the time of trial she was taking zoloft,an antidepressant.
stephanie physical injuries included an injury to her knee that required arthroscopic surgery.her treating physician testified that this injury resulted in a permanent impairment resulting in weakness,swelling,limited range of motion,and pain.he also testified that the impairment would make it difficult for stephanie to squat or kneel.at the time of trial,stephanie continued to take a prescription drug to relieve the pain in her knee.
lauren and emily share some common symptoms,such as nightmares and fear of planes and thunderstorms.additionally,lauren has exhibited extended grief over the loss of a doll she brought with her on the plane and adverse reactions to school fire drills and fire safety instruction,while emily went through a period during which she rejected her father and subjected the family cat to abuse.at the time of trial,both girls were receiving weekly therapy from a psychological examiner.
american appeals the district court denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law,arguing that the evidence of stephanie lost earning capacity was insufficient to create a jury question.we review a district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo,employing the same standard as the district court.belk city of eldon,cir.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate only when all of the evidence points one way and is susceptible of no reasonable inference sustaining the position of the nonmoving party.id.at internal quotes and citations omitted.we view the facts in the light most favorable to the.id.at.
arkansas law recognizes that where an injury is permanent,proof of specific pecuniary loss is not indispensable to recovery.coleman cathey,see also gipson garrison.
damage resulting from loss of earning capacity is the loss of the ability to earn in the future.the impairment of the capacity to earn is the gravamen of the element.proof of this element does not,however,require the same specificity or detail as does proof of loss of future wages.the reason is that the jury can observe the appearance of the plaintiff,his age,and the nature of the injuries that will impair his capacity to earn.a serious or permanent injury may sustain the submission of the issue of loss of earning capacity to the jury thus,the relevant inquiry is whether there was some evidence of the plaintiff loss of earning capacity.
