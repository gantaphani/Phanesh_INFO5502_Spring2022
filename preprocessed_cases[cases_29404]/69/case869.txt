severn trent services appeals from the grant to the eeoc of an injunction against severn enforcing or threatening or attempting to enforce any provision of any contract which prohibits or purports to prohibit kevin murphy from participating in the eeoc investigation and processing of a charge filed with the commission by a former employee of severn named petolick,or from providing any information,testimony,and documents to eeoc in connection with the investigation.
murphy had sold his business,which was called and employed petolick,to pitometer associates.in connection with the sale,he had signed a consulting agreement with pitometer that contained a nondisparagement clause forbidding him directly or indirectly,in public or private,to deprecate,impugn or otherwise make any remarks that would tend to or could be reasonably construed to tend to defame pitometer or its affiliates,officers,or employees.
such private gag orders appear to be fairly common.wayne outten,negotiations,adr,and agreements an employee lawyer perspective,see,patlovich rudd,illinois law eichelkraut camp.naturally an employer does want to be by a disgruntled employee who may be privy to the employer dark in a case such as this in which a person sells his firm and may intend to reenter the business and seek a competitive advantage by disparaging the firm buyer.john hines,michael cramer peter berk,anonymity,immunity online defamation managing corporate exposures to reputation injury,sedona conf,laurence reece iii,valuation and settlement of business disputes,in winning through settlement valuation and settlement of business disputes paul garrity,massachusetts continuing legal education.the nondisparagement clause in the consulting agreement may thus have been a substitute for a noncompete clause,which would be unenforceable if its duration were unreasonable,as it might be under illinois law which governs disputes arising under the agreement if it exceeded two or three years,and almost certainly if it exceeded five.compare midwest television,oloffson,d,and basins,d,with eichmann national hospital health care services,d,and hamer holding group,elmore,d.although the term of the consulting agreement itself was only three years,the nondisparagement clause is by its terms perpetual,which appears to be common,see,patlovich rudd,supra.at,and,so far as we are aware,unexceptionable.a related provision of the agreement forbids murphy to solicit or hire any employees of pitometer or its affiliates for two years after his consultantship terminates.
the defendant,however,is severn,not pitometer.pitometer is not a party to this lawsuit.when and how did severn come into the picture we know that murphy was working for severn by september of at the latest,for it was then that the eeoc subpoenaed him to testify concerning petolick charge,and the subpoena designates him as an executive of severn.also according to the charge,was already part of severn in june even though the consulting agreement,which was between murphy and pitometer,not severn,recites that it is effective from may.it seems that overnight pitometer turned into severn.in fact we see later in this opinion that murphy relationship with severn dated from pitometer acquisition of and that pitometer,despite the after its name,may be a division of severn and,if not,is a was in may and june of.
the consulting agreement either expired or was terminated during this litigation.murphy no longer works for severn or,so far as appears,has any other relationship with the company.the vagueness of the record in these and other respects is notable.
murphy told the eeoc that he would comply with the subpoena because severn had refused to assure him that it would not sue him for breach of the nondisparagement clause if he cooperated with the commission.the commission could have sought and obtained judicial enforcement of the subpoena,since obviously murphy could not by signing a contract excuse or disable himself from testifying.eeoc astra usa,cir camp eichelkraut,eeoc indiana bell telephone,cir en banc baker general motors,d hartlep torres,d.but instead it wrote severn asking the company to give murphy an enforceable waiver or amendment to the consulting agreement indicating that severn trent will not take action against him for any statements he might make to the eeoc in connection with its investigation of petolick charge.severn replied by expressing puzzlement that the commission had sought to enforce the subpoena and stating that severn trent has taken no action,nor does its agreement with murphy purport to restrain him from participating in any eeoc proceeding.accordingly,severn trent will not waive a negotiated provision of an agreement,made in connection with the sale of a business and totally unrelated to this or any other eeoc proceeding or charge of discrimination.
the commission then filed this suit for injunctive relief pursuant to f,which authorizes the agency to seek such relief in aid of its investigations when prompt judicial action is necessary to carry out the purposes of title vii.ahearn jackson hospital,and cir eeoc pacific press publishing ass n,cir.the district judge did not issue a written opinion explaining the basis for his decision to grant the injunction but in oral remarks said that severn trent has basically conceded that it is intend ing to use that provision of the contract that is,the nondisparagement clause to prohibit murphy from going beyond the legitimate bounds of the investigation itself.this sounds like a point against the grant of an injunction,since the eeoc has no right to question murphy about matters that are beyond the legitimate bounds of the investigation of petolick complaint.but no.the judge said that because the parties were for some inexplicable reason unable to work this out themselves a nd i said i would issue the injunction,i will.
at a previous hearing the judge had expressed exasperation at severn refusal to give murphy a blanket assurance that he would be sued.the judge said that murphy is willing to show up to be questioned by the eeoc,he just does want to be hammered by your client,severn,and i do blame him.the assurance the government was seeking,however,was that severn will not enforce the provision based on any information he provides to us emphasis added.that was too broad.later the demand was narrowed,but ambiguously,to communications with the eeoc in the context of our investigation of the charge.severn lawyer then told the judge that perhaps the parties could work out what that the context of our investigation means exactly.the hearing was adjourned to let the parties work it out.they did work it out we do know what the stumbling block was,so the judge issued the injunction.
that is all we can find in explanation of the judge action,except for his repeating when he issued the injunction that the eeoc wants to talk to murphy.murphy feels that he is being prohibited by this contract and is under the threat of suit.
the judge impatience is understandable,but he was too abrupt.an injunction so poorly buttressed by explanation flunks.d,which provides that every order granting an injunction and every restraining order shall set forth the reasons for its issuance.see also.a cir.advent electronics,buckman,cir weitzman stein,cir.the explanation can be oral rather than written,as in six clinics holding cafcomp systems,cir,and the absence of explanation can be forgiven when the justification for the injunction is clear from the record.books chater,cir hsu by and through hsu roslyn union free school dist,cir sunray dx oil helmerich payne,cir ross brothers construction international steel services,cir.but it is not clear in this case.
if severn merely wanted to prohibit murphy from making gratuitous disparagements of wholly unrelated to the petolick would be no cause for an injunction unless murphy or the commission had evidence that severn meant to sue him regardless of what he said to the commission,in order to deter signatories to the company nondisparagement clauses from cooperating in government investigations of the company.such suits would be frivolous,since a nondisparagement clause c
