background 
establishment of the trust 
lawsuits based on exposure to asbestos led celotex corporation,and its then subsidiary carey canada,collectively debtors to file for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code.in re celotex.in december,after years of negotiations between the debtors and other interested parties and multiple proposed reorganization plans,the bankruptcy court entered an order confirming the debtor reorganization plan.id.at.a principal feature of the plan was the creation of the trust.the trust was established in accordance with section g of the bankruptcy code,a provision specifically applicable to chapter reorganizations involving asbestos tort liabilities,to resolve and pay claims.see g b i.
the plan documents establish the process by which claims are determined and paid by the trust.under the plan documents,property damage claims pd claims are administered by a property damage claims administrator the administrator.plan a,b trust agreement,c apdcrp iv a.if the administrator allows a pd claim,the allowed claim is then submitted to the trustees for payment to the claimant.
because the trust current and future liabilities for asbestos claims exceed the trust assets,the trust operates as a limited fund that pays pd claimants a fraction of the value of their allowed claims.the plan directs the trustees to pay all allowed pd claims according to a payment percentage,which the trustees may adjust from time to time to ensure substantially equal treatment of all present and future claims.see plan art trust agreement c,a.in the event of a dispute under the plan,the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to enforce and interpret the provisions of the plan documents.plan c e accord trust agreement.
disputes over certain pd claims 
seven pd claims filed by the colleges and allowed by the administrator the allowed claims are at issue in this proceeding.when the administrator submitted the allowed claims to the trust for payment,the trustees originally refused to pay on grounds that the colleges failed to satisfy the legal prerequisites for payment.the trust then commenced adversary proceedings against the colleges in bankruptcy court.in opposing motions,each party sought an order from the bankruptcy court upholding its respective interpretation of the plan documents.the dispute largely related to the relative authority of the administrator and the trustees over pd claims.on april,the bankruptcy court granted the colleges motion for summary judgment and directed the trust to pay the colleges allowed claims.see generally asbestos settlement trust.claremont mckenna college in re celotex,bankr.april.
while the trust did not pay the colleges after the bankruptcy order,the trustees later decision to pay the allowed claims was in response to this court decision in a dispute between the trust and another pd claimant,the city of new york.see generally asbestos settlement trust city of new york in re celotex,cir nyc appeal.the trust had disputed certain allowed pd claims of the city of new york the nyc claims.the bankruptcy court ultimately granted summary judgment in favor of the city of new york and ordered the trust to pay the nyc claims.
in connection with the bankruptcy court determination,the court approved an agreement between the trust and the city of new york regarding the calculation of the liquidated amount for the nyc claims.under the terms of the agreement,if payment of the nyc claims was ultimately directed by a final order,the trust payment amount to the city of new york would include an additional amount based upon the rate of return earned by the trust on its investment portfolio during the pendency of the appeal.meanwhile,the trust and the colleges never reached a similar agreement as to the actual amounts to be paid on the colleges allowed claims.
after the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court order requiring the trust to pay the nyc claims,the trust appealed to this court.see generally nyc appeal.the colleges allowed claims remained in the bankruptcy court during the pendency of the nyc appeal.on appeal,this court considered the relative powers of the trustees and the administrator under the plan documents.see generally nyc appeal.this court determined,among other matters,that the plan documents did not confer to the trustees the power to independently review and overrule the administrator decisions in resolving pd claims.id.at.furthermore,this court found that the administrator actions and decisions were subject to review only for abuse of discretion.id.at.
c.the trust payments on the colleges allowed claims 
in july,after evaluating this court decision in the nyc appeal,the trust determined that it should no longer withhold payment of the colleges allowed claims and paid the colleges.the payments did not include interest on the allowed claims.instead,to calculate the amount paid to the colleges,the trust used the same formula that had been used,per agreements,to determine the amount paid to the city of new york and other pd claimants on their allowed claims.accordingly,the trust sent payments to the colleges in amounts that were based upon the total allowed costs determined for each claim,subject to the payment percentage,plus an additional amount calculated pursuant to a formula that factors into account the rate of return earned by the trust on its investment portfolio during the time that the colleges allowed claims were under judicial review.
the trust then moved to dismiss the adversary proceedings against the colleges on the basis that the issues had been resolved by the payments on the colleges allowed claims.the trust reasoned that its payments were in full satisfaction of the colleges allowed claims.the colleges opposed dismissal,asserting that they were entitled to interest on their allowed claims pursuant to rather than the rate of return on the trust investment.provides that i interest shall be allowed on any money judgment in a civil case recovered in a district at a rate equal to the weekly average constant maturity treasury yield,as published by the board of governors of the federal reserve system,for the calendar week preceding the date of judgment.according to the colleges,application of interest would require an additional payment from the trust slightly exceeding.
the bankruptcy court interpreted the plan documents and determined that the colleges were not entitled to interest on their claims.order on motion for dismissal with prejudice.march,bankruptcy court dismissal order.the bankruptcy court therefore granted the trust motion to dismiss and denied the college request for additional payment.id.at.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court order of dismissal.claremont mckenna college asbestos settlement trust in re celotex.march,district court dismissal order.the colleges appeal to this court,which has jurisdiction pursuant to.
