this appeal is the aftermath of a jury verdict that awarded celia zimmerman in compensatory damages and in punitive damages on her claim for retaliation and an additional in compensatory damages on her claim for tortious interference with advantageous relations resolving the appeal requires us to realign the standard of review applicable to appeals from punitive damage awards in light of recent supreme court precedent.before reaching this issue,however,we first must ponder two antecedent questions does the evidence suffice to sustain the jury finding of tortious interference with advantageous relations were the trial court jury instructions on compensatory damages adequate despite the court failure to address a plausible concern raised by the appellants we answer these two questions in the affirmative,uphold the punitive damage award,and affirm the judgment below.
background 
we recount the facts as the jury supportably could have found them,resolving conflicts where appropriate in favor of the prevailing party.
the plaintiff is a woman of considerable attainment.she graduated from princeton university,earned a master degree in business administration from southern methodist university,and held a variety of positions in the financial sector.in september,she accepted employment with direct federal credit union direct as its manager of financial planning and analysis.direct chief executive officer,david breslin,hired the plaintiff and led her to believe that her new post offered promising opportunities for advancement.
her first sixteen months with direct were a tour de force.joseph capalbo,direct and controller,was slated to be her immediate supervisor,but capalbo was absent for a long stretch of time due to his wife demise.the plaintiff assumed many of his responsibilities and handled them admirably.she received successive becoming director of concomitant pay raises and bonuses.at breslin request,she attended all but two of the twenty meetings of the board of directors held during that period and made presentations at fourteen of them.she also coordinated the annual senior management strategic planning retreat.by the end of,she had a sizable staff and was functioning successfully as direct de facto controller.her performance reviews sang her praises,describing her as a team player and a role model.
in january of,the plaintiff learned that she was pregnant and communicated that fact to breslin.the next day,breslin trimmed her responsibilities and reduced the size of her staff.approximately two months later,the plaintiff developed toxemia,and her physician prescribed episodic bed rest throughout the day.breslin initially agreed to accommodate her but then undercut the agreement by assigning her tasks to be performed during the allotted rest periods.the plaintiff was forced to leave the building entirely to obtain needed rest.
the plaintiff gave birth to her son in july of.the baby was born prematurely and the plaintiff took maternity leave.she then took some additional time to address other medical issues.when she returned to work in december,she discovered that her job had changed dramatically she had been stripped of her management role and capalbo had assumed most of her responsibilities.she was moved into a smaller office which she shared with a noisy wire transfer machine,given duties of modest importance,and excluded from discussions including board meetings.to compound these indignities,breslin shunned her,communicating only through capalbo.
on march,the plaintiff filed a complaint with the massachusetts commission against discrimination mcad.in it,she charged direct and breslin with discrimination based on sex and pregnancy.she a copy of her complaint to breslin two days later,hoping that he would begin addressing her concerns.breslin reacted badly,storming from office to office to speak to other executives,and closing the door behind him each time.although the plaintiff thereafter was invited to some management meetings,she was excluded from the senior management retreat an event which she previously had organized.moreover,breslin routinely ignored her attempts to participate during the meetings she attended and spoke about her in the third person as if she were not there.to make matters worse,she repeatedly was assigned to projects unrelated to the finance function,facility redesign and to monotonous tasks,beneath her pay grade,with which she had no prior experience,underwriting twenty to thirty home equity loans per day.
in april of,the plaintiff received an uncharacteristically poor performance review of her teamwork.the next month,direct and breslin responded to the mcad complaint,denying the plaintiff allegations and attacking her credibility.in due course,the plaintiff preempted the administrative proceedings by filing suit in a massachusetts state court charging,inter alia,gender and pregnancy discrimination,retaliation,intentional infliction of emotional distress,tortious interference with advantageous relations,and various statutory violations,violations of the family and medical leave act,the equal pay act,the massachusetts civil rights act,and the massachusetts equal rights act direct and breslin removed the case to the federal district court.see.
the institution of suit did nothing to calm troubled waters.breslin held a meeting in which he humiliated the plaintiff,pointedly stating that a certain person was not woman enough to come face to face with me and suggesting that bonuses would be larger if certain employees would leave as expected.at about the same time,capalbo instructed the plaintiff to prepare presentations for a board meeting,giving her only four days notice for a project that involved unfamiliar areas.breslin reported to the board on the status of the plaintiff lawsuit,then asked her to join the meeting and deliver her report.the plaintiff was not invited to attend any further board meetings.
breslin and capalbo continued to tinker with the plaintiff job description,repeatedly assigning her menial chores or duties unrelated to her expertise.breslin also made repeated attempts to set the plaintiff coworkers against her,quoting liberally,if not always accurately,from the plaintiff journal which he had obtained in the course of pretrial discovery.steve hagerstrom,a direct executive who was known to be sympathetic to the plaintiff,was a particular target of breslin wrath on one occasion after hagerstrom had defended the plaintiff,breslin told him that he did understand why a talented guy such as hagerstrom would stay at direct in such a hot economy if he had obvious negative feelings toward breslin.while these events were taking place the plaintiff received declining performance reviews,often with little or no explanation as to why her scores had decreased.
in june of,the plaintiff sought psychiatric help to cope with mounting stress.the psychiatrist diagnosed a severe depressive disorder,advised her not to return to work,and started her on antidepressant medication.after a absence,direct terminated her employment.the plaintiff depression had improved only marginally by the time of trial,and she was still unable to function as a normal person much less work.
meanwhile,the parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge.see c.the judge winnowed the plaintiff claims,disposing of her claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress and various statutory initiatives by summary judgment.as winnowed,the plaintiff case came on for jury trial in january of.the trial lasted for fifteen days.during that span,the plaintiff voluntarily discontinued her title vii claims and one of her discrimination claims.on february,the jury returned a split verdict.the jurors found that the appellants had neither discriminated against the plaintiff nor violated the family and medical leave act.they simultaneously found in the plaintiff favor on her retaliation claim against both appellants and on her tortious interference with advantageous relations claim against breslin.the plaintiff was awarded in compensatory damages and in punitive damages on the former claim and in compensatory damages on the latter.
the appellants promptly moved for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial.see.b,e.among other things,they questioned the sufficiency of the evidence on the tortious interference claim and argued that the punitive damage award should be set aside or,at least,reduced substantially.the magistrate judge denied the motions in a closely reasoned opinion.as to tortious interference,he found that a reasonable jury could readily conclude that breslin acted with a vindictive motive and that he,both individually and by means of capalbo,undertook a deliberate,calculated,systematic campaign to humiliate and degrade zimmerman both professionally and personally.as to punitive damages,the magistrate judge concluded that the jury had an adequate evidentiary basis to find that breslin engaged in a vendetta and that such conduct merited an award of punitive damages against both appellants.finally,the magistrate judge determined that the damages awarded both compensatory and punitive were reasonable in amount.
this appeal followed.in it,the appellants renew their challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence of tortious interference.they also aver that the magistrate judge erred in refusing to give a requested jury instruction.finally,they ask us to revisit the punitive damage award.we consider these three assignments of error separately 
ii.tortious interference with advantageous relations 
we review the denial of breslin motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.correa hosp.san francisco,cir.a motion for judgment as a matter of law only may be granted when,after examining the evidence of record and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,the record reveals no sufficient evidentiary basis for the verdict.see reeves sanderson plumbing,d gibson city of cranston,cir.in the course of this review,the court may not weigh the evidence,undertake credibility determinations,or engage in differential factfinding.colasanto life ins.of,cir.in the end,the jury verdict must stand unless the evidence,taken in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,points unerringly to an opposite conclusion.id.
breslin motion for judgment as a matter of law questioned the sufficiency of the evidence on the tortious interference count.he raises the same question on appeal.the elements of the tort are uncontroversial to prevail on a tortious interference claim,a plaintiff must demonstrate that she had a business relationship,that the defendant knew of this relationship,that the defendant intentionally and maliciously interfered with the relationship,and that the defendant actions harmed her.comey hill.
tortious interference takes an intriguing turn in the employment context.common sense suggests that an employee may not sue her employer for interfering with its own contract,and the case law verifies this intuition.harrison netcentric.despite the employer immunity,however,a supervisor may be personally liable if he tortiously interferes with a subordinate employment relationship.steranko inforex.this seeming paradox has led the massachusetts courts to construct a matrix of rules designed to ensure against irrational results 
one element of this matrix has special relevance here.the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc has held that a is entitled to a qualified privilege in an tortious interference case and,thus,will not be liable for employment decisions that are within the scope of his supervisory duties.see gram liberty mut.ins.the court adopted this limitation to allay a supervisor fear of personal liability when the occasion arises for that supervisor to make an adverse employment decision on behalf of the employer.id.withal,the privilege is not sacrosanct.massachusetts treats proof of actual malice as a proxy for proof that a supervisor was not acting on the employer behalf,and deems such proof sufficient to overcome the qualified privilege see id.
proof of actual malice requires more than a showing of mere hostility.see king driscoll,explaining that personal dislike will not warrant an inference of the requisite ill will.for one thing,the plaintiff must prove that malice was the controlling factor in the supervisor interference.alba sampson.for another thing,a ny reasonable inference of malice must be based on probabilities rather than possibilities.gram,at citation omitted.finally,such an inference requires an affirmative showing that the actions taken by the supervisor were not derived from a desire to advance the employer legitimate business interests.boothby texon,alba,at.
certain situations lend themselves to proof of malice.pertinently,the sjc has held that the elements underlying a claim for unlawful discrimination may be used to demonstrate malice in the context of a tortious interference claim.see comey,at.we think it follows logically that the elements underlying a claim for unlawful retaliation may be used to show malice when a tortious interference claim is brought against a supervisor in a case.although not a straightforward single employer situation,draghetti chmielewski,seems to establish the validity of this proposition as a matter of massachusetts jurisprudence.
draghetti was a police officer who also held a job as an instructor at a police academy.his supervisor on the police force,chmielewski,wrote a letter to the director of the academy,falsely stating that draghetti had scheduling problems.id.at.the supervisor urged draghetti replacement,and the director obliged.id.in the litigation that followed,draghetti prevailed on a tortious interference claim against chmielewski.
the sjc upheld the verdict because the record supported a finding that chmielewski likely retaliated against draghetti for draghetti union activities and testimony on behalf of a police officer suspended by chmielewski,the jury could have inferred that chmielewski had an improper motive.id.at.draghetti thus stands for the proposition that,in a tortious interference case under massachusetts law,proven retaliation may constitute an improper motive.since t here is no practical difference between actual malice and improper motives and means for the purposes of tortious interference,harrison,at,proven retaliation may serve as a proxy for actual malice.
with this background,we turn to the case at bar.breslin argument boils down to a claim that the plaintiff did not sufficiently overcome the qualified privilege.he contends that the evidence reveals only a series of slights which can not,as a matter of law,amount to malice in this context.but breslin failure to appeal from the jury finding of intentional retaliation under.laws ch,undermines his argument the jury had an opportunity to review the evidence in full and gauge the veracity of the witnesses.its breslin had unlawfully retaliated against the plaintiff for filing a complaint with the verified by the impressions of the judicial officer who presided over the trial.the commission of such unlawful discriminatory acts suffices to ground a reasonable inference that breslin motives were illegitimate and that his interference had no relationship to any proper corporate purpose.no more is necessary to sustain a finding of actual malice.see wright shriners hosp.for crippled children,holding that a spiteful,malignant purpose,unrelated to the legitimate corporate interest,suffices to show actual malice citation omitted.
to cinch matters,we have conducted an independent review of the record.we agree with the magistrate judge that the evidence presented at trial,when arrayed in the light most flattering to the plaintiff,is sufficient to demonstrate malice on breslin part and to warrant an illation that his acts fell outside the scope of his employment.breslin deliberate humiliation of the plaintiff at both the meeting and before the board of directors denotes something more pernicious than mere personal dislike or so reasonable jurors could have thought.king,at holding that the pursuit of additional financial gain did not constitute an improper motive.breslin use of the plaintiff diary is also apposite.he effectively drove a wedge between the plaintiff and her colleagues,poisoning her working relationships.on the basis of this evidence,the jury reasonably could have inferred as it apparently did that breslin interference sank to depths more peccant than mere slights and that he acted with actual malice.
we need not paint the lily.courts traditionally defer to the wisdom of juries in the resolution of questions.mailhiot liberty bank trust,illustrates the point in the tortious interference context.there,the treasurer of a bank had refused to sign a treasurer report without speaking to the board of directors,asserting that she was attempting to safeguard the bank against the bank president improper accounting practices.id.at.the president responded by advising the board of the plaintiff alleged shortcomings and successfully urging her dismissal.id.in the subsequent suit,the jury rejected the plaintiff claim against the board for wrongful discharge,yet awarded damages against the bank president for tortious interference.the appeals court upheld the verdict,noting that the plaintiff had introduced evidence that the president had fabricated certain allegations.id.this,the court held,was enough to sustain a finding of actual malice.id.the same sort of analysis holds true in this case we defer to the jury determination that the plaintiff,having proved unlawful retaliation,also proved the existence of an improper motive and,thus,proved actual malice.accordingly,we reject breslin claim that the evidence does not suffice to ground a finding of tortious interference.
iii.jury instructions 
we now turn to the issue of whether the magistrate judge erred in charging the jury.the appellants fault the magistrate judge because,notwithstanding their timely request,he did not specifically instruct the jurors to disregard all damages attributable to stress.the appellants speculate that,absent such an instruction,the jury may have awarded compensatory damages for injuries unrelated to the underlying claims.
because the appellants properly preserved their objection to the omission of the desired instruction,our review is for abuse of discretion.elliott warren,cir.we will set aside the verdict only if the omitted instruction was correct as a matter of substantive law,not substantially covered in the charge as a whole,and integral to an important point in the case.this standard weighs in the trier favor a trial court is obliged to inform the jury about the applicable law,but,within wide limits,the method and manner in which the judge carries out this obligation is left to his or her discretion.id.in short,no party is entitled to dictate the turn of phrase the judge should use to acquaint lay jurors with the applicable law.id.
in this instance,the appellants proffered instruction correctly stated the law.even though the sjc has not passed directly on the point,the heavy weight of authority holds that stress is not ordinarily recoverable as an element of damages.see picogna bd.of educ.of cherry hill,collecting cases.sound policy reasons support this rationale as a general rule,a putative tortfeasor should have the right to defend himself without risking a more munificent award of damages merely because the strain inherent in an actual or impending courtroom confrontation discomfits the plaintiff.as judge posner observed,i t would be strange if stress induced by litigation could be attributed in law to the tortfeasor.stoleson united states,cir.
the appellants are less successful on the remaining portions of the inquiry.as to the second prong,it is important to note that the omitted instruction related to compensatory damages.the judge told the jurors that if they found for the plaintiff on the issue of retaliation,they should award her those compensatory damages which were proximately caused by the retaliation.in the same vein,the judge admonished that damages in general and emotional damages in particular must be causally connected to the retaliation to be recoverable.he then added 
y ou are not to award any damages for any injury or condition from which the plaintiff may have suffered or may now be suffering unless it has been established by a preponderance of the evidence in the case that the particular injury for which damages are sought was caused by the retaliation.
later in the charge,the judge stated 
you may award the plaintiff damages which will compensate her reasonably for any emotional distress or mental anguish already suffered by her caused by the retaliation and for any emotional distress or mental anguish which you find from the evidence in the case that she is reasonably certain to suffer in the future from the same cause.
we believe that these instructions sufficiently addressed the core concern raised by the appellants proposed the jury compensate the plaintiff only for damages caused by their acts of retaliation jury instructions necessarily operate at a fairly high level of generality,elliott,at kibbe city of springfield,cir.consistent with this reality,a judge need not ruminate about every point of evidence nor instruct the jurors on how to weigh each bit of testimony.see interstate litho brown,cir a trial judge,who possesses particular insight into the main issues in a case,does not have an obligation to instruct a jury on every nuance of a party claim or defense.indeed,dangers often loom when a trial judge comments too specifically on the evidence.see,testa stores,cir explaining that a trial court instructing a jury must walk a fine court can err as easily by overinclusiveness as by underinclusiveness.
in the last analysis,the central inquiry reduces to whether,taking the charge as a whole,the instructions adequately illuminate the law applicable to the controlling issues in the case without unduly complicating matters or misleading the jury.united states destefano,cir citation omitted.in the usual case,the judge fulfills this responsibility as long as he adverts to the critical issues and instructs the jurors on the general legal framework applicable to those issues.there is simply no legal requirement that a judge,called upon to instruct a jury in a complicated case,be precise to the point of pedantry.see white dep t of corrections,cir.given that the court below told the jury no fewer than five times that the damages must be caused by the retaliation,this standard was satisfied.
if more were we doubt that it appellants also fail to satisfy the third prong of this inquiry they are unable to demonstrate that the requested instruction was integral to an important issue in the case.the appellants offer scant factual support for the instruction,identifying only two isolated vignettes in the course of a plaintiff comment that she felt as if she had mount everest in front of her when she received direct response to the mcad complaint,and her psychiatrist testimony that her downward spiral began on that day.this meager foundation hardly can support the weight that the appellants attempt to pile upon it.we therefore reject the appellants assertion that stress was an important issue in the case which ought to have been singled out for special attention in the lower court charge see destefano,at warning against instructing on collateral matters that may risk confusing and confounding the jury without supplying a scintilla of additional enlightenment united states fera,cir upholding trial court rejection of proffered jury instruction which did not relate to an important issue in the case.while the effects of stress may be a proper subject for inquiry and argument when the record evinces a realistic danger that the plaintiff will be awarded undeserved damages,the sketchy evidence here gives us no cause to believe that the magistrate judge abused his discretion by refusing to focus on that topic in his jury instructions.
to summarize,the standard of review cedes appreciable deference to the trial court in the formulation of jury instructions.here,the magistrate judge repeatedly instructed the jurors to consider only those damages that resulted from the appellants actions.given the record as a whole,no more was exigible.
iv.punitive damages 
we now arrive at the primary focus of the appeal the award of punitive damages on the retaliation count.historically,the standard of review applied to punitive damage awards has not been a model of clarity.in diversity cases,we sometimes have utilized the same standard of review that obtains in state court,ansin river oaks furniture,cir.on other occasions,we have applied a bifurcated standard,reviewing de novo the legal question of whether the evidence suffices to justify an award,and if it does,reviewing the trial court determinations as to excessiveness,inadequacy,and other questions for abuse of discretion,mcmillan.spca,cir.the supreme court,however,recently has clarified that,under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,the amount of a punitive damage award presents a legal issue.cooper,leatherman tool group,d.thus,both the extent of a punitive damage award and the sufficiency of the evidence on which it is premised engender de novo review in a federal appellate court.see id.since cooper supplants our prior precedents,we take a fresh look at the amount of the punitive damage award in this case.
where punitive damages are involved,de novo review is informed by principles of fundamental fairness.those principles dictate that a person receive fair notice not only of the conduct that will subject him to punishment,but also of the severity of the penalty that a state may impose.bmw of,gore,d.bmw furnishes three general guideposts for conducting such a review what is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant conduct what is the ratio between the compensatory and punitive damages what is the difference between the punitive damage award and the civil penalties imposed for comparable conduct id.at.these guideposts should neither be treated as an analytical straitjacket nor deployed in the expectation that they will draw a bright line marking the limits of a constitutionally acceptable punitive damages award.id.at.other pertinent factors may from time to time enter into the equation.when all is said and done,a punitive damage award will stand unless it clearly appears that the amount of the award exceeds the outer boundary of the universe of sums reasonably necessary to punish and deter the defendant conduct.romano int l,cir.
in this instance,the jury awarded punitive damages for retaliation under.laws ch.while this statute does not provide for any ceiling on punitive damage awards,the sjc placed a relevant gloss on the issue of punitive damages in labonte hutchins wheeler.there,the sjc recommended that reviewing courts consider 
a reasonable relationship to the harm that is likely to occur from the defendant conduct as well as to the harm that actually has occurred a reasonable relationship to the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant conduct removal of the profit of an illegal activity and be in excess of it so that the defendant recognizes a loss factoring in of the costs of litigation and encourage plaintiffs to bring wrongdoers to trial an examination whether criminal sanctions have been imposed an examination whether other civil actions have been filed against the same defendant.
id.at citing bmw,at.breyer,concurring.the sjc thus followed the same path as the bmw court,requiring review of punitive damage awards to ensure that any such award is reasonable and not simply a criminal penalty.id.at.
we evaluate the punitive damage award in this case in light of the bmw guideposts,without deference to the trial court appraisal.the first component of the degree of reprehensibility of the defendants is the most telling indicium of the reasonableness vel non of a punitive damage award.bmw,at.the simple fact is that some wrongs are more blameworthy than others.id.in order to justify a substantial punitive damage award,a plaintiff ordinarily must prove that the defendants conduct falls at the upper end of the blameworthiness continuum,or,put another way,that the conduct reflects a high level of culpability.see id.
the appellants argue that the record does not evince any behavior warranting an award of punitive damages.they see nothing egregious or outrageous about what they have done,but,rather,posit that the evidence,even when viewed favorably to the plaintiff,shows only slights and affronts.this argument lacks force.
the short but dispositive answer is that the appellants have not appealed the jury adverse verdict on the retaliation claim and,thus,have left unchallenged a finding,supported by extensive evidence,that the harm inflicted was far more than wounded pride and hurt feelings.the bmw court made plain that evidence that a defendant has repeatedly engaged in prohibited conduct while knowing or suspecting that it was unlawful would provide relevant support for an argument that strong medicine is required to cure the defendant disrespect for the law.id.at.this statement finds considerable traction on the facts of this case,in which the jury rationally could have found that breslin and through him,direct mounted a deliberate,systematic campaign to punish the plaintiff as a reprisal for her effrontery in lodging a discrimination claim.the campaign involved abasing her,isolating her from her colleagues,and degrading her professionally.the appellants should have realized that this scurrilous course of conduct was unlawful,yet they persisted in it.such a vendetta,to use the magistrate judge apt description,is not only deserving of opprobrium but also flatly prohibited by massachusetts law.hence,the reprehensibility of the appellants conduct can be viewed as calling for a substantial award of punitive damages.
the second bmw ratio between compensatory and punitive in the same direction.the supreme court has held that a ratio does not cross the line into the area of constitutional impropriety.pac.mut.life ins.haslip,d.accordingly,the ratio of compensatory to punitive damages awarded by the jury here presents no cause for concern 
the final bmw guidepost directs a reviewing court to assess the punitive damage award in light of the complex of statutory schemes developed to respond to the same sort of underlying conduct.on this factor,a reviewing court engaged in determining whether an award of punitive damages is excessive should accord substantial deference to legislative judgments concerning appropriate sanctions for the conduct at issue.bmw,at.citations and internal punctuation omitted.
the appellants treat this guidepost as if it beckoned them,first and foremost,to compare this case to other decided cases.thus,they stress the fact that this court has not upheld a punitive damage award in excess of for harms that the appellants classify as similar,rowlett,cir reducing punitive damage award on retaliation claim from to.they also argue that the statutory cap of for punitive damages under title vii,see b a,highlights the exorbitance of the award.
in our view,the appellants have misconstrued the nature and purpose of this guidepost.decided cases are relevant,but positive and even more critical.moreover,a reviewing court should search for comparisons solely to determine whether a particular defendant was given fair notice as to its potential liability for particular misconduct,not to determine an acceptable range into which an award might fall.in bmw,for example,the court compared the multimillion dollar verdict with civil fines for the same behavior that ranged from to.at.since none of these statutes provided the defendant with fair notice that the first violation of the alabama statute provisions might subject an offender to a multimillion dollar penalty,the punitive damage award did not pass muster.id.
here,the appellants had sufficient notice.in another section of the very statute upon which the plaintiff sued,the massachusetts legislature provided for the assessment of treble damages against perpetrators of intentional age discrimination.see.law ch.at the same time,the legislature left uncapped the damages stemming from other types of discrimination under that statute.in doing so,the legislature apparently intended to permit damage awards for other forms of the retaliation found than the treble damages for age discrimination.see fontaine ebtec,stating that i t is not reasonable to assume that the legislature intended to design a damages scheme which singles
