a jury awarded miguel in compensatory damages and in punitive damages against puerto rico,on his disability discrimination claim under the americans with disabilities act ada.
specifically,the jury found arrieta had proven that he had an impairment or was regarded as having an impairment which substantially limited his ability to perform a major life function.arrieta claimed impairment was a penile implant used to correct a sexual dysfunction the implant itself left arrieta with the appearance of a constant.the jury also found that arrieta was subjected to a hostile work environment because of his disability.arrieta claim was that,due to his condition,he was constantly harassed both by his supervisors and,and that when he complained to his supervisors,no corrective actions were taken.the jury found that arrieta was constructively discharged that is,that he resigned from due to the intolerable working conditions.
appeals from the verdict,arguing that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury on an affirmative defense under burlington industries,ellerth,d,and faragher city of boca raton,d.also makes two insufficiency of the evidence arguments as to liability that arrieta was not disabled within the meaning of the ada,in that his impairment neither affected a major life activity nor was related to working conditions and that the evidence was insufficient to support the existence of a hostile work environment.of these,the most difficult issue is that of whether arrieta was disabled within the meaning of the ada.but did not preserve the issue at trial and does not demonstrate circumstances that would warrant our taking the extraordinary step of reaching the merits of that issue on appeal.
also challenges the damages award,arguing that the district court erred in its punitive damages instruction to the jury,that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to award punitive damages,and that arrieta failed to mitigate his damages by taking advantage of open door policy.
arrieta,in turn,appeals arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion seeking an additional award of back pay and front pay,adjudicated by the judge,not the jury.
in the end,we affirm on both appeals,leaving all parties in the place the jury and the district court left them.
we recount the facts in the light most favorable to upholding the jury verdict as to the sufficiency challenge,cir.
arrieta began working at in.at the time,he suffered from peyronie disease,which made it impossible for him to have sexual intercourse.arrieta had undergone unsuccessful surgery in to attempt to correct the problem.in february arrieta underwent another surgery,during which the first implant was removed and a new penile prosthesis was implanted.the second procedure was successful,but had the side effect,common with this procedure,that arrieta had a constant that was apparent through his clothing.his doctor reported that arrieta had no physical or mental impairment before going back to work.the complaints of harassment in this case concern the period after the february surgery.
arrieta filed paperwork with personnel department detailing the february procedure in order to obtain approval for medical coverage.soon after returning to work after the surgery,arrieta became the subject of harassment by his and supervisors.three,the plaintiff,and supervisors all described the numerous incidents.on his first day back at work,jorge ortiz,an assistant manager,asked arrieta how it felt to have his new pump.when arrieta confronted ortiz about where he got the information,the assistant manager told him that he learned about arrieta surgery from the girls in personnel.arrieta complained to mara mieles,the personnel manager,about the release of information and the fact that ortiz had taunted him about it,but mieles said,i do know what you talking about,this is nonsense between guys,these are things between men.
arrieta married his present wife on june.the taunting about arrieta surgery continued for the remaining years that arrieta worked at,and was constant.on the one hand,much of the harassment expressed the view that arrieta was impotent,and that he needed to use a pump to get an erection.one of arrieta testified that he thought arrieta was impotent b ecause according to what i know,a person who has had a little pump put in is because they are disabled as far as achieving an erection.another testified that the jokes were regarding his age,saying that he needed to have a pump in order to have relations what they almost always used was the part regarding the pump,that he needed to use a pump.
on the other hand,some harassing statements evidenced an impression that arrieta was unusually enabled because of the implant.assistant manager ortiz once asked arrieta,old man,i going to be going out with someone tomorrow,and i wanted to know if you let me borrow your pump.another time,ortiz asked arrieta,miguelito,did it work with your wife on one occasion,someone used the store paging system to announce that if arrieta was close by to ask arrieta to come to the warehouse to let him borrow a pump so that they could lift a pallet or a box.on another occasion,when arrieta was visiting the personnel offices,a group of department managers in a meeting with personnel manager mieles began making comments such as,there is viagra man.no,he got force power.as to this event,arrieta testified,i looked over at miss mieles,and i said this was the nonsense i was talking about four years ago.mieles did not respond in any way.
in fact,with the implant,arrieta was initially able to engage in intercourse with his wife.later psychological depression,occasioned by the harassment,affected his sexual functioning.
assistant manager ortiz and jose ramos,a support manager under ortiz,were initiators of the comments about arrieta condition,according to the testimony of rey rodriguez,one of arrieta.during meetings at the beginning of the night shift,ortiz would come into the warehouse with a joke regarding the pump.rodriguez testified that jose ramos would use the paging system to make jokes regarding the pump ramos said that arrieta was ready with his baton.another,eliezer ramos,recounted an incident between arrieta and assistant manager ortiz.ortiz had been particularly offensive 
arrieta had been away on his honeymoon,and two or three days later,i heard comments from other employees saying that arrieta was upset with jorge,because jorge had asked arrieta if the pump had not worked out with his wife,he should bring her to him.
eliezer ramos also testified that dennis baerga,another assistant manager and yet a third supervisor of arrieta,once said l ook,miguel arrieta pump seems to be working within the presence of assistant manager ortiz and gilberto rosa,who was a department manager for cosmetics,but not arrieta supervisor.
arrieta former supervisors,ortiz and jose ramos,themselves admitted key facts.support manager jose ramos admitted participating in the taunting 
well,about what could be heard and all the fooling around they had going on in there,where i did participate in those jokes,well,about a condition that was very pronounced under his pants,then like everyone else,they started to make jokes with him saying miguel,what is it that you got there,come here 
assistant manager ortiz acknowledged that he was aware of the taunting,and that arrieta had complained to him about it 
q is it true that arrieta also on many occasions went to you to complain about the jokes 
a about the jokes,i remember only one time 
q is it true,jorge ortiz,that employees would see arrieta erection and would joke and laugh about his pump 
a that is correct,with him.
q is it true,jorge ortiz,that upon the question of your attorney,you answered that if an inappropriate conduct or a disrespectful conduct was taken to you,you had the duty to immediately report it to your supervisor or store manager 
a yes,that is correct.
q and arrieta did complain to you,did he 
a yes,that is correct.
ortiz also admitted knowing that arrieta went to department manager gilberto rosa to complain.neither ortiz nor rosa took action in response to these complaints.
the evidence shows that arrieta complained to superiors in his chain of command at,up to the level of store manager at no level was effective corrective action taken.as ortiz admitted,arrieta complained to him about the taunting.arrieta asked ortiz if he could work apart from the other employees so he would not be subject to their taunting ortiz allowed this.working apart from the other employees improved the situation somewhat.but arrieta still was subject to harassment,especially as his shift was starting and ending,at which time he was more frequently in the presence of other workers.arrieta also complained about the taunting to rey font,who was store manager from about to,and asked if his shift could be changed.font denied arrieta request,saying,look,don miguel,what do you want me to do,these are things going on between men,and what am i supposed to do it easier to get rid of one than to get rid of all of them.
in,arrieta made another request that he be transferred from the overnight shift to the morning shift.this time,he directed his request to benjamin gomez,who was font replacement as store manager.he told gomez that he was having trouble with the jokes made by the guys.gomez,rather than transferring arrieta to the morning shift,transferred him to the afternoon shift,which exacerbated the problem.arrieta said that once the decision to transfer him was made,he could not decline.according to arrieta,the change to the afternoon shift only made his problems was still being harassed,only this time the harassment occurred in front of customers in the store,rather than just fellow employees.he told gomez this.in his resignation letter,arrieta noted that when he had complained to gomez about the change to the afternoon shift,gomez responded in a mocking tone of voice and sarcastically that we are not here to make accommodations for anyone.
the harassment took an emotional toll on arrieta.he had trouble sleeping,lost weight,and experienced a loss of libido to the point where he became unable to engage in sexual relations.on may,arrieta complained to his urologist that he had a loss of sexual desire.the urologist found no physical reason for arrieta loss of libido,and so recommended that arrieta see a psychiatrist or psychologist.on september and october of,arrieta consulted a psychiatrist,reporting loss of libido,loss of weight,and a depressive mood.the psychiatrist diagnosed arrieta as having a dysthymic disorder with late onset.on february,the psychologist certified that arrieta was disabled on account of dysthymic disorder and that such disability was not work related.arrieta wife,nereida olivencia,testified that when they got married they had plans to have children,but after arrieta problems began,that was no longer possible.
also noticed a change for the worse in arrieta.rey rodriguez testified,y ou could see that miguel arrieta emotional system was working the same way anymore.delio crespo testified,at first,arrieta used to share a lot with us,and after a while,he withdrew from the group to the point where i had to ask about where he was,because i could see him.
has an open door policy,which,according to,permits any employee that has a grievance or is the object of illegal discrimination to complain to any supervisor,manager,officer or the president of the company.emphasis added.admits that p ursuant to the open door policy,the grievance need not be reduced to writing if an oral grievance is made,there is a duty to entertain it.the policy was not put into practice and a jury could easily find it existed only on paper.
no recording by the company was ever made of arrieta complaints,including his complaints to the personnel department.in fact,mieles,the personnel manager,acknowledged that there might not be any written record of an employee making use of the open door policy and that she had never even seen such a recording for any employee,much less one for arrieta.
under the open door policy,the supervisors had affirmative obligations as well.benjamin gomez,in response to a question by arrieta counsel,agreed that any manager who would have heard or been present during the harassment would have had an obligation to investigate.no investigation was ever undertaken,although arrieta had complained about the taunting to at least three supervisors in his immediate chain of command assistant manager ortiz,and store managers font and gomez,the personnel manager mieles,and rosa,who was not arrieta immediate supervisor but nonetheless a department manager.arrieta had been taunted by at least three of his managers baerga and ortiz,and support manager jose ramos.
arrieta concluded it was futile to complain further to the supervisors t hese jokes had been begun by supervisors themselves and had become commonplace.who are you going to complain to delio crespo,a,agreed.in reference to the taunting of arrieta,crespo stated i did feel the need to contact any manager,because they were all present.
arrieta explained that he decided not to escalate his complaints about the harassment to the home office because of his prior experience with that office.he never received a response to a letter he had written to the home office in about how his work experience was not meeting his expectations.arrieta wrote this letter because when you given all the orientation and you given all the chats,what would happen was actually totally opposite of the way it was supposed to be.arrieta said,since that letter was never answered,i never heard anything else about it.then it seemed to me that with any other small incidents,it would just be wasting my time.
on october,arrieta filed a charge of discrimination before the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc and the department of labor and human resources of puerto rico,alleging he had been subjected to a hostile work environment as a result of his age and medical condition.in his charge,arrieta stated often,allusions are made to my medical record,and i am the object of jokes and remarks on the part of my s upervisors and coworkers.i am told that i am already old,that i need a new operation because the pump does not work and other remarks that allude to an operation that i underwent approximately years ago.mocking is continuous on the part of my coworkers and s upervisors 
arrieta received two written reprimands after this date.on october,arrieta was reprimanded for failing to secure keys which could be used to access and steal merchandise.then,on november,arrieta was reprimanded for working minutes of overtime without the prior authorization of an assistant manager.arrieta considered the reprimands to have been unwarranted and given in retaliation for his having filed a discrimination complaint with the eeoc.
an undated document in evidence titled exit interview indicates that arrieta last day of work was november.while the record is not clear about the details of arrieta departure from,claims that arrieta was given a leave of absence on that date arrieta formally resigned on may.he left because of his emotional state and the emotional state it was causing in his wife,and the fact that he had already submitted documentation and filed a complaint because of discrimination,and the fact that back in october when he had returned,they had begun planning or orchestrating a way to provide me with warnings.at his exit interview at,arrieta noted that he was resigning because he was constantly harrass ed by supervisor and.
on march,the eeoc issued arrieta a notice of right to sue.arrieta filed suit on june,against,alleging violations of the ada,the age discrimination in employment act adea,and several provisions of puerto rico law.on january,the district court granted motion for summary judgment as to arrieta claims under the adea,but allowed arrieta hostile work environment and constructive discharge claims under the ada and state law to go to jury trial.
during the trial,both arrieta and submitted proposed jury instructions.proposed the following instruction regarding its policy,as part of a broader instruction on the required elements of a hostile work environment claim 
defendant,however,has what it calls the open doors policy as part of the policy of this procedure has been instituted to vent any serious grievance.in furthering this policy,submitted evidence that it has implemented continuous training procedures wherein it emphasizes the respect for the individual,the illegality of discrimination and the importance for associates of utilizing the open doors policy when such recourse is necessary.the defendant claims that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.if you find that such is the case,in this regard you must find for the defendant,because the plaintiff failed to place the defendant on notice of any grievance that he may have had,and therefore did not place the defendant in a position to do anything on the subject of this litigation.
at the end of the eighth day of trial,counsel for both sides convened with the judge in his conference room to review the instructions.later,when the judge instructed the jury,requested instruction regarding the open door policy was not given,which has raised on appeal the issues regarding the jury instructions,has not provided us a transcript of the discussions.has pointed us to two instances in the record where it made clear its objections to the instructions,and both occurred after the jury had heard the instructions.the first objection was made immediately after the charge to the jury.the transcript of this discussion is fairly sparse,and refers to discussions that are not in the record.the next objection was made in motion.those objections are described later.
arrieta,for his part,requested only one additional instruction,which sought to avoid having the jury draw a negative inference from the fact that the eeoc did not make any determination on arrieta complaint this proposed instruction was denied.arrieta made no other objections to the instructions.
at the end of arrieta case in chief,moved for judgment as a matter of law under.on the grounds that arrieta had failed to establish that he was disabled within the meaning of the ada.however,failed to renew its motion at the close of all the evidence.on january,the jury returned a verdict in arrieta favor on the ada claims and in favor on the state law claims,and awarded arrieta compensatory damages of and punitive damages of.
both and arrieta made motions.sought judgment as a matter of law under.this time,raising the claim that arrieta had not established that he was disabled under the ada,a new trial under,or vacation of the judgment under.b.arrieta sought an award of back pay and front pay.the district court denied both parties motions for reasons discussed below 
appeala.jury instruction on defense 
this case involves evidence of both harassment by supervisors and harassment by.in two companion cases decided in,the supreme court addressed the question of an employer vicarious liability for actionable discrimination by a supervisor with immediate or successively higher authority over the plaintiff employee.ellerth,d faragher,d.
prior to ellerth and faragher,cases had established the standard for employer liability for harassment of the plaintiff employee.ordinarily,where the harassment is by a,the employer is liable only if the plaintiff can show that the employer knew or should have known of the charged harassment and failed to implement prompt and appropriate action.crowley bean,cir quoting white dep t of,cir.
as to actionable discrimination by supervisors,faragher articulated some clear lines 
an employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate or successively higher authority over the employee.faragher,at.
where no tangible employment action is taken,a defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages,subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence.id.
no affirmative defense is available when the supervisor harassment culminates in a tangible employment action,such as discharge,demotion,or undesirable reassignment.id.at.
the affirmative defense,when available,comprises two necessary elements a that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any harassing behavior,and b that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.id.at.the employer bears the burden of proof as to both elements.id.at.
as to the first element of the defense,proof of an policy with a complaint procedure available to employees,while not necessarily dispositive,is relevant.id.at.
as to the second element of the defense,proof that the employee failed to meet his obligation of using reasonable care is not limited to an unreasonable failure to use such a procedure,although such proof will normally suffice to meet the employer burden.id.at.see also reed mbna mktg,cir marrero goya of,cir.
after ellerth and faragher,the question that arose was whether a constructive discharge,occasioned by supervisor harassment so severe it was intolerable,constituted a per se tangible employment action so as to preclude the assertion of the faragher affirmative defense.this court addressed the question in reed.see at.as is often our wont,we said that while other circuits had adopted hard and fast per se rules as to whether a constructive discharge was or was not a tangible employment action,we would not adopt such a rule.id.at w e see no reason to adopt a blanket rule one way or the other.here,it is clear to us that the constructive discharge label can not be used to preclude the affirmative defense.instead,we focused on whether the supervisor action was an official action comprising the kind of tangible employment action,discharge,reduction in pay that the supreme court appeared to have in mind.id.reeddid allow for the possibility that,on other facts,the affirmative defense as to supervisor harassment could be precluded in a constructive discharge case.
the supreme court addressed the same issue in pennsylvania state police suders,d,adopting a test similar to that in reed.suders held that constructive discharge is not a per se tangible employment action.rather,it held that a tangible employment action was an official act,that is,an adverse action officially changing the employee employment status or situation,for example,a humiliating demotion,extreme cut in pay,or transfer to a position in which the employee would face unbearable working conditions.id.at.such an official act can both precipitate an employee constructive discharge and be a tangible employment action that would preclude the employer resort to the faragher defense.see id.at.
where the evidence shows that the defendant can not prove an affirmative defense under the faragher standard,there is no reason to remand for the giving of a faragher instruction.see city of providence,cir.indeed,in faragher itself,the supreme court declined to remand because the factual findings made in the trial court demonstrated that the employer was not,on the evidence,entitled to the defense.at.
in this case,the court instructed the jury on january,rejecting defendant proposed instruction.at that time,suders had not yet been decided,but reed had been.nonetheless,did not ask for an instruction on whether a tangible employment action,or a tangible event as that term is defined by reed,had taken place.instead,instruction assumed there was no tangible employment action and that it was entitled to assert the defense.
in its ruling on the motion the court said it had declined to give the proposed instruction because the defense was not applicable.the court found,in essence,that no reasonable jury could have concluded that either element of the defense had been met.first,the court noted that the open door policy existed on paper,but had not been put into practice.indeed,when arrieta complained to the personnel department and to several supervisors,no corrective actions were taken and his complaints were not even recorded.second,the evidence was that arrieta had reasonably availed himself
