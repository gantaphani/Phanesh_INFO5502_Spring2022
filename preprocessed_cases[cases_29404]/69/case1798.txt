hopkins real estate group hopkins group appeals from the trial court order authorizing a writ of attachment for california retail portfolio fund california retail in connection with california retail arbitration proceeding against the hopkins group for breach of a real estate joint venture agreement.because there was substantial evidence that an award for california retail might be rendered ineffectual without a writ of attachment,we affirm the order.
facts and procedural history 
california retail is a german limited partnership that entered into a partnership agreement with the hopkins group by which california retail invested more than million in five southern california area shopping centers.the partnership agreement provided that california retail would receive an annual payment of every june from through.when the hopkins group failed to make the first two annual payments,california retail began arbitration proceedings pursuant to the partnership agreement arbitration provision 
under code of civil procedure section,parties to arbitration proceedings may apply to the superior court for writs of attachment and other provisional remedies if,in addition to the usual requirements for such remedies,an award to the petitioner may be rendered ineffectual without such relief.code civ,subd.b.in march,california retail applied to the trial court for a writ of attachment against various assets and funds owned by the hopkins group.
the unverified application alleged compliance with all the requirements for issuing a writ of attachment,along with an allegation that without the writ,an award in california retail favor would be ineffectual.the application was supported by the declaration of one of california retail officers,joerg kanebley.kanebley summarized the terms of the partnership agreement and said that the hopkins group had failed to make the and annual payments.neither the declaration,nor any of the other evidentiary materials submitted with the application,addressed whether an award might be ineffectual without the writ.despite the evidentiary omission,the points and authorities in support of the application argued that an arbitration award for california retail might be rendered ineffectual because the hopkins group was not paying its debts,and because stephen hopkins hopkins,who effectively controlled the hopkins group and its related entities,would make sure the company had no remaining assets by the end of the arbitration proceeding.
the hopkins group opposition points and authorities noted the absence of evidence on three issues the existence of an enforceable written agreement,subd.a proof of the probable validity of california retail claim,based on the hopkins group for arbitration of claims against entities related to california retail that were also parties to the partnership agreement,subd.a that an award for california retail might be ineffectual without the writ.the opposition brief was supported by the declaration of hopkins,who offered a different version of the events.however,apart from stating that neither he nor the hopkins group had ever declared bankruptcy,hopkins declaration was silent as to the solvency of the hopkins group.
california retail filed a reply brief that addressed these evidentiary gaps.as to the insolvency issue,which is the only relevant issue on appeal,california retail provided a of a june,email to hopkins from michael haines,the chief financial officer of the hopkins group.in it,haines said he wanted to speak with hopkins about some concerns i have regarding the hopkins group overall liquidity,and other matters.haines stated that igb a california retail entity wants more clarity on the game plan for fontana and where the igb ii funds are.i do know how those funds were used so i can not sic answer that question.also,my sense is that missing the guaranteed payments to igb on funds i,ii and iii will likely cause them to not fund on fund iv.that will put us in a position where we ca resolve clearfund iii and wo be in a position to payoff sic the renfro note.andy looked at the igb agreements.assuming the payments are made and something is not worked out,igb would at a minimum go after the guaranteed payments that you personally guaranteed.haines went on to state that completing another transaction would generate some cash but i do not believe it will be enough to meet all of our needs haines cautioned that we are not being up front with another entity about the payments owed to igb.haines concluded that a vailable cash is being used up and our development fee stream is effectively down to shopping centers in carson and redlands which does not come close to covering overhead.i have brought up assets sales before to monetize value and i know there is concern that we would be discounted but i think we have to look at all alternatives.it is very important to discuss all of this to strategize on how to keep the company capitalized.
the delayed production of this email was explained in a declaration from one of california retail lawyers.she said that the hopkins group had not fully responded to california retail discovery requests,forcing california retail to obtain an interim order from the arbitrator compelling the production of certain documents.the email from haines to hopkins was among those produced.the hopkins group did not turn over the materials until march,eight days after the application for a writ of attachment was filed.the hopkins group does not dispute these events.
at the hearing on the writ application,the hopkins group objected that the email from haines was inadmissible because it was both unauthenticated and hearsay.the trial court never ruled on the objection,and counsel for the hopkins group never asked it to do so.when the trial court asked counsel for the hopkins group about the absence of an explanation from his client about why the guaranteed annual payments had not been made,counsel said he could not answer that question.the court asked whether there were certain inferences that it could make that are common sense out of what it does have.after further brief argument,the trial court granted the application for a writ of attachment.

discussion 
ineffectual relief is a species of irreparable injury that includes 
insolvency or other evidence of extreme financial distress 
under section,a party to an arbitration agreement may file an application in superior court for certain provisional remedies without waiving the right to arbitrate,subds.b,d.those provisional remedies include receivers,writs of possession,temporary restraining orders,and preliminary injunctions.they also include writs of attachment and protective orders issued under title of part of the code of civil procedure,beginning with section,subd.a.the writ may issue only upon the ground that the award to which the applicant may be entitled may be rendered ineffectual without provisional relief,subd.b.
the logical reason for the requirement that an applicant be required to show that an arbitration award may be rendered ineffectual is to ensure that the court does not invade the province of the arbitrator,the court should be empowered to grant provisional relief in an arbitrable controversy only where the arbitrator award may not be adequate to make the aggrieved party whole.woolley embassy suites,d.in addition to the requirement of ineffectual relief,the applicant must also satisfy the statutory or common law requirements that pertain to the provisional remedy they seek.id.at.
although there are a handful of reported decisions concerning the ineffectual relief requirement when issuing an injunction as a provisional remedy in an arbitration proceeding,only one federal court decision has addressed the issue as to writs of attachment china nat.metal prod.apex dig.d china national.that case involved an arbitration between a chinese exporter of dvd players and one of its buyers.at issue was whether the federal district court had jurisdiction to issue a writ of attachment under the federal law governing the enforcement of foreign arbitration awards,and,if so,whether such a writ was proper.the federal magistrate answered yes to both questions.
because the writ was sought in a district court in california,the court applied our state laws governing attachments,including section.after finding that the traditional requirements for a writ of attachment had been satisfied,the china national court turned to section and the ineffectual relief requirement.without discussion or citation to authority,the court found that because the buyer was having a problem with its finances,and appeared to be having financial difficulties,any award for the exporter might be rendered ineffectual.the evidence supporting this finding included the company unwillingness to pay its debts,threats by its customers for claims of indemnification in the millions of dollars,and a statement from the company president that the company was having financial difficulties,thus making it hard to meet its obligations.china national,supra,d at.
both the legislative history of section,as well as the terms of the statute itself,support the notion expressed in china national that the apparent insolvency of a party to an arbitration agreement,or other evidence showing that the party was experiencing severe financial difficulties,is sufficient to satisfy the ineffectual relief requirement 
only two documents in the legislative history addressed this issue.the first describes the requirement of ineffectual relief in the proposed legislation as,the provisional remedy is needed to preserve the value or worth of item sic in dispute under the arbitration agreement.consumer affairs,enrolled bill on bill reg.sess.because there is no particular item in dispute here,this statement does not help us.however,the second document does.after setting forth the ineffectual relief requirement,this report describes it as being similar to irreparable harm.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.may,proposed amendment.
irreparable harm is a cornerstone of the availability of another provisional remedy,injunctive relief,subd.a,a provisional remedy also expressly allowed by section.in the context of injunctions,insolvency or the inability to otherwise pay money damages is a classic type of irreparable harm.leach day cal,friedman friedman th.a close examination of section confirms that both insolvency and the inability to otherwise pay damages are appropriate measures of irreparable harm that might render an arbitration award ineffectual when a writ of attachment is sought.
as noted above,section authorizes the issuance of writs of attachment in arbitration proceedings pursuant to title commencing with section of part.included within title is chapter,which sets forth the procedures for obtaining an ex parte writ of attachment article of that chapter is headed,great or irreparable injury requirement.it contains only one provision section which sets forth the showing required to obtain an ex parte writ of attachment 
a except as otherwise provided by statute,no right to attach order or writ of attachment may be issued pursuant to this chapter unless it appears from facts shown by affidavit that great or irreparable injury would result to the plaintiff if issuance of the order were delayed until the matter could be heard on notice.
b the requirement of subdivision a is satisfied if any of the following are shown 
under the circumstances of the case,it may be inferred that there is a danger that the property sought to be attached would be concealed,substantially impaired in value,or otherwise made unavailable to levy if issuance of the order were delayed until the matter could be heard on notice.
under the circumstances of the case,it may be inferred that the defendant has failed to pay the debt underlying the requested attachment and the defendant is insolvent in the sense that the defendant is generally not paying his or her debts as those debts become due,unless the debts are subject to a bona fide dispute.plaintiff affidavit filed in support of the ex parte attachment shall state,in addition to the requirements of section,the known undisputed debts of the defendant,that the debts are not subject to bona fide dispute,and the basis for plaintiff determination that the defendant debts are undisputed.
any other circumstance showing that great or irreparable injury would result to the plaintiff if issuance of the order were delayed until the matter could be heard on notice.italics added.
when a statute is ambiguous,section headings may be considered in determining legislative intent and are entitled to considerable weight.woodland park management,llc city of east palo alto rent stabilization bd.th,fn.because the legislature did not specify what constitutes ineffectual relief under section,we conclude that it is proper to consider both the heading of article of chapter great or irreparable injury requirement,and the only statute contained in that article section.we reach this conclusion in three steps.first,the legislative history of section refers to irreparable harm as a touchstone for the ineffectual relief requirement.second,irreparable harm includes the concepts of insolvency and the inability to pay a damage award.third,the legislature included ex parte writs of attachment among the provisional remedies authorized under section,and section of that article defines a variety of irreparable injuries,including insolvency.in short,we believe that section,along with its article heading,is instructive on the concept of ineffectual relief under section,and that the courts may look to the criteria of section when deciding that issue.
as discussed below in part,the hopkins group takes this point even further and contends that strict compliance with the standards for showing irreparable harm under section is required in order to obtain a writ of attachment under section.thus,the hopkins group argues in its reply brief that california retail must submit supporting declarations that a list the hopkins group known undisputed debts b state that the debts are not subject to a bona fide dispute and c state the basis for california retail determination that the hopkins group debts are undisputed,subd.b.
this argument mixes apples and giraffes.the purpose behind the additional requirements in section is to avoid the irreparable injury that would otherwise befall an attaching party if issuance of the order were delayed until the matter could be heard on notice,subd.a,italics added.the factors identified by the hopkins group in its reply brief compare only one of the five different ways a party can satisfy the exception for ex parte as opposed to noticed motion issuance of a writ,subd.b.the specifics of these statu
