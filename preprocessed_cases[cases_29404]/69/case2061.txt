dwayne parents,lottie nelson and wallace nelson,sued the county of los angeles and the sheriff department and individual deputies,all of whom are included in our references to the county for their son allegedly wrongful death the county answered,discovery ensued,and the case ultimately proceeded to trial a jury found the county was negligent,that the county negligence was the cause of dwayne death,and that percent of the negligence was attributable to dwayne conduct.the jury awarded million to the nelsons,which was reduced by the percent to.the county motions for a new trial and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict were denied,as was a motion by the nelsons for attorneys fees.the county appeals and nelson has filed a.
we reject the county challenge to the nelsons standing to prosecute this action,reject the county contention that the nelsons failed to prove causation,agree with the county that the damages awarded by the jury were excessive,reject nelson claim that she was entitled to recover her attorney fees on a private attorney general theory,and reject her contention that the government tort claim she filed for herself was sufficient to preserve a claim for damages by dwayne estate.we reverse the award of damages,remand for a new trial of that issue,and otherwise affirm the judgment.
discussion 
the county contends the judgment must be reversed because the nelsons lacked standing to bring a wrongful death action.we disagree.
during a pretrial conference,the county filed a request for determination of preliminary fact in which it asked the trial court to determine that the nelsons lacked standing to prosecute this action because some of dwayne prison records refer to statements by him in which he said he had children.although it is undisputed that the nelsons were dwayne parents,and although no one else has ever asserted a claim to dwayne estate or to any relationship with him,the county position was and is that the nelsons had the affirmative obligation to prove that dwayne was not survived by a spouse or child.the county said the issue had to be determined by the court before they could proceed to the merits of the nelsons wrongful death claim 
the trial court agreed,and a hearing was held at which the nelsons without objection presented nelson deposition testimony to establish that dwayne who was about at the time of his death never married and never had any children.to dispute that fact,the county presented some of dwayne prison records to show that he had at various times over a period of eight or ten years told prison employees that he had one,or sometimes two,or sometimes three children.in rebuttal the nelsons presented conflicting prison records to show that dwayne had at other times told various prison officials that he never married and did not have any children.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the trial court found the prison records were inadmissible hearsay because the statements made to the prison employees were simply not trustworthy.as the court put it,dwayne sometimes said he was single and other times that he was married and that he was divorced,that he had no kids,that he had one kid,that he had two kids,that he had three kids.there was also the fact that the prison records stated that dwayne suffered from hallucinations,and that he was a narcotics addict.the trial court concluded that the nelsons had established their standing.
subdivision a of section of the code of civil procedure provides that a cause of action for the death of a person caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another may be asserted by any of the following persons or by the decedent personal representative on their behalf the decedent surviving spouse,domestic partner,children,and issue of deceased children,or,if there is no surviving issue of the decedent,the persons,including the surviving spouse or domestic partner,who would be entitled to the property of the decedent by intestate succession.because the right to sue for wrongful death damages is strictly a creature of statute and exists only so far and in favor of such persons as the legislature has declared justus atchison cal d,disapproved on another ground in ochoa superior court cal d,standing among multiple claimants is determined by statutory rank 
it was and is undisputed that the nelsons were dwayne parents,and we consider it safe to assume now,more than five years after dwayne death,that no lost child or missing spouse is likely to come forward to assert a claim against the county or anyone else.
we agree with the county that a wrongful death plaintiff must plead and prove standing jolley clemens d,coats d.davis southern arizona lines,d,roddenberry roddenberry th,d,but disagree with the county assertion that the nelsons failed to do so in this nelson uncontradicted testimony constitutes substantial evidence that her adult child had no children.
to avoid this conclusion,the county offers up a series of arguments which we reject seriatim.
first,the county says the nelsons should have sought more they should have hired investigators and searched public records for birth certificates and the like.we disagree.the county offers no authority to support this claim,and we know of none.it would be one thing to require additional proof if a known heir asserted a competing claim,but it is quite another to require the parents of a deceased adult child to disprove an unsubstantiated claim that the decedent might at some time,in some unknown place,have had a child.in short,the mother uncontroverted testimony is sufficient.
second,the county complains that the trial court refused to admit the prison records into evidence.assuming the prison records and the statements reported in those records were admissible under a sufficient number of exceptions to the hearsay rule,the trial court reason for excluding they were untrustworthy because dwayne sometimes said he was single,other times that he was divorced,sometimes that he had no kids,other times that he had one kid,two kids,or three kids,and because dwayne,a drug addict,suffered from the court,had it admitted the documents,would have found them incredible,rejected them on that ground,and resolved the conflict in favor of the nelsons.this is a nonissue.
third,the county complains about the nelsons failure to introduce any evidence of standing to the jury,and simply ignores the fact that it waived its right to a jury determination of the standing issue when it invited the court to treat standing as a preliminary fact to be determined by the court before trial.we summarily reject this argument on the ground that,in law as in life,you ca have your cake and eat it too.
the nelsons established their standing to pursue this action.
the nelsons theory of causation was that dwayne died from positional asphyxia due to the use of the tarp,and their expert,john cooper,testified in support of that theory.the county attacks cooper opinion,contending his purported admissions that other things could have caused dwayne sudden death mean that causation was not proved with sufficient certainty.bromme pavitt th,d the plaintiff in a wrongful death action must prove the defendant conduct was a substantial factor in causing the decedent death jones ortho pharmaceutical d.causation must be proved within a reasonable medical probability.the county is wrong.
cooper,a forensic pathologist who at the time of trial had performed more than autopsies,testified that it was his opinion that dwayne died as a result of positional asphyxia for one thing he is face down in a prone position and,as the videotape made by the deputies shows,his face is against the ground.and at one point one of the officers has a knee on his head so there is probably some small element in this case of actual obstruction of the airways t hat is not the main problem here.the main problem is that the chest has to expand or we ca breathe.and there are several elements of chest expansion.and in this case,there is a big need for breathing because the subject is very agitated,worked up,and he is burning a lot of energy.the we breathe in,the diaphragm moves down to create kind of a vacuum and the air comes into the lungs.but when we are excited and we are working and fighting for air,then we also use what are known as the intercostal muscles which are the muscles between the ribs.so between the diaphragm and the costal muscles,we create this bigger space that air being flow n into and flown out to.
in this kind of mechanical asphyxia,the problem is,first of all,the prone position makes it a little bit difficult,and then you got some degree of weight of the officers with at least one of them kneeling on his chest sic and that compromises the ability of the chest to expand by action of the intercostal muscles.we are also dealing with a fairly large person with quite a bit of contents in his abdominal cavity which tend to,if you are in a prone position,tends to push the diaphragm up and not allow the diaphragm to come down.
being forced down in a prone position pushes all contents up further against the diaphragm.so this is really our main problem,and this is the primary problem in that the chest ca expand diaphragmatically and it ca expand with intercostal muscle action.finally,then we have the hands behind,and then we are bringing the legs up locking and tying them to the hands in this procedure which,by immobilizing the shoulders in this way,it just accentuates these other elements of the chest not being able to expand.and that is why the procedure is so dangerous because it really locks in that fixedness of the chest cavity.and so this is what positional asphyxia is 
cooper testified that dwayne had a mildly enlarged heart,but disagreed with the opinion expressed in the autopsy report that dwayne had died as the result of that coronary anomaly i do think it really played a factor.cooper also testified that dwayne had an artery anomaly,but opined that it did play a factor in causing his death.as cooper put it,we have a known cause of death.it is asphyxia it is the equivalent to having a situation where somebody is being strangled by somebody and then they die,and the autopsy shows they have coronary artery disease and then concluding that they died of coronary artery disease.well,in fact,they were being strangled at the time they died.finally,cooper testified that dwayne was intoxicated by cocaine at the time of his arrest,but opined that the cocaine did not contribute to the cause of death.
in short,it was cooper opinion that,had dwayne not been subjected to the tarp procedure,he would not have died on the day of his arrest,and the fact that cooper rejected the county claims of enlarged heart,the artery anomaly,and the not render cooper expert medical opinion unreasonable.roddenberry roddenberry,supra,th at,d.no more was required to prove causation.leslie perry associates th,d.
in a related argument,the county contends cooper was not competent to give his opinion about the cause of death because he was not present at the autopsy,and because he did not base his opinion on reliable evidence.we disagree.cooper based his opinion on the videotape of dwayne death,the coroner autopsy reports and photographs,the report of another pathologist who performed a examination of dwayne at the nelsons request,dwayne records from the department of corrections,and the deposition testimony given by several of the deputies.no more was required.
in related arguments,the county contends the damage award is not supported by substantial evidence,is excessive as a matter of law,includes a type of damages not permitted in a wrongful death action,and resulted from jury misconduct.we agree that the amount of damages is not supported by substantial evidence,and therefore do not reach the jury misconduct issue.rufo simpson th,d the contention that the evidence does not support the award of damages in a wrongful death action is reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.
a plaintiff in a wrongful death action is entitled to recover damages for his own pecuniary loss,which may include the loss of the decedent financial support,services,training and advice,and the pecuniary value of the decedent society and he may not recover for such things as the grief or sorrow attendant upon the death of a loved one,or for his sad emotions,or for the sentimental value of the loss.overly ingalls shipbuilding,th,d ure maggio,d,krouse graham cal d.
the evidence establishes these facts dwayne was born in,in chicago.in,when dwayne was about years old,and nelson separated.in,nelson and dwayne moved to tennessee.when he was,dwayne left nelson home and ended up in california.it is undisputed that dwayne did not see either of his parents at any time during the years preceding his death.indeed,at the time of dwayne death in,neither nor nelson knew his address or telephone number.they did not know he had been incarcerated for substantial periods of time,did not know about his medical problems,did not know about his drug addiction,could not name any of his friends,and did not receive any financial support from him.
charitably put,dwayne future financial prospects at the time of his death were limited.he was recently paroled he had been in and out of prison several times during the preceding years and addicted to cocaine,and was sufficiently deranged to stand in the middle of a busy intersection,shooting a loaded gun into the air and at passing motorists.had he survived the arrest,it is more probable than not that as an expert testified at trial he would have been convicted of several felonies and sentenced to state prison for up to years there was no evidence to the contrary.
the most that and nelson could say is that they occasionally spoke to dwayne by phone,and each offered about a cards they had received from their son over a period of several years.most of nelson testimony focuses on the understandable but noncompensable emotional distress she suffered as a result of dwayne death,and nelson did not appear at trial his deposition testimony was read to the jury,and he too described his emotional distress.
we do not doubt the parents expressions of love,but we are unable to say that a rational person would value their lost comfort,society,and companionship at million.the inescapable conclusion is that the jury included in its calculations some measure of damages for the parents emotional distress,or some amount intended to punish the county for its conduct.in either event,the damage award simply can not stand.krouse graham,supra,cal d at,the cases uniformly have held that a wrongful death recovery may not include such elements as the grief or sorrow attendant upon the death of a loved one,or compensation for sad emotions and injured feelings,or the sentimental value of the loss don cruz d.a damage award is not supported by substantial evidence if it is so grossly disproportionate as to raise a presumption that it is the result of passion or prejudice fields riley d.defense verdict explained on theory that jury apparently concluded that the suffered no pecuniary loss,nor did he suffer a loss of the child comfort and society through his death because father and son lived in different states,and saw each other but seldom ford motor superior court d.it has long been established in california that punitive damages may not be recovered in a wrongful death action.
for these reasons,the damage award must be reversed.
