background 
factual background 
berkla is a visual artist from chico,california,who,in,started a small company,digarts software digarts,to design illustration tools.berkla created image file databases,or nozzles,that contained images of plants and natural objects that were sprayed like paint out of an image hose tool to design realistic illustrations of trees and foliage.he released a variety of nozzle products under the names garden hose and tubular text.these nozzle products were not,by themselves,functional,but rather were designed to be used in connection with an image hose tool to create natural looking gardens and landscapes.
fractal design corporation fractal is a computer software company that by had developed an image hose tool called painter that enabled users to create graphics by spraying images.in and,berkla entered into two separate licensing agreements with fractal that granted fractal the right to distribute berkla garden hose and garden hose as stand alone to fractal painter program.these agreements were concluded after berkla threatened fractal with litigation for including his protected ideas and designs in fractal painter product in violation of the parties nda.steve guttman,fractal vice president of marketing,stated that the garden hose product was fractal ever.
in,corel released photo paint,a program within the coreldraw suite,which contained an image hose tool similar to fractal painter.photo paint was comprised of approximately ten nozzles that included images of foliage.on march,berkla,who had initiated a business relationship with corel as an independent solutions partner,sent an email to doug chomyn,corel product manager for photo paint 
i produce small,successful,products for fractal design.the products support painter image hose technology and go by the name garden hose.i like to support photopaint image sprayer as well.before i can do that,however,i need to know what level of developer support corel offers small independents such a sic digarts if you have any questions or wish to talk with me,please feel free to contact me if you unfamiliar with the garden hose,you can view samples at.
chomyn replied to berkla email on april,
thanks for the message,but it is not clear as to the nature of your products,or how they would relate to our image sprayer tool our image sprayer tool implementation and capability is quite different from that of the image hose tool in fractal design painter.could you give me some idea as to what you are looking for with respect to developer support we do not offer any developer support per se,although we do sometimes contract work to developers,and sometimes purchase the rights to products.
please more information 
berkla responded to chomyn with several technical questions about photo paint.he then stated as for developer support in a financial sense,i not asking for money.i happy to take a look at manufacturing as a third party developer though i likely need some tangible form of marketing support.if your sic interested in purchasing rights,we can talk about that too.on april,chomyn emailed berkla the answers to his questions.he concluded by telling berkla i f you selling files to be used as image lists nozzles,i like to evaluate what you have to offer.if you be willing to send me copies for evaluation purposes,i happily oblige you with an evaluation copy of plus.berkla responded the next day that chomyn had answered most of his questions and encouraged chomyn to visit berkla website.
chomyn responded on april if you interested in selling nozzle files to corel,it would be good to get a graphical catalog copies of what you have to offer berkla emailed chomyn two days later that he would send him a cd with the relevant nozzle files if you still interested after working with the files,we can discuss licensing terms.after chomyn requested that berkla send the nozzle files in a universal format,berkla sent the following email on april 
i like to send you some of the new stuff since that what the product will contain.however,i not comfortable doing that without an nda.
if you have a problem with nda sic,i can simply send you the,garden hose cd since that grants you and sic license.unfortunately,it a smaller,older product than the one i have in mind and does contain the new files,which comprise over of the content.
you can access some new,demo smaller nozzles via my web site.the license will adequately cover my property rights.
chomyn replied two days later i be happy to sign your nda on behalf of corel.this is quite common i often in the position of evaluating new stuff under these circumstances.
chomyn executed the nda and faxed it to berkla on april.the nda contained the following nondisclosure provision 
recipient agrees that neither recipient nor any of its employees or agents shall disclose or use except for the purpose of providing the services or products that recipient has agreed with the company to provide or other purposes expressly agreed to in writing between the company and recipient any confidential information.recipient shall not communicate or disclose confidential information to any third party.internal access shall be limited on a need to know basis for the purpose of providing the services or products that the recipient has agreed with the company that it will provide.recipient shall neither use confidential information nor circulate it within its own organization except for the foregoing purposes.recipient will maintain a list of recipient personnel permitted access to the confidential information and will,upon request,provide the company with a copy of the list 
the nda also provided that i n any action relating to this agreement,the party,shall pay the expenses including without limitation reasonable attorneys fees of the prevailing party.
in,after the nda was signed,berkla submitted a beta cd of his garden hose images to chomyn for evaluation.berkla original cd,which bore the inscription digarts image lists for review dennis berkla,was copied by corel.twelve corel employees had access to the cd or may have viewed some images contained therein.katie gray,corel digital content manager at the time,gave berkla cd to dan dudley,the head of corel content development group.gray testified to having the following conversation with dudley i said to dan,these images were very good quality.and we are interested in licensing them perhaps.can you guys meet this quality and do us some more of these soon thereafter,berkla was informed by gray that corel would not license berkla image file databases.corel was unable to locate berkla original beta cd and therefore never returned it to him.
in october,corel sent of its beta testers a beta cd of its version of coreldraw paint,which contained exact duplicates of of berkla garden hose nozzles.the duplicates were not identified as berkla product.berkla began to suspect that corel had copied his images during a conversation with david huss,a corel tester who informed berkla that corel had designed eucalyptus files that would paint remarkably realistic trees.berkla,suspicious that the images huss referred to were his own,forwarded huss a copy of his eucalyptus files.huss subsequently informed chomyn that he thought some of the images on the beta version of coreldraw were not corel product.corel removed all exact duplicates of berkla image files before the final version of coreldraw was released in november.
on november,berkla faxed a letter to michael cowpland,president of corel,in which he expressed concern about the use of his ideas and techniques in developing coreldraw.given the existence of the nda and the absence of any licensing agreement,berkla informed cowpland that any use of my proprietary ideas,designs,or techniques is inappropriate.berkla,however,left open the possibility of further negotiations though i remain ready and willing to negotiate a licensing agreement for my product,that agreement must be reached prior to the commercial release of your competing product.
cindy mcgann,corel corporate counsel,responded to berkla by letter,asserting that w hile corel image list files include files that represent elements from nature which are similar in content only to your files,we can not agree that in the creation of our files,we used your ideas techniques.mcgann went on to state though the imaginative use of image list files with our image sprayer tool can result in the creation of landscape or style imagery similar to that which could be created through the use of your files,this similarity in end result is due to the inherent nature of the technology that corel used to develop our image list files.it is not due to any misappropriation by corel of your ideas,designs or techniques.
procedural background 
berkla commenced this action on june,alleging claims for copyright infringement,breach of the nda,unfair competition,and breach of confidence.he did not specifically request punitive damages.
on june,berkla offered to settle his claims against corel for million corel responded with a counteroffer of.after a settlement conference,corel increased its offer to.berkla declined this offer because corel refused to cast it as an offer of judgment under federal rule of civil procedure 
on september,the district court granted summary judgment in corel favor on berkla copyright claims,with the exception of the claim pertaining to corel dissemination of berkla image files to corel beta testers.with respect to berkla state law claims,the district court denied corel summary judgment motion to the extent that the claims predated the public dissemination of berkla image files in version of garden hose in.
after trial commenced,the district court denied berkla request to include punitive damages in the pretrial order,ruling that because berkla breach of confidence claim was substantively identical to his breach of contract claim,punitive damages were unavailable the district court,however,permitted punitive damages to be presented to the jury on an advisory basis in order to avoid the need for a new,separate trial,if its decision were reversed on appeal.
the jury found that corel breached the nda with berkla corel breached confidence with berkla and corel acted with fraud,oppression,or malice with respect to the breach of confidence claim during the damages phase,the jury awarded berkla in compensatory damages for the improper use of confidential information and in punitive damages.berkla was also awarded one dollar in nominal damages for other breaches of the nda.judgment was entered on the verdict after striking the award of punitive damages.
berkla and corel each filed motions for attorney fees,as well as their respective costs bills.the district court denied both sides motions for attorney fees and costs.

punitive damages 
california law provides for punitive damages in specified actions 
in an action for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract,where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression,fraud,or malice,the plaintiff,in addition to the actual damages,may recover damages for the sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant.
cal.a.thus,punitive damages,which are designed to punish and deter wrongful conduct,are not available in breach of contract actions.applied equip.litton saudi arabia,cal th,d.
california courts specifically recognize the tort of breach of confidence.faris enberg,d.this tort is based upon the concept of an implied obligation or contract between the parties that confidential information will not be disclosed.enter.research group,genesis creative group,cir construing california law see also eng rs,pac,d.to prevail on a claim for breach of confidence under california law,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the plaintiff conveyed confidential and novel information to the defendant the defendant had knowledge that the information was being disclosed in confidence there was an understanding between the defendant and the plaintiff that the confidence be maintained and there was a disclosure or use in violation of the understanding.enter.research group,at.
in his breach of confidence claim,berkla alleged that corel had violated the parties understanding to maintain in confidence the contents of berkla beta cd by misappropriating the images and nozzles on the cd,disclosing the contents of the cd to individuals who did not have a bona fide reason for access,and otherwise unlawfully disclosing and utilizing the contents of the cd.in finding corel liable for breach of confidence,the jury found that corel acted with fraud,oppression or malice and awarded punitive damages of.nonetheless,in accordance with its earlier ruling,the district court struck the punitive damages award,holding that berkla claim for breach of confidence was indistinguishable from his breach of contract claim and therefore provided no basis for a recovery of punitive damages.the district court rested its denial of punitive damages on california case law denying tort remedies on claims that are intimately related to underlying contracts.
the issue tendered for decision is whether,under california law,breach of confidence is a true tort that affords traditional tort remedies or is instead akin to a contract action that precludes punitive damages.the district court position finds support in california cases that have taken an increasingly narrow view of a plaintiff right to recover tort damages for a claim that arises from the breach of an underlying contract.see erlich menezes,cal th,d,freeman mills,belcher oil,cal th,d,foley interactive data,cal d.there is also support,however,for berkla position that the tort of breach of confidence creates an independent obligation that is separate and distinct from any contractual duty and therefore permits the recovery of punitive damages.see fink,d.
we are not required,however,definitively to resolve the underlying issue because berkla punitive damages claim fails irrespective of whether the breach of confidence is characterized as a contract or tort claim.obviously,if the district court is correct that breach of confidence is substantively equivalent to a contract claim for the purposes of determining remedies,then berkla is not entitled to punitive damages.see cal.a.
alternatively,even if punitive damages are theoretically available for breach of confidence claims,berkla would nevertheless be precluded from collecting them here.that is so because the tort of breach of confidence is grounded on an or theory see fink.at,that is coterminous with his claim for express breach of contract under the nda.california courts have made clear that these two causes of action are mutually exclusive there can not be a valid,express contract and an implied contract,each embracing the same subject matter,existing at the same time.hill,d,accord hedging concepts,first alliance mortgage,th,d.we therefore conclude that it would be inconsistent to allow concurrent recovery in express contract and breach of confidence,especially since the latter is designed to protect confidential ideas where no express agreement exists.as berkla recovered on his nda claim,tort remedies under his breach of confidence claim are unavailable.accordingly,we conclude that the district court did not err in its decision to strike punitive damages 
berkla motion for attorney fees and costs 
attorney fees 
after trial,berkla moved for attorney fees in the amount of under the attorney fees provision of the nda.the district court denied berkla request for attorney fees,finding that he was not the prevailing party on either his contract or tort claims and therefore was not entitled to attorney fees under state law berkla contends that the district court applied the wrong statute in rejecting his request.
california permits parties to allocate attorney fees by contract.see except as attorney fees are specifically provided for by statute,the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement,express or implied,of the parties.this ability to contract out of the american rule,under which each party pays its own attorney fees,is circumscribed,however,by california civil code,which was enacted to limit the ability of a dominant contracting party to provide for a right to attorney fees on only one side of an agreement.sears baccaglio,th,d.that statute provides 
in any action on a contract,where the contract specifically provides that attorney fees and costs,which are incurred to enforce that contract,shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party,then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract,whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not,shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs.
cal.a.section further provides that the court shall determine who is the party prevailing on the contract.id.at b.t he party prevailing on the contract shall be the party who recovered a greater relief in the action on the contract.the court may also determine that there is no party prevailing on the contract for purposes of this section.id.
california also allows attorney fees authorized by contract,statute,or law to be recovered as costs.a.attorney fees awarded under are specifically included under the statutory definition of costs.id.at c.the statute relating to the recovery of costs provides the following definition of prevailing party for the purposes of determining costs awards 
prevailing party includes the party with a net monetary recovery,a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered,a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief,and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.when any party recovers other than monetary relief and in situations other than as specified,the prevailing party shall be as determined by the court,and under those circumstances,the court,in its discretion,may allow costs or not and,if allowed may apportion costs between the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted under section.
with respect to berkla contract claim,the district court found that berkla was not a prevailing party entitled to attorney fees under,emphasizing that berkla net recovery was less than of what he affirmatively sought before the jury at trial the district court similarly found that berkla was not a prevailing party on his tort claim under,despite the fact that berkla won a net monetary recovery.the district court concluded that,like,conferred discretion to award fees and that i t would be perverse to find that california law permits differing attorneys fees recovery standards under a contractual provision simply because an underlying,substantively identical claim might be denominated in contract or tort.
berkla contends that the district court erred in analyzing his claim under and that he should have been awarded fees under the mandatory provision of.we reject this argument.as we have already determined that berkla is precluded from recovering in tort,attorney fees would be available,if at all,only on the basis of his breach of contract claim.section applies to berkla request for attorney fees on his contract claim.see santisas goodin,cal th,d.
the standard for evaluating prevailing party status under was set forth in hsu abbara,cal th,d.in that case,the california supreme court held that 
in deciding whether there is a party prevailing on the contract,the trial court is to compare the relief awarded on the contract claim or claims with the parties demands on those same claims and their litigation objectives as disclosed by the pleadings,trial briefs,opening statements,and similar sources.the prevailing party determination is to be made only upon final resolution of the contract claims and only by a comparison of the extent to which each party ha s succeeded and failed to succeed in its contentions.
id.at citation omitted accord scott blount,cal th,d.while a plaintiff who obtains all relief requested on the only contract claim in the action must be regarded as the party prevailing on the contract for purposes of attorney fees under section,hsu,d at,a court could also determine that a party is not prevailing when it receives only a part of the relief sought,id.internal quotation and citation omitted.the court emphasized that in determining litigation success,courts should respect substance rather than form,and to this extent should be guided by,equitable considerations.id.at.
under this standard,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying berkla attorney fees.berkla recovered only in compensatory damages for breach of the nda,although he sought more than million.although berkla suggests that he obtained an unqualified win on his contract claim,it is clear from hsu that a court is entitled to look at more than the issue of liability in determining prevailing party status,and to evaluate litigation success in light of the party overall demands and objectives.in this case,these demands and objectives clearly involved a substantial financial payoff for berkla.the jury,however,completely rejected berkla contractual damages theory,instead awarding damages consistent with the estimates offered by corel expert.given the equitable considerations that animate prevailing party status under and the deference owed to the district court,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying berkla attorney fees request.
despite finding that berkla was the prevailing party under federal standards for determining eligibility for costs the district court denied berkla motion for costs on two grounds berkla did not win an amount exceeding,the statutory minimum for diversity jurisdiction and berkla unnecessarily extended the litigation by rejecting corel offers to settle the case for an amount far in excess of what berkla eventually recovered.
federal rule of civil procedure d provides generally that costs other than attorneys fees shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs.although the rule creates a presumption in favor of awarding costs to a prevailing party,it also vests discretion in the district court to refuse to do so.ass of educators california,cir en banc.in exercising that discretion,a district court must specify reasons for its refusal to award costs.id.berkla argues that both of the district court articulated reasons are insufficient to justify deviation from the presumptive award of costs to prevailing parties.
we agree with berkla that the district court erred in resting its denial of costs on his failure to recover the jurisdictional amount under the diversity statute.under b,if a plaintiff recovers less than,the district court may deny costs to the plaintiff and,in addition,may impose costs on the plaintiff.the district court relied on perlman zell,cir,to support its conclusion that it had discretion under b to deny costs with respect to berkla state law claims.
because subject matter jurisdiction here is not founded on diversity of citizenship,but on federal question and supplemental jurisdiction perlman simply does not apply.in perlman,although the plaintiffs pleaded a federal claim rico,that claim was dismissed on the merits.see at so perlman is a loser on the question whether this was a federal case.here,berkla partially prevailed on his federal claim.
the court specifically stated in perlman that b stands for the general principle that if the outcome shows that the case did not belong in federal court,then costs may be denied id.at.but here,there is no question that this case did belong in federal court.berkla copyright claims clearly came under the court federal question jurisdiction.although berkla most significant copyright claims were dismissed on summary judgment,he was victorious on his claim,ultimately winning a stipulated judgment of.although this amount may have been minimal in comparison to the large sum berkla was seeking,nonetheless,it did not eliminate the basis for federal jurisdiction,making the district court application of the b standard inappropriate.moreover,berkla was compelled to bring all of his claims in federal court,short of splitting his claims,because federal court jurisdiction over copyright claims is exclusive of the courts of the states.a emphasis added.
we further conclude that the district court erred in denying berkla costs on the ground that he failed to accept corel settlement offer.the issue is whether it was a proper exercise of the district court discretion to deny costs,even though corel offer did not comply with federal rule of civil procedure.rule provides 
at any time more than days before the trial begins,a party defending against a claim may serve upon the adverse party an offer to allow judgment to be taken against the defending party for the money or property or to the effect specified in the offer,with costs then accrued.
when a rule offer of judgment is made and rejected,and the judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not more favorable than the offer,the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer.fed.civ.proc.berkla contends that he can not be deprived of his costs without having received a rule offer of judgment.we agree.
although no ninth circuit case speaks directly to this issue,other circuits have adopted berkla position in the analogous situation of determining attorney fees awards after rejected settlement offers.see clark sims,cir because the district court limited appellants recovery of attorney fees based on a settlement offer which failed to meet the requirements of rule,its decision must be vacated and this case remanded so that the court may reconsider the amount properly awardable.ortiz regan,cir finding that,where the defendant could have made a formal offer of judgment pursuant to rule,but chose not to use this procedure,the plaintiff rejection of a settlement offer should not operate to reduce an otherwise appropriate fee award cooper utah,cir reversing district court reduction of attorney fees based on settlement negotiations where the defendants had not availed themselves of an offer of judgment pursuant to rule.corel cites meister regents of the,th,d,which rejects these cases in determining that california law does not prevent a trial court from considering a settlement offer in determining the amount of a reasonable attorney fee award.meister,however,is a state law case and does not control the issue here.we agree with the reasoning of our sister circuits that,absent a rule offer of judgment,a plaintiff failure to accept a settlement offer that turns out to be less than the amount recovered at trial is not a legitimate basis for denying an award of costs.to hold otherwise would render rule largely meaningless.it was therefore error for the district court to deny berkla costs based on corel settlement offer.accordingly,on remand,the district court should award to berkla his properly taxable costs.
corel motion for attorney fees 
on its,corel contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying its request for attorney fees on berkla copyright claim.the copyright act provides 
in any civil action under the copyright act,the court in its discretion may allow the recovery of full costs by or against any party other than the united states or an officer thereof.except as otherwise provided by this title,the court may also award a reasonable attorney fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs.
the supreme court has adopted the evenhanded approach to the award of attorney fees in copyright cases.fogerty fantasy,d prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants are to be treated alike,but attorney fees are to be awarded to prevailing parties only as a matter of the court discretion.in exercising this discretion,the court noted that courts may be guided by the factors articulated by the third circuit in lieb topstone,cir,which include frivolousness,motivation,objective unreasonableness and the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence.fogerty,at.quoting lieb.this court has held that while courts may take the lieb factors into account,they are.even so,courts may not rely on the lieb factors if they are not faithful to the purposes of the copyright act.faithfulness to the purposes of the copyright act is,therefore,the pivotal criterion.fantasy,fogerty,cir.
corel argues that its successful defense of berkla infringement claims on the ground that berkla images contained no protectable expression furthered a primary objective of the copyright promote the progress of science and useful arts by encourag ing others to build freely upon the ideas and information conveyed by a work.feist publ ns,rural.serv,d.it contends that its defense of this suit fostered the important concept of distinguishing unprotectable ideas from protectable expression.
we find this argument unpersuasive and agree with the district court that corel behavior in this case did not advance the purposes of the copyright act.in denying fees,the district court found that corel use of berkla nozzles to model its own photo paint images,while not technically violating the virtual identity standard of copyright infringement,nevertheless constituted a highly questionable business practice.the district court emphasized 
most important is the fact that the jury found corel had acted improperly in utilizing berkla databases for modeling of its own.while the jury finding of maliciousness or oppressiveness or fraud on the part of corel in breaching berkla confidence could be questioned,corel has chosen not to contest these findings in motions.the jury unaltered liability verdict speaks loudly in proclaiming that corel should not be rewarded for prevailing on a finding regarding copyright standard of proof in light of the found misdeeds on related issues.
it would be inconsistent with the copyright act purposes to endorse corel improper appropriation of berkla product by awarding fees 
moreover,the decision to award attorney fees to prevailing defendants remains within the court sound discretion.fogerty,at.an evaluation of the lieb factors demonstrates that there is no reason to conclude that the district court abused its discretion.with respect to the frivolousness factor,corel argues that berkla position was frivolous since he never presented any evidence that corel had access to his tubular text images.although this might be true,the tubular text databases were only one aspect of berkla copyright claims and there is no reason to conclude that the district court abused its discretion in ruling that berkla infringement claims regarding his garden hose images were nonfrivolous.further,an analysis of the district court decision clearly shows that frivolousness was appropriately treated as one among many considerations in denying fees.
the lieb court also mentioned objective unreasonableness as a factor to consider in awarding fees.corel contends that berkla was objectively unreasonable in pursuing his copyright claim for several reasons corel offered berkla to resolve the claims four months prior to trial there was no evidence that corel had access to berkla tubular text images the law of virtual identity was and corel stipulated to liability with respect to the release of images to beta testers.these reasons,however,do not justify overturning the district court.the rejected settlement offer related to the state law issues,as well as the copyright claim,and therefore should not be dispositive of the fees question.moreover,berkla presented a valid copyright claim related to his garden hose images.he lost on summary judgment,but that does not mean that his claim was objectively fact,the district court conceded that berkla work contained protectable expression and that,although not virtually identical,corel photo paint images were substantially similar to berkla.finally,the fact that berkla persisted in his claims despite corel liability stipulation on the copyright claim does not show objective unreasonableness,given that berkla was pursuing state law claims as well and corel did not concede liability or damages on the claim until fairly late in the proceedings 
finally,corel argues that fees are appropriate punishment for berkla under the lieb factors related to motivation and deterrence,suggesting that berkla,who had a history of litigiousness,was motivated by a desire to extract a licensing agreement from corel.the sanction of attorney fees,corel contends,would deter berkla irresponsible behavior in the future.the district court did not,however,abuse its discretion in finding that berkla prior entanglement with fractal did not warrant attorney fees for corel in this case.as the district court noted,berkla did not initiate any action against corel until he was told that corel had utilized his databases in its product.thus,corel was not a blameless victim in this admittedly illegal behavior prompted berkla complaint.corel attempt to paint berkla as a litigious schemer who set up corel obscures corel underlying wrongful conduct and is insufficient to warrant overturning the district court denial of fees.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying corel attorney fees on the copyright claim.
iv.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,in,the judgment is affirmed.in,the order denying attorney fees is affirmed.in,the order is affirmed as to attorney fees and reversed as to costs and remanded.each party shall bear his or its own costs on appeal.
affirmed,except as to costs,and remanded.
i concur in the majority opinion on all issues,save one.i respectfully dissent from the holding that the district court erred when it denied an award of costs to berkla because corel failed to make an offer of judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.the majority adopts an inflexible rule that it is always error to deny costs on the basis that a prevailing party ignored an offer to settle and thereby prolonged litigation,unless the defending party offer to settle was made pursuant to rule.
the majority begins its analysis with the observation that federal rule of civil procedure d provides for an award of costs to a prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs.to be more precise,it is rule d addressing costs other than attorneys fees that is pertinent to the disputed issue the majority then reasons that because corel did not make an offer of judgment pursuant to rule,the district court could not rely on the fact that berkla ultimately recovered far less than corel had informally offered in deciding to deny costs to berkla.
there are several problems with the majority approach.first,by failing to take into account the differences between rule d and rule,the majority conflates the two rules and substitutes the simple comparative analysis and mandatory outcome dictated by rule for the exercise of discretion authorized by rule d.no wonder the majority opines that to hold otherwise than it does would render rule largely meaningless.second,the offer actually made by corel could not reasonably have been made in the form of a rule offer.third,rule d gives trial courts discretion to deny costs and logic compels the conclusion that needlessly prolonging litigation is one of the reasons that would support a decision to deny costs.rule d.fourth,there is no authority in this circuit to support the inflexible rule adopted by the majority,and the cases relied upon from other circuits do not provide well reasoned support for the rule adopted by the majority.
rule provides that a defending party may offer to allow the party prosecuting a claim to have judgment against the defending party for the money or property or to the effect specified in the offer.if the offer is not accepted,its cost shifting efficacy is then determined by a comparison of the judgment resulting from the trial with the offer.rule authorizes more relief than rule d.it authorizes shifting costs,not merely the denial of costs to one party.there is another significant difference between the two rules.the cost shifting feature of rule is mandatory when the judgment obtained is less favorable than the offer,the offeree must pay the costs.in contrast,rule d operates through the well informed discretion of the trial court.clearly,the trial court was attempting to exercise the discretion afforded by rule d,not attempting to apply rule.nevertheless,the majority reverses his decision,because no rule offer was made.
the offer of compromise actually made by corel was made orally at a settlement conference and then memorialized in a july,letter from corel lawyer to berkla lawyer which reads in pertinent part 
this letter is to confirm the settlement offer made by corel at the conclusion of the settlement conference on tuesday,july.as communicated to you by judge hollows,corel is willing to settle this case for four hundred thousand dollars in exchange for a general release of any and all claims against corel and any affiliated or subsidiary companies,relating to any graphical content contained within any version of coreldraw or corel photopaint,as well as all future versions of these products.the terms of the settlement would also include dismissal with prejudice of the current lawsuit,a grant by berkla to corel of a perpetual license for any nozzle images berkla sic contends or could have contended were infringed by corel,and berkla covenant not to sue corel in the future for any claims of misappropriation or infringement of his garden hose,tubular text or tubular neon nozzle images.the payment would be in satisfaction of all claims,damages,costs,expenses,interest and attorneys fees sought in your action 
the offer sets out terms that go beyond those that would be included in a judgment against corel for.most notably,the offer is contingent on a perpetual license for berkla nozzle images.this would render it very difficult to perform the simple direct comparison of offer with result upon which the mandatory cost shifting feature of rule turns.in short,the offer made could not reasonably have been made pursuant to rule.thus,the rule adopted by the majority has the perverse effect of reducing the incentive to make offers of compromise that can not be molded into a rule form by eliminating any role they might play in the application of rule d.
in association of educators state of california,cir,the en banc court made it clear that there are many reasons why costs might be denied to a prevailing party pursuant to rule d in addition to punishing the prevailing party for some form of misconduct.however,the en banc court left in place the notion that one reason for denying costs is to punish inappropriate behav
