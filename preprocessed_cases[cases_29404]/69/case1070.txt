kansas city power light company kcplc appeals the jury verdict entered in favor of norman ross in this employment discrimination claim.we affirm in part,and reverse in part.
background 
ross,a black male,began working for kcplc in as a plant helper,and became a meter reader in.ross worked in that capacity for eighteen years.in,ross obtained a bachelor degree in systems management from rockhurst college.after receiving his degree,he also took additional computer classes from a community college.in,he was temporarily promoted to the cis plus project which involved testing kcplc software.in june he became a computer applications coordinator,and at the time of trial,he had been recently promoted to a programmer analyst.
at kcplc,employees could apply for a promotion through either the position opportunity program pop or the union bidding procedure,depending on the type of job.the pop was designed to allow workers to apply for job openings within kcplc.under the pop,once an employee applies for a position,the application is reviewed by the human resources department to determine if an applicant meets the minimum qualifications for the position.if the minimum qualifications are met,the application is passed along for the interview process.application for a union position was governed by the union bidding procedure as set forth in the collective bargaining agreement between kcplc and the electrical workers union,the details of which are immaterial to our discussion of this case.
although ross applied for several promotions prior to bringing this action in the only two positions relevant to our discussion are the service coordinator position,and the business systems analyst position.in june,ross applied for the service coordinator position,which was a posted union position.a service coordinator acts as kcplc project manager for new installations or for modification of electrical service.the bid notice set forth the minimum job qualifications and required applicants to forward proof of completion of relevant courses or equivalent experience with their bids.ross did not receive this position,ostensibly because he did not have the minimum educational qualifications two practical electricity courses for the position.instead,mary follin and russell wiley were selected as service coordinators.follin had only taken one of the required practical electricity courses but instead was allowed to substitute equivalent classes to satisfy this requirement.
in december,ross applied for a business systems analyst position,posted through the pop program.the duties of this position included performing systems analysis design and testing,providing user training and support,and maintaining business systems databases.ross application was passed along by the human resources department for an interview with ken geier,the for this position.ross testified on that after the interview,he sent geier an email to clarify that the extent of his programming experience was on the educational side and not the applied side.geier ultimately selected glenda schnetzer for this position,apparently because of her superior qualifications.
in june,ross filed this action,alleging racial harassment,failure to promote,and retaliation.the district court granted summary judgment with respect to the harassment and retaliation claims,and left the failure to promote claims for the jury.at trial,the district court denied kcplc motion for judgment as a matter of law jaml and submitted five promotion records administrator,computer applications coordinator,programmer analyst,service coordinator and business systems the jury.the jury returned verdicts in favor of kcplc on the first three positions and for ross on the remaining two.the jury awarded ross in actual damages and in punitive damages for the service coordinator position,and in actual damages and in punitive damages for the business systems analyst position.following motions,the district court reduced the punitive damages awards to and respectively,and set attorney fees and costs.
on appeal,kcplc argues that jaml should have been granted prior to jury submission because ross was not as qualified as the successful applicants for the positions in question.ross cross appeals,arguing for reinstatement of the punitive damages award or the choice of a new trial on damages.ross also appeals the amount of the district court award of attorney fees and costs.finally,ross conditionally appeals the district court grant of partial summary judgment,to be considered only if we reverse any part of the favorable jury verdict.
ii.discussion 
this court reviews the denial of a jaml de novo.feltmann sieben,cir.we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the and give him the benefit of all reasonable inferences.id.in an employment discrimination case,a court must render jaml when there is no legally sufficient basis for a rational factfinder to conclude the employer intentionally discriminated.reeves sanderson plumbing,d.
because there was no direct evidence of discrimination here,we apply the burden shifting analysis set forth in mcdonnell douglas green,d.yates rexton,cir there is direct evidence of discrimination only when there is specific link between challenged employment action and the alleged animus.to raise a presumption of discrimination in this case,ross must show that he is a member of a protected group he was qualified and applied for an available position he was rejected and employees similarly situated but not part of the protected group were promoted instead.shannon ford motor,cir.once ross establishes the prima facie case,the burden of production shifts to kcplc,who must rebut the presumption of discrimination with evidence of a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for ross rejection.texas dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d.if kcplc meets that burden,ross may win by proffering evidence that kcplc reason was a pretext for intentional discrimination.shannon,at.
service coordinator position 
kcplc argues the district court erred in refusing to grant jaml on the service coordinator position.kcplc argues that ross was not qualified for this position because he had not completed course work in practical electricity i and ii.the district court found,and we agree,there was evidence in the record that qualifications for jobs were occasionally waived if an applicant had satisfied the requirement through other course work or experience.at trial,counsel elicited testimony from ross to the effect that his course work and experience were similar enough to practical electricity i and ii to satisfy this prerequisite.further,there was also evidence that kcplc had accepted a successful applicant college physics course as a substitute for practical electricity ii,even though there was no evidence that this physics class had electrical instruction.
thus,ross established his prima facie case for this claim and the burden shifted to kcplc to produce a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for not promoting him.kcplc stated reason was that ross did not supplement his application for the position with proof of equivalent coursework in lieu of the practical electricity requirements.while this is true,ross also submitted evidence that the human relations department occasionally contacted applicants who appeared to be lacking a prerequisite to determine whether they had educational or practical experience that might satisfy the missing requirement.ross,however,was not contacted and given this opportunity to supplement his application.the jury obviously believed ross evidence of pretext,as it was entitled to.we therefore affirm the jury verdict on this claim.
business systems analyst position 
we reverse the jury verdict in favor of ross on this claim and direct the district court to enter jaml in favor of kcplc for the business analyst position.while ross again met his prima facie case,kcplc countered with evidence that the candidate it selected,schnetzer,was more qualified.ross claims that evidence of his qualifications,schnetzer qualifications and the atmosphere of discrimination were all permissible factors allowing the jury to conclude that the employer reason was pretextual.we disagree.
in addition to the minimum educational requirements,the business systems analyst position had the following posted special requirements working knowledge of cis plus system and kcplc business in customer services.the evidence showed that the hr department did pass along ross pop application,indicating that he met the bare minimum educational requirements for the job and he was eligible for an interview.however,ross own testimony indicates that the eventually successful candidate was more qualified.as earlier indicated,ross admitted that he sent the for this position,ken geier,an email to the effect that the extent of his programming experience for this position was on the educational side and not the applied side.geier determined that schnetzer had experience with kcplc cis computer system and more than seven years of customer service experience.ross had experience in neither of those areas.geier also scored each candidate based on several criterion for the job,which included education and experience in several different areas.out of a possible total score of,schnetzer scored,while ross scored.
these amount to legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for selecting schnetzer for the promotion instead of ross,and no reasonable jury could conclude otherwise.reeves,at.jaml appropriate where parties have been fully heard and there is no legally sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to find for the party on that issue.in the usual course of events,an employer will hire the most qualified candidate,and an employer,not a federal court,is in the best position to i dentify those strengths that constitute the best qualified applicant.duffy wolle,cir.we have oft repeated the maxim that the federal courts do not sit as departments assessing the business judgments made by employers,wilking county of ramsey,cir.instead,the courts address t he ultimate question in every employment discrimination case involving a claim of disparate treatment,which is whether the plaintiff was the victim of intentional discrimination.evers alliant techsystems,cir quoting reeves,at.
an employer is properly entitled to judgment as a matter of law if the record conclusively reveal s some other,nondiscriminatory reason for the employer decision.cha henderson,cir quoting reeves,at.here the record conclusively reveals that schnetzer unique skills for this particular position were superior to ross.as noted,schnetzer had seven years of customer service experience and experience in using the company cis computer system,both of which were special requirements of this position.furthermore,schnetzer scored considerably higher than ross on geier evaluation scale.these are adequate,and in fact,quite understandable,nondiscriminatory reasons for kcplc decision to promote schnetzer instead of ross.see,gentry,cir no evidence of discrimination in the promotion selection process where successful candidate graded higher on scored interview process.accordingly,kcplc is entitled to judgment as a matter of law for the business systems analyst position.
ross cross appeals the remittitur of the punitive damages award,the district court grant of partial summary judgment,and the amount of the district court award of attorney fees and costs.we review de novo the district court determination of the constitutionality of punitive damages awards.cooper indus.leatherman tool group,d callantine staff builders,cir.

punitive damages 
ross argues he is entitled to reinstatement of the entire punitive damages award,and in the alternative argues he should have been given the option of a new trial in lieu of remittitur.kcplc argues the punitive damages should not have been submitted to the jury,that the damages are still excessive following reduction and that it is therefore entitled to a new trial or a further reduction.
in kolstad american dental ass n,d,the supreme court addressed the contours of the standard for when punitive damages should be submitted to the jury in an employment discrimination case.punitive damages may be recovered for employment discrimination if the employer engages in intentional discrimination with malice or with reckless indifference to the individual protected rights.kolstad,at.however,a plaintiff does not have to establish egregious misconduct on the part of an employer in order to have punitive damages submitted to the jury.madison ibp,cir.
the district court submitted punitive damages to the jury because it found that the evidence showed that kcplc occasionally took special efforts on behalf of white applicants,including making further inquiry when their applications did not initially meet minimum qualifications.further,there was evidence that kcplc may have passed over qualified internal black candidates in favor of new college graduates who were white.in light of this evidence,the district court correctly submitted punitive damages to the jury.see id.at submission of punitive damages issue to jury appropriate where,even though company had policy and procedures,those procedures were not followed by managers.
following motions,the district court held that the jury punitive damages award violated due process and reduced the award for the service coordinator position from to.the district court was required by the due process clause to undertake an examination of the punitive damages award.bmw of north america,gore,d in bmw,the court held that the constitution provides an upper limit on punitive damage awards so that a person has fair notice not only of the conduct that will subject him to punishment but also of the severity of the penalty that may be impose d.id.at.the court set out the following factors to be used in determining the reasonableness of a punitive damages award the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant conduct the ratio or relationship between actual harm inflicted on plaintiff and the punitive damages award and civil penalties authorized for comparable misconduct.id.at.
here,kcplc reprehensibility,while enough for liability,was not enough for a punitive damages award which totaled a ratio over the compensatory award.in bmw,the supreme court struck down a ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages as violative of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.id.at.while the courts should not employ a mechanical mathematical approach in determining the reasonableness of punitive damages awards,id.at,we note that the district court formula still results in a ratio with the compensatory damages award.from our de novo review of the record,this is still too high for the conduct which occurred in this case.thus,while we agree with the district court that a award violated due process,we further reduce the punitive damages award from to,resulting in a ratio.kimzey stores,cir reducing punitive damages from approximately to a punitive to compensatory ratio.
ross argument,based on thorne welk investment,cir,that he was entitled to the option of a new trial on damages,absent his consent to the district court remittitur is unavailing.in thorne we held that the district court erred when it remitted an excessive verdict without first obtaining the plaintiff consent or offering the plaintiff the option of proceeding to a new trial.id.at.here,while perhaps labeled as such,the action the district court took was not actually a remittitur,but instead was simply a reduction of the excessive punitive damages award in conformity with constitutional limits.see johansen combustion eng g,cir.as the eleventh circuit explained 
a constitutionally reduced verdict is really not a remittitur at all.a remittitur is a substitution of the court judgment for that of the jury regarding the appropriate award of damages.the court orders a remittitur when it believes the jury award is unreasonable on the facts.a constitutional reduction,on the other hand,is a determination that the law does not permit the award.unlike a remittitur,which is dis
