introduction 
plaintiffs are owners of condominium units that are designated below market rate bmr units,and thus subject to restrictions imposed by the below market rate condominium conversion program bmr program created by the city and county of san francisco the city,under authority of the state subdivision map act,et sma plaintiffs filed this lawsuit against the challenging ordinance the ordinance adopted by the city in december as part of its bmr program.in their facial challenge,plaintiffs claim the ordinance,which amended existing ordinances governing the bmr program and added new provisions,constituted a regulatory taking,was preempted by state law,and violated their civil rights under section.
in this interlocutory appeal,the city claims the court erred in issuing a preliminary injunction to maintain the status quo while plaintiffs claims were being litigated.among other arguments,the city claims that plaintiffs did not have a reasonable probability of prevailing at the trial one of the requirements for issuing a preliminary injunction because all of plaintiffs causes of action were.we agree with the city that section,the statute of limitations governing any decision under the sma,required plaintiffs facial challenge to the ordinance to be filed within days of the enactment of the ordinance.because plaintiffs claims were not filed within the day timeframe,plaintiffs have not shown a likelihood of success on the merits.for this reason,we reverse the preliminary injunction,and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.
facts and procedural history 
the sma is the primary regulatory control governing the subdivision of real property in california.hill city of clovis th.condominium projects are expressly defined as subdivisions within the meaning of the sma.the sma vests the r egulation and control of the design and improvement of subdivisions in the legislative bodies of local governments which must promulgate ordinances on the subject.under the sma,local governments possess the powers necessary to set condominium conversion restrictions.see soderling city of santa monica d.
pursuant to the city authority under the sma,the city established its bmr program in to expand opportunities for homeownership while preserving and expanding the supply of housing,b.the city created the bmr program by adopting sections and of the city subdivision code,which,among other things,required property owners seeking to convert their apartments into condominiums to set aside a certain number of their units for the bmr program.the purpose of conditioning approval of subdivision maps in this way was to restrict the sales and rental prices of each affected unit to ensure the affected units would remain available for purchase by households.the affordable housing restrictions were then reflected as conditions set forth in the san francisco planning commission subdivision map approvals.the program restrictions were,in turn,reflected on each property subdivision map.
in,a dispute arose between the city and several owners of bmr units regarding the terms of the bmr program,including whether the program restrictions lasted in perpetuity,or for only years.in response,on december,the city adopted the ordinance at the center of this controversy,which amended sections and and added a new section to the city subdivision code.
new section of the city subdivision code states that it applies to bmr units purchased or acquired on or after the effective date of this ordinance,and retroactively to bmr units purchased or acquired before the effective date of this ordinance,a,a.the amendment clarifies the city intent that the requirements of the bmr program apply in perpetuity.
in addition,the ordinance sets out procedures for calculating the sale price for bmr units and the procedures unit owners must follow to sell their units,c,e specifies how the city adds costs for capital improvements to the base resale price of the units id.at d establishes rental restrictions id.at f and allows certain unit owners to pay a fee to have their units released from the bmr program,so long as they make such election months from the effective date of this legislation id.at i.section i a of the city subdivision code also requires that in order to have a unit released from the bmr program,the bmr unit owner must waive all claims against the city for damages or other alleged injury arising from the owner participation in the program.
throughout this litigation,the parties have taken vastly different views of the purpose and effect of the ordinance.the city claims the ordinance was enacted to further the planning goals of the sma by clarifying conditions placed on the subdivision of plaintiffs properties and by creating new options for program participants who wish to exit the program or sell their units in plaintiffs view,i n,after years of the city mismanagement and the exit of nearly half of the bmr units from the program,the city attempted to unilaterally rewrite the terms of the program and subject plaintiffs to permanent resale,rental and inheritance restrictions.
on may,five months after the city adopted the ordinance,plaintiffs filed a complaint in federal district court challenging both the city adoption of the ordinance,and the city alleged mismanagement of the bmr program.victor aiuto et san francisco mayor sic office of housing et al.no.c cw.in the federal case,plaintiffs asserted claims for the unlawful taking of their property,preemption under state law,declaratory relief,injunctive relief,and violations of their due process,equal protection,and civil rights.
on october,the city filed a motion to dismiss the federal action.ultimately,the federal court dismissed all of plaintiffs claims,but granted leave to amend their claim under section.plaintiffs did not attempt to amend their federal pleadings.instead,on august,three months after their federal case was dismissed,plaintiffs filed the underlying complaint in the san francisco superior court alleging three causes of action for regulatory taking,state law preemption by the costa hawkins rental housing act legislation,et and unspecified sections of the sma and the probate code,and a claim for violation of plaintiffs civil rights under section.as described by plaintiffs,the crux of their complaint is that the city has unilaterally rewritten the terms and operation of an affordable housing program in such a way as to unlawfully strip homeowners sic of their constitutionally protected property rights.the complaint prayer for relief seeks a permanent injunction preventing the enforcement of the ordinance,and declaratory relief adjudging the ordinance unconstitutional on its face as applied to plaintiffs.
on september,plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction.in their motion,plaintiffs sought an injunction in case their challenge to the ordinance failed,and in order to preserve their option of having their units released from the bmr program in exchange for a fee and a waiver of rights.specifically,plaintiffs requested the court to extend the deadline referenced in the san francisco subdivision code,section i,as added by ordinance,from months from the effective date of ordinance to ninety days after final judgment in this case.
ordinarily,trial courts evaluate two interrelated factors when deciding whether or not to issue a preliminary injunction.the first is the likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial.the second is the interim harm that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction were denied as compared to the harm that the defendant is likely to suffer if the preliminary injunction were issued.citations.it county of imperial cal d.
in claiming there was no likelihood plaintiffs could prevail at trial,the city contended that plaintiffs claims were all barred by the day statute of limitations period provided by section actions challenging the decision of a legislative body concerning a subdivision and section,subdivision c actions challenging either the adoption or amendment of a zoning ordinance or the validity of conditions attached to variances,conditional use permits,or other permits.the city argued that plaintiffs claims were governed by both sections and w hen the city adopts an ordinance under its authority pursuant to the sma,or when there is a challenge to conditions imposed by the city on subdivisions,or when the city takes actions which relate to or concern subdivisions,those actions are governed by section.moreover,whenever the city adopts a land use ordinance,any facial challenge to such an ordinance must be brought within days whether or not it a subdivision ordinance pursuant to section it is undisputed that plaintiffs failed to file suit within the day limitations period specified in both statutes.
in opposition,plaintiffs argued that sections and were wholly inapplicable because plaintiffs claims could not be fit into the statutory rules set up for development decisions.instead,their challenge was to the city adoption of an ordinance which unilaterally changes the terms of a low income housing program.consequently,plaintiffs insisted their claims were governed by the statute of limitations for inverse condemnation claims,including regulatory takings code civ,the statute of limitations for preemption claims code civ,subd.a and the personal injury statute of limitations for section claims code.civ,see jackson cedars sinai medical center d,state and federal courts alike have consistently held that the personal injury statute of limitations applies to civil rights causes of action.
in ruling on plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction,the trial court concluded that plaintiffs had met their burden of showing a reasonable probability of success on the merits.the trial court also found that the balance of harm weighed in plaintiffs favor.on january,after considering further briefing and hearing oral argument from each side,the court determined that neither the statutes of limitation found in section nor section applied to the claims set forth in plaintiffs complaint.therefore,the court concluded this action is not subject to a day statute of limitations.on january,the court entered its order granting plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction.
thereafter,the city sought review of the court statute of limitations ruling by a direct appeal from the order granting the plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction no.and by filing a petition for writ of mandate,prohibition,certiorari,or other appropriate relief no.where,however,as here,there is a right to an immediate review by appeal,that remedy is almost as speedy as a writ proceeding,under present practice,and should be considered adequate unless petitioner can show some special reason why it is rendered inadequate by the particular circumstances of his case.citation.phelan superior court cal d,fn.omitted.in this case,the city has an adequate remedy at law in its appeal.powers city of richmond cal th,a remedy by immediate direct appeal is presumed to be adequate attorney general superior court cal d,writ not appropriate remedy where appeal provides adequate remedy.consequently,the city writ petition will be denied as plaintiffs have not shown entitlement to review by extraordinary writ.
discussiona.overview 
in seeking reversal of the trial court order granting the preliminary injunction,the city relies on the principle that a preliminary injunction granted without a showing of a likelihood of success on the merits is an abuse of discretion and will be reversed.see perez hastings college th,reversing preliminary injunction because respondent could not show a likelihood of success on the merits.among other arguments,the city insists that plaintiffs could not possibly prevail at trial because all of their causes of action are under the day statutes of limitation found in sections and.
plaintiffs contend the court ruling on the applicability of the statute of limitations to plaintiffs claims is not at issue in this appeal.they assert that we should only reach the question whether the trial court abused its discretion in issuing the injunction because plaintiffs can challenge the statute of limitations decision on appeal from a final ruling.we disagree.when the likelihood of prevailing on the merits depends on a question of law,such as construing the applicable statutes of limitation,an appellate court can independently determine whether the trial court interpretation was correct as a matter of law and,therefore,whether there was a possibility of success on the merits.see bullock city and county of san francisco cal.app d,bullock legacy group city of wasco th,legacy group applicability of statute of limitations presents question of statutory interpretation subject to de novo review.moreover,even where the question of law is not entirely determinative of the likelihood of plaintiffs success on the merits,it may be appropriate for the appellate court to express its opinion in order to clarify or narrow the issues for trial.citation.citations.carsten city of del mar th.
b.the sma statute of limitations,section,bars plaintiffs claims 
the subdivision map act establishes a strict day limitations period for any action or proceeding to attack a governmental decision concerning a subdivision or to determine the reasonableness,legality,or validity of any condition attached thereto.in addition,to further expedite resolution of challenges,section provides calendar preference for covered actions.the proceeding shall take precedence over all matters of the calendar of the court except criminal,probate,eminent domain,forcible entry,and unlawful detainer proceedings.
in the trial court written order finding plaintiffs claims were not subject to the day limitations period of section the court concluded that the phrase concerning a subdivision as used in section referred to decisions that have a temporal aspect to them such as the formulation of subdivision plans,to approve or disapprove tentative and final maps for such plans,and participa tion in the administration of subdivision planning.apparently,the trial court believed section would only apply if plaintiffs were seeking to challenge the affordable housing conditions originally imposed as part of the subdivision process when plaintiffs apartment buildings were being subdivided into condominiums.so interpreted,the court concluded t his case concerns activities which lie outside the purview of section because plaintiffs challenges do not concern any decision made by defendants that justifies a short limitations period or relates to an ongoing project and would affect future components of the project 
in interpreting statutes,such as section,the words used in the statute are the starting point.wilcox birtwhistle cal th.on its face,the statutory language at issue,applying the day statute of limitations to a ny action or proceeding challenging the decision of an advisory agency,appeal board,or legislative body concerning a subdivision is very broad and does not contain the temporal limitation relied upon by the trial court to find that plaintiffs lawsuit was timely.to the contrary,the language used in section contains no limitation whatsoever on the type of decision that is being challenged,but instead broadly encompasses any decision of a local legislative or advisory body concerning a subdivision.
moreover,the day limitations period of section is expressly made applicable to any action to determine the reasonableness,legality,or validity of any subdivision condition including,but not limited to,the approval of a tentative map or final map italics added.the italicized language was added by a amendment.stats,ch.according to the analysis prepared for the senate judiciary committee,assembly bill clarify ies that the day time limitation to attack,review,set aside,void,or annul the decision of a legislative body concerning a subdivision applies to,but is not limited to,the approval of a tentative map or final map.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.may,proposed amendment.we think it is evident that the legislature,in adopting the amendment,intended to apply the day statute of limitations in a more expansive manner to actions seeking to attack or review any decision concerning a subdivision,and not just
