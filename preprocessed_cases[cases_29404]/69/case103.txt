john livick appeals a grant of summary judgment to his former employer,the gillette company,and the gillette company retirement plan collectively gillette in a dispute over the amount of his pension benefits under gillette employee benefit plan plan.livick sued gillette under the civil enforcement provisions of the employee retirement income security act erisa,arguing that gillette must pay him the amount of the erroneous benefit estimates he received before he left gillette instead of the lesser amount he was entitled to under the plan.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment for defendants.
livick began working for parker pen company in janesville,wisconsin,in.in,parker pen was bought by gillette stationary products group gillette spg,a division of gillette,and the pension plans of the two companies were merged together at the end of.in and again in,livick received letters from gillette spg explaining how the parker pen pension he had already accrued would be treated under gillette plan.these letters enclosed an estimate of livick parker pen pension a stated in the opening paragraphs that livick would receive this pension in addition to any benefit you accrue under the gillette plan for your service on and after january.the official plan terms also included similar clear language under the heading former participants in the parker pen pension plan.
gillette decided to close the janesville plant in,so livick moved to boston to take another position within gillette spg.a year later,gillette announced the sale of gillette spg to another company,resulting in the elimination of livick position.
livick attended a meeting in october in which gillette explained what benefits would be available for the gillette spg workers like livick who were losing their jobs.this is the first time someone from gillette suggested that livick gillette pension might cover the years he worked for parker pen.following up on that meeting,livick met individually with wayne brundige,a human resources representative,the next week.brundige calculated an estimate of livick gillette pension based on a hire date of instead of the appropriate gillette hire date of.that estimate put livick gillette pension at a month.
while still employed at gillette spg,livick went online to check brundige estimate against gillette pension estimator estimator.before the online estimator can be accessed,the user must pass through a disclaimer page that emphasizes repeatedly that the site only provides estimates.that page also notes that the estimator does not take into account some very specific features of the gillette retirement plan.in capital,bold letters at the bottom of this disclaimer page,the estimator website states in the event there is any discrepancy between the information provided by the estimator and the benefits to which you are entitled,the terms of the gillette plans will apply.in a more detailed definitions and additional information section of the website,a subsection entitled parker frozen benefit explains that former parker pen employees would receive their earned pension under the parker pen plan plus the benefit they earn under the terms of the gillette retirement plan for service after december.livick printed this portion of the website in december while researching how his pension would be calculated.the website calculator generated a pension estimate for livick of a month based on a hire date of,which was the incorrect date under the parker pen frozen benefit policy.
livick job was formally terminated on january,livick turned down another job offer,he says in reliance on the pension estimates.in,after livick again visited the online estimator and generated yet a higher estimated benefit,livick called gillette human resource center to ascertain which or the estimator was more correct.he was told that the online estimate was likely more correct,but that he would be sent a new estimate of his pension benefit.
that new benefit statement correctly showed that livick gillette pension would be based solely on the years he worked for gillette.this dropped his gillette pension down to a month his parker pen pension a month presumably remained unchanged.
livick sued gillette in district court in may,claiming that gillette was in breach of its fiduciary duty to livick under erisa because of these misrepresentations.he requested equitable relief under erisa a,specifically a declaration that he was entitled to a gillette pension that accounted for his years at both gillette and parker pen.
the defendants moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted on june.livick gillette,d.this appeal followed.
motion to strike affidavit 
we turn first to livick appeal of an evidentiary matter.on defendants motion,the district court struck a portion of the affidavit of peter miller,who worked as a human resources manager for gillette in janesville from to.id.at.when reviewing a grant of summary judgment,we often first consider challenges to the district court evidentiary rulings,as such rulings define the record on which the summary judgment rests.see hoffman applicators sales,cir schubert nissan motor,cir vazquez,cir.we review the district court decision to exclude evidence,such as affidavits,for abuse of discretion.hoffman,at.under that standard,we will not disturb the district court ruling unless the record demonstrates an error of law or a serious lapse of judgment on the part of the court.id.at schubert,at.
under rule e,an affidavit at the summary judgment stage must be made on personal knowledge,set out facts that would be admissible in evidence,and show that the affiant is competent to testify on the matters stated.e.this requisite personal knowledge must concern facts as opposed to conclusions,assumptions,or surmise.perez volvo car,cir.the district court struck of miller affidavit because it would be inadmissible due to its lack of relevance to and probity of the issues of the case.see livick,d at.the court did not abuse its discretion in striking the paragraph.
section a claim 
our review of a grant of summary judgment is de novo,and we resolve all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.mellen trs.of boston,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,the discovery,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
section a of erisa enables plan beneficiaries to sue in their individual capacities to obtain appropriate equitable relief beyond the relief otherwise provided under the statute to redress violations or enforce any provisions of either erisa or the plan itself.a varity howe,d.
as his basis for a relief,livick claims that gillette was in breach of its fiduciary duty under erisa.we disagree,as we explain below.because we disagree,we do not reach the question of whether the relief he seeks is the type of equitable relief available under a livick also argued before the district court that gillette should be held liable under a based on a theory of estoppel.that basis for his claim was not specified in his original complaint and is not argued in precise terms before this court.however,livick theory of his case is largely built on a reliance argument that he relied to his detriment on the mistaken pension estimates he received.thus we briefly address the estoppel theory,though we find it also unavailing.
under erisa,a fiduciary is defined functionally a party is a fiduciary to the extent that he or she exercises discretion over the management of the plan or its funds or over its administration.a pegram herdrich,d varity,at.a fiduciary named in an erisa plan can undertake duties,and a party not identified as a plan fiduciary can become one if,but only to the extent that,he or she undertakes discretionary tasks related to the plan management or administration.see pegram,at.employer can switch between wearing its fiduciary and employer hats varity,at.same beddall state bank trust,cir person can become fiduciary to extent she undertakes fiduciary duties.thus in cases alleging breach of erisa fiduciary duty,the threshold question is not whether t
