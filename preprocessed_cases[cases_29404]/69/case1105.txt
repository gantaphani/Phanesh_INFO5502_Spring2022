a coalition of environmental groups montana wilderness association,et,hereinafter mwa challenges the gallatin national forest travel management plan prepared by the united states forest service,arguing that the travel plan violates the montana wilderness study act of study act.we hold that the study act requires the service to ensure that current users of a wilderness study area are able to enjoy the wilderness character of the area as it existed in,pending a congressional decision on whether to designate the area as wilderness.in this case,the service has not adequately explained how the wilderness character of the relevant study area,particularly the opportunities for solitude it offers,has been maintained despite an increase in the volume of motorized and mechanized recreation in the area.we therefore conclude that the service adoption of the travel plan was arbitrary and capricious,and accordingly affirm the district court decision finding that the service actions violate the administrative procedure act apa.
statutory background 
we begin with a brief overview of the statutes that govern the land management decision challenged in this case.
the wilderness act established a national wilderness preservation system composed of congressionally designated wilderness areas.see,stat.a.under the wilderness act,wilderness is defined as an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man,where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.c.the definition further specifies 
an area of wilderness generally appears to have been affected primarily by the forces of nature,with the imprint of man work substantially unnoticeable has outstanding opportunities for solitude or a primitive and unconfined type of recreation has at least five thousand acres of land or is of sufficient size as to make practicable its preservation and use in an unimpaired condition and may also contain ecological,geological,or other features of scientific,educational,scenic,or historical value.
id.unlike national forests,which are generally managed to sustain a variety of uses,see id.e,wilderness areas must be managed to preserve their wilderness character,id.b.only certain recreational uses are appropriate in wilderness areas motorized and mechanized activities are generally prohibited.see id.b,c.
in,the forest service undertook a nationwide inventory of large roadless areas within the national forest system,select ing areas with the most merit for specific study as possible additions to the national wilderness preservation system,at.congress became concerned,however,that in conducting this review the service may have unjustifiably rejected from wilderness consideration several large tracts in montana,at.in response,congress passed the study act,which identified nine wilderness study areas in montana for renewed evaluation.see,a,stat.the study act directed the secretary of agriculture to review these study areas suitability for preservation as wilderness and to advise congress whether each study area should be designated as wilderness or removed from study area status.id.a,b.the study act also instructed that,pending congressional action on the secretary recommendations,the study areas be administered so as to maintain their presently existing wilderness character and potential for inclusion in the national wilderness preservation system.id.a.the secretary,acting through the service,has long since made these recommendations.congress,however,has not yet acted on them.accordingly,until congress either designates the study areas as wilderness areas or removes their study act protection,the service must continue to manage them to maintain their wilderness character and potential for wilderness designation.
factual and procedural background 
the hyalite porcupine buffalo horn wilderness study area,a acre region within southwest montana gallatin national forest,is managed under the study act.until recently,the service administered the entire gallatin national forest,including the study area,under a forest plan prepared in since the forest plan was prepared,however,recreation and travel uses of the gallatin national forest have evolved substantially.motorized and mechanized recreational use has intensified u se of snowmobiles and atvs has grown in popularity,for instance,and mountain bike activity has exploded.observations by forest service personnel further indicate that motorized and mechanized recreational use has increased in the study area in particular,not just in the gallatin national forest in general,although the service does not possess statistically sound data fully illustrating these historical changes.for example,during the winter of,snowmobile traffic on the big sky snowmobile trail,which passes through the study area,was roughly double that observed in the winter of.
in,realizing that the demand for some recreation opportunities in the gallatin national forest might be reaching the point of exceeding the capability of the land to provide them,the service began preparing the travel plan to balance travel and recreational uses with other management goals.in october,the service released the record of decision rod for the travel plan,along with a final environmental impact statement feis prepared to satisfy the national environmental policy act nepa,et.
when preparing the portion of the travel plan that covers the study area,the service recognized that the increasing use of motorized and mechanized transports like snowmobiles,motorcycles and mountain bikes,none of which can be used in designated wilderness areas,might potentially degrade the study area wilderness character relative to the baseline,in contravention of the study act mandate that wilderness character be maintained thus,to comply with the study act,the service examined which portions of the study area were available for motorized and mechanized recreational use in,and compared the areas to the areas available in,when the travel plan was prepared.after conducting this analysis,the service restricted summer use of motorcycles and mountain bikes to total trail miles,and restricted winter use of snowmobiles to an acre open area surrounded by a acre buffer zone the parties dispute whether these restrictions amount to a net increase or decrease in the physical area of motorized and mechanized use relative to the baseline.all acknowledge,however,that the service at least attempted to comply with its study act management obligations by reconfiguring the physical areas in which such use occurs.
although it reconfigured the area over which motorized and mechanized use occurs relative to,however,the service did not explicitly account for the increase in volume of use over time.the service acknowledged that use volume has increased in the study area since,but noted that accounting for the increase was somewhat problematic because there were no reliable statistically valid recreation use data available.the service concluded,however,that the missing data were not relevant in any event because the study act requires the service to maintain only those physical characteristics that may affect a study area ability to provide a wilderness experience in the event of future wilderness designation.the service did not attempt to maintain the area wilderness character,including the relatively low motorized use volumes that existed at that time,for the enjoyment of current users.
after the travel plan was finalized,mwa brought this action under the apa,alleging the travel plan and feis allow motorized and mechanized activities in the study area to increase beyond the status quo,in contravention of the study act.mwa also alleged that the service violated nepa by failing adequately to disclose and analyze the impact of the travel plan on the study area wilderness character.citizens for balanced use,et citizens,a coalition representing enthusiasts of motorized and mechanized recreation,filed a separate lawsuit against the service,alleging just the opposite that the travel plan unlawfully restricts motorized use in the study area.on appeal,however,citizens largely supports the restrictions adopted by the service and argues that the service decision is entitled to deference 
the district court consolidated the two cases.it then granted mwa motion for summary judgment and denied the of the service and citizens.the court concluded that the service failed adequately to explain how the travel plan reconfiguration of the physical areas open to motorized and mechanized use satisfied the study act mandate to maintain wilderness character,in light of acknowledged increases in use volume.see.wilderness ass mcallister,d.the court recognized that the service lacked complete historical data that would allow it to quantify the volume of use increase precisely,see,but held that the service was nonetheless not permitted to ignore increased volume of use altogether.see id.at.the court found that the service had done so,and that the omission render ed the decision arbitrary and capricious in violation of the apa.id.at.
the court also ruled that,by asserting that the missing historical volume of use data were not relevant to its study act analysis,the service violated its nepa obligation to include in the feis a statement of the relevance of incomplete or unavailable information to evaluating reasonably foreseeable significant adverse impacts on the human environment.b see mcallister,d at.the court enjoined the service from continued implementation of the travel plan and remanded to the agency.see mcallister,d at.the service appealed.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction over the service challenge to the district court remand order under.see chugach alaska lujan,cir holding that an agency may appeal immediately from a remand order because review would,as a practical matter,be foreclosed if an immediate appeal were unavailable.
we review the district court summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards that applied in the district court.pit river tribe forest,cir.because nepa and the study act do not contain independent judicial review provisions,our review of the travel plan compliance with these statutes is governed by the apa,which allows us to set aside agency decisions that are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.
in reviewing the service justification for its decision under the arbitrary and capricious standard,we ask only whether the agency relied on factors which congress has not intended it to consider,entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem,offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency,or an explanation that is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.lands council mcnair,cir en banc alteration in original quoting motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d internal quotation marks omitted,abrogated on other grounds by winter natural res.def.council,d.

discussion 
we agree with the district court that the travel plan does not adequately address the service study act obligation to maintain the study area wilderness character.the service first erroneously determined that the study act does not require it to maintain the wilderness character of the study area for the enjoyment of the area current users.then,based on its misinterpretation of the study act,the service ignored the obvious impact of increased volume of motorized and mechanized use on current users ability to enjoy the study area wilderness character.because the service entirely failed to consider this important aspect of its study act obligation,the travel plan is arbitrary and capricious.
we first address the service interpretation of the study act.
as we explained in russell country sportsmen united states forest service,slip,wl cir,the study act imposes two requirements.first,the service must administer study areas so as to maintain their wilderness character as it existed in.second,the service must administer the areas so as to maintain their potential for designation as wilderness areas,as part of the national wilderness preservation system,at,slip op.at.the dispute in this case centers on the first requirement,to maintain wilderness character.
the parties offer competing interpretations of this requirement.the first offered by the forest service in its appellate brief is that the statute requires only that the service maintain those physical,inherent characteristics of the study areas that will make them suitable for future wilderness use.the second urged by mwa,and implicitly adopted by the district court is that the service must maintain wilderness character,including relatively low volumes of motorized use,for the enjoyment of current users of the study areas,in addition to ensuring that the areas physical potential for future wilderness designation is not destroyed.we conclude,based not only on the language of the study act and the wilderness act but also on basic common sense,that mwa interpretation is correct.
the service argument that it can satisfy its statutory obligation to maintain a study area wilderness character by preserving only its physical wilderness characteristics is out of step with the wilderness act,which the service agrees should inform the definition of wilderness character for purposes of the study act.the wilderness act does not define wilderness solely according to physical,inherent characteristics.instead,it states that,in addition to having physical characteristics such as large acreage,a wilderness has outstanding opportunities for solitude.c.an area ability to provide solitude depends on a current user perception of other users around him not just on the physical characteristics of the land.see american heritage dictionary of the english language ed.defining solitude as the state or quality of being alone or remote from others oxford english dictionary online version june defining solitude as the state of being or living alone loneliness seclusion solitariness of persons.furthermore,because the wilderness act governs current wilderness areas,the term opportunities for solitude must include the experience of current,as well as future,users of the area.see webster third new international dictionary defining opportunity as a combination of circumstances,time,and place suitable or favorable for a particular activity or action alteration in original.the service focus on physical characteristics alone,without regard to the opportunities for solitude currently available,fails to capture this important aspect of wilderness character.
in russell country sportsmen,at,slip,we interpreted the statutory mandate to maintain wilderness character to require that the service provid e current users with opportunities for solitude comparable to those that existed in emphasis added.this interpretation accords not only with the language of the wilderness act,but also with common sense.if the study act allowed the service to focus on physical wilderness characteristics alone,even a massive escalation in noisy,disruptive motorized use would trigger no management response so long as there was no resulting physical degradation.for example,the service could allow sightseeing helicopters to fly over the study areas in unlimited numbers,filling the study areas with loud and intrusive noise.because the helicopters would likely never touch the ground,however,their presence which from a perspective would plainly degrade the areas wilderness character could persist uncontrolled.we agree with the district court that confronted this very situation that congress could not have intended to permit such a result.see greater yellowstone coal.timchak,no.cv e blw,wl,at,sensibly observing,in analyzing the impacts of helicopters used for in a wyoming wilderness study area,that loud helicopter flights can be inconsistent with solitude,and holding that the service was required to address the impact of a tenfold increase in helicopter flights on the study area wilderness character.
