over a period,roxanne eyraud stole from her employer rhino building services rbs.her embezzlement scheme involved writing extra payroll checks both to herself and to other unknowing employees.she forged her employer signature on the checks,cashed them,and kept all the money for herself.also,she mischaracterized entries in rbs quickbooks accounting program as tax payments made by company check to the internal revenue service irs covering the period from november,to june.these bogus checks totaled money owed to the irs but not remitted.the phantom check payments entered into quickbooks were actually made payable to and cashed by eyraud.she hid the paper checks to conceal her forgery.
rbs discovered part of eyraud theft in when an auditor spotted approximately worth of bogus checks.she confessed and covered the loss with from a relative.eyraud did not alert rbs to the approximately the auditor had not yet spotted,nor did she tell the company she had kept for herself the money listed in quickbooks as paid to the irs.the rest of eyraud thefts came to light in.
pursuant to a negotiated agreement,eyraud pleaded guilty to bank fraud in violation of,one count of a ten count indictment.the court eventually sentenced her to time served with three years of supervised release.in addition,the court ordered her to pay restitution to rbs in the amount of.this total included in unrecovered stolen money,in tax deficiencies and penalties caused by her fraud,for forensic accounting fees,and in attorneys fees.
because the march,plea agreement was negotiated before rbs full loss had been calculated,the agreement obligated the government to recommend restitution in the amount of only.this number represented eyraud embezzled funds not yet repaid and the resulting tax penalties and interest known as of the date of the agreement.the sum did not include rbs attorneys fees.on june,the probation office informed the court that rbs would be seeking considerably more in restitution than the amount specified in the plea agreement.attorneys fees now became an issue.
at a sentencing hearing on september,rbs appeared in court with private counsel to justify its request for additional restitution.rbs appearance triggered a series of additional hearings and multiple dueling submissions by both rbs and eyraud.on march,rbs supplemented its request with invoice summaries not the original invoices themselves for attorneys fees paid by rbs showing the attorney involved,the number of hours worked,and the hourly rate of each attorney.rbs also produced an sworn declaration from their attorney explaining his law firm billing policy,the extent of the legal and investigative work performed,and the resum√©s of the attorneys who performed the work,as well as a summary of the tax damage done to rbs by eyraud scheme,calculated by quarter.counsel declaration asserted that the withheld original invoices contained information protected by both the attorney client work product privileges.
at a contested hearing on april,rbs refined its request,and the court took the issue of restitution under submission,setting eyraud sentencing for april.because of its plea agreement,the government continued to sit on the restitution sidelines.
on april,the court asked for the original invoices relating to the summaries previously submitted.the court said that it wanted to review the billing rate and work completed by each attorney on april,rbs filed the requested documentation ex parte,for court eyes only,and in camera,once again asserting the attorney client work product privileges regarding communications and information in the originals.
on april,the court sentenced eyraud,but set a later date to determine attorneys fees and prejudgment interest.the court denied eyraud counsel request for the original invoices,saying,well i not inclined to turn over the billing records,but when i rule,i will explain my ruling to such a degree that you would be able to make any objections.
final judgment day arrived on may,almost one year after rbs entered the fray on its own behalf.
in explaining its analysis and findings of fact and conclusions of law,the court indicated that the backup billing documentation rbs had provided was consistent with the invoice summaries.the court added that the attorneys had been careful not to include any fees not related to eyraud criminal case.true to its promise,the court explained its ruling in thoughtful detail.counsel renewed his objection to the court decision not to give him access to the original invoices.counsel voiced his understanding that implicit in the court order was a denial of his assertion that the material he sought was not protected by any privilege.
eyraud presents us with six issues.first,whether the district court erred in concluding that the attorneys fees incurred by rbs were reasonably necessary.in his reply brief,however counsel takes a different tack,now claiming that the district court failed to apply the reasonably necessary test,and was ignorant of the test altogether.
second,whether the court denied statutory and constitutional due process to eyraud in denying access to the original billing invoices submitted in camera by rbs.
third,whether the district court failed to account for in the amount of attorneys fees awarded.
fourth,whether the court erred in finding that rbs tax penalty and interest loss were proximately caused by eyraud conduct.
fifth,whether the irs abatement of of the delinquent tax payments and interest was the true measure of eyraud damage to rbs,not the eyraud paid to the government.
sixth,whether after paroline united states,a jury,not a judge,must make the factual findings that support an order of restitution.
standard of review 
we review the district court restitution order for an abuse of discretion,provided it is within the bounds of the statutory framework.factual findings supporting an order of restitution are reviewed for clear error.united states waknine,cir citation omitted.we review de novo eyraud due process claims.
attorneys feesa.the law 
the mandatory victims restitution act mvra,requires a district court to order a defendant to make restitution to a victim of certain specified offenses.united states anderson,cir citation omitted.the amount of restitution is limited to the victim actual losses that are a direct and proximate result of the defendant offense.united states hunter,cir.the mvra lists certain losses that are undoubtably compensable,including expenses incurred during participation in the investigation or prosecution of the offense.b.however,so long as any loss not just those incurred during investigation or prosecution is an actual loss suffered as a result of a defendant qualifying crime and the mvra causation standard is satisfied,a district court must include the amount of that loss in its restitution order.see hunter,at united states peterson,cir.
normally but not exclusively,the government proves the amount of loss and causation by a preponderance of the evidence.see peterson,at.however,the statute setting the procedure for awarding restitution under the mvra,also authorizes the district court to allow a victim to prove up its own claim for restitution when the court deems it appropriate to do so.united states gamma tech,cir.
when a victim does prove up its claim,it does not do so as a formal party to the proceedings,but as someone damaged by the defendant crime.id.at a a a.we note that in gamma tech,the government vigorously opposed allowing the victim to bring its own restitution request.see gamma tech,at.here,rbs was similarly left to fend for itself in its request for restitution because the government earlier plea deal with eyraud tied its hands.
a meaningful difference exists between the role a victim like rbs plays at a restitution hearing and that of the prosecutor.see united states alverson,cir.the victim interest is focused on making itself whole.the victim does not advocate for a larger fine or longer prison sentence.and even if the victim were to do so,the district court would be powerless to increase the amount of restitution for solely punitive reasons.see hunter,at.
the law is settled that a court may include attorneys fees in a restitution order when the victim incurred the expenses to participate in law enforcement investigation and prosecution of a defendant.see b united states gordon,f d at,cir.to qualify as investigation costs under b,the fees must be reasonably necessary to aid in the investigation or prosecution of the defendant.see waknine,at.this principle covers the portion of attorneys fees that rbs incurred during its initial criminal investigation alongside the fbi into eyraud fraud and during the grand jury proceedings.see gordon,at approving investigation costs that were incurred in response to five grand jury subpoenas and a number of government requests requiring the victim to analyze vast amounts of documentation and electronic information.
however,this is not the end of the story.we have adopted a broad view of the restitution authorization for investigation costs,holding that investigation costs including attorneys fees incurred by private parties as a direct and foreseeable result of the defendant wrongful conduct may be recoverable.gordon,at citations omitted alteration in original.for instance,in united states cummings,cir,we concluded that b the companion statute to b was broad enough to serve as the basis for a restitution award for a mother attorneys fees in a separate child custody proceeding where the father had improperly retained the children abroad.we have concluded that the mrva is similarly expansive.see united states hayward,cir holding that parents were entitled to restitution under b for reasonable costs in obtaining the return of their victimized children from london and in making their children available to participate in the investigation and trial.
the textual reach of b manifestly covers the entirety of the attorneys fees awarded to rbs,not just those incurred leading up to and during the grand jury proceedings.rbs incurred those fees as part of its continuing investigation of the extent of eyraud thievery.eyraud created the need for this investigation by concealing the full measure of her wrongdoing when she was first confronted and then cutting a favorable deal with the government before rbs discovered the extent of her crime.because she had disguised her scheme through multiple false entries in the company quickbooks and tax ledger,eyraud should have anticipated especially after her lack of candor that unearthing the full consequences of her embezzlement would take additional time,effort,and money.
as gammatech holds,a victim may prove up its own claim for restitution.section d invites a victim seeking recompense privately to submit in camera information and documents revealing the full amount of a loss.in light of the mvra broad remedial purpose and the statutes implementing that purpose,it stands to reason that the term investigation must cover a victim reasonable investigation,not only one conducted by a government agency.consequently,the award of attorneys fees to rbs was proper.
an examination of the district court record through the prism of the relevant statutes and cases reveals no error or failure to exercise appropriate discretion.the court consideration of rbs interests as well as eyraud was thorough and a model of careful due process.the court findings and determinations are fully supported by the evidence,including the court decision about rbs tax penalty and interest loss.eyraud cooked quickbooks were directly responsible for the irs penalties incurred by rbs.contrary to counsel claim about judge lorenz supposed ignorance of the appropriate test,the court was manifestly aware of the law governing an award of attorneys fees.
moreover,the court properly concluded that rbs taxes and penalties were foreseeable and directly and proximately caused by eyraud embezzlement,with no break in the chain of causation.an intervening cause that is not directly related to the offense conduct will sever the causal chain.united states meksian,cir see also gamma tech,at the causal chain may not extend so far,in terms of the facts or the time span,as to become unreasonable.nevertheless,the d efendant conduct need not be the sole cause of the loss,and we have approved restitution awards that included losses at least one step removed from the offense conduct itself.id.
in united states peterson,cir,we rejected an argument similar to eyraud.there,homebuilders were convicted of submitting gift letters that falsely claimed that borrowers had received the down payments for home loans from their relatives,rather than from the homebuilders.id.at.when the borrowers defaulted on their loans,the district court ordered the homebuilders to compensate hud for its losses.the homebuilders argued that hud losses were caused by the borrowers defaulting on the loans,not the fraudulent gift letters.id.at.we held that the borrowers default was not a superceding cause that relieved the homebuilders restitution obligation because the borrowers would not have qualified for the loans in the first instance without the false letters.id.
similarly,eyraud fraud was the first link in the causal chain.the period for which rbs sought to recover its tax deficiencies and losses began at a time when it was current on its taxes.it was only after eyraud depleted rbs coffers and entered false tax payments on the books that rbs again fell behind on its payments to the irs.as the district court found,eyraud theft created the circumstances under which the harm or loss occurred.meksian,at quoting united states spinney,cir.moreover,rbs restitution request focused on the time period most directly related to eyraud losses.as a result,it was reasonable to hold eyraud responsible for rbs taxes that had gone unpaid and the penalties incurred as a result of eyraud fraud.
contrary to eyraud assertion,the negotiated amount of the irs abatement did not relieve the court of its responsibility to determine the amount of loss.see f a commanding that i n each order of restitution,the court shall order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim losses as determined by the court.quite simply,the irs did not determine the amount of restitution owed to rbs because of eyraud fraud,and the district court had no obligation to defer to any reduction in penalties negotiated between rbs and the irs.
furthermore,by examining the original invoices,the court reduced rbs requested attorneys fees by.contrary to counsel unsupported argument,the court did not conclude in making this reduction that the fees incurred were not reasonably necessary,just that the billing rate charged was too high.
counsel assertion that the court overlooked of rbs request is without merit.the colloquy between court and counsel reveals without ambiguity that the court had approved the requested total minus the familiar lodestar reduction.counsel said he understood the amount being requested and that the court had approved was a total of.at the time,counsel said nothing about a missing,and he did not respond when the court said,i can be more specific as far as the amounts of money by the different attorneys.i do know if that what you interested in.one wonders why counsel did not timely raise this question during the hearing when given the opportunity to request clarification on the precise amounts awarded.
as the district court explained at the restitution hearing,rbs requested attorneys fees included in grand jury billings and for restitution billing,two figures that total to.the court went on to explain that after reducing the attorneys fees via the lodestar method,the court had landed on as the final amount owed.though eyraud math is not quite accurate,what we gather to be counsel contention is that there is a gap between the attorneys fees that the district court explained orally at the restitution hearing and the attorneys fees later awarded by the district court.
the transcript demonstrates that the district court was not attempting to give a thorough accounting of every invoice submitted by rbs,but rather highlighting several of rbs primary requests.indeed,the court only orally discussed invoices,and,leading us to the obvious inference that invoices and conta
