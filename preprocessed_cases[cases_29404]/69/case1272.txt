background 
leon was hired by idx in.in,leon began complaining of mismanagement of the interoperable guideline system sage project,claiming there were irregularities in the financing and reporting of the project.on april,after putting leon on unpaid leave,idx brought an action for declaratory relief,seeking to establish that it could terminate leon employment without violating the provisions of the false claims act,sox,and the ada.on may,leon filed his own action,which included claims for retaliation under the false claims act,violations of title vii,the ada,and state law claims.leon complaint alleged that idx fired him in retaliation for his activities.
on april and may,idx attorneys sent letters to leon attorney,requesting that leon return the laptop to idx.on may,leon attorney responded in writing by asking if leon could keep his laptop for the duration of an audit of the sage project.on may,idx counsel stated that leon could keep the laptop for the specific purpose of responding to the auditors.the april and may letters cautioned that leon should take care to preserve all data one letter specifically warned that leon should ensure no data on the laptop is lost or corrupted so as to avoid any possible despoliation of evidence.the audit was completed in july,and by october,counsel for both sides were negotiating the return of the laptop.idx computer forensics expert received the laptop on february.
after conducting a forensic analysis,idx expert reported that all data in the hard drive unallocated space had been intentionally wiped,and also reported that the computer had been used to view and download pornography.the expert concluded that more than files had been deleted.after receiving this information,idx moved for dismissal of leon action based on leon intentional spoliation of evidence.
in his deposition,leon admitted deleting entire directories of personal files after he was placed on leave by idx in april.he also stated that the week before he shipped the computer back to idx he wrote a program to wipe any deleted files from the unallocated space in the hard drive.he also admitted that some of these files included pornographic content.
the district court held an evidentiary hearing on september,at which leon did not appear.the court commented at the hearing that leon behavior was very egregious and,from the written documents,appears to be without remorse.the court found leon written testimony to be extremely evasive and that leon ca answer a straight question that being posed.
after considering the parties additional video submission of leon deposition,the court granted idx motion to dismiss on september.the district court relied on its wide range of inherent powers in issuing the sanction.it first discussed leon duty to preserve the data on the laptop,holding that leon knew or should have known that he was in possession of evidence relevant to pending litigation by april.it then discussed the extent of prejudice to idx as a result of the spoliation,observing that a wealth of personal material could be relevant to leon ada and claims,such as communications with health care providers or with realtors regarding his relocation from seattle.b ecause of leon actions there is no way of knowing what might have been stored on the laptop and no reliable way of recreating what might have been there.accordingly,the court concluded that the deletion and wiping of the files severely prejudice s idx.
the court also found that leon acted in bad faith.while leon claimed that his wiping of relevant evidence was merely negligent because he meant to wipe only personal information,leon did not have the authority to make unilateral decisions about what evidence was relevant in this case.the court concluded that the extraordinary measures to which leon resorted to destroy evidence relevant to this litigation merit a finding of.
turning to the choice of sanction,the court found that dismissal was the appropriate sanction because a ruling excluding evidence would be futile,as the most salient evidence has been destroyed,a jury presumption in favor of the defense would be ineffectual,and a fine would not arm the defense with evidence to counter plaintiff claim.regarding the monetary sanction of,which was idx submitted cost of investigating and litigating the spoliation issue,the court reviewed this information and found the charges and costs listed therein to be reasonable.
on october,idx filed its motion to enjoin,under the all writs act,the dol administrative proceeding.at that time the dol was still conducting its investigation of idx.the district court denied this motion,finding a lack of identity or privity between leon and the dol consequently,it held that res judicata did not bar the agency proceedings against idx.the court subsequently denied idx motion for reconsideration of this decision,adhering to its view that privity was not satisfied and observing that sox gives osha the right to petition for review of a settlement agreement,thus showing that osha is not a mere proxy for the complaining party.the court noted that the agency proceedings were still investigative,and that res judicata principles apply only to adjudicative proceedings.
on june,the dol issued its findings and order,in which it concluded that t here is reasonable cause to believe that idx has violated the sox act.the dol did not refer to the district court dismissal of leon claims,but seemed to incorporate the spoliation findings when it limited the amount of leon back wages because there was reasonable cause to believe that idx would have fired leon on june,regardless of his protected activities,based on its discovery that leon had downloaded pornography on a company computer.the dol ordered idx to pay leon back wages,compensatory damages,and reasonable attorneys fees provide a neutral employment reference for leon and expunge negative employment records post the enclosed notice to employees in a conspicuous place c omply with all the terms and provisions of the notice and refrain from future retaliation against leon.the enclosed notice stated,inter alia,that idx agrees it will not discharge or in any manner discriminate against any employee who files a complaint under sox 
leon timely appealed the dismissal of his action and the monetary sanction.idx timely appealed the district court denials of the injunction and the motion for reconsideration.

discussion 
i.the dismissal sanction 
there are two sources of authority under which a district court can sanction a party who has despoiled evidence the inherent power of federal courts to levy sanctions in response to abusive litigation practices,and the availability of sanctions under rule against a party who fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery.fjelstad,at fed.civ.b c.in this case,the district court relied on its inherent authority in sanctioning leon because leon conduct was not in violation of any discovery order governed by rule.
dismissal is an available sanction when a party has engaged deliberately in deceptive practices that undermine the integrity of judicial proceedings because courts have inherent power to dismiss an action when a party has willfully deceived the court and engaged in conduct utterly inconsistent with the orderly administration of justice,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.before imposing the harsh sanction of dismissal,however,the district court should consider the following factors the public interest in expeditious resolution of litigation the court need to manage its dockets the risk of prejudice to the party seeking sanctions the public policy favoring disposition of cases on their merits and the availability of less drastic sanctions.id.
while the district court need not make explicit findings regarding each of these factors,united states ex rel.wiltec guam,kahaluu constr,cir,a finding of willfulness,fault,or bad faith is required for dismissal to be proper,at citation omitted.additionally,the district court must consider less severe alternatives than outright dismissal.wiltec guam,at.the district court here did not explicitly refer to the test articulated in,but did specifically consider leon level of culpability,the prejudice suffered by idx,and the availability of lesser sanctions 
a party destruction of evidence qualifies as willful spoliation if the party has some notice that the documents were potentially relevant to the litigation before they were destroyed.united states kitsap physicians,cir emphasis added internal quotation marks and citation omitted.moreover,because the relevance of destroyed documents can not be clearly ascertained because the documents no longer exist,a party can hardly assert any presumption of irrelevance as to the destroyed documents.alexander farmers,cir.
the district court concluded that leon behavior amounted to willful spoliation because he knew he was under a duty to preserve all data on the laptop,but intentionally deleted many files and then wrote a program to write over deleted documents.the court rejected leon explanation that the deleted documents were personal,observing that personal documents are highly relevant to an employment discrimination claim and noting the evidence that documents were also deleted and written over.the district court finding that leon acted in bad faith is not clearly erroneous.
leon admits that he intended to destroy information,including evidence of pornographic files,but he contends that his intent was merely to protect his privacy.leon had ample notice,however,that the files he destroyed were not merely private and were potentially relevant to the litigation at hand.leon ran the wiping program,eliminating over files,including pornographic files,well after idx had filed its action for declaratory judgment and he had filed his own employment discrimination action.idx declaratory judgment action sought to establish whether idx could legally fire leon for his failure to satisfactorily perform his job duties.therefore,leon was on notice that files created on his computer were relevant to a lawsuit centering on the existence of legitimate grounds for firing leon.for example,idx employee guide specifically forbids access or sending of sexually oriented messages or images of any kind.leon was on notice that files created in violation of this idx company policy would be relevant to idx lawsuit against him.his deletion and wiping of files,acts that were indisputably intentional,amounted to willful spoliation of relevant evidence.accordingly,the district court finding was not clearly erroneous.
the prejudice inquiry looks to whether the spoiling party actions impaired the party ability to go to trial or threatened to interfere with the rightful decision of the case.wiltec guam,at citation omitted.in,we found prejudice when a party refusal to provide certain documents forced anheuser to rely on incomplete and spotty evidence at trial.at.
the district court found that idx would be prejudiced by leon deletion of the files.the district court discussed types of personal files that could have helped idx with its case,including leon correspondence with realtors and financial institutions relevant to the timing of his decision to resign from idx communications with health care providers regarding illness relevant to his ada claim and the timing of and efforts to find other employment.the court noted that there was no way of recreating the contents of these files,and discounted leon contention that idx should have examined the laptop contents earlier or should examine the idx network for files relevant to leon and the litigation.
we conclude that the district court finding is not clearly erroneous.as the district court observed,the types of files leon would have deleted out of privacy concerns would likely be at the heart of idx defense were the files available.leon spoliation threatened to distort the resolution of the case,see wiltec guam,at,because any number of the files could have been relevant to idx claims or defenses,although it is impossible to identify which files and how they might have been used because of the obvious relevance of leon personal files to the litigation and the harm to idx caused by leon destruction of these files,the district court did not clearly err in its finding of prejudice.
lesser sanctions 
in reviewing whether the district court properly considered lesser sanctions prior to dismissing leon case,we examine whether the district court explicitly discussed the feasibility of less drastic sanctions and explained why such alternate sanctions would be inappropriate whether the district court implemented alternative sanctions before ordering dismissal and whether the district court warned the party of the possibility of dismissal before ordering dismissal,at citation omitted.
the district court found that less drastic sanctions are not useful because a ruling excluding evidence would be futile,and fashioning a jury instruction that creates a presumption in favor of idx would leave defendants equally helpless to rebut any material that plaintiff might use to overcome the presumption.the district court therefore satisfied the first criterion.the second criterion is inapplicable here because leon erased the files and ran the wiping program before the district court had an opportunity to compel discovery or otherwise order lesser sanctions.likewise,the third criterion,which examines whether the district court warned the party,is inapplicable here because the destruction of the evidence occurred before the court had any opportunity to warn leon.see malone,at observing that f ailure to warn has frequently been a contributing factor in our decisions to reverse orders of dismissal,but also holding that an explicit warning was unnecessary in certain circumstances.
in sum,four of the five factors support the district court decision to dismiss.the prejudice to idx,and the unavailability of lesser sanctions weigh heavily in favor of dismissal.also,the need to manage the court docket,as well as the public interest in expeditious resolution of litigation,weigh in favor of dismissal.the only factor weighing against dismissal is the public policy favoring disposition of cases on their merits,which,standing alone,is not sufficient to outweigh the other four factors.see malone,at.additionally,the determination,which is a prerequisite to dismissing a case pursuant to a court inherent powe
