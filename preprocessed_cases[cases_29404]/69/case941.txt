michael fegans,an inmate in arkansas,brought this suit against the director of the arkansas department of corrections adc,larry norris,and other prison officials,alleging violations of his rights under the first and fourteenth amendments,the religious land use and institutionalized persons act rluipa,et,the arkansas constitution,and the arkansas civil rights act.fegans,a follower of the teaching of the assemblies of yahweh,claimed that the adc failure to provide kosher meals and a religious exemption from its grooming policy created a substantial burden on the exercise of his religious beliefs that could not be justified under federal or state law.the district court agreed with fegans in part,ruling that fegans had a clearly established constitutional right to receive kosher meals and awarding him in damages.the district court disagreed,however,with fegans challenge to the grooming policy,and determined that the policy was constitutional and consistent with rluipa.fegans appeals both the amount of damages awarded and the district court decision on the grooming policy.we affirm.
on december,fegans was sentenced to years imprisonment for four counts of aggravated robbery,one count of second degree battery,and one count of criminal attempt to escape.in,fegans received a major disciplinary sanction after attempting to escape and possessing a weapon and drugs.in that incident,fegans was able to smuggle a firearm,shotgun shells,smoke grenades,marijuana,and a large amount of cash through an vent,and to have the items placed in a maintenance van to which he was assigned.tr.fegans testified that around this same time,he underwent a religious conversion,inspired by the radio broadcasts of jacob meyer.fegans began studying the teachings of meyer and the assemblies of yahweh,a christian sect which requires its members to follow old testament law.fegans eventually concluded that he should follow a kosher diet and refrain from rounding the corners of his hair and beard.
fegans stopped trimming his hair and beard in.in june,fegans formally notified the adc that he was a follower of the assemblies of yahweh and began requesting a kosher diet.while the adc policy at the time apparently allowed fegans to wear his hair and beard as he wished,the adc advised fegans that kosher meals were not an option and placed him on a diet instead.fegans protested the adc meal policy,and eventually exhausted his administrative remedies on this claim.
on april,director norris issued administrative directive ad,which set forth a new grooming policy for all arkansas prisons.the policy requires all male prisoners to keep their hair above their ears and no longer than the middle of the nape of the neck in the back.the policy allows female prisoners to wear hair.a separate provision prevents male inmates from wearing facial hair other than a neatly trimmed mustache,but provides an exception for inmates diagnosed with dermatological problems,such as pseudofolliculitis barbae,a medical condition that causes painful bumps from shaving.inmates with such a diagnosed dermatological problem are permitted to wear facial hair,provided that it is kept no longer than inch.the policy stated purpose is t o provide for the health and hygiene of incarcerated offenders,and to maintain a standard appearance throughout the period of incarceration,minimizing opportunities for disguise and for transport of contraband and weapons.the policy went into effect immediately.
on april and may,fegans was approached by an adc officer and ordered to get a haircut.fegans refused,stating that cutting his hair was against his religion.the adc issued fegans a major disciplinary sanction for each refusal,and eventually transferred him from the cummins unit in grady to the east arkansas regional unit earu in brickeys.fegans continued to resist the grooming policy while at the earu,and continued to receive disciplinary reports as a result of his failure to comply.in an effort to secure compliance,the adc gradually stripped fegans of privileges and ultimately transferred him first to a maximum security cell and then to the varner supermax unit.
fegans brought suit against several adc officials on march,claiming that the adc failure to provide kosher meals and a religious exemption to the grooming policy violated his constitutional rights and rluipa.following a bench trial,the district court determined that director norris had violated fegans firmly established constitutional right to receive kosher meals.the court relied on its previous holding in love evans,cv,where it held that the adc was required to accommodate an inmate requests for kosher meals.because the adc did not begin providing kosher meals until march,the district court found that norris knowingly violated established law requiring kosher diets from december,through march,and awarded fegans in damages.
the district court found that fegans had a sincere religious objection to the grooming policy,but rejected fegans challenges to the policy.the court reasoned that this court decision in hamilton schriro,cir,foreclosed fegans claims based on the first amendment.the court also rejected fegans challenge under rluipa,holding that the grooming policy served compelling state interests and was no more restrictive than necessary to further its stated goals.while fegans testified that he would have been satisfied to abide by the women regulation,and thus implied that it presented a less restrictive means available to meet the adc security concerns,the district court disagreed,finding that t he security concerns attendant female inmates housed in a single unit are not as great.the court rejected fegans equal protection claim for the same reason,concluding that different security concerns presented by male and female inmate populations provide a sufficient basis for the distinction in the grooming regulations.the court also ruled that the defendants were immune from suit on the state law claims,because fegans conclusory allegations that defendants acted with malice were not supported by the evidence.in this appeal of the district court judgment after a bench trial,we consider legal issues de novo and review the court finding of fact for clear error.eckert titan tire,cir.
prison inmates retain constitutional rights protected by the first amendment,including the right to free exercise of religion.shabazz,d.these rights are limited,however,by the fact of incarceration and valid penological objectives,such as deterrence of crime,rehabilitation of prisoners,and institutional security.id.the evaluation of penological objectives in this context is committed to the considered judgment of prison administrators,and to ensure appropriate deference to those judgments,courts review prison regulations alleged to infringe constitutional rights under a reasonableness test that is less restrictive than ordinarily applied to alleged infringements of fundamental constitutional rights.see also turner safley,d.
congress has granted additional protection for religious exercise by institutionalized persons.the rluipa,enacted in,succeeded a similar statute,the religious freedom restoration act rfra,which failed to pass constitutional muster as a valid exercise of congress power under the fourteenth amendment,insofar as it applied to the states.see city of boerne flores,d.rluipa,like rfra,provides that no government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of an inmate,even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability,unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest,and is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.the supreme court has remarked that context matters in the application of this compelling governmental interest standard,and that rluipa does not elevate accommodation of religious observances over an institution need to maintain order and safety.cutter wilkinson,d.indeed,the court noted that lawmakers who supported rluipa were mindful of the urgency of discipline,order,safety,and security in penal institutions,id.at,and expected that courts would apply the act with due deference to the experience and expertise of prison and jail administrators in establishing necessary regulations and procedures to maintain good order,security and discipline,consistent with consideration of costs and limited resources.id.quoting cong.rec,july,joint statement of hatch and kennedy on rluipa.
we applied these standards,through rfra,to a prison regulation in hamilton schriro,at,and much of fegans argument against the adc regulation is foreclosed by the reasoning of hamilton.the regulation at issue in hamilton,which prohibited male inmates from wearing their hair below the collar,was supported by testimony from prison officials who explained that inmates could conceal contraband,including dangerous materials,in their long hair,and that long hair could also cause problems with inmate identification.id.at.the officials suggested that a more liberal policy would place a strain on prison resources and relations because,in the absence of a policy,prison staff would be required to perform more frequent searches of inmates,which could cause conflicts between staff and inmates.id.
in holding that the regulation did not conflict with rfra,we cited congress expectation that the courts will continue the tradition of giving due deference to the experience and expertise of prison and jail administrators in establishing necessary regulations and procedures to maintain good order,security and discipline,consistent with consideration of costs and limited resources.id.at quoting,sess,reprinted in.we observed that while rfra reinstated the balancing test that had been applied by some courts to free exercise claims of inmates prior to the supreme court decision in,the case law nonetheless emphasized that judgments regarding prison security are peculiarly within the province and professional expertise of corrections officials,and,in the absence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate that the officials have exaggerated their response to these considerations,courts should ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such matters.id.at emphasis in original quoting pell procunier,d.our opinion in hamilton thus gave deference to the prison officials testimony that long hair presented a risk to prison safety and security and that no viable less restrictive means of achieving that goal existed,and upheld the restriction.id.at accord diaz collins,cir harris chapman,cir.
these observations about rfra are equally applicable to rluipa,see murphy.of corrections,cir hoevenaar lazaroff,cir,and the rationale of hamilton thus applies with equal force in this case.as in hamilton,the prison officials here testified that the policy was all about security,and that it was designed to minimize the smuggling of contraband and to reduce the opportunity for disguise.to underscore the reality of these concerns,norris and another correctional officer pointed to specific examples showing that inmates had used their hair to conceal contraband and to change their appearance after escaping.tr.norris testified that there was no less restrictive means to address adc security concerns,both because longer hair created a greater opportunity for inmates to conceal contraband,and because correctional officers are placed at risk of assault if they are required to search through the long hair of individual inmates.tr.we see no basis to distinguish these safety and security concerns from those deemed sufficient in hamilton.
the partial dissenting opinion attempts to distinguish hamilton by relying on a snippet from an unpublished opinion in pounders kempker.cir,where the panel noted that the record in hamilton had been fully developed as to the prison officials basis for denying the inmate requests.the dissent asserts that the record in this case was not so developed.a look beyond the snippet to context,however,demonstrates that pounders reviewed a district court dismissal of an inmate complaint.by a record that was fully developed in hamilton,the pounders panel meant a hearing at which various officials testified,as opposed to the record in pounders,which included nothing but the complaint.id.at.the record here,of course,involves a hearing at which various officials testified it includes a complete bench trial conducted over three days with ten witnesses.
the dissent also relies on teterud burns,cir,which refused to defer to a prison warden opinion on hair net and reidentification requirements,because it was unsupported by empirical proof.id.at.hamilton distinguished teterud,holding that the hair length regulation was founded on the legitimate concern that prison safety would be compromised by inmates concealing contraband in their long hair or identifying with a particular gang.at.so too here.hamilton relied for empirical proof on the testimony of prison officials,based on their collective experience in administering correctional facilities,that prison security requires them to prevent inmates from concealing contraband in their long hair.id.at.the district court here relied on testimony of experienced prison officials,who opined that the policy was necessary to prevent inmates from concealing contraband in their long hair or changing appearance after an escape,and who described specific,empirical examples of inmates who had done just these things under a previous policy that permitted long hair.there is no material distinction between this case and hamilton.see also rogers scurr,cir decision vacating district court injunction against policy prohibiting the wearing of caps and robes outside prayer meetings,where explanation of prison officials that the attire makes it too easy to conceal contraband was eminently reasonable.
this case is unlike murphy missouri department of corrections,a decision in which the court found a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether the prison refusal to permit group worship by white separatists was necessary to prevent racial violence.murphy did not require evidence that racial violence had in fact occurred in the form of a riot,but said that some evidence must be presented to show that the prison decision was the least restrictive means necessary to preserve its security interest.it was not clear in murphy that the prison had considered any other options the only evidence presented was testimony suggesting that the inmate was a racist,and that his religion limited participation to anglo saxon individuals.arkansas officials,by contrast,not only considered other options,they tried one.under the former adc policy,which permitted long hair,prison officials found that use of long hair to conceal contraband or to change appearance after an escape had in fact occurred.the district court decision is thus entirely consistent with murphy requirement that some evidence short of an actual incident be presented in support of a challenged policy.
fegans argues alternatively that the uniform regulation for male inmates is not the least restrictive means available,because the adc is able to address safety and security concerns in the women barracks while allowing hair.in contrast to male prisoners,however,female prisoners are housed in a single unit,and thus have less opportunity to obtain and transport contraband.see kellensworth norris,cv sww,slip op.at,since most female inmates are housed in a single unit,the security concerns attendant with daily transfers of male inmates are not nearly as great.reproduced at doc.based on his more than thirty years with the adc,norris gave this further explanation for the distinction in policy women are not generally as violent as men.they are not as escape prone as men.they are not as prone to give us problems with contraband as men.tr.unlike the situation in warsoldier woodford,cir,the record here includes no data to refute norris expert testimony about the relative security risks in the male and female facilities,and the district court credited norris unrebutted testimony.this finding of fact is not clearly erroneous,and given that factual premise,the district court correctly held that the differing hair regulations for men and women did not undermine the adc contention that its regulation for males was the least restrictive means available to satisfy security concerns 
fegans also claims that ad is not the least restrictive means available,because other prison systems employ more liberal grooming policies.these other policies,however,were rejected by norris and the adc as less effective in meeting the adc security and safety concerns we concluded in hamilton that a lthough prison policies from other jurisdictions provide some evidence as to the feasibility of implementing a less restrictive means of achieving prison safety and security,it does not outweigh the deference owed to the expert judgment of prison officials who are infinitely more familiar with their own institutions than outside observers.hamilton,at.norris opined that more liberal policies would be less effective in the adc,because he had seen one of these policies at work in the past,and our security was nearly as good then as it is now.fegans did not effectively rebut this testimony.
finally,fegans proposes that a less restrictive alternative would be to house inmates seeking a religious exemption in administrative segregation,apart from the general inmate population,in order to alleviate security concerns.this proposal,however,does not lessen the safety risk to correctional officials assigned to pat down the prisoners,and it would place a strain on the adc facilities,which are already full.see cutter,at.observing that lawmakers supporting rluipa expected that courts would apply the statute with deference to the expertise of prison administrators who must act consistent with consideration of costs and limited resources.because this option,like the others proposed by fegans,would allow accommodation of religious observances to override other significant state interests,see id.at,we agree with the district court that ad withstands scrutiny under rluipa.
fegans constitutional claims fail under the applicable reasonableness standard,at.turner,at.as we noted in hamilton,when a prison regulation impinges on inmates constitutional rights,the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.at quoting turner safley,d.given the district court unassailable finding that long hair poses a threat to security,the adc regulation does not violate an inmate constitutional right to the free exercise of his religion.hamilton,at iron eyes henry,cir.for similar reasons,the adc regulation does not violate fegans constitutional right to equal protection of the laws.as the factual record stands in this case,the district court did not err in concluding that the adc has a valid reason for differing rules for men and women,and that the regulations are reasonably related to the state legitimate,penological interests of safety and security.
fegans also contends that the requirement of the grooming policy that he shave his beard violates his rights under the first amendment and rluipa.in explaining the justification for this rule,norris testified that the prohibition on facial hair keeps inmates from being able to change their appearance,and makes it easier for law enforcement to track and identify an inmate after an escape.norris also suggested that long beards,like long hair,facilitate the transport of contraband.these safety and security concerns are compelling governmental interests.see cutter,at.
fegans acknowledges that institutional security is a compelling interest,but argues that the shaving requirement is not the least restrictive means available to address these concerns.he observes that the adc grants a medical exemption from the shaving requirement for inmates with a diagnosed dermatological condition,and contends that this exemption shows that the adc can permit facial hair without endangering institutional security.
the adc medical exemption does not win the day for fegans,because he has not been disciplined merely for growing facial hair consistent with that exemption,facial hair that does not exceed a in length,and he did not communicate to the adc or testify at trial that the medical exemption would satisfy his religious beliefs.rather,fegans testified that his religion requires that he refrain from rounding the corners of his beard,and he was disciplined for wearing a beard that was uncut altogether.the beard permitted by the medical exemption has rounded corners,and we therefore presume that it is not satisfactory to fegans.this is not a case,therefore,in which the adc grants an exemption to some inmates for medical reasons,but refuses to grant the same exemption to another inmate for religious reasons.fraternal order of police newark lodge city of newark,cir.we need not decide whether such a distinction would be permissible under rluipa or the first amendment,because the record does not present the question 
on this record,the adc disciplined fegans for wearing an uncut beard.the record shows that uncut beards create safety and security concerns that are not presented by faces or beards.norris explained at trial that an uncut beard would make identification more difficult and would facilitate the smuggling of contraband.an uncut beard creates a better disguise for an escapee than a beard,because it conceals the contours of an inmate face.tr.and an uncut beard allows a prisoner to transport contraband,while a beard is too short to serve that purpose.see green polunsky,cir.in applying this policy to fegans,prison officials were aware of his disciplinary history,which included two previous escape attempts and the smuggling of contraband within the prison.tr.we therefore agree with the district court that the adc demonstrated a compelling penological interest in prohibiting fegans from wearing an uncut beard,and that this prohibition was the least restrictive means available to further that interest.
for all of its criticism of the adc grooming policies,the dissent,in the end,is not prepared to order the prison to permit fegans to grow long hair and a full beard.rather,the dissent urges a remand to give the prison the opportunity to conduct the individualized review rluipa requires.post,at.we do not agree with the implication that rluipa calls for the federal courts to impose procedural requirements on the internal disciplinary processes used by prison administrators.fegans was afforded individualized consideration at a bench trial in which the adc was required to prove that the burden imposed on fegans religious exercise by the grooming regulations was the least restrictive means of furthering the compelling governmental interests in order,safety,and security.moreover,particularly given the supreme court emphasis in cutter on giving due deference to the experience and expertise of prison and jail administrators in establishing necessary regulations and procedures to maintain good order,security and discipline,consistent with consideration of costs and limited resources,at.emphasis added internal quotation omitted,we do not interpret rluipa to prevent a prison from applying certain important security regulations to all inmates without providing for exemptions.see gonzales o centro espirita beneficente uniao do vegetal,d we do not doubt that there may be instances in which a need for uniformity precludes the recognition of exceptions to generally applicable laws under rfra.
fegans constitutional challenges to the prohibition on uncut beards fail for the same reasons.the adc has established that it has a compelling interest in safety and security,and that the grooming policy is reasonably related to those interests.see,at.
fegans claims that the district court abused its discretion in awarding only in damages for the adc failure to provide kosher meals.aside from punitive damages,the prison litigation and reform act limits recovery for mental or emotional injury to nominal damages only.royal kautzky,cir.we conclude that an award of for each constitutional violation is a sufficient nominal damage award,and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to award a greater amount.see id.at affirming award of one dollar in nominal damages.to the extent that fegans appeals the district court refusal to award punitive damages,we discern no abuse of discretion.the district court accurately stated the legal standard for an award of punitive damages,but found that norris and the adc did not act with malice,and that punitive damages were not warranted to deter future unlawful conduct,because the adc already had instituted a policy for providing kosher meals.these reasons are sufficient to support the court ruling.
fegans also challenges the district court dismissal,with prejudice,of his state law claims.as the district court held,employees of the state of arkansas acting in their official capacity are immune from civil suits for damages.see fegans norris.while prison officials acting in their individual capacities may be liable for damages if they act with malice,id.at grine bd.of trustees,the district court did not clearly err in finding that fegans failed to present evidence of malice.accordingly,the district court properly dismissed the state law claims.
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
i join the majority opinion except for sections and.because i disagree with the majority conclusions regarding fegans rluipa claims and would reverse and remand,i respectfully dissent.
rluipa requires strict scrutiny.a.while i agree with the majority that context matters in the application of rluipa standard and that we must accord due deference to the experience and expertise of prison and jail administrators in applying rluipa,ante at quotation omitted,i believe the majority accords norris conclusory justifications a level of deference that is contrary to rluipa.under rluipa,prison officials have the burden of establishing that their policy is the least restrictive means to achieve a compelling government interest.see also hamilton schriro,cir noting that under rfra,prison officials bear the burden of demonstrating that the regulation is the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling interest.norris has the burden of demonstrating that the grooming policy is the least restrictive means to achieve security as applied to fegans.see a providing that prisons can not impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in an institution even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability emphasis added see also gonzales o centro espirita beneficente uniao do vegetal,d determining rfra requires individualized review koger bryan,cir noting that rluipa,unlike the free exercise clause of the constitution,requires individualized review spratt dep t of,cir rejecting the prison all or nothing argument and finding that the prison must establish that prison security is furthered by barring the individual from engaging in the disputed conduct washington klem,cir noting that rluipa requires an assessment of whether the government action is the least restrictive means as applied to the individual.norris must not only justify the policy as a whole,but he must also justify his failure to grant a exception to fegans.
in upholding the grooming policy,the majority relies on hamilton,a case where we upheld a prison regulation.ante at.in hamilton,however,we upheld the regulation based on a record that was fully developed as to the prison officials basis for denying the inmate requests pounders kempker,cir unpublished citing hamilton,at and noting that the decision was based on a fully developed record detailing the prison officials decision.in this case,the record indicates norris never even considered granting fegans a exception,and the record is certainly not fully developed as to norris basis for denying fegans request.tr.also,in hamilton,we explicitly distinguished a case where we struck down a regulation because the only reason advanced in support of the regulation was the warden opinion,unsupported by empirical proof,that another alternative would be unworkable.hamilton,at distinguishing teterud burns,cir.furthermore,contrary to the facts of this case,the inmate in hamilton was in a maximum security facility when he was denied the exception,at,and the hamilton court was not faced with claims that evidence,such as a disparity in grooming policies among males and females or a medical exception,indicates that the grooming regulation could not possibly be the least restrictive alternative,see id.at.
our decision in murphy.dep t of,cir,a case decided under rluipa,is instructive.we remanded murphy,noting that the prison did not demonstrate that it seriously considered any other alternatives to a regulation alleged to infringe on prisoners free exercise of religion.at.the prison denied a request by members of the christian separatist church society,a religion that believes caucasians are uniquely blessed by god,to engage in group worship.id.at.prison officials testified that they denied the request,fearing the worship services would result in racial violence.we acknowledged in murphy,and i acknowledge here,that prison officials security concerns are valid,id.at nevertheless,under rluipa higher standard of review,prison authorities must provide some basis for their concern that safety problems will result from any accommodation of the request.id.at.
in justifying policies under rluipa,prison authorities must do more than offer conclusory statements and post hoc rationalizations for their conduct.hamilton,at citing,at,as reprinted in.prison officials can not justify restrictions on religious exercise by simply citing to the need to maintain order and security in a prison.they must demonstrate that they actually considered and rejected the efficacy of less restrictive measures before adopting the challenged practice.alvarez hill,cir citations and quotations omitted.
the majority does not,and can not,dispute that norris must conduct an individualized review and that strict scrutiny applies to norris decision not to grant a exception to fegans.instead,the majority opinion indicates that norris did conduct an individualized review and that he determined that the grooming policy as applied to fegans was the least restrictive means to achieve security.ante at.however,the majority does not point to any evidence that prison officials considered whether to apply the policy to fegans.instead,the majority points to evidence that prison officials considered alternatives when formulating the policy as a whole.ante at.the majority opinion also does not cite to any evidence that norris considered granting fegans an exception.norris testified he was sure prison officials considered other alternatives to the grooming policy that would achieve security however,he could not recall any of these alternatives,nor remember how long they were considered,tr,although he did testify that none of the alternatives involved a religious exception,tr.regardless of whether norris failure to recall was because he forgot or because he never considered other alternatives,the record does not include any examples of less restrictive alternatives norris considered when the policy was formulated or when declining to grant fegans an exception.in fact,norris explicitly testified that he would not consider granting a exception to anyone,regardless of the sincerity of their beliefs,tr,and the prison warden testified he would not have considered granting one to fegans,tr.considering all the evidence the district court credited,there is still no indication that prison officials seriously considered any alternatives to the grooming policy that would not substantially burden fegans religious exercise.thus,as a matter of law,i do not believe the policy can be upheld under rluipa.see murphy,at remanding because the record did not indicate the prison seriously considered any other alternatives,nor were any explored before the district court.
the majority opinion concludes that prison officials were aware of his disciplinary history i n applying this policy to fegans.ante at.while an inmate disciplinary history may lead prison officials to conclude that security can only be achieved by applying a policy without exception to that inmate,the record does not reflect that prison officials considered fegans disciplinary history in declining to grant him an e
