introduction 
union carbide corporation appeals from a judgment entered in favor of plaintiffs bobbie izell and helen izell on claims for personal injuries and loss of consortium stemming from izell alleged exposure to union carbide asbestos and subsequent diagnosis with mesothelioma.after a trial the jury returned special verdicts finding union carbide percent comparatively at fault for plaintiffs injuries and awarding plaintiffs million in compensatory damages plus million in punitive damages against union carbide.by remittitur,which plaintiffs accepted,the trial court reduced the compensatory damage award to million,but declined to disturb the punitive damages.
on appeal,union carbide contends the evidence was insufficient to support the liability finding,apportionment of comparative fault,and the remitted compensatory damage award.union carbide also challenges the punitive damage award as excessive.we conclude the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict,as well as the compensatory and punitive damage awards.accordingly,we affirm.
facts and procedural background 
union carbide purchased an asbestos mine near coalinga,california in.until,union carbide supplied asbestos to companies that manufactured and marketed products for the construction industry.
izell owned a construction business that built approximately homes in southern california from until.izell did not work as a laborer or supervisor on these projects,but he regularly visited and walked through the construction jobsites.all the homes were constructed with drywall interiors.izell workers applied various brands of premixed joint compound to cover nail heads,fill the seams between drywall boards,and fill corner sections of drywall.once the joint compound dried,the workers sanded it one to three times,usually with sandpaper on a long pole,then by hand.izell often was present when his workers sanded the joint compound.he described the resulting dust as a little fog in the air.he also recalled breathing dust that was disturbed when his workers swept the excess joint compound from the floor.
izell workers also used gun plastic cement to apply stucco to the homes exterior.izell was present when his workers tore open bags of gun plastic cement,and he breathed the dust from those products as well.
izell recalled seeing four different brands of joint compound on his jobsites and two brands of gun plastic cement.of the joint compound brands,izell believed georgia pacific was the most common brand because it was the dominate seller in those days,followed by hamilton red dot,kaiser gypsum,and kelly moore paco brand.izell also saw his workers use riverside and colton gun plastic cement.at varying times from to,union carbide supplied asbestos to each of the four joint compound manufacturers and to riverside for use in its gun plastic cement.
in july,at the age of,izell was diagnosed with mesothelioma.initially,plaintiffs sued more than defendants who were allegedly responsible for the products to which he claimed he was exposed.by trial,only five defendants remained,including union carbide,one joint compound manufacturer kaiser gypsum,one stucco manufacturer la habra and two gun plastic cement manufacturers colton and riverside.
after hearing percipient witness and expert medical and scientific testimony,the jury returned a special verdict finding all defendants liable on all theories of strict product liability and negligence.the jury awarded plaintiffs a total of million in compensatory damages,consisting of million in past and million in future damages to izell and million in past and million in future loss of consortium damages to izell.
the special verdict form also asked the jury to apportion comparative fault among the defendants,izell,and six other entities,consisting of three joint compound manufacturers georgia pacific,hamilton,and kelly moore,two asbestos suppliers carey canadian and johns manville,and an unnamed pipe manufacturer.the jury apportioned percent of the fault to the five defendants,assigning percent to union carbide,percent to kaiser gypsum,and a total of percent to the three stucco and gun plastic cement manufacturers.the jury allocated the remaining percent to the joint compound manufacturers and asbestos suppliers,finding each responsible for a percent share of the comparative fault.no fault was apportioned to izell or the pipe manufacturer.
the jury also found union carbide and kaiser gypsum acted with malice,oppression or fraud.boldface omitted.kaiser gypsum settled before the jury was asked to decide the amount of punitive damages.
for the punitive damage phase,union carbide stipulated that it had a present net worth of billion.the court instructed the jury that it should consider a variety of factors in deciding the amount,if any,of punitive damages to award,including a reasonable relationship between the amount of punitive damages and the harm to izell.the jury also was instructed that it could consider evidence of harm caused to others for purposes of assessing reprehensibility,but not for purposes of punishing the defendant directly for harm caused to others.
in his argument to the jury,plaintiffs counsel commented there was probably no amount of money that could deter union carbide,given its billion net worth.thus,counsel suggested the jury award something in the range of million for each year of izell life and million million for each year union carbide sold asbestos after it knew its product caused cancer.the jury returned a verdict awarding plaintiffs million in punitive damages.
union carbide moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict jnov and a new trial on all issues,including punitive damages.the trial court denied the jnov motion,but conditionally granted a new trial on the ground of excessive compensatory damages only,unless plaintiffs consented to a remittitur reducing the compensatory damage award from million to million.the court declined to disturb the punitive damage award,concluding union carbide stipulated billion net worth and the evidence concerning the reprehensibility of its conduct supported the amount of the award,notwithstanding the substantial reduction in compensatory damages.plaintiffs accepted the remittitur and the court entered judgment against union carbide.
discussion 
substantial evidence supports the jury causation finding 
in the context of a cause of action for latent injuries,the plaintiff must first establish some threshold exposure to the defendant defective products,and must further establish in reasonable medical probability that a particular exposure or series of exposures was a legal cause of his injury,a substantial factor in bringing about the injury t he plaintiff may meet the burden of proving that exposure to defendant product was a substantial factor causing the illness by showing that in reasonable medical probability it was a substantial factor contributing to the plaintiff or decedent risk of developing cancer.rutherford owens illinois,cal th,fn.omitted rutherford.we review a jury causation finding for substantial evidence.jones john crane,th.
union carbide contends the jury necessarily speculated in finding izell was exposed to union carbide asbestos and that the exposure contributed to his risk of developing mesothelioma.we conclude the evidence of causation was sufficient.
substantial evidence supports the finding that izell was exposed to asbestos supplied by union carbide 
a threshold issue in asbestos litigation is exposure to the defendant product.mcgonnell kaiser gypsum th,mcgonnell rutherford,supra,cal th at.it is axiomatic that,i f there has been no exposure,there is no causation.mcgonnell,at.further,t he mere possibility of exposure is insufficient to establish causation.andrews foster wheeler llc th,dumin owens corning fiberglas th,dumin.p roof that raises mere speculation,suspicion,surmise,guess or conjecture is not enough to sustain the plaintiff burden of persuasion.ulwelling crown coach d.
in mcgonnell,the court affirmed summary judgment in favor of the defendant,concluding the plaintiffs limited circumstantial evidence was insufficient to establish more than the mere possibility that the decedent had been exposed to the defendant joint compound.in opposing summary judgment,the plaintiffs in mcgonnell offered invoices showing the sale of the defendant joint compound to a contractor in,which indicated the materials were purchased for a project at the decedent workplace.mcgonnell,supra,th at.based on this evidence,the mcgonnell court acknowledged it was at least within the realm of possibility that the decedent encountered a wall with the defendant joint compound during his years of employment.ibid.however,the court held this possibility alone was insufficient to create a triable issue of fact,because a finding of exposure would necessarily require speculation that at some time the decedent might have cut into a wall that might have contained the defendant joint compound that might have contained asbestos.ibid.the mcgonnell court concluded the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,create d only a dwindling stream of probabilities that narrow into conjecture,and thus summary judgment was properly granted.accord dumin,supra,th at affirming directed verdict where defendant product was only one of many asbestos insulation products used at the shipyard,such that a conclusion that plaintiff was exposed to defendant product would require a stream of conjecture and surmise whitmire ingersoll rand th,evidence that defendant specified asbestos insulation at plant in the was insufficient to create triable issue where plaintiffs submitted no evidence that the materials installed in the early were more likely than not still present when decedent was employed there in.
union carbide contends the evidence in this case,as in mcgonnell,established only the mere possibility that izell was exposed to union carbide asbestos at some unspecified time during the year period in question.in support of this contention,union carbide cites evidence indicating there were multiple asbestos suppliers for the joint compound and gun plastic cement products that izell remembers encountering at his jobsites.thus,while union carbide concedes it supplied asbestos that could have been in one or all of these products,it argues the jury necessarily speculated in concluding izell was more likely than not exposed to union carbide asbestos,as opposed to asbestos from one of the other suppliers.
as we shall explain,though we agree the evidence allowed only speculation with respect to the products manufactured by kelly moore,georgia pacific,kaiser gypsum and riverside,with respect to the hamilton joint compound,we conclude the evidence was sufficient to permit a reasonable inference that izell was exposed to union carbide asbestos.
i kelly moore 
at trial,plaintiffs presented a collection of invoices showing union carbide supplied kelly moore san carlos,california plant with several hundred thousand pounds of raw asbestos from to.however,the uncontradicted evidence established that kelly moore had multiple asbestos suppliers during this time period,of which union carbide was only a minor supplier.specifically,a former kelly moore employee offered undisputed testimony that union carbide supplied only percent of the asbestos kelly moore purchased for its paco textures division the division that manufactured the company asbestos containing products while carey canadian supplied percent and johns manville supplied percent 
because the invoices show union carbide supplied asbestos to kelly moore san carlos,california plant,plaintiffs argue a reasonable inference,beyond speculation,can be drawn that joint compound containing union carbide asbestos made its way to one of the southern california jobsites where izell inhaled dust from a kelly moore product.we disagree.in view of the uncontested evidence that kelly moore had multiple asbestos suppliers during the relevant time period,the fact that union carbide supplied asbestos to a plant in california does not remove the issue from the realm of speculation.as union carbide points out,plaintiffs failed to show what percentage of the asbestos supplied to kelly moore san carlos plant came from union carbide,as opposed to some other supplier,let alone that kelly moore paco textures division had other plants outside of san carlos,california.moreover,even if supplying kelly moore san carlos plant enhanced the possibility that union carbide asbestos made its way to one of izell jobsites,this still leaves speculation about whether izell was present when his workers sanded joint compound that might have contained union carbide asbestos,as opposed to asbestos from one of kelly moore other suppliers.mcgonnell,supra,th at.
ii georgia pacific 
izell testified that he inhaled dust from georgia pacific ready mix joint compound on jobsites in southern california during the mid to late.he identified the georgia pacific joint compound as a pasty thing,the premixed compound that came in five gallon buckets weighing pounds.plaintiffs contend the jury could have reasonably inferred that izell was more likely than not exposed to union carbide asbestos from georgia pacific joint compound because the evidence showed that all ready mix manufactured at georgia pacific acme,texas plant between september and may contained union carbide asbestos.this assertion would have merit if the joint compound from the texas plant had been the only premixed product that georgia pacific sold in california under the ready mix brand during the relevant time period.the undisputed evidence established it was not.
because ready mix was percent water and the freight on the water would make it uncompetitive for georgia pacific to ship the product from texas to california,the undisputed evidence showed that from to,georgia pacific had a formal rebranding agreement in which a paco kelly moore facility in california made joint compounds and cements at their facility and put them in georgia pacific containers.after the rebranding agreement expired in,georgia pacific individual distribution centers in california were allowed to purchase rebranded ready mix from anybody they wanted,including kelly moore.according to the uncontested testimony of a former georgia pacific employee,the reason for this distribution arrangement was the same as had motivated the former rebranding agreement georgia pacific could get the product economically to california.
plaintiffs argue the evidence was in conflict as to whether ready mix joint compound from georgia pacific texas plant made its way to the southern california market.they stress that,on appeal,this conflict must be resolved in favor of the jury verdict however,even if we assume a genuine conflict exists,when viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment,the evidence still required the jury to speculate as to whether izell might have inhaled dust from ready mix joint compound manufactured at georgia pacific texas plant where union carbide asbestos was used,or kelly moore california facility where asbestos from multiple suppliers was used,or some other joint compound manufacturer that contracted with one of georgia pacific individual distribution centers during the period.absent a minimum evidentiary showing that ready mix joint compound manufactured at georgia pacific texas plant was used on one of izell jobsites,the jury could only speculate as to whether izell inhaled dust containing union carbide asbestos.see dumin,supra,th at.
iii kaiser gypsum and riverside 
for the reasons already discussed with respect to kelly moore and georgia pacific,we also conclude the evidence was insufficient to support anything more than speculation that izell was exposed to union carbide asbestos from kaiser gypsum joint compound or riverside gun plastic cement.
with respect to kaiser gypsum,the undisputed evidence showed that kaiser gypsum purchased asbestos from many different suppliers,of which carey canadian and johns manville were the two largest.as they did with kelly moore,plaintiffs offered union carbide invoices showing that it supplied several hundred thousand pounds of raw asbestos to a kaiser gypsum plant in southern california between to part of the period during which izell testified he inhaled dust from kaiser gypsum joint compound.plaintiffs,however,failed to offer evidence establishing that union carbide was the exclusive asbestos supplier for this plant,let alone evidence showing that joint compound from this plant found its way to one of izell jobsites.
the evidence was even more speculative with respect to riverside gun plastic cement.the parties stipulated that union carbide was a minority supplier to riverside during only one year and izell testified he saw workers dump riverside gun plastic cement into a mixer in the late.even if we accept as a reasonable inference from this testimony that izell inhaled dust from riverside gun plastic cement in,there still is no evidence establishing this dust contained asbestos from riverside minority supplier union carbide as opposed to any of its larger suppliers.any finding of exposure based on this evidence would have been speculative.dumin,supra,th at.
iv hamilton 
in contrast to the foregoing,the evidence adduced with respect to hamilton supported a reasonable inference that union carbide was hamilton exclusive asbestos supplier during the time period when izell inhaled dust from hamilton red dot joint compound.hamilton president,willis hamilton,testified that,from the through,all of hamilton taping and embedding joint compound contained asbestos.hamilton also affirmed that,during this same period,the asbestos used to make hamilton joint compound was all union carbide.italics added.
as for exposure,izell testified that,apart from georgia pacific,which was the dominate joint compound seller at that time,he most frequently encountered hamilton red dot joint compound on his jobsites.hamilton described its red dot product as an all purpose joint system.izell testified that his workers used the joint compound to fill in seams between sections of drywall,cover nail heads,and fill in corner sections.when the joint compound dried,the workers sanded it,dispersing a fog of dust into the air.izell testified that he inhaled dust from hamilton red dot joint compound during the mid to late.coupled with hamilton testimony,this evidence was sufficient to support a reasonable inference that izell more likely than not inhaled union carbide asbestos.
union carbide argues hamilton memory was too faulty to credit his testimony that union carbide was ever hamilton exclusive asbestos supplier.in support of the contention,union carbide cites its own records as evidence that it did not start selling asbestos to hamilton until,which it argues undisputedly refutes hamilton testimony that his company used all union carbide asbestos in its joint taping compound from the through the.italics added.union carbide also points out that when hamilton was asked about these records,he conceded he could not recall when hamilton started purchasing asbestos from union carbide.
though the foregoing discrepancies suggest that hamilton memory was not perfect,union carbide objection concerns only his credibility and the weight of his testimony not the sufficiency of the evidence.see wright best cal d,inconsistencies evidencing a faulty memory do not go to the admissibility or sufficiency of the evidence,but rather to the weight of the testimony and the credibility of the witnesses,matters wholly within the exclusive province of the trier of fact,whose determination upon them will not be disturbed by an appellate court.while the jury could have entirely disregarded hamilton testimony based on these inconsistencies,it also could reasonably have inferred that he was confused about the start date,but correct in his recollection that union carbide became his company exclusive supplier once it started selling asbestos to hamilton 
union carbide also contends it is speculative whether izell ever inhaled asbestos from a hamilton product,because the evidence showed that,in addition to its joint compound,hamilton also sold a drywall topping compound that did not contain asbestos.the record does not support this contention.though there was evidence of hamilton topping compound,there was no evidence that it ever was used on any of izell jobsites.izell testimony exclusively concerned hamilton red dot all purpose joint compound,which his workers used to fill in seams,cover nail heads,and fill corner sections of drywall functions that can not be performed with a topping compound due to its lower adhesive content izell never mentioned hamilton topping compound,and union carbide made no attempt to elicit this testimony from him.
viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment,the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that izell was exposed to union carbide asbestos when he inhaled dust from hamilton red dot joint compound.
substantial evidence supports the finding that union carbide asbestos was a substantial factor in increasing izell risk of developing mesothelioma 
in addition to establishing some threshold exposure to the defendant defective products,a plaintiff in an cancer case must further establish in reasonable medical probability that a particular exposure or series of exposures was a legal cause of his injury,a substantial factor in bringing about the injury.rutherford,supra,cal th at.however,given the long latency period of disease,and the occupational settings that commonly exposed the worker to multiple forms and brands of asbestos products with varying degrees of toxicity,our supreme court has held that a plaintiff need not prove with medical exactitude that fibers from a particular defendant products were those,or among those,that actually began the cellular process of malignancy.id.at.rather,a plaintiff may meet the burden of proving that exposure to defendant product was a substantial factor causing the illness by showing that in reasonable medical probability it was a substantial factor contributing to the plaintiff or decedent risk of developing cancer.id.at.
as our supreme court explained in rutherford,t he substantial factor standard is a relatively broad one,requiring only that the contribution of the individual cause be more than negligible or theoretical.rutherford,supra,cal th at.thus,a plaintiff who suffers from an cancer and has proven exposure to inhalable asbestos fibers from several products will not,generally speaking,face insuperable difficulties in convincing a jury that a particular one of these product exposures,or several of them,were substantial factors in creating the risk of asbestos disease or latent injury.ibid.under rutherford,a plaintiff is free to establish that his particular asbestos disease is cumulative in nature,with many separate exposures each having constituted a substantial factor citation that contributed to his risk of injury,and a defendant can not escape liability simply because it can not be determined with medical exactitude the precise contribution that exposure to fibers from defendant products made to plaintiff ultimate contraction of disease id.at.
union carbide contends plaintiffs medical evidence was inadequate to establish legal causation under the rutherford test.in particular,union carbide emphasizes the following testimony by plaintiffs medical expert,eugene mark,which it claims improperly conflates a threshold showing of exposure with proof of legal causation 
question if izell was exposed to asbestos supplied by union carbide that went into some of these various joint compounds,would the union carbide asbestos have been a contributing cause of his mesothelioma as well 
answer all of the asbestos together contributes to cause mesothelioma.the asbestos fibers do come into the body labeled union carbide.they come in as asbestos fibers with certain physical,chemical,and biological principles.and those asbestos fibers,all of them together in total,contributed to cause this disease.italics added.
union carbide asserts the foregoing testimony can not be squared with rutherford causation test.under mark approach,union carbide argues,it is only the first step proof of exposure that matters,because every exposure contributes to the overall increase in risk thus,t he second step would be wholly unnecessary,since proof of exposure automatically equates with proof that the exposure constituted a substantial factor.this argument does not withstand scrutiny.
to begin,the purported fallacy union carbide claims that the second step of the rutherford test would be wholly unnecessary under mark approach disregards the fact that mark expert medical testimony is the evidence that satisfies rutherford second step.in other words,proof of exposure establishes legal causation only if the jury accepts mark expert medical testimony that all exposures constitute a substantial factor contributing to the risk of developing mesothelioma.this is not inconsistent with rutherford causation test.nothing in rutherford precludes a plaintiff from establishing legal causation through opinion testimony by a competent medical expert to the effect that every exposure to respirable asbestos contributes to the risk of developing mesothelioma.on the contrary,rutherford acknowledges the scientific debate between the every exposure and insignificant exposure camps,and recognizes that the conflict is one for the jury to resolve.see rutherford,supra,cal th at,discussing jury resolution of conflict between defense expert opinion that a very light or brief exposure could be considered insignificant or at least nearly so in assessing increased risk of cancer and plaintiffs expert contrary opinion that each exposure,even a relatively small one,contributed to the occupational dose and hence to the risk of cancer noting jury rejected defendant argument that such a small contribution should be considered insubstantial.
in any event,union carbide argument ignores the distinction mark drew between significant exposures that contributed to izell risk of contracting the disease and trivial exposures that would not have been substantial factors increasing his risk.in particular,mark testified that asbestos fibers had to be respirable and put into the air and izell needed to have breathed it in for the exposure to constitute a substantial contributing factor toward his mesothelioma.in contrast,mark testified that if izell had been exposed to asbestos in a wet slurry this would be a trivial exposure,and i would not be able to say that that was a contributing factor.contrary to union carbide characterization,mark did not opine that every exposure constituted a substantial factor.rather,he testified that only those exposures in which the product was dry enough so that asbestos fibers could be released into the air,and the asbestos became airborne and izell breathed it in would be significant enough to contribute to his risk of contracting cancer.
as discussed above,plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that izell was exposed to union carbide asbestos contained in hamilton red dot joint compound.izell testified that he not only saw his workers apply hamilton red dot in its wet form,but he also watched them sand the dried product,and inhaled the resulting dust when it became airborne.viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment,this evidence,coupled with mark expert testimony,is sufficient to establish in reasonable medical probability that exposure to union carbide asbestos was a substantial factor contributing to izell risk of contracting mesothelioma.see hernandez amcord,th,testimony regarding dust which would become airborne and settle on the plaintiff face and expert testimony suggesting that if an individual is exposed to many different products,each of those products would contribute to an increased risk of disease,as long as the asbestos was inhaled and retained in the worker body held sufficient to establish legal causation under rutherford.
substantial evidence supports the jury apportionment of comparative fault 
after making liability findings as to each defendant,the jury was asked in the special verdict form to assign a percentage of responsibility to those defendants found liable for plaintiffs injuries and those entities or product descriptions named on the chart below that you determine contributed to bobbie izell harm.in addition to the five defendants and izell,the chart listed six other entities that were not parties to the trial three joint compound manufacturers georgia pacific,hamilton,and kelly moore,two asbestos suppliers carey canadian and johns manville,and an unnamed pipe manufacturer.the verdict form instructed the jury that the total of your apportionment must equal.boldface omitted.
the jury apportioned percent fault to union carbide,percent to kaiser gypsum,percent to the three other defendants,and one percent fault to each of the five joint compound manufacturers and asbestos suppliers.the jury apportioned no fault to the unnamed pipe manufacturer or izell.union carbide contends the jury allocations are not supported by substantial evidence.we disagree.
on review for substantial evidence,we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,giving that party the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolving conflicts in support of the judgment.citation.citation.under this standard,the appellate court may not substitute its judgment for that of the jury or set aside the jury finding if there is any evidence which under any reasonable view supports the jury apportionment.citation.pfeifer john crane,th,pfeifer.
as discussed above,the evidence established union carbide asbestos was a legal cause of plaintiffs injuries.thus,under established law,union carbide undisputedly had the burden to establish concurrent or alternate causes by proving that izell was exposed to defective products of other companies that the defective designs of the other companies products were legal causes of the plaintiffs injuries and the percentage of legal cause attributable to the other companies.stewart union carbide th,stewart.in the absence of such proof,or if the jury finding is supported by any reasonable view of the evidence,the comparative fault allocation can not be disturbed.see pfeifer,supra,th at absent evidence quantifying plaintiff exposure to asbestos from the other sources the jury reasonably allocated a percent share of comparative fault to appellant.
a.the pipe manufacturer 
union carbide argues the jury allocation of zero percent fault to the pipe manufacturer can not be squared with the evidence or plaintiffs theory of causation in this case.union carbide relies on izell testimony that he chiseled cement pipe and busted it up while working on construction projects during the and,coupled with testimony by plaintiffs materials expert,william longo,that chiseling cement pipe would result in exposure to elevated levels of crocidolite asbestos fibers.union carbide contends this evidence strongly suggests that exposure to pipe played a major role in causing izell disease,and,in view of plaintiffs purported theory that any exposure,however small,contributes to the overall dose,required the jury to allocate some portion of fault to the cement pipe manufacturer.
as we explained in connection with our discussion of causation,plaintiffs medical expert did not testify,as union carbide suggests,that any exposure constitutes a substantial factor toward increasing the risk of contracting mesothelioma.rather,mark testified the asbestos fibers had to be respirable and put into the air and izell needed to have breathed them in for the exposure to constitute a substantial contributing factor.though longo testimony concerning elevated levels might have supported an inference that chiseling cement pipe put respirable asbestos fibers into the air,this evidence did not require the jury to find that izell inhaled asbestos fibers when performing this work.
for its part,union carbide did not question izell about his cement pipe exposure.it elicited no testimony concerning the conditions under which he worked with the cement pipe such as whether he wore a mask or took other protective measure nor did it confirm,in contrast to the evidence concerning izell exposure to joint compound,that he inhaled dust from the cement pipe.absent such evidence,the jury was free to find that izell admitted exposure to pipe was not a legal cause of his injuries see stewart,supra,th at despite plaintiff admission that he was exposed to asbestos from many sources,jury reasonably allocated percent share of comparative fault to union carbide where it submitted no evidence detailing plaintiff exposure from other sources sparks owens illinois,th,jury reasonably found that defendant product was sole of plaintiff mesothelioma when defendant submitted no evidence specifying extent of plaintiff exposure to asbestos from other manufacturers products.
b.the asbestos suppliers 
union carbide contends the jury allocation of percent fault to it,but only one percent fault to johns manville and carey canadian,was disproportionate and unsupported,given evidence that johns manville was the biggest and carey canadian was a large asbestos supplier.additionally,union carbide emphasizes that izell claimed he was exposed to asbestos in joint compound throughout the and,while it did not begin selling asbestos for use in joint compound until.thus,union carbide argues,even if izell was exposed to some of its asbestos,the overwhelming evidence is that he was exposed to far more asbestos supplied by johns manville and carey canadian.
in view of the date union carbide entered into the joint compound market,it is reasonably likely that izell was exposed to asbestos from other suppliers.but this fact alone does not require,or even necessarily support,an inference that izell was exposed to asbestos from johns manville or carey canadian or some other asbestos supplier.once plaintiffs established union carbide asbestos was a legal cause of izell injury,union carbide had the burden to establish concurrent or alternate causes by proving that izell was exposed to another supplier asbestos,that the exposure was a legal cause of his injuries,and the percentage of legal cause attributable to the other supplier.stewart,supra,th at.as union carbide has argued,this required proof,beyond speculation,that izell inhaled dust containing johns manville or carey canadian asbestos before significant fault could be allocated to either of these companies.mcgonnell,supra,th at dumin,supra,th at.
in contrast to the evidence demonstrating that union carbide was hamilton exclusive asbestos supplier when izell inhaled dust from red dot joint compound,there was no evidence of an exclusive relationship between johns manville or carey canadian and any joint compound manufacturer.as union carbide argues in its opening brief,without proof that either entity was the sole asbestos supplier to any of the manufacturers,establishing exposure beyond speculation required it to prove not only that izell came into contact with specific products,but also that the asbestos in those products was supplied by johns manville or carey canadian,rather than another asbestos supplier.in allocating only nominal fault to these entities,the jury apparently determined union carbide did not carry its burden.this was not an unreasonable finding based on this record.stewart,supra,th at.
c.the joint compound manufacturers 
union carbide contends there is no evidence supporting the jury allocation of three percent total fault to the joint compound manufacturers georgia pacific,hamilton,and kelly moore,versus percent fault to kaiser gypsum.in view of izell testimony that he recalled seeing georgia pacific and hamilton joint compound on his jobsites more frequently than kaiser gypsum,union carbide argues the jury was compelled to allocate a greater proportion of comparative fault to these entities because,if kaiser gypsum joint compound was defective,then so too were the joint compounds sold by the other manufacturers.
the court in pfeifer rejected a similar argument,reasoning the jury was permitted to consider the egregiousness of a defendant conduct in apportioning the defendant a greater share of comparative fault for the plaintiff injuries.in that case,the defendant asbestos supplier,jci,challenged the jury finding allocating it percent of the fault for the plaintiff cancer,versus only percent for the navy.pfeifer,supra,th at.jci argued the evidence compelled a larger allocation of fault for the navy,because the duration of plaintiff naval service accounted for nearly half his exposure to products.id.at.the pfeifer court rejected jci argument,holding the jury was permitted to increase jci share of liability because it determined that jci misconduct was more egregious than the navy misconduct.ibid.the court explained,the evidence supported the inference that jci was consciously indifferent to the dangers that its products posed to consumers citation,while the navy was merely negligent regarding those dangers during the plaintiff period of service citation.the evidence was thus sufficient to support the jury allocation of comparative fault,in view of the differences in the length and gravity of jci and the navy misconduct.id.at.
so too here,the evidence supported an inference that kaiser gypsum conduct was more egregious than that of the other joint compound manufacturers,and the jury found kaiser gypsum acted with malice,oppression or fraud.boldface omitted.in,an internal kaiser gypsum memorandum detailed studies linking asbestos inhalation to lung cancer and mesothelioma,and advised kaiser gypsum employees to use a respirator with a filter especially designed for asbestos dust.notwithstanding these internal measures,the evidence also showed that as late as,kaiser gypsum sales staff was advised to tell customers that there was no asbestos in kaiser gypsum products.and,the evidence showed the sales staff carried this message to customers because,as one kaiser gypsum sales person put it,i f you had asbestos in your product,it would be negative towards sales.the evidence was sufficient to support the jury allocation of greater fault to kaiser gypsum,given the gravity of its misconduct.pfeifer,supra,th at see also daly general motors cal d,observing principles of comparative fault elevate justice and equity above the exact contours of a mathematical equation.
substantial evidence supports the amount of compensatory damages after remittitur 
we next consider union carbide contention that the compensatory damages award,in the remitted amount of million for and izell past and future noneconomic damages and loss of consortium is excessive and unsupported by the evidence.we begin with the principles that prescribe our circumscribed scope of review.
the amount of damages is a fact question,first committed to the discretion of the jury and next to the discretion of the trial judge on a motion for new trial.they see and hear the witnesses and frequently,as in this case,see the injury and the impairment that has resulted therefrom.as a result,all presumptions are in favor of the decision of the trial court citation.the power of the appellate court differs materially from that of the trial court in passing on this question.an appellate court can interfere on the ground that the judgment is excessive only on the ground that the verdict is so large that,at first blush,it shocks the conscience and suggests passion,prejudice or corruption on the part of the jury.seffert los angeles transit lines cal d,seffert.

in the instant case,the trial court statement of decision thoughtfully sets forth the competing evidence,the court observations of the witnesses demeanor,and the court factual findings supporting its reduction of compensatory damages to million.accordingly,we quote the trial court decision in its entirety 
bobbie izell,age at the time of trial,was diagnosed with mesothelioma in july of,approximately months before the trial.he and his wife helen had been married for years,and were living comfortably in retirement near family.bobbie izell,who had a successful career in building and selling homes,was diagnosed with mesothelioma,a fatal lung disease,during a doctor visit for an unrelated ailment.he had liters of fluid drained from his lungs.
izell was not terribly expressive about the effect of his diagnosis and disease at the time of trial.much of the evidence concerning the effect of the disease came from izell.from their combined testimony,there was evidence that izell became very depressed after the diagnosis,and went through a real bad spell.izell had to work all the time to lift his spirits.she described how izell would try to hide his feelings from the outside world however,she knew him well enough to see the pain he was feeling inside.izell testified that izell had experienced grief,anxiety,and emotional problems since his diagnosis.
physically,izell became increasingly reliant on a walker.at the time of trial,izell walked with a cane with much difficulty.at times izell would fall if he did not have something for support,and one time fell onto a barbed wire fence.his energy level was low.he would go back to bed after breakfast,wake up in time for lunch,and go back to bed.he had difficulty speaking at times,with his voice giving way.and izell could not do the things they used to do before the diagnosis.
there was testimony regarding the expected course of the disease from eugene mark,a medical doctor and professor of pathology at harvard medical school.he described how the disease will inevitably spread into the chest and cover the lung.it will grow into the lung and chest wall.the severe pain will require pain medication.izell will lose his appetite and weight,experience depression,and pass away.he could expect to live another to years.izell,of course,would experience his demise right along with him.
defendants rightly point out countervailing evidence concerning damages.izell hospital visit was due to a fall on a nail,not from any symptoms related to the disease.izell had other infirmities as well as his lung disease.he had arthritis in his joints,and had had falls before his diagnosis,and had used a walker in the past.he had kidney problems,gout,and hypertension.he was able to participate in activities that did not require a great deal of physical efforts,such as gardening and watching television.these were all factors for the jury to consider in determining damages for both and izell.
based on this evidence,the award of damages for past noneconomic losses of and future noneconomic losses of each was clearly excessive.this does not mean,however,that the evidence did not support a significant award.for a man of izell age,his normal life expectancy would have been an additional years.at the time of trial his life expectancy was to years.the jury was charged with the responsibility of determining the effects on and izell of living with what is,in essence,a death sentence,with an inevitable painful demise.the jury had the opportunity to hear and evaluate the testimony,and to determine the consequences of the disease.based on the evidence,and reasonable inferences that could be drawn therefrom,the court finds that an award of past noneconomic damages in the sum of and future noneconomic damages of,as to each plaintiff,is fair and reasonable.
in its briefs,union carbide largely ignores our presumption of correctness by downplaying the evidence that supports the trial court findings,while highlighting the countervailing evidence the court thoughtfully considered in significantly reducing the jury award.for instance,union carbide acknowledges plaintiffs are right that izell had fluid drained from his lungs,but emphasizes he had no chemotherapy or surgery.it continues,plaintiffs are also right that izell testified that his voice was sometimes weaker and he used his walker more after his diagnosis,but stresses it is also undisputed that izell was when diagnosed and suffering from a number of unrelated infirmities,which had already caused him to use a walker.with respect to izell loss of consortium damages,union carbide contends t here was no evidence in her scant pages worth of testimony to suggest that izell had suffered physical or emotional injuries as a result of her husband diagnosis,noting s he testified that her husband still helped around the house and showed affection for her after his diagnosis.
the trial court statement of decision adequately resolves the conflicting evidence union carbide seeks to relitigate on appeal,and the court thorough discussion of the evidence and witnesses demeanor fully dispels any suggestion that and izell have not suffered significant physical and emotional anguish since learning of izell cancer.though we recognize the remitted amount remains on the of noneconomic damage awards discussed in reported mesothelioma decisions particularly for plaintiffs of the izells advanced age this alone is not sufficient to second guess the trial judge,who presided over the trial and personally observed the injury and the impairment that has resulted.seffert,supra,cal d at daggett atchison,ry.cal d,while a reviewing court,in passing upon the question of excessive damages,may consider amounts awarded in similar cases citations,in the final analysis the question in each case must be determined from its own peculiar facts and circumstances citation and it can not be held as a matter of law that a verdict is excessive simply because the amount may be larger than is ordinarily allowed in such cases.
the punitive damage award is not unconstitutionally excessive 
lastly,union carbide contends the million punitive damage award is unconstitutionally excessive when compared to its percent share of the reduced million compensatory damage award.reviewing this contention under the following principles,we can not conclude the award was unconstitutionally arbitrary in relation to the reprehensibility of union carbide conduct and the magnitude of harm suffered by plaintiffs.
punitive damages may be imposed to further a state legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and deterring its repetition.bmw of north america,gore,gore.the amount of punitive damages offends due process under the fourteenth amendment as arbitrary only if the award is grossly excessive in relation to the state legitimate interests in punishment and deterrence.id.at see also state farm mut.ins.campbell,state farm.
a court determining whether a punitive damages award is excessive under the due process clause must consider three guideposts the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant misconduct the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award and the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.citation.state farm,supra,at.the defendant financial condition also is a permissible consideration under the due process clause in determining the amount of punitive damages necessary to further the state legitimate interests in punishment and deterrence.simon san paolo holding,cal th,simon.
on appeal,we defer to findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence,and we independently assess each of the three guideposts to determine de novo whether the punitive damages award is excessive under the due process clause.state farm,supra,at cooper,leatherman tool grp,simon,supra,cal th at fn.the reviewing court constitutional mission is only to find a level higher than which an award may not go it is not to find the right level in the court own view.while we must assess independently the wrongfulness of a defendant conduct,our determination of a maximum award should allow some leeway for the possibility of reasonable differences in the weighing of culpability.in enforcing federal due process limits,an appellate court does not sit as a replacement for the jury but only as a check on arbitrary awards.simon,at.
a.the reduction in the compensatory award did not mandate retrial of punitive damages 
before examining the state farm guideposts,we first will address union carbide contention that,given the dramatic reduction in compensatory damages,california law required the trial court either to grant a new trial or to reduce the punitive damages to the level the jury selected.in support of this argument,union carbide principally relies upon frommoethelydo fire ins.exchange cal d frommoethelydo and auerbach great western bank th auerbach.
in frommoethelydo,the plaintiff obtained a judgment for in general damages,for emotional distress,and million for punitive damages in an action for misconduct by an insurer in dealing with a claim for stolen property.frommoethelydo,supra,cal d at.our supreme court held the plaintiff could not recover emotional distress or general damages that were based on the insurer privileged report of plaintiff claim to the bureau of fraudulent claims,and reduced the compensatory award from to.id.at.then,citing the rule requiring reasonable proportionality between punitive and compensatory damages see neal farmers ins.exchange cal d,the frommoethelydo court held t he award of punitive damages may not be upheld since most of the compensatory damages must be set aside.frommoethelydo,at.
in auerbach,a jury found the defendant bank liable on contract and fraud claims and awarded the plaintiff for each,together with million in punitive damages.auerbach,supra,th at.the court of appeal reversed the judgment on the contract claim and held the recoverable compensatory damages on the fraud claim were limited to.id.at.the court then addressed the punitive damages award,stating,we can not simply reduce the damages and modify the award on the fraud cause of action at this stage.because the jury was misled about the amount of compensatory damages it could award,its punitive damage award is suspect.although there is no fixed ratio,punitive damages must be proportional to recoverable compensatory damages.citation.because the punitive damages are out of proportion to the actual damages suffered by the plaintiffs,the punitive damage claim will have to be retried.id.at.
union carbide contends frommoethelydo and auerbach draw a bright line rule requiring a new trial on punitive damages whenever a compensatory damage award is dramatically reduced.we read these cases differently.contrary to the rule advanced by union carbide,the courts focus in frommoethelydo and auerbach was not simply on the magnitude of the compensatory damage reduction,but rather on the effect the reduction had on the proportionality between compensatory and punitive damages.
in frommoethelydo,after the supreme court set aside most of the compensatory damages,the resulting ratio of punitive to compensatory damages was to.similarly in auerbach,after the court of appeal reduction,the resulting ratio of the jury punitive damage award to the reduced compensatory damages was to.the united states supreme court has held few awards exceeding a ratio between punitive and compensatory damages will satisfy due process.state farm,supra,at.likewise,our supreme court stated that ratios significantly greater than or to raise a presumption of invalidity.simon,supra,cal th at.although frommoethelydo and auerbach did not expressly rely on constitutional standards in reversing the punitive damage awards,it is clear that such grossly disproportionate awards could not withstand constitutional scrutiny see behr redmond th,rejecting contention that an award of punitive damages must be reversed and retried whenever the court of appeal reduces an award of compensatory damages.
here,the ratio of the jury punitive damage award to union carbide share of compensatory damages after the trial court reduction is to.as this ratio is not presumptively invalid,we must assess union carbide due process challenge under the state farm guideposts.
b.the punitive damage award withstands constitutional scrutiny under the state farm guideposts 
union carbide argues the punitive damage award is unconstitutionally excessive under two of the three state farm guideposts the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant misconduct and the relationship between the punitive damage award and the harm suffered by the plaintiff.we conclude the award is constitutional under each guidepost.
i degree of reprehensibility 
the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant conduct is the most important indicator of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award.state farm,supra,at gore,supra,at.in assessing the reprehensibility of a defendant conduct,we are to consider whether the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident and the harm was the result of intentional malice,trickery,or deceit,or mere accident.citation.the existence of any one of these factors weighing in favor of a plaintiff may not be sufficient to sustain a punitive damages award and the absence of all of them renders any award suspect.it should be presumed a plaintiff has been made whole for his injuries by compensatory damages,so punitive damages should only be awarded if the defendant culpability,after having paid compensatory damages,is so reprehensible as to warrant the imposition of further sanctions to achieve punishment or deterrence.state farm,at.
independently assessing these factors in view of the evidence presented at trial,we must agree with the apparent findings of the jury and trial court that union carbide culpability was so reprehensible as to warrant punitive damages to achieve the state legitimate interest in deterring such conduct.
the first reprehensibility factor whether the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic clearly weighs in favor of high reprehensibility.due to his exposure to union carbide asbestos,izell has contracted a terminal cancer from which he will die in two to three years.see bullock philip morris usa,th,bullock ii the harm caused by philip morris misconduct was physical rather than economic because the evidence shows that bullock suffered a debilitating and terminal illness,lung cancer,as a result of philip morris fraudulent scheme.
with respect to the second factor,the evidence also shows union carbide acted with a reprehensible indifference to the health and safety of others.in,union carbide produced an internal report concluding that low levels of exposure to asbestos cause mesothelioma,which can occur after only a brief exposure,which may be as little as three months.though acknowledging a general inference that crocidolite asbestos is more liable to produce mesothelioma,the report cautioned that e xoneration of union carbide chrysotile asbestos has not been made and that on the basis of present evidence,we are not entitled under any circumstances to state that our material is not a health hazard.echoing this concern,in,union carbide associate medical director reported,i t is generally held that much less exposure to asbestos increases the possibility of mesothelioma formation,and thus advised,i do see that we have any choice in a position except to admit that asbestos is carcinogenic under certain conditions.despite these admonitions,union carbide chose not to warn its customers about the risk of cancer,stating in,cancer is a very emotional word and there is a strong possibility that people will react to it far beyond the real danger involved we can not predict with certainty what effect the use of the proposed cancer warning will have on our business,but the general feeling here is that it is likely to vary somewhere between serious and fatal.all this suggests union carbide knew the dangers of its product,but failed to warn consumers of those dangers,while seeking to maintain profits from the sale of asbestos.see stewart,supra,th at,reviewing same evidence and rejecting union carbide assertion that punitive damages were unconstitutionally excessive because its conduct was on the low end of the reprehensibility scale.
the same evidence also establishes reprehensibility with regard to the fourth and fifth factors whether the conduct involved repeated actions,and whether the harm was the result of intentional malice,trickery,or deceit.unquestionably,union carbide continued sales of asbestos for more than decade after it internally recognized low levels of exposure could cause mesothelioma establishes repeated conduct further,as union carbide acknowledged,had it warned of the known risk of cancer,the result may have been fatal for its asbestos business,but it also likely would have prevented izell from being exposed to its dangerous product.all told,four of the five factors weigh in favor of finding high reprehensibility 
ii disparity between actual harm and punitive damages 
due process requires that punitive damages bear a reasonable relationship to the actual or potential harm to the plaintiff.gore,supra,at.thus,courts must ensure that the measure of punishment is both reasonable and proportionate to the amount of harm to the plaintiff and to the general damages recovered.state farm,supra,at.
the united states supreme court has consistently rejected the notion that the constitutional line is marked by a simple mathematical formula.gore,supra,at state farm,supra,at.as state farm explains,the due process limitation is elastic,rather than rigid,and depends on the circumstances b ecause there are no rigid benchmarks that a punitive damages award may not surpass,ratios greater than those we have previously upheld may comport with due process where a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages.citations.the converse is also true,however.when compensatory damages are substantial,then a lesser ratio,perhaps only equal to compensatory damages,can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee.the precise award in any case,of course,must be based upon the facts and circumstances of the defendant conduct and the harm to the plaintiff.state farm,at.
in view of the multimillion dollar compensatory damage award for noneconomic losses,union carbide argues any punitive award greater than its share of the compensatory award would be constitutionally excessive.we disagree.
to begin,though union carbide million share of the reduced compensatory damage award may be substantial in the abstract,we believe that whether the compensatory damages are small or substantial within the meaning of state farm,supra,at page,depends,in substantial part,on the defendant financial condition.bullock ii,supra,th at,fn.this is because the state legitimate interests in punishment and deterrence are not served if the amount of punitive damages is so small relative to the defendant wealth as to constitute only a nuisance or a routine cost of doing business simon,supra,cal th at,and because a punitive damages award violates due process only if the award is grossly excessive in relation to these interests,quoting gore,supra,at.bullock ii,at,fn.here,union carbide stipulated to a present net worth of billion.in view of its financial condition,and the highly reprehensible conduct discussed above,we can not hold that punitive damages equal to less than five times union carbide share of compensatory damages exceeded the amount necessary to serve the state legitimate interest in punishment and deterrence.
nor are we persuaded by union carbide contention that a ratio was mandated because the compensatory award here consisted entirely of noneconomic damages.to be sure,some cases have recognized that a noneconomic award may be high enough that it appears to include a punitive component,thereby reducing the permissible ratio of punitive to compensatory damages.bankhead arvinmeritor,th,bankhead,italics added see also walker farmers ins.exchange th,jury award of substantial emotional distress damages,in the court view,contained a punitive element so as to support only a ratio.here,however,we need not speculate from what appears to be included in a jury verdict,because we have the trial court thorough recitation of the harm suffered by plaintiffs that it considered in setting the amount of compensatory damages.the trial court thoughtful analysis is set forth above in its entirety there is no appearance that the court included a punitive component in the reduced compensatory award.
finally,union carbide attempts to establish equivalency with roby mckesson cal th,in which our supreme court concluded a ratio between compensatory and punitive damages was the federal constitutional limit where the defendant conduct involved a relatively low degree of reprehensibility and the compensatory verdict included a substantial award of noneconomic damages.id.at,italics added.as we discussed with respect to the reprehensibility guidepost,that is not the case here see stewart,supra,th at.
disposition 
the judgment is affirmed.plaintiffs are entitled to their costs.
i concur with my colleagues on all issues except the affirmance of the million punitive damages award.on this issue,i respectfully dissent.
after determining the jury clearly should have reached a different verdict or decision as to compensatory damages,and reducing the award by percent from million to million the trial court declined to disturb the jury million punitive damages award,concluding a ratio of punitive to compensatory damages is reasonable.in my view,the significant reduction of the jury compensatory damage award requires a new trial on the amount of punitive damages.
although a trial court approval of the punitive damage award by denial of a motion for new trial is entitled to significant weight citation,deference is not abdication.it is the duty and responsibility of an appellate court to intervene where the award is so grossly disproportionate or palpably excessive as to raise a presumption that it was the product of passion and prejudice.dumas stocker d,neal farmers ins.exchange cal d,neal a n appellate court may reverse a punitive damages award only w hen the award as a matter of law appears excessive,or where the recovery is so grossly disproportionate as to raise a presumption that it is the result of passion or prejudice.appellate courts must scrutinize punitive damage verdicts because they constitute a windfall,create the anomaly of excessive compensation,and are therefore not favored in the law.las palmas associates las palmas center associates d.
e xemplary damages must bear a reasonable relation to actual damages citation even though no fixed ratio exists to determine the proper proportion.liodas sahadi cal d,liodas.in assessing whether a recovery is grossly disproportionate,a relevant yardstick is the amount of compensatory damages awarded in general,even an act of considerable reprehensibility will not be seen to justify a proportionally high amount of punitive damages if the actual harm suffered thereby is small.neal,supra,cal d at.because the calculation of punitive damages involves a fluid process that defies strict adherence to a rigid formula,the proper proportion that punitive damages should bear to compensatory damages is a question committed,in the first instance,to the jury determination.walker signal companies,d,gagnon continental casualty d,gagnon.in view of these complimentary principles,when a substantial reduction in compensatory damages makes the proportionality of the jury punitive award suspect,appellate courts have held that the cause should be remanded for a new trial on the amount of punitive damages.auerbach great western bank th,auerbach see also liodas,at holding,when a trial court has granted a new trial on the issue of compensatory damages e xemplary damages must be redetermined as well,because exemplary damages must bear a reasonable relation to actual damages.
