background 
pro is located at south cicero avenue,in the city of country club hills,a southern suburb of chicago.tharon bradley,carla nelson,and patricia nelson,the owners of pro,are also plaintiffs in this litigation.the city of country club hills is governed by an elected mayor,an elected clerk,and ten elected aldermen two from each of the city five wards.the mayor,dwight welch,and the clerk,deborah mcilvain,are named as defendants,along with the city itself.
to obtain a liquor license in country club hills,a business must apply and satisfy certain preliminary requirements.the applicant must then secure from the city council an ordinance granting that particular business a license.the municipal code in country club hills defines several types of liquor licenses,two of which are relevant here class a,for restaurants,and class b,for bars.the code also sets the permissible hours of operation for these establishments.both class a and class b licenses allow the holder to remain open until,monday through friday,and on saturday and sunday.
pro satisfied the application requirements for a liquor license,and the city council considered an ordinance to grant pro a license on november.the parties dispute what took place at this meeting.helpfully,the meeting was videotaped.the district court viewed this video and summarized it in its written opinion granting the preliminary injunction.
minutes into the meeting,the council turned to the economic development portion of its agenda,the only item being whether to pass an ordinance granting pro a liquor license.alderman tyrone hutson,one of the aldermen for ward,where pro is located,was granted the floor.he did not immediately introduce the proposed ordinance,however.instead,he began by explaining that he wished to amend the ordinance,and place a time frame on the liquor license.he proposed limiting the hours of alcohol sales to on weekdays and on weekends.at mayor welch direction,hutson introduced the amendment via motion.hutson called for a vote,but welch stated that a discussion of the amendment must occur first.welch spoke for about three minutes about the license process generally,then observed that pro was surrounded by residential zoning.welch said that he did not have a problem with the hours proposed by hutson and emphasized that pro license,like all other licenses,would last only until may of the following year,at which time it would need to be renewed.he indicated that he traditionally defers on decisions related to liquor licenses to the aldermen from the particular ward where the business is to be located and asked tom if he had anything to say.tom is not identified in the video but was presumably thomas comein,the other alderman from ward.he agreed with proposed hours and said that if there was a problem,the police would take care of it.
another alderman,vincent lockett,suggested moving the weekday closing time to so that patrons would not have to leave before sporting events,such as monday night football,had ended.welch opposed the change,saying that just because the bar had to stop serving liquor did not mean that patrons had to leave welch then said,seemingly to someone in the crowd,you guys good with that all right.all right.let move on.
no vote was taken on the amendment.instead,after welch directed the council to move on,hutson introduced,by motion,the original ordinance,a draft of which had been prepared before the council meeting.hutson introduced it as an ordinance providing for the granting of a class a liquor license to pro.the motion received a second.welch called for discussion and an unidentified alderman asked whether the original or amended ordinance was being considered.welch responded 
this is amended,but we are going to have to put this,i talked to our city attorney,we have to put this into a formal ordinance at the next council meeting,but i going to give them permission to go ahead and proceed,as the liquor commissioner,based on the council action tonight.
welch then proceeded to a roll call,and all ten alderman voted in favor.
the council next met in december of,but did not revisit pro liquor license.an ordinary class a liquor no mention of the restricted issued to pro.bradley,one of the owners,obtained this license from the clerk,mcilvain,on january.however,a new class liquor license was reissued on january,signed by mcilvain and welch.like the original class a license,the class license does not mention any time limitations on the service of alcohol.the municipal code does not have any provision describing a class license.
at the preliminary injunction hearing,mcilvain testified that she was uncertain why she reissued the license to pro,but speculated that she did so in anticipation of an ordinance that would have created a class license with the limited hours discussed at the november council meeting.no such ordinance was ever adopted.however,the owners of pro claim that a police officer subsequently showed them the first page of a draft ordinance that purports to establish such a classification.pro alleges that the police began enforcing these time limitations,resulting in several citations,arrests of management,and frequent visits by the police to pro at or shortly before the new closing time.bradley testified that this resulted in lost business and revenues,identifying in particular the refund of fees to those who had booked private parties that were terminated early by police and lost bookings to other bars in the city that could remain open later.
in march of,the city council entertained a motion to extend pro hours to those of a regular license holder.that ordinance did not pass,receiving five votes in support and five votes against.
pro applied for a new license prior to may,as all licensees were required to do.pro applied for a class b license,apparently at the direction of welch.when pro received its new class b license,it stated the following limitation 
this liquor license is hereby granted to pro sports bar grill to liquor in the city of country club hills,until pm sunday through thursday,and until pm friday and saturday 
these new hours were not voted on by the city council,and are not the hours that were discussed at the november,meeting.at the preliminary injunction hearing,mcilvain testified that when she receives an application for liquor license renewal,she first confirms that the establishment dram shop insurance is still valid and then issues a new license with the same terms and conditions that the establishment previous license had contained.
pro filed the instant litigation on october,seeking damages and an injunction under.on october,pro moved for a preliminary injunction.after a preliminary injunction hearing on december and,the district court concluded that pro was likely to prevail on its due process claim and issued the injunction.the city now appeals.
