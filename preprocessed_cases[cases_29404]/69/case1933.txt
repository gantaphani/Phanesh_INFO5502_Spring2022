this appeal concerns a hospital proposed acquisition of rural health clinics from a medical group.the acquisition was not completed because disputes arose prior to the closing.the hospital terminated the agreement and sued for the return of a payment,alleging an anticipatory breach of contract resulted from the medical group inability to make certain representations and warranties required by the agreement.the medical group for an injunction to protect the confidential information it disclosed to the hospital during the due diligence period.
after a voluntary general reference,a referee issued a statement of decision that determined the hospital had not taken the proper steps to assert a claim for anticipatory breach of contract and the medical group was entitled to an injunction that a prohibited the hospital from using the confidential information and b required the hospital to return certain confidential materials.
we conclude the judgment and injunction must be reversed and the matter remanded for further proceedings.
we publish the portions of this opinion that address the questions whether a nonrepudiating party must sue for damages immediately upon learning of the events that constitute an anticipatory breach,and whether a claim for anticipatory breach is precluded where executory covenants in the contract remain unperformed by the repudiating party.
we answer both questions in the negative.an injured party retains the right to treat a repudiation as an anticipatory breach until the repudiation is nullified.further,one party repudiation discharges any remaining duties of performance of the other party with respect to the expected exchange.rest d contracts,com.b.
we also publish the portion of this opinion in which we address the question whether california law authorizes the issuance of injunctive relief based on threatened misappropriation of trade secrets.based on civil code section,subdivision a,we answer that question in the affirmative.california rejection of the inevitable disclosure doctrine does not mean that threatened misappropriation also must be rejected as a basis for injunctive relief.

the letter of intent 
on march,cvg hospital and smith and affiliates entered a letter of intent that set forth the principal terms for the acquisition by cvg hospital of certain assets associated with the health care delivery operations of smith and affiliates.the assets included rural health clinics and other professional medical practices of smith and affiliates in kings and fresno counties.
section a of the letter of intent provided cvg hospital with a diligence review period during which it had the exclusive right to examine and investigate the businesses,properties,books and records of smith and affiliates for the purpose of determining whether to proceed with the acquisition and other transactions contemplated by the letter of intent.section a also provided cvg hospital shall notify smith and affiliates in writing prior to expiration of the diligence review period in the event that cvg hospital determines that it shall not proceed with the transactions 
section b of the letter of intent provided for an interim closing date after cvg hospital finished its diligence review and elected to exercise its option to purchase the assets covered by the letter of intent.
section a of the letter of intent required cvg hospital to pay smith and affiliates upon execution of the letter of intent as consideration for the obligations of smith and affiliates as set forth in section above and cvg hospital exclusive option to effect the transactions as also set forth in section above.this subsection also stated that the payment shall be nonrefundable subject to the terms and conditions set forth in section a 
section stated that the letter of intent may be terminated by cvg hospital as set forth in section.the circumstances under which the payment became nonrefundable are stated as follows 
provided that smith and affiliates are not in material breach hereof during the diligence review period and provided further that all interim closing conditions to be performed by smith and affiliates in favor of cvg hospital as herein defined in section including the deliveries set forth in section have been satisfied,the payment shall be and retained by smith and affiliates as liquidated damages in the event the transactions as contemplated hereunder are not consummated as set forth herein as a result of cvg hospital refusal or inability to do so.
section of the letter of intent set forth the obligations that each party was required to fulfill in connection with the interim closing.these obligations included the execution and delivery of definitive agreements necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the letter of intent.section of the letter of intent listed the definitive agreements and stated that they shall include representations and warranties regarding,among other things,d completeness,accuracy and conformance to generally accepted accounting principles of financial statements and books and records,and absence of changes therefrom,f compliance with governing instruments,contracts and laws,and i complete disclosure of material facts 
section a of the letter of intent was a confidentiality provision.it stated that a party receiving confidential information agrees to keep all such information confidential that is not in the public domain exercising the same care in handling such information as it would exercise with similar information of its own and,if requested,to return any such written information to the providing party in the event that negotiations are not pursued.
due diligence and related disputes 
shortly after the letter of intent was signed,cvg hospital began its due diligence review of clinic operations,including the clinics financial and billing operations.the due diligence review did not go smoothly.
cvg hospital asserts that smith halted the diligence review in late march and demanded cvg hospital sign a separate indemnification letter agreeing not to assert a action related to billing irregularities at the clinics.smith asserts he was concerned that the individuals conducting the review might not strictly comply with the confidentiality provision in the letter of intent.the parties agree that cvg hospital did not sign the agreement offered by smith and affiliates.cvg hospital,however,did agree to indemnify smith and affiliates for any wrongful disclosures to a third party by cvg hospital or its employees,agents,or representatives.once the indemnification agreement was in place,the diligence review continued.
cvg hospital contends that,in early april,rosenberg discovered smith and affiliates appeared to be engaged in duplicate billing,which made it impossible for rosenberg to perform a compensation analysis and to confirm the value of assets.in cvg hospital view,the billing irregularities raised serious concerns about whether smith and affiliates could make the representation and warranty required by the letter of intent that it had complied with all laws.in addition,cvg hospital contends that smith and affiliates did not cooperate with its requests for information during the diligence review.
on may,smith and affiliates expelled the rosenberg due diligence teams from the clinics.
the parties met and conferred to discuss their differences on may,and again on june.in a letter dated june,cvg hospital proposed terms under which it was willing to resolve the matter.smith and affiliates rejected the proposal.
counsel for cvg hospital sent a letter dated june,to the attorneys for smith and affiliates that asserted claims for breach of contract and fraud.the letter also stated that cvg hospital notifies smith and affiliates that cvg hospital can not and shall not proceed with the transactions contemplated by the letter of intent.cvg hospital demanded the return of the payment and other damages,including the expenses incurred in connection with the letter of intent.as a result,the interim closing contemplated by the letter of intent was never held.
the parties met a final time to confer on their differences.they did not reach an agreement and this lawsuit began.
proceedings 
on july,cvg hospital sued smith and affiliates to recover the payment and various expenses and professional fees incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by the letter of intent.smith and affiliates answered the complaint with a general denial and for damages as well as declaratory and injunctive relief against hospital group.they alleged hospital group engaged in unlawful or unfair business practices under business and professions code section et,misappropriation of trade secrets,and fraud and deceit.they requested an injunction to protect their trade secrets and confidential information.
pursuant to a provision in the letter of intent and code of civil procedure section,the superior court appointed a referee and directed him to hear and determine all of the issues in the action,whether of fact or law,and report a statement of decision the referee conducted an trial starting in october and ending in february.the referee initial statement of decision was served on the parties in november.
the referee concluded that smith and affiliates were prevailing parties on both the complaint and the and that an injunction should issue prohibiting hospital group from using the patient records,trade secrets,and proprietary information they obtained pursuant to the letter of intent and commanding them to return confidential materials to smith and affiliates.
after a series of objections and responses,the referee signed a revised statement of decision in november and a second revised statement of decision on december.the second revised statement of decision was filed with the superior court on december.
on february,the referee filed an injunction with the superior court,the terms of which were narrower and more specific than the terms of the injunction proposed in the second revised statement of decision.it stated that the confidentiality provisions of the letter of intent were incorporated by reference into the injunction,directed hospital group to return certain documents to smith and affiliates and to destroy other documents,and permitted hospital group to retain certain redacted documents and documents that constituted attorney work product.
less than three weeks later,hospital group filed five declarations that described the measures taken to comply with the injunction filed by the referee in february.
the judgment in this case is contained in a stipulation,order and judgment nunc pro tunc,which was filed by the superior court on march.the judgment,in accordance with the revised second statement of decision,was in favor of smith and affiliates on cvg hospital complaint and in favor of smith and affiliates on their against hospital group.it was to be nun sic pro tunc to december.
in april,smith and affiliates filed a motion to enter an injunction in accordance with the second revised statement of decision.smith and affiliates filed the motion because the superior court had not filed an injunction and,in their view,the referee february,injunction was ineffective because the referee was not authorized to file it.
smith and affiliates motion to enter an injunction in accordance with the second revised statement of decision,as well as a motion to tax costs,was heard by the superior court on may.the motion to tax costs was granted in part and denied in part.for example,the superior court allowed smith and affiliates to recover the filing fee related to an unsuccessful motion and denied smith and affiliates request to recover in referee fees and in document storage fees.
with respect to the motion to enter the injunction,the superior court determined that it,not the referee,had jurisdiction over matters that arose after the entry of the second revised statement of decision.the superior court also determined that the second revised statement of decision became the decision of the court once it was filed by the referee on december.consequently,the superior court determined the narrower terms in the injunction filed by the referee on february,were not appropriate.based on these determinations,the superior court concluded that it was required to enter an injunction consistent with the second revised statement of decision and the february injunction had no effect.
on may,the superior court filed an injunction that implemented the terms contained in the second revised statement of decision.hospital group was prohibited from using the patient records,trade secrets proprietary information obtained from smith and affiliates pursuant to the letter of intent in any manner whatsoever against the interests of smith and affiliates,except as may be otherwise provided by law.the injunction also required hospital group to return documents and information reflecting patient records,trade secrets proprietary information belonging to smith and affiliates within days of the injunction.
hospital group filed a notice of appeal from the judgment entered pursuant to the second revised statement of decision and the may,order granting the motion to enter an injunction in accordance with the second revised statement of decision.
discussion 
standard of review 
on appeal,hospital group contends that the referee second revised statement of decision contains reversible error with respect to the issuance of an injunction and the determination that cvg hospital did not establish its claim for anticipatory breach of contract.
accordingly,we must identify the rules of review that appellate courts use to determine whether a statement of decision reported by a referee contains reversible error.
voluntary general references 
code of civil procedure section,subdivision a provides that a referee may be appointed by agreement of the parties to hear and determine any or all of the issues in an action or proceeding,whether of fact or of law,and to report a statement of decision.the parties voluntarily agreed in section of the letter of intent to submit claims to a retired judge or justice appointed pursuant to code of civil procedure section.
based on the letter of intent and the statute,the superior court appointed a referee and directed the referee to hear and determine all of the issues in the action,whether of fact or law,and report a statement of decision 
a statement of decision reported by a referee under a voluntary general reference is the equivalent of a statement of decision rendered by a superior court under code of civil procedure section.in re marriage of demblewski th,d.as a result,a referee statement of decision is reviewed by an appellate court using the same rules that apply to a trial court statement of decision.ibid.
under the general rules applicable to a trial court statement of decision,an appellate court independently reviews questions of law and applies the substantial evidence standard to findings of fact.see ghirardo antonioli cal th,d,questions of law are subject to independent review crawford southern pacific cal d,substantial evidence rule.
adequacy of the statement of decision 
the specific rules concerning the adequacy of a statement of decision are derived from the code of civil procedure.section requires a statement of decision to explain the factual and legal basis for the decision as to each of the principal controverted issues of the case.
appellate review of a statement of decision is addressed in code of civil procedure section 
when a statement of decision does not resolve a controverted issue,or if the statement is ambiguous and the record shows that the omission or ambiguity was brought to the attention of the trial court either prior to entry of judgment or in conjunction with a motion under section or,it shall not be inferred on appeal that the trial court decided in favor of the prevailing party as to those facts or on that issue.
sections and of the code of civil procedure have been interpreted to mean that a statement of decision is adequate if it fairly discloses the determinations as to the ultimate facts and material issues in the case,ermoian desert hospital th,d.when this rule is applied,the term ultimate fact generally refers to a core fact,such as an essential element of a claim,yield dynamics,tea systems th,d.ultimate facts are distinguished from evidentiary facts and from legal conclusions.kazensky city of merced th,d,dist.
ii.repudiation and anticipatory breach 
general principles 
california law recognizes that a contract may be breached by nonperformance by repudiation,or a combination of the two.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts.
a repudiation may be express or implied.taylor johnston cal d,taylor.in this case,the repudiation alleged is implied.a n implied repudiation results from conduct where the promisor puts it out of his power to perform so as to make substantial performance of his promise impossible citations.ibid.
a repudiation may have several consequences.when a repudiation occurs before any breach by nonperformance there are three main consequences.rest d contracts,com.a,see,com.a.first,the repudiation may give rise to a claim for damages for total breach rest d contracts,com.a,see,subd.second,it may discharge the other party duties to render performance,subd.third,it may excuse the nonoccurrence of a condition to a duty of the repudiating party.
breach by repudiation is referred to in the case law as an anticipatory breach,romano rockwell,cal th,d.as a matter of definition,an anticipatory breach of contract occurs when the contract is repudiated by the promisor before the promisor performance under the contract is due.taylor,supra,cal d at.
specific principles relevant to this case 
in taylor,the california supreme court set forth the following principles regarding repudiation,nullification,and anticipatory breach 
when a promisor repudiates a contract,the injured party faces an election of remedies he can treat the repudiation as an anticipatory breach and immediately seek damages for breach of contract,thereby terminating the contractual relation between the parties,or he can treat the repudiation as an empty threat,wait until the time for performance arrives and exercise his remedies for actual breach if a breach does in fact occur at such time.citation.however,if the injured party disregards the repudiation and treats the contract as still in force,and the repudiation is retracted prior to the time of performance,then the repudiation is nullified and the injured party is left with his remedies,if any,invocable at the time of performance.citations.taylor,supra,cal d at,italics added.
the interpretation of these two sentences from taylor,especially the significance of the word immediately,is the source of disagreement between the parties.
repudiation and nullification under taylor 
referee interpretation of taylor 
the referee interpreted and applied taylor as follows 
the only way for cvg hospital to have required s a to perform was,as stated in taylor,supra,to have treated s a suspected inability to perform as an anticipatory breach and to have immediately sought damages for breach of contract,which would have terminated the contractual relation between cvg hospital and s having chosen not to do so,cvg hospital was left with its remedies,if any,invocable at the time of performance but for its termination notice during the diligence period ex,which brought the letter of intent to one of its possible conclusions.in other words,cvg hospital could have immediately sued for anticipatory breach of contract,terminated the contractual relation between the parties and sought provable damages,if any,or elected to proceed with the transactions and sought provable damages from s a if s a,in fact,could not perform.cvg hospital did neither.underscoring in original.
the importance that the referee attached to cvg hospital decision to deliver the termination notice instead of proceeding with the transactions is demonstrated further by the following two paragraphs from the second revised statement of decision.
at bar,cvg hospital promised to decide whether or not to proceed with the transactions within the diligence period.different consequences,s a,flowed from that decision,whether or not to proceed.
first,if cvg hospital decided to proceed and s a could not respond as required in the letter of intent,the avenues of recourse available to cvg hospital are obvious.second,if cvg hospital was aware of an anticipatory breach,or breaches,on the part of s a,cvg hospital should have immediately terminated the letter of intent and proceeded to prove the breach,or breaches,and damages,if any.it did not do that.some of what cvg hospital refers to as anticipatory breaches were known to it months before they were raised as such and,therefore,were waived.third,cvg hospital terminated the letter of intent by ex,not because of the anticipatory breaches outlined,which were either stale,waived or premature,but according to an internal mechanism set forth in a which ended the letter of intent.
based on the foregoing,smith and affiliates contend that the referee correctly determined that cvg hospital did not timely pursue its claims for anticipatory breach.smith and affiliates also contend that the inquiry into whether cvg hospital timely elected to terminate the letter of intent and pursue anticipatory breach claims was essentially a factual question and should be reviewed for substantial evidence.
our interpretation of taylor 
we disagree with the referee interpretation of taylor and the way in which the word immediately was applied to the facts of this case.in our view,the following is a correct statement of the law of california a party to a contract does not lose the right to treat an implied repudiation of the contract as an anticipatory breach by failing to seek damages immediately after learning of the events that constitute the implied repudiation.
the california supreme court stated that an injured party can treat the repudiation as an anticipatory breach and immediately seek damages for breach of contract taylor,supra,cal d at,italics added.this language authorizes the injured party to immediately seek damages,but it does not necessarily require the party to seek damages immediately or lose the right to treat the repudiation as an anticipatory breach.in essence,the first sentence of the quote from taylor describes the earliest point at which an injured party may seek damages.it does not say that the earliest point is the only point.nor does that sentence identify the last point at which a repudiation may be treated as an anticipatory breach.
the second sentence of the quote from taylor indicates when the injured party may no longer treat a repudiation as an anticipatory breach.it describes when the repudiation is nullified and the injured party is left with his remedies for breach by nonperformance.taylor,supra,cal d at.specifically,a repudiation is nullified if the injured party disregards the repudiation and treats the contract as still in force,and the repudiation is retracted prior to the time of performance ibid.thus,the california supreme court has identified three conditions that combine to nullify a repudiation.
the first condition is the injured party disregards the repudiation taylor,supra,cal d at.the second condition is the injured party treats the contract as still in force id.at.the third and most important condition is that the repudiation is retracted prior to the time of performance taylor,supra,at.the three conditions are joined by the word and,not or.ibid.and is conjunctive,while or is disjunctive.kobzoff los angeles county medical center cal th,d.therefore,the language used by the california supreme court plainly means that all three conditions must exist before the repudiation is nullified and the injured party is left with his remedies for breach by nonperformance.taylor,supra,cal d at.
furthermore,by stating that an injured party is left with his remedies for breach by nonperformance when a nullification occurs,the court implied that an injured party retains the right to treat a repudiation as an anticipatory breach until the repudiation is nullified in short,the referee adopted the wrong legal standard when he interpreted taylor to mean that a party loses the right to sue for anticipatory breach if it does not pursue a claim for damages immediately upon becoming aware of the alleged repudiation.
our interpretation of taylor is consistent with earlier statements by the california supreme court about nullification.in guerrieri,supra,cal d,the court observed 
as stated in section of the restatement of contracts manifestation by the injured party of a purpose to allow or to require performance by the promisor in spite of repudiation by him,does not nullify its effect as a breach,or prevent it from excusing performance of conditions and from discharging the duty to render a return performance.comment although the effect of repudiation may be nullified it operates until so nullified not only as a breach but as a continuing excuse of conditions and as a continuing justification of the promisee failure to perform a return promise even though the promisee has indicated a willingness to forgive the repudiation.see also.guerrieri,supra,at.
based on taylor and guerrieri,we conclude that the california supreme court has adopted the view that a repudiation operates as a breach until it is nullified.
secondary authorities 
how much time an injured party has to elect to treat a repudiation as an anticipatory breach is addressed by williston on contracts on the one hand,it is frequently said that the election must be promptly made but it has also been held that unless the repudiation is withdrawn it operates as a continuing offer of a breach,of which the promisee may take advantage at any time.williston on contracts ed,fns.omitted.the view adopted by a repudiation may be treated as an anticipatory breach until it is similar to the latter of the two approaches described in williston on contracts.
treatises also have addressed what happens when an injured party learns of a repudiation and pursues other avenues before bringing a lawsuit for anticipatory breach.for instance,an injured party that urges performance does not waive the repudiation.witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,contracts.
as stated in williston on contracts,
under the early law,if the promisee,after receiving the repudiation,demanded or manifested a willingness to receive performance,his or her rights were lost.t he promisee thereafter was barred from bringing an action on the repudiation this early view resulted in a severe penalty imposed upon the injured party for not seizing the right moment.when a repudiates its promise,nothing is more natural and reasonable than for b to urge a to perform.yet under the early view,if b does so,it seems that not only does b lose the right of immediate action,but b is bound to perform its own promise,even though it has reason to expect that a will not perform its promise,as a condition of holding a,the repudiator,liable after the time for performance arrives.williston on contracts,supra,fns.omitted.
the california supreme court has not followed the early law,and its approach to repudiation and nullification does not penalize an injured party for attempting to resolve the difficulties created by a repudiation.if any such attempts do not result in the nullification of the repudiation or a modification to the contract,then the injured party may pursue a claim for anticipatory repudiation.guerrieri,supra,cal d at,see also lucente international business machines cir,nonrepudiating party does not have specific time limit to elect to treat a repudiation as an anticipatory breach and generally,an election need not be made until the time comes when the party making the election must render some performance under the terms of the contract.citation.
conclusion 
our review of the second revised statement of decision shows that the referee applied incorrect rules of law in deciding that cvg hospital failed to establish its claim for anticipatory breach.the legal error concerns how long an injured party has to treat a repudiation as an anticipatory breach.in this case,cvg hospital should have been allowed to treat a repudiation as an anticipatory breach until such repudiation was nullified or performance was due therefore,the judgment must be reversed and the matter remanded for application of the correct rules of law regarding repudiation,nullification,and anticipatory breach.
iii.anticipatory breach and executory covenants 
the second revised statement of decision sets forth an alternate ground for the conclusion that cvg hospital could not establish a contract claim based on breach by repudiation also,the doctrine of anticipatory breach has no application where executory covenants remain unperformed by the promisor see witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,contracts,citing vitagraph,liberty theatres cal,vitagraph.
it appears that the second revised statement of decision applied this principle in the following discussion 
the contract was executory until cvg hospital decided either to proceed to the interim closing or,upon first ascertaining evidence of s a anticipatory breach to have immediately terminated the letter of intent and sought damages for the anticipatory breach.if cvg hospital decided to proceed to the interim closing at any time during the diligence period,s a may have been in breach,anticipatorily or otherwise,in which case cvg hospital could have exercised its options,as far as the breach is concerned,and proved its damages,if any.
s a and obligations were conditional see,b until cvg hospital decided to proceed or properly terminated the letter of intent by either timely suing for anticipatory breach,which it did not do,or gave s a its termination notice see,below.
cvg hospital did terminate consistent with a by ex,dated june.in ex.cvg hospital asserted claims against s a,pursuant to of the letter of intent,and notified s a that cvg hospital can not and shall not proceed with the transactions contemplated in the letter of intent.
the proposition that an action for damages for an anticipatory breach does not lie where executory covenants have not been performed by the nonrepudiating party is not an established principle of california law.
first,the court in vitagraph did not apply that proposition and,therefore,the court decision does not establish precedent for that proposition existence.see dcm partners smith d.case does not stand for proposition neither discussed nor analyzed.
in vitagraph,the court stated 
it may be doubted that an action for damages for an anticipatory breach will lie in a case where there are executory covenants unperformed on the part of the plaintiff which are precedent to those which have been repudiated by the defendant,the performance of which has not been prevented by the defendant bradbury higginson cal.as this question has not been briefed or argued herein we shall not undertake to pass upon it.vitagraph,supra,cal.at.
the court then assumed a damages claim for anticipatory breach existed and determined that the plaintiff proof was insufficient to sustain an award of damages.id.at.consequently,the vitagraph decision is not precedent on the issue concerning the effect of the failure to perform executory covenants.
second,the proposition is at odds with the principles of law set forth in the restatement second of contracts.as discussed earlier,one of the consequences of a repudiation is that it may discharge the other party duties to render performance.rest d contracts,subd.in other words,one party repudiation discharges any remaining duties of performance of the other party with respect to the expected exchange,com.b.
third,the proposition is not consistent with the general rule that a party must mitigate the damages caused by another wrongful act.see williston on contracts,supra.that general rule of damages necessarily involves the conclusion that failure of the injured party to continue performance is excused,since to hold that the injured party must proceed with performance and yet be denied compensation for so doing is neither conceivable,nor do the courts so hold.
accordingly,we conclude that the existence of executory covenants that cvg hospital did not perform before treating the purported repudiation as an anticipatory breach does not bar cvg hospital from pursuing a damages claim based on an anticipatory breach.
iv.election to terminate the letter of intent 
smith and affiliates also contend that cvg hospital lost its anticipatory breach claim because it expressly elected to terminate the letter of intent by issuing a termination notice prior to the interim closing.smith and affiliates argue that the referee found cvg hospital terminated the letter of intent pursuant to its specific termination provision and held prior to that termination cvg hospital had never made the required election to terminate the agreement because of any alleged anticipatory breaches.in smith and affiliates view,this lack of causal connection between the purported repudiation and the termination is an independent reason for affirming the referee ruling.
the second revised statement of decision states that t he only way for cvg hospital to have required s a to perform was,as stated in taylor,supra,to have treated s a suspected inability to perform as an anticipatory breach and to have immediately sought damages for breach of contract,which would have terminated the contractual relation between cvg hospital and s having chosen not to do so,cvg hospital was left with its remedies,if any,invocable at the time of performance because cvg hospital delivered a termination notice before the time for performance,the referee concluded,the time for smith and affiliates to perform never arrived.consequently,cvg hospital was prevented from showing smith and affiliates breached the letter of intent by nonperformance.
based on our review of the statement of decision,it is clear that the referee determined cvg hospital lost the right to treat the alleged repudiation as a breach before it delivered the termination notice to smith and affiliates this determination was based on an erroneous view of the law.furthermore,the determination lacks sufficient evidentiary support to separate it from the legal error.in particular,the evidence does not support a finding that the alleged repudiation was nullified before cvg hospital delivered the termination notice.because the alleged repudiation had not been nullified,the termination notice could have been the act by which cvg hospital materially change d its position in reliance on the repudiation or indicate d to the other party that it consider ed the repudiation to be final.rest d contracts,subd.
the comments and illustrations in the restatement second of contracts demonstrate how the cancellation or termination of a contract by the injured party may operate to make the repudiation final.comment c explains that c ancellation of the contract or the commencement of an action claiming damages for total breach would be sufficient to indicate to the repudiating party that the injured party considers the repudiation final.rest d contracts,com.c.
illustration applies this principle to the following fact pattern.on february,a enters a contract to supply b with natural gas beginning on may.on march,a repudiates the contract.on march,b notifies a that he cancels the contract.based on these facts,the illustration concludes that b duties under the contract are discharged and b has a claim against a for damages for total breach.rest d contracts,illus.
in summary,the referee conclusions regarding the legal consequences that resulted from cvg hospital delivering the termination notice are predicated on legal error.the referee application of the erroneous principle that an injured party must sue immediately or lose the right to treat a repudiation as an anticipatory breach necessarily precluded the referee from considering whether the delivery of the termination notice materially changed cvg hospital position in reliance on the repudiation or indicated to smith and affiliates that cvg hospital considered the repudiation final.rest d contracts,subd.therefore,we must reject smith and affiliates contention that the second revised statement of decision can be upheld on the ground that cvg hospital never elected to terminate the agreement because of any alleged repudiation.
grounds for the injunction pertaining to confidential information 
contentions of the parties 
hospital group contends the may,injunction should be dissolved because no underlying cause of action was established.
smith and affiliates directly dispute that they lost every cause of action by contending that they prevailed on the second cause of action for threatened misappropriation of trade secrets.
hospital group replies to smith and affiliates argument as follows.first,california is not among the jurisdictions that provide relief for threatened misappropriation of trade secrets.second,assuming a cause of action for threatened misappropriation of trade secrets exists,smith and affiliates did not plead such a claim.third,the referee made no finding that hospital group threatened to misappropriate any trade secrets of smith and affiliates.fourth,the findings the referee did make are insufficient to support the broad scope of the injunction entered.
threatened misappropriation as a basis for an injunction 
statutory provision 
the california legislature adopted a version of the uniform trade secrets act,et in,and it became operative on january.stats,ch,operative date of act itt telecom products dooley d,fn.
civil code section,subdivision a provides actual or threatened misappropriation may be enjoined.based on the unambiguous words of the statute,we reject hospital group argument that california law does not permit injunctive relief to be based on threatened misappropriation of trade secrets.
it is well established that the plain and ordinary meaning of the word or is to mark an alternative such as either this or that citations.houge ford cal d.therefore,the use of the word or in civil code section,subdivision a plainly means that an injunction may be based either on actual misappropriation or on threatened misappropriation.see fiorentino city of fresno th,d or used in statute to designate alternatives.
accordingly,civil code section,subdivision a explicitly provides for two types of and threatened.del monte fresh produce dole food,d,court did not decide whether california or florida law applied because each state version of the uniform trade secrets act contained the same language.
inevitable disclosure doctrine 
the inevitable disclosure doctrine allows a trade secret owner to prevent a former employee from working for a competitor despite the owner failure to prove the employee has taken or threatens to use trade secrets.under that doctrine,the employee may be enjoined by demonstrating the employee new job duties will inevitably cause the employee to rely upon knowledge of the former employer trade secrets.whyte schlage lock th,d.
hospital group contends that the express rejection of the inevitable disclosure doctrine by the court in whyte schlage lock,supra,th at page,d,means that an injunction may not be based on threatened misappropriation.we disagree.
first,this contention is inconsistent with the plain meaning of the words used in civil code section,subdivision a.the wording of that provision permits injunctions against threatened misappropriation.
second,the court in whyte explicitly discussed whether whyte had engaged in actual or threatened misappropriation before it discussed the inevitable discovery doctrine.it concluded the evidence established whyte did not threaten to or actually misappropriate schlage trade secrets.whyte schlage lock,supra,th at,d.when it considered and rejected the inevitable disclosure doctrine,the court treated it a s an alternative to proof of actual or threatened misappropriation ibid.therefore,the court did not equate its rejection of the inevitable disclosure doctrine with a rejection of threatened misappropriation as a basis for granting an injunction protecting trade secrets.see del monte fresh produce dole food,supra,d at some courts apply the inevitable disclosure doctrine to situations where there has been no actual or threatened misappropriation.consequently,we do not equate the rejection of the inevitable disclosure doctrine with a rejection of the principle that threatened misappropriation may be enjoined.
we recognize that the inevitable disclosure doctrine is not conceptualized by all courts as an alternative to actual or threatened misappropriation.some courts view the inevitable disclosure doctrine as a specific kind of threatened misappropriation,interbake foods,tomasiello d.in that case,chief district court judge bennett concluded that the inevitable disclosure doctrine is just one way of showing a threatened disclosure in cases where additional evidence showing the existence of a substantial threat of impending injury is unavailable to the movant.id.at.
if the inevitable disclosure doctrine is regarded merely as one way of showing a threatened misappropriation,it does not follow logically that the rejection of the doctrine means all ways of establishing threatened misappropriation have been rejected.thus,regardless of the conceptual basis of the doctrine,our conclusion remains the principle that threatened misappropriation of trade secrets may be enjoined is the law of california despite the rejection of the inevitable disclosure doctrine by california courts.
injunction entered was not based on threatened misappropriation 
hospital group contends that smith and affiliates did not plead threatened misappropriation as a basis for the issuance of injunctive relief.
the first cause of action in smith and affiliates concerns unlawful business practices under business and professions code section et.the second cause of action is titled misappropriation of trade secrets.the allegations that constitute these causes of action do not mention threatened misuse,disclosure,or other type of misappropriation of trade secrets.similarly,the prayer for relief in the includes no reference to threatened misappropriation.
we will not,however,decide the fate of the may,injunction based on the failure to explicitly plead threatened misappropriation.the description of the contents of smith and affiliates pleadings is provided as background for our discussion of the statement of decision filed by the referee.
statement of decision 
hospital group asserts that the second revised statement of decision did not mention threatened misappropriation or indicate that threatened misappropriation was the basis for the injunction.our review of the second revised statement of decision shows that hospital group assertion is misappropriation is not mentioned.
smith and affiliates contend that the following findings and conclusions set forth in the second revised statement of decision are sufficient to support the issuance of the injunction.
have established by a preponderance of the evidence that they placed trust in the integrity of cvg hospital,and its agents,to treat the trade secrets and proprietary information of,including their sensitive patient records,with the utmost confidentiality as required by the letter of intent ex,par,and not to employ that information for their own benefit,individually or collectively,against.
are the prevailing parties on the.
an injunction shall issue prohibiting,and each of them,from using the patient records,trade secrets proprietary information obtained from,pursuant to the letter of intent,in any manner whatsoever against the interests of,except as may be otherwise provided by law.further,said injunction shall command that,and each of them,return to all documents information,in any format,including reproductions thereof,obtained by them,or any of them,reflecting patient records,trade secrets proprietary information belonging to,within thirty days of the service of said injunction on counsel for said.
the injunction filed by the superior court on may,closely follows the language in the final paragraph of the foregoing quote.for purposes of this opinion,we will refer to the first sentence of that paragraph,which prohibits use of confidential information,as the prohibitory part of the injunction.see witkin,cal.procedure ed.provisional remedies,prohibitory injunctions prevent an act.the last sentence of that paragraph,which requires hospital group to return materials,will be referred to as the mandatory part of the injunction.ibid.mandatory injunctions compel acts.
deficiencies in the statement of decision 
applying the principles of appellate review discussed in part,ante,we consider whether the referee second revised statement of decision contains findings of fact sufficient to support threatened misappropriation as the basis for the injunction.
first,the second revised statement of decision did not include a finding that hospital group threatened to misappropriate trade secrets or that hospital group posed a threat of misappropriation.if the existence of such a threat or the posing of such a threat were regarded as ultimate facts and the statement of decision included such findings,then it would have fairly disclosed the factual and legal basis for its decision.code civ.
second and alternatively,we address whether other,more particular facts found by the referee might be sufficient to establish the essential elements of a claim for threatened misappropriation.we address this alternative because the line of demarcation between ultimate facts and evidentiary facts is less than clear.see witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading.
one variation of this alternative is that a claim for threatened misappropriation is established by the following essential facts trade secrets remain in the possession of a defendant who actually has misused or disclosed some of those trade secrets in the past.readylink healthcare cotton th,d employee improperly acquired trade secrets and then used those secrets when he went to work for competitor even though he no longer worked for competitor at time the injunction was issued,court concluded there remained an imminent threat of him using the trade secret information to solicit readylink employees and customers.this variation of threatened possession by someone who misused the information in the sufficient to establish the requisite threat of misuse or disclosure in the future as to justify injunctive relief.
there is no finding that hospital group actually misused or disclosed any confidential information in its possession.to the contrary,the referee explicitly found that smith and affiliates failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that hospital group had improperly used or disclosed the confidential information that came into its possession under the letter of intent.
another variant of the essential elements of a claim for threatened misappropriation consists of the following facts trade secrets are held by a defendant who intends to improperly use or disclose some of those trade secrets.technical i
