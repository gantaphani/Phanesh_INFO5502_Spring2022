introduction 
this appeal involves an admiralty claim.for purposes of focus and orientation it appears prudent to state the grounds for state court jurisdiction in the opening portion of the opinion.article iii of the united states constitution gives federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over all admiralty and maritime matters,but united states code section,subdivision grants state courts concurrent jurisdiction under the so called saving to suitors clause.this clause provides for in personam remedies which means that an injured party may have claims arising from a single accident under both federal maritime and state common or statutory law.state remedies under the savings to suitors clause may be pursued in state court or,if there is a basis for federal jurisdiction,in federal court.citation.a maritime claim brought in the common law state courts is governed by federal maritime law,however.barber marina sailing,th,d.this is sometimes referred to as the doctrine.this appeal does not raise an issue of jurisdiction.
the case was tried without a jury.no material facts are in dispute.the parties filed a document in the trial court on december,entitled stipulated findings of fact and conclusions of law.
plaintiff and appellant daniel price price is a seaman under the terms and conditions of the jones act which was enacted in to give protection to any seaman injured in the course of employment.the jones act was codified in title,united states code appendix,section and renumbered title,united states code appendix,section on october,pursuant to public law,stat.this appeal does not raise an issue of price status as a seaman under the jones act.
price was an operating engineer,a licensed merchant mariner,and a crew member of a special purpose derrick barge named the long beach.at all times relevant,the long beach was owned and operated by defendant and respondent,connolly.
price is referred to in this litigation as a commuter seaman or sometimes as a brown water seaman.these terms are contrasted with the term blue water seaman.as the names imply,commuter seaman are those employees who commute to and from their place of employment but are not required to live aboard the vessel where they are employed.blue water seamen,by contrast,live aboard a vessel by necessity in most instances by virtue of the vessel activity in offshore or distant waters.
price affliction was caused by a sickness commonly called west nile encephalitis,as a result of being bitten by mosquito carriers.the sickness resulted in his being unable to return to work for connolly and more specifically to the long beach,which led to his termination of employment by connolly.
price sued connolly in the los angeles county superior court contending that he was entitled to maintenance and cure.price states in his opening brief on appeal that the term maintenance refers to a vessel owner duty to provide ill or injured seamen with food and lodging up to the point of maximum medical recovery,and cure entails the concomitant obligation to provide all necessary medical care.price cites gardiner service,cir,for these definitions.connolly does not take issue with these definitions.
the gravamen of connolly defense and denial of its obligation to provide maintenance and cure in this instance is the failure of price to carry his burden of proof to show that the mosquito bite or bites occurred while price was in the service of a ship,namely,the long beach.the trial court was ultimately persuaded,after an extensive and well argued bench trial with penetrating questions from the court,that price had failed to carry his burden of proof.
with these introductory comments in mind we now turn to giving a more complete statement of the facts and proceeding in the trial court.
