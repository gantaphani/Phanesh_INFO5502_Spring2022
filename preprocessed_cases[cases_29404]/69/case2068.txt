the county has appealed from a postjudgment order granting plaintiff motion to tax costs.we agree with the county that the discretion to award costs to a prevailing defendant is not limited to cases in which the plaintiff action was frivolous,unreasonable,or without foundation.we therefore reverse the order and remand for the court to exercise its discretion with regard to the claimed costs.
background 
plaintiff,who is filipina,was an experienced nurse before starting her employment at elmwood in.she was hired to work half code on the evening shift and was classified as a clinical nurse ii.jeannie haskins,the nurse manager,had hired plaintiff at the recommendation of marilyn thornton,assistant nurse manager.
haskins and thornton,both caucasian,initially supervised plaintiff.on april,thornton gave plaintiff a positive performance evaluation and recommended that she be promoted to clinical nurse iii within the next months.on july,plaintiff requested such a promotion,but thornton told her that she needed a few more months experience as a charge nurse and time serving as a preceptor nurse before receiving a recommendation for promotion.thornton stated that she would revisit the request in november,and indeed,she did make that recommendation on november.shortly thereafter,plaintiff received the promotion,which took effect december.
on april,plaintiff filed her first charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,alleging that the delay in her promotion constituted discrimination on the basis of race asian and national origin filipina.she also alleged retaliation because of her union activities.in january plaintiff had been elected of the employees union,a position that allowed her to help other nurses who had complained of discrimination at elmwood.plaintiff further alleged that she had been falsely accused of a medication error as the result of a.
at trial thornton testified that the delay in the promotion was unrelated to plaintiff being filipina.she knew that plaintiff was a union and in that capacity worked with unhappy nurses but she was unaware of the assistance plaintiff might have been giving to anyone pursuing discrimination claims.thus,she said,the promotion delay had nothing to do with plaintiff opposition to discrimination against either her or other employees.
during the two years before this discrimination charge,plaintiff had received three oral counselings private discussions about minor one written counseling,a memorandum about a more serious error.she had also received a written employee unfavorable report from haskins after she erroneously gave a patient a tetanus toxoid shot.
over the next two years,plaintiff received an oral counseling from thornton an oral counseling from her new assistant nurse manager,juno vega a filipino and a written counseling from haskins.in december her application was rejected for a position which was given to another filipina nurse by haskins replacement,remy panlilio also filipina.
on march,plaintiff filed a second charge of discrimination with the eeoc,again alleging racial discrimination and retaliation for her opposition to discriminatory practices and for her filing of a complaint with the department of fair employment and housing.in october she filed a third charge of discrimination with the eeoc,alleging retaliatory harassment based on her race,her national origin,and her charge of discrimination.since the last filing she had received three oral counselings from vega.
at trial plaintiff testified that between her first and second eeoc charges,she was closely monitored,denied requests for more hours,and subjected to undeserved discipline,daily hostility,and frequent harassment by panlilio and vega.between the second and third charges,she said,she was harassed and harangued every day by panlilio and vega.panlilio and vega denied all of these accusations.
on november,plaintiff received an oral counseling from vega.both raised their voices during the meeting.plaintiff left the counseling session feeling ill,and she telephoned her husband for a ride home.while waiting for the ride,she had her blood pressure taken.it was elevated,and she felt dizzy,weak,and nauseated.she was later diagnosed as having suffered a hypertensive episode,and she went on disability leave from elmwood.by the time of trial she had still not returned to work because she was afraid of another medical incident.
plaintiff filed a third amended complaint in december,alleging employment discrimination,retaliation,and harassment in violation of the feha,government code section,subdivisions a,f,h,and i.following a trial,the court stated the following findings.first,plaintiff had established a prima facie case of intentional discrimination in the delay in promotion,but the county had established a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the delay,and plaintiff had failed to prove that this reason was pretextual.plaintiff had also failed to establish a causal link between the delay and the unsubstantiated allegations of discrimination set forth in her first eeoc charge of discrimination.as to the denial of the position,plaintiff likewise had shown a prima facie case of discrimination,but again the county had rebutted plaintiff showing by clear and convincing evidence.the court also found that plaintiff had failed to show a causal link between the denial of her request and the charge of discrimination and retaliation set forth in the second eeoc charge of discrimination.finally,the court found that plaintiff had established a prima facie case of retaliation and harassment,but the county had rebutted her showing by clear and convincing evidence,and there was no causal link between her complaints of discrimination and the unsubstantiated allegations of retaliation and harassment set forth in her three eeoc charges of discrimination.the court parenthetically noted that nurses of various races and nationalities had complained of preferential treatment at elmwood,including some who believed that filipino nurses were favored.
discussion 
standard of proof 
in reaching its verdict the trial court applied the formula set forth in mcdonnell douglas green,supra,d mcdonnell douglas.under that formula the plaintiff has the initial burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of discrimination.the plaintiff can meet this burden by showing i that he belongs to a racial minority ii that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants iii that,despite his qualifications,he was rejected and iv that,after his rejection,the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of plaintiff qualifications.id.at.if the plaintiff succeeds in establishing the prima facie case,a presumption of discrimination arises,and the burden shifts to the employer to articulate some legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the employee rejection.texas of community affairs burdine,d guz bechtel national,cal th,d.if the employer carries this burden,the plaintiff must then have an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons,but were a pretext for discrimination.texas of community affairs burdine,supra,at.that is,the plaintiff must be given a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate by competent evidence that the presumptively valid reasons for his rejection were in fact a coverup for a racially discriminatory decision.mcd
