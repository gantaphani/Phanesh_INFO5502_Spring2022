in this case arising under welfare and institutions code section the parties dispute whether the juvenile court lawfully ordered as a probation condition that appellant,pay victim restitution on a count of the petition that had been dismissed.appellant contends the restitution order was invalid because appellant had not entered a waiver pursuant to people harvey cal d,allowing the court to consider the circumstances of the dismissed count in ordering restitution.for reasons that follow,we conclude a harvey waiver was not required.we shall therefore affirm the order for restitution.
procedural background 
on november,the district attorney filed a wardship petition against in yolo county.
as pertinent,count five alleged that on or about may,in yolo county,appellant violated section,subdivision a,of the vehicle code in that appellant did willfully and unlawfully drive and take a vehicle,to wit,a fairfield nissan maxima.
as pertinent,count eight alleged that on or about april,to may,in sacramento and yolo counties,appellant violated section,subdivision a,of the vehicle code in that appellant did willfully and unlawfully drive and take a vehicle,to wit,a dodge charger.
a probation report indicated the dodge charger in count eight was stolen from a swift dodge dealership.
the probation report said appellant and others were apprehended fleeing the scene of the theft of the nissan maxima on may.appellant admitted to police being involved in the theft of the nissan maxima and admitted having possessed a stolen dodge charger that was recently recovered by sacramento police.
the probation report also recited that appellant was already a ward of the court for prior offenses of receiving stolen property,related to vehicle theft and driving without a license.he was the subject of five prior juvenile wardship petitions for automobile theft and related offenses,filed between march and july.the probation report said,it is obvious the subject does not abide by the conditions of probation the report recommended that appellant be continued a ward of the court,committed to juvenile hall for days,and that previous conditions of probation remain in effect.
on august,pursuant to a plea agreement,appellant admitted count five theft of the nissan maxima.before accepting appellant admission to count five,the yolo county court stated there may be restitution.if you enter this admission,you would be obligated to pay restitution,any damages or loss that the victim incurred.you would have to pay what loss they incurred,if there was an agreement,and if there is,whether or not that is the right number,there would be an evidentiary hearing and t he amount would have to be determined.appellant said he understood.appellant then admitted the count five offense.the court said,then i would dismiss all other counts outright,although they may be considered for purposes of disposition.
because appellant lives in sacramento and had other matters pending there,the case was transferred to sacramento county for final disposition.
on september,the sacramento county juvenile court vacated all previous dispositional orders,continued appellant a ward of the juvenile court of sacramento county,and set forth conditions of probation,including payment of restitution in an amount to be determined by the court.
at a contested hearing to determine the amount of restitution,appellant counsel argued that there being no harvey waiver,the restitution on count should not be ordered.
at the restitution hearing,much was made of people harvey,supra,cal d,which held in the context of an adult defendant that,in the absence of an agreement to the contrary,an implicit part of a plea bargain is the understanding that the accused will suffer no adverse sentencing consequence by reason of the facts underlying,and solely pertaining to,dismissed counts unless they are transactionally related to the admitted charge.id.at.
at the contested restitution hearing,the parties agreed and the sacramento county juvenile court found no harvey waivers had been entered.
the court considered whether to order the minor to pay restitution to two nissan dealer that was the victim in count five the admitted offense and swift dodge,the alleged victim in count eight,which was dismissed.appellant objected to restitution on the dismissed count,on the ground there had been no admission or adjudication,hence no victim.the deputy district attorney,representing the department of health and human services,argued appellant had a pattern of behavior of prior vehicle theft violations and should be held accountable for that pattern of behavior.
on march,the court issued an order on contested restitution,ordering appellant and his parents by joint and several liability to pay restitution to fairfield nissan in the amount of relating to the theft of the nissan maxima count five,and to swift dodge relating to the theft of the dodge charger in the dismissed count eight which was recovered but was damaged.the restitutionary orders were conditions of probation.the order acknowledged count eight was dismissed outright,without a harvey waiver.the order said,the issue presented for resolution here is whether the court,in the absence of a harvey waiver,can lawfully order the minor to pay restitution to the alleged victim named in one of the dismissed auto theft counts,specifically swift dodge,the owner of a stolen dodge charger.the court concludes that it can make such a restitution order,even in the absence of a harvey waiver.that is because the rule announced by the court in people harvey is inapplicable in juvenile court.in re jimmy th,d.thus,a harvey waiver is not required when using dismissed allegations in determining an appropriate juvenile disposition.id.at d.
in addition to the foregoing,and after a full review of relevant documents contained in the court file,including documentary evidence contained in the yolo county file,the court finds that the theft of the charger is transactionally related to the admitted offense herein so as to justify a restitution order with regard to the taking of that vehicle,notwithstanding the fact that,as noted,the charge relating to the theft of the charger was dismissed.in re gary th,d.see also,section subdivision b which gives juvenile courts broad powers to order probation conditions to enhance the reformation and rehabilitation of a ward,including ordering victim restitution if such a condition is reasonably related to the minor conduct and furthers the goal of deterring future criminality.
discussion 
standard of review 
generally,an order of restitution will not be overturned in the absence of an abuse of discretion.citation.the court abuses its discretion when it acts contrary to law citation or fails to use a rational method that could reasonably be said to make the victim whole,and may not make an order which is arbitrary or capricious citation.in re anthony th,d juvenile court erred by ordering restitution for medical expenses in excess of actual amount expended or incurred.
ii.analysis 
appellant contends the juvenile court erred in ordering restitution to swift dodge on count eight,which had been dismissed outright,in the absence of a harvey waiver.
we note that the juvenile court said,i would dismiss all other counts outright although they may be considered for purposes of disposition.for reasons that follow,we hold that the juvenile court did not err in ordering restitution on the dismissed count.
in,by initiative measure,the voters passed proposition giving all crime victims the constitutional right to receive restitution from the offender who was convicted of committing a crime against them.cal,art.i,subd.b.the legislature implemented this section by amending the restitution statutes applicable to adult offenders people birkett cal th,d,birkett and section,which is the parallel provision applicable to juvenile offenders.birkett,supra,at,fn,d.
section,subdivision a declares that i t is the intent of the legislature that a victim of conduct for which a minor is found to be a person described in section who incurs any economic loss as a result of the minor conduct shall receive restitution directly from that minor.in re anthony,supra,th at,d.
if section were the exclusive authority for the restitution order at issue,we would conclude the order was invalid.this is because subdivision a of section requires restitution for economic loss as a result of the minor conduct however,the reference to the minor conduct refers to the precedent phrase defining the conduct conduct for which a minor is found to be a person described in section italics added.thus,subdivision a of section mandates that a minor must pay restitution where conduct for which the minor is declared a ward of the court under section results in economic loss to the victim.here,the minor was not found to be a person described in section with respect to count eight.rather,count eight was dismissed.
but we do not think that section,which was enacted to implement proposition victim bill of rights,displaced the authority of a juvenile court to impose any and all reasonable conditions of probation that it may determine fitting and proper to the end that justice may be done and the reformation and rehabilitation of the ward enhanced pursuant to section,subdivision b.see fn,ante.nothing in the language of section compels that conclusion.and,as we shall explain,numerous cases,including those of the california supreme court,have held that a court may order restitution,as a condition of probation,even where no conviction has occurred.it would be anomalous to conclude that a statute which was designed to implement the mother of all victims rights initiatives would be construed to limit victims rights.so we conclude that section specifies when restitution must be imposed.section states when restitution may be imposed as a condition of probation.in other words,as this court said recently in a different statutory context,section serve s as a floor,not a ceiling,for juvenile probation conditions citations.in re walter th,d.
the juvenile court has wide discretion to select appropriate conditions of probation and may impose any reasonable condition that is fitting and proper to the end that justice may be done and the reformation and rehabilitation of the ward enhanced.citations.in re sheena cal th,d.in determining how best to rehabilitate a minor,the juvenile court should consider the broadest range of information.in re robert th,d.consistent with section,the juvenile court enjoys broad discretion to fashion conditions of probation for the purpose of rehabilitation and may even impose a condition of probation that would be unconstitutional or otherwise improper so long as it is tailored to specifically meet the needs of the juvenile.citation.that discretion will not be disturbed in the absence of manifest abuse.citation.in re josh th,d.
in people lent cal d,the california supreme court upheld an order to pay as a probation condition victim restitution for funds allegedly taken in a related criminal charge of which the defendant was acquitted.id.at.lent said,a condition of probation which requires or forbids conduct which is not itself criminal is valid if that conduct is reasonably related to the crime of which the defendant was convicted or to future criminality.id.at.a condition of probation will not be held invalid unless it has no relationship to the crime of which the offender was convicted,relates to conduct which is not in itself criminal,and requires or forbids conduct which is not reasonably related to future criminality,italics added.this test is three prongs must be satisfied before a reviewing court will invalidate a probation term.citations.as such,even if a condition of probation has no relationship to the crime of which a defendant was convicted and involves conduct that is not itself criminal,the condition is valid as long as the condition is reasonably related to preventing future criminality.citation.people olguin cal th,d.
despite the acquittal in lent,supra,cal d,there was no question as to the relationship of the total sum of restitution orders to the crime of which the defendant was convicted,because the victim had lost a total of to which she was entitled the trial court was convinced the defendant was responsible for the loss and the crime of which the defendant was convicted involved the theft of some of those funds.ibid.
restitution for dismissed counts was upheld in in re raymond d,which followed lent to hold the juvenile court did not err in ordering victim reparation for dismissed burglaries as related losses to one admitted burglary.one of the purposes of a juvenile disposition is to impose on the minor a sense of responsibility for his own acts,subd.a,and the court may require the minor to go to work and make reparation.here each of the charged burglaries was fully admitted by appellant to the probation officer.they all occurred between august and january.the trial court could reasonably conclude that the burglaries were related and were committed with the same criminal intent.appellant was not exonerated of the other crimes,as if they had been fully tried and he had been acquitted.appellant had shown no remorse and showed no interest in making restitution although he was earning money as a dishwasher.he was planning on spending that money on a motorcycle.under all the circumstances,we conclude that the requirements of lent and people richards cal d,were satisfied and that the condition for restitution was reasonable.raymond,supra,d at.
lent was reaffirmed in people carbajal cal th,d.carbajal held in a case where a defendant pled no contest to that it was within the trial court discretion to condition probation on payment of restitution to the owner of property damaged in the accident from which the defendant unlawfully fled.citing lent but not harvey,carbajal said,we determined that an order for restitution,which attempts to make a victim whole,has generally been deemed a deterrent to future criminality,and concluded the court is not limited to transactions or amounts of which the defendant is actually convicted.carbajal,supra,cal th at,d.in addition to finding the restitution was related to the crime of leaving the scene of the accident the regulatory purpose of which was to provide others with information needed to pursue civil remedies for damages,the supreme court also concluded restitution was related to the goal of deterring future criminality in that it acted both as a deterrent to future attempts to evade his legal and financial duties as a motorist and as a rehabilitative measure tailored to correct the behavior leading to his conviction.id.at,d.there was no question as to the defendant responsibility for the loss,since he conceded he committed a negligent act of driving that caused damage to the victim parked car.ibid.
carbajal was applied in a juvenile case in in re th,d.there the court upheld an order of the juvenile court that required a minor,who was convicted of being an accessory after the fact to murder,to pay the funeral expenses of the murder victim.id.at,d.although the court cited section in a footnote th at,fn,d,its analysis was based on analogies to penal code section,concerning general conditions of adult probation,and on the opinion of our supreme court in people carbajal,supra,cal th,d,also construing penal code section probation conditions and penal code section restitution.in re,supra,th at,d.
we agree with that carbajal applies in juvenile cases.additionally,we cited lent in in re vincent th at page,d,where we said in dictum that a probation condition restricting travel in vehicles without adult supervision was proper even though it had no relationship to the offense for which the minor was adjudicated under section,possession of marijuana for sale in a school classroom.id.at,d.we said a condition of probation which requires or forbids conduct which is not in itself criminal,and is for that reason most vulnerable to challenge,is nonetheless valid if the conduct required or forbidden either a has a relationship to the crime of which the offender was convicted,or b is reasonably related to future criminality.people bauer d,citing people lent,supra,cal d at.although gang condition has no relationship to the marijuana offense that
