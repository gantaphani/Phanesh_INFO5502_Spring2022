in this case,a trucking company participated in the california automobile assigned risk plan the caarp,a statutorily created program governed by the insurance commissioner designed to make automobile liability insurance available to those unable to obtain insurance through ordinary methods.after a premium billing dispute with its insurance company,which was hired by the caarp,the trucking company defended a collection action and filed a against the company alleging that it had retroactively and knowingly charged it a substantially higher premium than was actually owed,and was therefore liable for tortious breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and for fraud.a jury found in favor of the trucking company.
we are asked to decide two questions.the first is whether the trucking company was required to exhaust the administrative remedies available to those participating in the caarp before bringing a lawsuit in which the central issue was the determination of the proper premium to be charged,a matter governed by the caarp and the insurance commissioner internal regulations.we conclude that exhaustion of remedies was not required but that,as the court of appeal alternately held,the doctrine of primary jurisdiction required the trial court to stay proceedings and refer the premium billing dispute to the department of insurance doi and the insurance commissioner.its failure to do so required reversal of the judgment in the trucking company favor.
the second question concerns our understanding of when tort damages will be available for an insurance company breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the remedy for breach of that covenant is generally limited to contract damages,but we have recognized an exception to this rule when the breach occurs in the context of an insurance company failure to properly settle a claim against an insured,or to resolve a claim asserted by the insured.see foley interactive data cal d,foley.the question presented by this case is whether an insurance company breach of the covenant sounds in tort when it retroactively overcharges a premium it knows is not owed.the trial court concluded that tort remedies were available but the court of appeal disagreed and reversed.we conclude,for reasons explained below,that the court of appeal is correct.
the factual underpinnings of this case are lengthy and complex.for purposes of this case the following summary,taken in part from the court of appeal opinion,will suffice.freddie and mildred jones owned a trucking company,known as jones trucking henceforth sometimes referred to collectively as the joneses.in,after the joneses private insurance company went out of business,they applied for and obtained,at their insurance broker recommendation,an insurance policy through the caarp.an understanding of this program and one of the rules promulgated by the program is necessary for comprehending the facts of this case.
a.the caarp and rule 
the caarp was established under section of the insurance code,requiring the insurance commissioner to approve or issue a reasonable plan to provide liability insurance for those who are in good faith entitled to but are unable to procure that insurance through ordinary methods.in general,the plan assigns such insureds to the various companies who write insurance in california and regulates the premiums that can be charged to such insureds.this assigned risk insurance is generally issued at the minimal levels required by the financial responsibility law.see.the program is administered through the caarp committee,which is advisory to the insurance commissioner see,subd.a.the committee with the approval of the commissioner shall appoint a manager to carry out the purposes of this article,employ sufficient personnel to provide services necessary to the operation of the plan,and contract for the provision of statistical and actuarial services.ibid.the caarp committee is,by statute,composed of eight employees of insurance companies that write assigned risk policies,four public members,two representatives of insurance agencies,and the insurance commissioner or his or her designee.ibid.
there are certain classes of vehicle users whose financial exposure and potential danger to the public is much greater than is contemplated by the ordinary assigned risk placement.among these is the class of commercial truckers.in order to accommodate these higher risk vehicle users,the insurance commissioner in promulgated by regulation at,tit,et the commercial automobile insurance procedure caip.the assigned risk plan for truckers is also administered by the caarp committee,of which there is a separate caip subcommittee that handles policy issues arising from truckers insurance.
caarp hires two servicing carriers,tit,subd.e,who provide all of the insurance policies issued under the caip.these carriers have a contract with the caarp by which they are paid a percentage of the premium as a fee for their services.they turn all premiums over to caarp and charge all claims to the caarp,which then distributes the charges among automobile liability carriers in california.thus,the servicing carriers are not typical insurance companies in the sense of a company putting its own assets at risk through its underwriting and premium practices.instead,risk is borne by the insurance industry at large,underwriting and premium practices are specified by the caarp and the doi,and the servicing carrier is paid a commission for implementing and administering the program,based on premiums billed.insurance company became one of the servicing carriers in.
the caarp is run according to rules promulgated by the doi and contained in the california automobile assigned risk plan manual of rules and rates.see,tit.of particular relevance is rule of the manual rule,which governs the premiums assessed to truckers for their use of independent truckers,or subhaulers.in general,insured truckers premiums are determined by the number of trucks they own and operate.but the california public utilities commission puc,which at the time this controversy arose regulated truckers such as the joneses required these subhaulers to have their own puc certificates of authority and their own liability insurance.the joneses made extensive use of subhaulers,paying out over half their annual gross receipts to them.
the testimony indicated that california was somewhat unique in issuing puc certificates directly to subhaulers,with the attendant requirement that the subhauler have its own insurance.in other states,according to the testimony,only the primary trucking company had insurance and the hired carriers were covered under that insurance.in its original form,california rule incorporated the generic,nationwide rule resulting in uncertainty concerning the way the rule applied in california 
rule was rewritten by the doi after a period of study and consultation with the insurance industry.the revised rule,tailored to the california situation,specifically applied to exposure based on a subhauling agreement involving the hauling of goods on behalf of an insured trucker by a hired carrier.
the revised rule recognized that in some circumstances the primary trucker insurance would be called upon only to provide excess coverage if a claim exceeded the limits of liability of the subhauler insurance,thereby justifying substantially lower premiums.thus,the revised rule stated,at paragraph.a the insured trucker may request and the caip servicing carrier shall provide coverage for the hired carrier exposure on an excess basis where an insured trucker demonstrates at the time of application or upon renewal that all of the following criteria are satisfied and such criteria remain satisfied throughout the policy period the five criteria,set forth in the margin address both the form and the substance of the relationship between the trucker and the subhauler.the premium applicable if the insured trucker is able to satisfy all criteria is only percent of the otherwise applicable premium.
the revised rule also modified the otherwise applicable premium.although the premium was based on the cost of hiring the subhaulers,as had been the case under the original rule,the base multiplier was reduced from to.the revised rule required that the total cost of hiring would be calculated on the basis that each subhauler vehicle was hired for a minimum of of work per year.
as the revised rule was implemented from september of forward,certain problems revealed themselves.some of the problems occurred because the doi required the carriers to implement the rule on a retroactive basis if requested by insureds.many insureds did not have the required detailed records readily available to establish their eligibility for the five criteria for excess coverage.further,smaller truckers like the joneses did not use any particular subhauler for anywhere near of work per year.
b.the joneses premium dispute 
the joneses insurance application under the caarp and caip was assigned to by the assigned risk program office.they purchased a commercial assigned risk liability insurance policy from in march,when the old rule was still in effect.issued a policy in a form required by the doi.it charged the joneses an initial estimated annual premium of,based on the joneses use of their own,specified vehicles in the business.over the term of the policy,assessed additional premiums as the joneses added equipment to their fleet.the total premiums charged and paid during the policy year was approximately.
the policy issued to the joneses permitted it to reassess the initial premium based on new information.as the policy stated the premium for this policy is based on information we have received from you or other sources.you agree that if any of this information material to the development of the policy premium is incorrect,incomplete or changed,we may adjust the premium accordingly during the policy period.to cooperate with us in determining if this information is correct and complete,and to advise us of changes in this information.the policy also provide the estimated premium for this coverage form is based on the exposures you told us you would have when this policy began.we will compute the final premium due when we determine your actual exposures.
after the policy period expired,did an audit of the joneses to make sure all vehicles used in the business had been accounted for in the calculation of premiums.auditors discovered the joneses extensive use of subhaulers,and assessed the joneses,under old rule,another in insurance premiums for the coverage period that had just expired.reaudited the joneses under new rule and adjusted the premium to.
the joneses believed the retroactive premium charge was in error and that the charges for subhaulers should have been on an excess basis under the new rule,as explained above.after the initial reaudit,but before learning of the downward adjustment of the premium,the joneses sought the help of the doi.they were eventually routed to elizabeth mohr,the doi attorney principally in charge of the caarp.after speaking with mohr,the joneses received a consumer complaint form,which they filled out and returned to the doi consumer services division as directed.in response,the rating services bureau of the doi consumer services division acknowledged the complaint and wrote to asking for an explanation of the premium increase 
replied in a letter to the joneses,copied to the doi,that upon physical audit,it was determined that there were additional vehicles to be added,and it had applied the primary insurance rate for these subhaulers because not all of revised rule requirements for an excess rate were met.the reply further advised that was removing several vehicles and represented that a copy of the auditor report is attached.informed the doi of the readjustment resulting from the reaudit.did not,however,provide the second page of the audit report stating that its auditor had insisted that the audit must be done based on the records available at the time of the audit and had refused the joneses request for days to recreate their records.
based on response,the doi wrote the joneses advising them that the premium had been reduced and that unless you can meet the guidelines in the auditor report with which they must comply by providing with the correct information,there was nothing further the department can do to cause your premiums to be reduced further.the doi response did not evidence any awareness of the controversy between the joneses and over whether the former would be permitted time to recreate their records to establish coverage for subhaulers.
although had a general policy to inform its insureds about the administrative grievance appeals procedure available through the caarp see,tit,it did not inform the joneses about the availability of such an appeal when they complained to about the additional premium.the joneses did not file an appeal with the caarp.
the joneses declined to pay the additional premium.assigned its claim to jonathan neil associates,a collection agency,which sued the joneses for the balance due on the premium.the joneses responded with a,initially for bad faith and subsequently amended to state a fraud cause of action.
moved for summary judgment on two bases that the joneses failed to state a tort cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and that they had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.the trial court denied the motion.petitioned the court of appeal for writ relief,which the court summarily denied.
the trial was divided into three phases.phase i was a trial to the court without a jury on certain matters of interpretation of various doi rules and regulations,including the meaning of rule above,as well as other legal questions on statutes and policy language.phase ii was a trial to the jury of the complaint and.the jury found the joneses owed no additional premiums and found liable for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and for fraud.it awarded the joneses in compensatory damages from for lost profits,based on the joneses testimony that uncertainty over the premium bill caused them to close their business each in emotional distress damages to freddie and mildred jones and for attorney fees and costs pursuant to brandt superior court cal d.phase iii was a trial to the jury concerning the amount of punitive damages to be awarded.the jury awarded punitive damages against in the amount of.in posttrial proceedings,the trial court conditioned its denial of a new trial motion on remittitur of the punitive damages award to.while preserving their right to,the joneses consented to the remittitur.
and jonathan neil associates,hereafter collectively,filed timely notices of appeal,as did the joneses.the court of appeal reversed.it first held that as a matter of law,tort damages are not available for the breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in an insurance contract when the breach involves a dispute over premiums,as opposed to matters concerning payment or settlement of insurance claims.the court of appeal also concluded that the joneses were required to exhaust their administrative remedies with the doi,or alternatively that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction required an initial resort to such remedies before bringing a lawsuit.because the joneses failed to fully avail themselves of such remedies,the court reversed the trial court judgment and remanded with directions to stay proceedings until doi remedies had been exhausted.we granted review to consider both issues.
ii.discussion 
exhaustion of administrative remedies 
the first question posed by this case is whether the joneses failed to exhaust their administrative remedies with the doi,or,in the alternative,whether the doctrine of primary jurisdiction requires the doi to initially decide the questions of the proper premium to be charged.we conclude that the latter doctrine is implicated here and that the judgment should be reversed on that basis.
our discussion of the exhaustion doctrine in rojo kliger cal d,rojo shows that the doctrine consists of at least three distinct strands,justified by somewhat different rationales.first,when a statute and lawful regulations pursuant thereto establish a quasijudicial administrative tribunal to adjudicate statutory remedies,the aggrieved party is generally required to initially resort to that tribunal and to exhaust its appellate procedure.as witkin explains the administrative tribunal is created by law to adjudicate the issue sought to be presented to the court.the claim or cause of action is within the special jurisdiction of the administrative tribunal,and the courts may act only to review the final administrative determination.if a court allowed a suit to be maintained prior to such final determination,it would be interfering with the subject matter jurisdiction of another tribunal,at,quoting witkin,cal.procedure,actions ed,at.
second,the exhaustion doctrine has been applied when a private or public organization has provided an internal remedy.see westlake community hosp.superior court cal d,westlake.whereas the exhaustion requirement in the first category is based on a discernment of legislative intent,the second category is more a matter of judicial policy the reason for the exhaustion requirement in this context is plain w e believe as a matter of policy that the association itself should in the first instance pass on the merits of an individual application rather than shift this burden to the courts.for courts to undertake the task routinely in every such case constitutes both an intrusion into the internal affairs of private associations and an unwise burden on judicial administration of the courts.citation.rojo,supra,cal d at.in this context,the exhaustion of administrative remedies furthers a number of important societal and governmental interests,including bolstering administrative autonomy permitting the agency to resolve factual issues,apply its expertise and exercise statutorily delegated remedies mitigating damages and promoting judicial economy.ibid.
third,courts have required exhaustion of external administrative remedies in a variety of public contexts.rojo,supra,cal d at.in such cases,although the legislative intent to resort in the first instance to administrative remedies is not entirely clear,courts have required exhaustion when they have expressly or implicitly determined that the administrative agency possesses a specialized and specific body of expertise in a field that particularly equips it to handle the subject matter of the dispute.typical of these is karlin zalta d,involving a physician class action for equitable relief and damages arising out of defendant insurers alleged charging of excessive malpractice insurance premium rates t he court held plaintiffs were required to exhaust their administrative remedies under the mcbride act.citing the factual complexities of medical malpractice insurance ratemaking and the mcbride act pervasive and system of administrative procedure for monitoring rates and relevant market conditions,the court determined the issue was a matter singularly within the technical competence of the insurance commissioner through the enlistment of agency resources.d at.in these circumstances,the court held,it is indispensable that the expertise of the insurance commissioner and the agency staff be initially engaged to make such review.rojo,supra,cal d at.
in addition to the above three categories,we have recognized in some cases that although exhaustion is not required,the doctrine of primary jurisdiction of administrative agencies,long used in federal law,should be invoked to require resort to an administrative agency to resolve issues within its particular area of expertise.in farmers ins.exchange superior court cal th,d,farmers ins.exchange,we explained that exhaustion and primary jurisdiction are two closely related concepts citation.both are essentially doctrines of comity between courts and agencies.they are two sides of the timing coin each determines whether an action may be brought in a court or whether an agency proceeding,or further agency proceeding,is necessary.citation.exhaustion applies where a claim is cognizable in the first instance by an administrative agency alone judicial interference is withheld until the administrative process has run its course.primary jurisdiction,on the other hand,applies where a claim is originally cognizable in the courts,and comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which,under a regulatory scheme,have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body in such a case the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views.citations.farmers ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d.
the policy reasons behind the two doctrines are similar and overlapping.the exhaustion doctrine is principally grounded on concerns favoring administrative autonomy,courts should not interfere with an agency determination until the agency has reached a final decision and judicial efficiency,overworked courts should decline to intervene in an administrative dispute unless absolutely necessary.citations.t he primary jurisdiction doctrine advances two related policies it enhances court decisionmaking and efficiency by allowing courts to take advantage of administrative expertise,and it helps assure uniform application of regulatory laws.citations.
no rigid formula exists for applying the primary jurisdiction doctrine citation.instead,resolution generally hinges on a court determination of the extent to which the policies noted above are implicated in a given case.citations.this discretionary approach leaves courts with considerable flexibility to avoid application of the doctrine in appropriate situations,as required by the interests of justice.farmers ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d,fns.omitted.
in farmers ins.exchange,the attorney general brought suit against various insurance companies,asserting that they violated insurance code sections and by refusing to offer good driver discounts to appropriate applicants and sufficient discounts to those who qualified.the attorney general also alleged that the violation of these provisions constituted an unlawful business practice actionable under the unfair practices act,business and professions code section et.we concluded that the insurance code claims presented a question of exhaustion of administrative remedies the people can not litigate insurance code claims over which the insurance commissioner has been given exclusive jurisdiction without first invoking and completing the available administrative process set out in the insurance code.citation.by contrast,t he business and professions code claim is originally cognizable in the courts,and thus it triggers application of the primary jurisdiction doctrine.farmers ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d.
we further concluded that the primary jurisdiction doctrine was properly invoked first,the insurance commissioner has at his disposal a pervasive and system of administrative procedure rojo,supra,cal d at,to deal with the precise questions involved herein.second,and more important,based on the allegations in the people complaint,there is good reason to require that these administrative procedures be invoked here w e conclude that considerations of judicial economy,and concerns for uniformity in application of the complex insurance regulations here involved,strongly militate in favor of a stay to await action by the insurance commissioner in the present case.farmers ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d.it seems clear to us that the insurance commissioner is best suited initially to determine whether his or her own regulations pertaining to eligibility for a good driver discount have been faithfully adhered to by an insurer.similarly,the determination of whether a given good driver discount policy comports with the percent discount provision of the statute also calls for exercise of administrative expertise preliminary to judicial review.id.at,d.
as discussed,the chief distinction between the two doctrines is that the primary jurisdiction doctrine applies to cases originally cognizable in the courts farmers ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d,whereas exhaustion generally applies to certain statutory claims initially cognizable by an administrative agency see rojo,supra,cal d at,feha claimants statutorily required to exhaust administrative remedies.another related distinction between the two doctrines is that in the case of exhaustion,the administrative agency must initially decide the entire controversy,whereas under the primary jurisdiction doctrine,the court makes its own decision based in part on the agency decision on an issue or issues within the case.koch,administrative law and practice ed.
we conclude that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction rather than exhaustion of remedies should be applied here.both suit for breach of contract and the joneses for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and fraud are originally cognizable in court.the insurance commissioner has no authority to decide these common law claims,but can only make a determination regarding some of the issues in the case.nor can we discern in insurance code section et an absolute statutory bar to prosecuting such claims absent a prior administrative determination.
that being said,the case for invoking the primary jurisdiction of the insurance commissioner is compelling.the issues raised in the joneses directly implicate the regulatory authority and expertise of the insurance commissioner.what we stated in farmers ins.exchange applies with at least as much force in this case the insurance commissioner has at his disposal a pervasive and system of administrative procedure farmers ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d,in the form of an assigned risk program heavily regulated and indeed ultimately governed by the commissioner.as discussed,the caarp was created by the insurance commissioner pursuant to insurance code section,in order to accomplish the important public purpose of providing automobile liability insurance to those unable to obtain such insurance by ordinary methods.the caarp committee and caip subcommittee are advisory to the insurance commissioner,pursuant to section,subdivision a.one of the statutorily required features of the caarp is the establishment of an appeal to the commissioner by persons who believe themselves aggrieved by the operation of the plan,subd.b.pursuant to this statute,the commissioner has adopted section of title,california code of regulations,which provides in pertinent part that any insured under the plan who is affected by any act,ruling,decision or order of an insurer,the manager or the caarp committee may complain to the committee,with the committee decision eventually appealable to the insurance commissioner,who will then render a decision which shall be binding upon all parties.
furthermore,as in farmers ins.exchange,concerns for uniformity in application of the complex insurance regulations here involved,strongly militate in favor of a stay to await action by the insurance commissioner in the present case.farmers ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d.premiums under the caip for truckers such as the joneses are set according to rules promulgated by the doi and the caarp.at the heart of the present controversy is a dispute about an interpretation and application of rule regarding the method of computing insurance premiums to cover an insured trucking company subhaulers under the caip,including the type of documentation required to qualify for a retroactive assessment of the premium on an excess basis in conformity with paragraph.a of the rule.the doi interpretation and application of these regulations in the first instance is necessary to secure regulatory uniformity informed by its expertise and extensive experience with this area of regulation.indeed,the insurance commissioner,as amicus curiae,vigorously argues in favor of an exhaustion of remedies requirement as a means of securing such regulatory uniformity.
the conduct of the trial that did occur in this case,without the benefit of the insurance commissioner final determination of the premium issues,confirms the need to afford the insurance commissioner primary jurisdiction.the record reveals that at least six witnesses currently or formerly employed by the doi testified about the operation of rule or the inner workings of the caarp.the joneses,in their opening brief in the court of appeal,stated that the jury trial was tantamount to a two month training course on assigned risk underwriting,auditing,and premium calculation.such time and expense was in addition to the similar training course the trial court had to undergo in phase i of the trial.the reliance on doi experts and the need to intensively train the judge and jury on the fine points of an insurance regulatory scheme illustrate the folly of bypassing a statutorily authorized grievance process within the doi,operated by employees who would not require such training,and who might have been able to expeditiously resolve the matter.
we conclude for all the above reasons that the trial court abused its discretion in not staying the proceeding and referring the premium dispute issue to the doi.the proper remedy is to reverse the judgment and direct such reference occur on remand.see general american tank car el dorado terminal.appropriate to stay judicial proceedings already initiated,even when trial has concluded,to permit administrative determination of issues pertinent to the litigation.the fact that a lengthy trial has already been held,which may well have been unnecessary,highlights the need for trial and appellate courts to timely apply the primary jurisdiction doctrine when appropriate 
the joneses also claim,in effect,that they have already exhausted their administrative remedies.as discussed,the joneses did file a complaint through the doi generic complaint process pursuant to insurance code section.the department official,after an apparently superficial investigation,concluded that the joneses would be required to submit more paperwork regarding their subhaulers,as requested by.the joneses contend that misrepresented to the doi the paperwork requirements imposed on the joneses,and also strenuously,and not unpersuasively,argue that these requirements were intrinsically unfair and impossible to meet.but the joneses did not attempt to inform the doi of misrepresentation,nor to press the matter with the doi personnel in charge of handling the complaint,much less pursue an appeal.the joneses also contend that did not inform them of the caarp appeal process.but such a process was public information and there was no indication that the joneses,who were represented by counsel at this point and who were already in contact with the doi,were affirmatively misled into believing that such appeal was unavailable.
failure to exhaust administrative remedies is excused if it is clear that exhaustion would be futile.sea sage audubon society,planning com.cal d.similarly,it is improper to invoke the primary jurisdiction of an administrative agency if it is clear that further proceedings within that agency would be futile.see farmers ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d,application of primary jurisdiction doctrine not required when the policy interests underlying the doctrine would not be served.the joneses claim such futility with respect to the doi remedies.we disagree.the futility exception requires that the party invoking the exception can positively state that the agency has declared what its ruling will be on a particular case.sea sage audubon society,planning,supra,at,italics omitted.there is nothing in the record to indicate how the doi would have decided the joneses case had the latter fully availed themselves of the caarp complaint and appeals processes 
the trial court judgment must therefore be reversed and the matter stayed pending the insurance commissioner determination of the additional premium,if any,owed by the joneses,and related issues.see reiter cooper,d proceeding to be stayed unless in the interest of justice the trial court dismisses without prejudice.on remand,the joneses,if they wish to continue the action,must pursue the doi administrative remedies to its conclusion.like the court of appeal,we conclude that at this juncture,the matter should be referred to the caarp committee,which has the specific expertise to address the premium issue,rather than to the doi generic complaint process,with right of appeal to the insurance commissioner.see,tit.if the insurance commissioner decides against the joneses in the underlying billing dispute,then the litigation will likely come to an end.if the commissioner decides in the joneses favor,then the joneses may proceed with their lawsuit,but trial will be assisted by the fact that the commissioner has made a decision on the billing dispute that is the predicate for the suit 
tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
because this case may be retried,we address the other issue in this case whether the joneses have an action in tort for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
every contract imposes upon each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its performance and its enforcement.citation.because the covenant is a contract term,however,compensation for its breach has almost always been limited to contract rather than tort remedies.as to the scope of the covenant,t he precise nature and extent of the duty imposed by such an implied promise will depend on the contractual purposes.citation.initially,the concept of a duty of good faith developed in contract law as a kind of safety valve to which judges may turn to fill gaps and qualify or limit rights and duties otherwise arising under rules of law and specific contract language.citation.as a contract concept,breach of the duty led to imposition of contract damages determined by the nature of the breach and standard contract principles.foley,supra,cal d at.
in the area of insurance contracts the covenant of good faith and fair dealing has taken on a particular significance,in part because of the special relationship between the insurer and the insured.we have held that the insurer,when determining whether to settle a claim,must give at least as much consideration to the welfare of its insured as it gives to its own interests.the governing standard is whether a prudent insurer would have accepted the settlement offer if it alone were to be liable for the entire judgment.citations.the standard is premised on the insurer obligation to protect the insured interests in defending the latter against claims by an injured third party.egan mutual of omaha ins.cal d.a breach of this duty of reasonable settlement gives rise to tort damages.crisci security ins.cal d.
the implied covenant imposes obligations not only as to claims by a third party but also as to those by the insured.citations.in both contexts the obligations of the insurer are merely two different aspects of the same duty.citations.for the insurer to fulfill its obligation not to impair the right of the insured to receive the benefits of the agreement,it again must give at least as much consideration to the latter interests as it does to its own.egan mutual of omaha ins,supra,cal d at.as in the case of failure to properly settle third party claims,w hen the insurer unreasonably and in bad faith withholds payment of the claim of its insured,it is subject to liability in tort.id.at.
in foley,supra,cal d,the court refused to extend the tort of bad faith to the employment relationship,concluding that it was substantially different from the insurance relationship.in so concluding,it focused on three areas.first,when an insurer in bad faith fails to properly settle or pay a claim,the insured can not turn to the marketplace to find another insurance company willing to pay for the loss already incurred.the wrongfully terminated employee,on the other hand,can and must,in order to mitigate damages citation make reasonable efforts to seek alternative employment.citation.second,the role of the employer differs from that of the insurance company with whom individuals contract specifically in order to obtain protection from potential specified economic harm.the employer does not similarly sell protection to its employees it is not providing a public service third,i n the insurance relationship,the insurer and insured interest are financially at odds but as a general rule it is to the employer economic benefit to retain good employees.the interests of employer and employee are most frequently in alignment.if there is a job to be done,the employer must still pay someone to do it thus the need to place disincentives on employer conduct in addition to those already imposed by law simply does not rise to the same level as that created by the conflicting interests at stake in the insurance context.id.at,fn.omitted see also cates construction,talbot partners cal th,d,refusing to extend the remedy for tortious breach to breaches of performance bonds for reasons similar to those in foley.
the question at issue is whether tort remedies should be extended to the breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing when the insurer has in bad faith retroactively billed an insured for an excessive premium.the joneses argue that the factors discussed immediately above apply in such insurer is compromising the availability of a public service,and the insured will not obtain replacement insurance for a policy year partly or wholly passed.the joneses also assert that the interest of insurers and insureds in billing disputes are adverse.
in addressing this issue,we first observe that,generally speaking,the insurer ability to charge excessive premiums will be disciplined by competition among insurers.in the present case market forces,to be sure,are less significant,both because the premium is assessed retroactively and because the insurance program is an assigned risk plan,a public insurance program of last resort.but although the caarp insurer is not restrained by the marketplace from overcharging premiums,in the caarp program is extensively regulated,and an insured faced with such an overcharge may seek administrative remedies established in place of market controls to expeditiously resolve billing disputes,as discussed above.
aside from this observation,there are several critical factors that counsel against the availability of tort remedies for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the present case.first,the billing dispute does not,by itself,deny the insured the benefits of the insurance security against losses and third party liability.see old republic ins.fsr brokerage th,d.second,the dispute does not require the insured to prosecute the insurer in order to enforce its rights,as in the case of bad faith claims and settlement practices.see ibid.
third,traditional tort remedies may be available to the insured who is wrongfully billed a retroactive premium.if the premium charge is wholly unjustified,the insured may,after successfully defending the action,sue for malicious prosecution.see sheldon appel albert oliker cal d.if the debt is reported to third parties,to the debtor detriment,a defamation action may lie.pulver avco financial services d.schneider united airlines,d.the untruthful,bad faith creditor may also be liable for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.see walsh glendale fed.sav.loan d,disapproved on other grounds in garrett coast southern fed.sav.loan cal d.
the joneses contend that the very act of billing a retroactive excess premium created such financial uncertainty as to compel them to close their business.assuming someone in a similar position to the joneses can prove that,notwithstanding their resort to available administrative remedies,the excessive premium charge compelled them to close their business,lost profits would be available even when the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing sounds only in contract,so long as the lost profits were among the natural and direct consequences of the breach.brandon tibbs george kevorkian accountancy d.breach of contract action permitting lost profit damages.
the joneses cite a number of cases in the workers compensation insurance context in which the bad faith overbilling of a premium was held to sound in tort.typical of these cases is security officers service,state compensation ins.fund th,d security officers service.the plaintiff employer contracted for workers compensation insurance with the state compensation
