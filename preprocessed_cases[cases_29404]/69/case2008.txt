discussion 
loss of goodwill caused by gvr not shown 
appellants contend the jury,not the court,determines whether the loss of goodwill was caused by the taking of the property or the injury to the remainder code civ,subd.a hereinafter,section a and that they made the requisite showing.we disagree.
goodwill in this context consists of the benefits that accrue to a business as a result of its location,reputation for dependability,skill or quality,and any other circumstances resulting in probable retention of old or acquisition of new patronage,subd.b.the property owner has the initial burden to prove,by the preponderance of the evidence,that there was a loss of goodwill caused by the taking of the property or the injury to the remainder a.see,redevelopment agency of san diego attisha th,d regents of university of california sheily sheily th,d redevelopment agency thrifty oil th,d.
we conclude the trial court did not err in refusing to allow a jury to decide the issue of whether the prerequisite conditions for compensation existed.compensation for goodwill loss involves a process.whether the qualifying conditions for such compensation a have been met is a matter for the trial court to resolve only if the court finds these conditions exist does the remaining issue of the value of the goodwill loss,if any,go to the jury.see,emeryville redevelopment agency harcros pigments,th,d accord,sheily,supra,th at,d.
ii.august,proper date of valuation 
appellants contend the trial court erred in finding august,the date of city original deposit,to be the date of valuation,because city failed to deposit the true and real amount of probable compensation for etcr property when it commenced this action in,and has never deposited any compensation on behalf of nts.original italics.also,it would be an unconstitutional denial of due process to value etcr property on a date three years prior to the determination that city was entitled to take not simply possess that property.original italics.alternatively,appellants argue that,if the date of valuation is the date of deposit,this date should be the date of city supplemental deposit,which was september.we find appellants positions unpersuasive.
a property owner has a constitutional right to just compensation,which is the fair market value of the property at the time the taking occurred by the public entity.redevelopment agency gilmore gilmore cal d,see also,cal,art.i.
in a straight eminent domain action no pretrial possession sought,the statutory date of valuation is the date the action began if trial on the compensation issue is commenced within one year on the other hand,the statutory date of valuation is the date when trial on that issue commenced if trial is not brought within one year after the action began,leaf city of san mateo d,overruled on another ground in trope katz cal th,d.
nonetheless,the statutory date of valuation does not control where its effect would deprive the owner of just compensation.gilmore,supra,cal d at,in this situation,the valuation date would be the date that affords the owner just compensation.see saratoga fire protection dist.hackett th,d kirby forest industries,united states,d convention of using the date of the commencement of the trial as the date of the valuation violates fifth amendment if the result of that approach is to provide the owner substantially less than the fair market value of his property on the date the united states tenders payment.
in contrast,the date of valuation under the quick take or early possession law et is a date on which the condemner deposits probable just compensation for the property,which entitles condemner to seek immediate possession.see,gilmore,supra,cal d at.
as we shall demonstrate,the appropriate date for valuation of the property was august,rather than september,the date city voluntarily increased its original deposit,or december,the date of trial,which was more than a year after the action was filed.
on august,city deposited,which represented the probable compensation based on lidgard appraisal.based on this date,michael mason,city trial appraiser,valued the property at.on september,city voluntarily increased its deposit to reflect this amount.see,subd.f.
at trial,the court ruled august,was the date of valuation.the court rejected appellants argument that the date of valuation had to be changed in light of city supplemental deposit.
initially,we conclude the trial court did not err in finding august,to be the date of valuation under the quick take statutory scheme.it is undisputed that city made its deposit of probable compensation on august,subd.a,and on september,the court issued an order of immediate possession.
we further conclude city supplemental deposit on september,did not require the date of deposit to be changed to this later date.appellants have not cited any persuasive authority for the proposition that the date of a voluntary supplemental deposit supersedes the date of the original deposit.moreover,such a conclusion is not compelled by law 
under the quick take statutory scheme,the condemner or any party having an interest in the property for which the deposit was made is entitled to make a motion requesting the court to determine or redetermine whether the amount deposited is the probable amount of compensation that will be awarded in the proceeding,subd.a.if the condemner has taken possession of the property and the court determines that the probable amount of compensation exceeds the amount deposited,the court shall order the amount deposited to be increased to the amount determined to be the probable amount of compensation.if the amount on deposit is not increased accordingly within days from the date of the court order,or any longer time as the court may have allowed at the time of making the order,the condemnee may serve on the condemner a notice of election to treat that failure as an abandonment of the proceeding.if the condemner does not cure its failure within days after receipt of such notice,the court shall,upon motion of the condemnee,enter judgment dismissing the proceeding,subd.c.
a plain reading of these provisions does not support an inference that the date of deposit,and thus date of valuation,transforms into the date of a supplemental deposit.rather,the designated consequence of the condemner refusal to increase the original deposit to the amount determined by the court is the possible dismissal of its eminent domain action.in other words,if appellants had invoked the procedure to increase the deposit,they might have obtained a ruling that was insufficie
