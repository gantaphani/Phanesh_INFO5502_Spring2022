plaintiffs are the widow and two children of the decedent,rajesh saxena.saxena died in february after seeking treatment from willie goffney for an open wound on his right leg.plaintiffs brought a wrongful death action against goffney and others involved in saxena medical care for wrongful death,negligence,and battery.the jury concluded goffney was negligent in the diagnosis or treatment of saxena and that he performed a procedure on saxena without his informed consent.the jury awarded plaintiffs million in noneconomic damages,over in economic damages,and allocated percent of the fault to goffney.
goffney moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict jnov on plaintiffs battery claim.he also moved for a new trial and to conform the judgment to the medical injury compensation reform act micra.despite concluding the special verdict by plaintiffs and given at their not require the jury to determine whether goffney committed a battery,the court denied the jnov motion.instead,it granted a new trial on plaintiffs battery and informed consent negligence claims,and on damages.the court denied goffney motion for new trial on plaintiffs negligence cause of action and declined to consider goffney micra motion.
goffney appeals the denial of his jnov motion.plaintiffs the order partially granting a new trial.in a separate petition,goffney seeks a writ of mandate prohibition compelling the court to grant his motion for new trial on plaintiffs negligence claim.we consolidate the writ petition with the appeals to promote judicial efficiency and avoid piecemeal adjudication of the issues 
we conclude the court should have granted goffney jnov motion.accordingly,we reverse the jnov and new trial orders.we remand with directions to grant goffney jnov motion on the battery claim,to consider goffney micra motion,and to enter the resulting judgment for plaintiffs on the negligence claims and for goffney on the battery claim.we deny goffney writ petition.
in january,saxena sought treatment from goffney at the la palma wound center wound center for an open wound in his right leg.the plan was for goffney,a general surgeon,to perform a series of surgical procedure used to remove dead or infected tissue from an open saxena leg.goffney would then cover the wound with apligraf,a synthetic substitute,to promote healing.during his initial appointment with goffney,saxena signed a consent form authorizing goffney to evaluate,assess,and treat his wound.
goffney performed debridements on january,and.by early february,however,saxena health declined the wound on his leg was bleeding constantly he was using crutches he had a fever and he was having difficulty breathing.during an appointment on february,saxena complained to goffney that he had chills and a fever.goffney concluded saxena had the flu and performed another debridement.saxena wife,neelofer,took saxena to the emergency room on february because he continued to have a fever.
saxena was scheduled to return to the wound center on february for the final debridement and apligraf application.that morning,neelofer felt saxena health was getting worse and worse so she tried,unsuccessfully,to reschedule the appointment.at the request of a nurse in goffney office,neelofer brought saxena to the wound center that evening.according to neelofer,she listened as saxena told goffney he wanted to postpone the debridement and apligraf procedure.neelofer also testified she begged and pleaded for goffney to postpone the procedure until her husband regained his strength.in response,goffney explained he would have to throw out the cost he did not use it that day.he debrided the wound,applied the apligraf,and sent saxena and neelofer home.saxena died the following day of congestive heart failure.
plaintiffs alleged wrongful death and negligence claims against goffney and others.the first amended complaint added a battery claim against goffney.the battery cause of action alleged goffney performed medical procedures on saxena without his informed consent.these medical procedures included intentional,unlawful and harmful contact by said defendants.plaintiffs further alleged a s a direct and proximate result of the battery saxena suffered injuries resulting in death.the court overruled goffney demurrer to the battery claim,concluding the allegations were sufficient to state a cause of action.
trial proceeded against goffney only.after the close of evidence,goffney moved for a nonsuit on plaintiffs battery claim.the court denied the motion.the court then gave the jury two instructions on the battery claim.the first instruction,based on former judicial council of california civil jury instructions,caci,recited the elements of battery as follows plaintiffs claim that goffney committed a battery.to establish this claim,plaintiffs must prove all of the following.that goffney performed a medical procedure without saxena consent.that saxena was harmed and.that goffney conduct was a substantial factor in causing saxena harm.a patient can consent to a medical procedure by words or conduct.over goffney objection,the court also gave the jury a special instruction on plaintiffs battery claim which provided if you find that goffney performed a surgical procedure on saxena or provided other medical treatment to saxena without his informed consent,you may find goffney liable for battery,even if you find that the surgery was skillfully performed and he was not negligent.
the court presented plaintiffs version of the special verdict form to the jury.the special verdict form asked the jury to answer the following questions was goffney negligent in the diagnosis or treatment of saxena was goffney negligence a substantial factor in causing the death of saxena did goffney perform a debridement and apligraf procedure on saxena on february,did saxena give his informed consent for the debridement and apligraf procedure on february,would a reasonable person in saxena position have refused the debridement and apligraf procedure if he or she had been fully informed of the possible results and risks of the procedure,and alternatives to the procedure would saxena have consented to the procedure performed on him on february,even if he had been given enough information about the risks of the procedure and was saxena harmed as a consequence of a result or risk that goffney should have explained before the debridement and apligraf procedure was performed questions eight through of the special verdict form asked the jury to calculate plaintiffs damages.
the jury returned a verdict for plaintiffs.it concluded goffney was negligent in the diagnosis or treatment of saxena and that goffney performed the debridement and apligraf procedure on february without saxena informed consent.the jury also determined saxena would have refused the debridement and apligraf procedure on february had he been fully informed of the possible risks of,and the alternatives to,the procedure.
after the verdict was rendered but before judgment was entered,goffney moved for jnov on plaintiffs battery claim and for a new trial.goffney also filed a motion to conform the judgment to micra.the court denied the jnov motion.instead,it ordered a new trial on the battery and lack of informed consent negligence claims,and on damages.the court concluded the special verdict form did not require the jury to make a finding on battery and that plaintiffs special jury instruction was manifestly prejudicial to goffney because it improperly blended the legal doctrines of battery and negligence.the court also determined the damages award could not stand because of the instructional error,the deficiencies in the special verdict form,and the jury failure to apportion damages between the battery and negligence claims.the court denied goffney new trial motion on plaintiffs negligence claims.
discussion 
the court denial of goffney jnov motion was erroneous 
we turn first to the court denial of goffney jnov motion.as an initial matter,we reject plaintiffs contention that the court denial of the motion is not appealable because the issue of damages remain s before the trial court for determination.an appeal may be taken from an order denying a motion for jnov even where the trial court has granted,or denied,a new trial motion.code of civ.proc,subd.a see also eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group.
goffney contends the court denial of his jnov motion was erroneous because there was insufficient evidence he committed battery or intended to harm saxena.we need not reach these issues because we agree with goffney third basis for reversal the jury special verdict did not include any findings on plaintiffs battery cause of action 
the informed consent doctrine 
to place the issues in context,we briefly discuss the distinction between negligence and battery as set out by the california supreme court in cobbs grant cal d,cobbs.an action should be pleaded in negligence when the doctor performs an operation to which plaintiff consents,but without disclosing sufficient information about the risks inherent in the surgery.id.at.the battery theory should be reserved for those circumstances when a doctor performs an operation to which the patient has not consented.id.at.
our high court has made it clear that battery and lack of informed consent are separate causes of action.a claim based on lack of informed sounds in when the doctor performs a procedure without first adequately disclosing the risks and alternatives.in contrast,a battery is an intentional tort that occurs when a doctor performs a procedure without obtaining any consent.see,conte girard orthopaedic surgeons medical group,th,d a battery is an intentional and offensive touching of a person who has not consented to the touching perry shaw th,d doctor committed claim distinct from professional he performed an operation to which plaintiff did not consent warren schecter th,d discussing statute of limitations for medical malpractice action arising out of a failure to obtain informed consent to surgery nelson gaunt d.battery should be reserved for those circumstances where a doctor performs an operation to which the patient has not consented.
the special verdict form was fatally defective because it did not require the jury to make a finding on plaintiffs battery claim 
we analyze the special verdict form de novo.city of san diego horton san diego holding,th,d a special verdicts correctness must be analyzed as a matter of law.a special verdict must present the conclusions of fact as established by the evidence,and not the evidence to prove them and those conclusions of fact must be so presented as that nothing shall remain to the court but to draw from them conclusions of law.code civ.the requirement that the jury must resolve every controverted issue is one of the recognized pitfalls of special verdicts.t he possibility of a defective or incomplete special verdict,or possibly no verdict at all,is much greater than with a general verdict that is tested by special findings myers building industries,interface technology,th,d myers see also falls superior court d.falls.
a special verdict is fatally defective if it does not allow the jury to resolve every controverted issue.insulation highlands ins.th,d myers,supra,th,d.myers is instructive.there,the owner of a building and its general contractor filed against each other for breach of contract,fraud,and other claims.by special verdict,the jury concluded the building owner breached its contract with the general contractor,and awarded the general contractor punitive damages.myers,at,d.the court of appeal struck the punitive damages award because n o special verdict findings were submitted to the jury on any cause of action except breach of contract,even though the general contractor had pleaded a cause of action against the building owner for fraud.id.at,d.according to the myers court,the punitive damages award could not be sustained because the jury was neither requested to nor made the necessary factual findings for a tort verdict.id.at,d.
supra,th at,d,reached a similar result.that case concerned the reasonableness of an insured bankruptcy settlement and the effect of its reorganization plan on its excess insurers.the trial court entered judgment in favor of the insured,and a jury calculated the amount of the insurers liability.id.at,d.the appellate court reversed the jury liability findings.id.at,d.it concluded the special verdict form was fatally defective because it did not require the jury to make any finding on the issue of the reasonableness of the reorganization plan.id.at,d.as the court explained,the jury finding that the insured was not guilty of inequitable misconduct did not answer the distinctly different question of whether the plan was unreasonable.id.at,d.
the same is true here.the jury concluded goffney performed the debridement and apligraf procedure on february without saxena informed consent by answering no to the following question did saxena give his informed consent for the debridement and apligraf procedure performed on february,italics added.the special verdict form did not require the jury to answer the separate and distinct question of whether goffney performed the procedure with no consent at all.because the special verdict form did not require the jury to make a finding on battery,it is like a puzzle with pieces missing the picture is not complete.falls,supra,d at.
plaintiffs offer several arguments urging us to overlook the deficiencies in the special verdict form,all of which fail.first,plaintiffs contend the use of the phrase informed consent in question four of the verdict form made no functional difference because lack of informed consent and lack of any consent are the same.this argument has no merit for the reasons discussed above.moreover,the related questions on the verdict form dealt with lack of informed consent,not the lack of any consent.thus,the jury found a reasonable person in saxena position would have refused the procedure if he or she had been fully informed of the risks,and saxena would not have consented to the procedure had he been given enough information about the risks.further,the cases plaintiffs cite to support their contention are inapposite because they either concern conditional consent,a theory plaintiffs did not pursue here,or address situations where a doctor fraudulent misrepresentations about a proposed procedure vitiated the patient consent.see ashcraft king d.rains superior court d.
plaintiffs also contend the only interpretation of the verdict consistent with the evidence is the jury concluded saxena did not consent to the procedure.we disagree.at plaintiffs request,the court instructed the jury it could find goffney liable for battery if he performed the procedure without saxena informed consent.this instruction conflated the theories of negligence and battery it allowed the jury to find goffney liable for battery by concluding he performed the procedure without saxena consent,or by concluding saxena consented without sufficient information performing a medical procedure without informed consent is not the same as performing a procedure without any consent.but the verdict form read as a whole unmistakably relates to the lack of informed consent.because it is impossible to determine how the jury would have resolved the battery issue had it been instructed properly and had it been asked to answer the question of whether goffney performed a procedure without saxena consent,we will not speculate on the basis of the verdict.bracisco beech aircraft d.instead,we will read the verdict to mean what it says.the jury found goffney did not have saxena informed consent when goffney performed the procedure on february and that saxena would not have consented to the procedure had he been given enough information about the risks.
we also reject plaintiffs argument that goffney waived his right to challenge the special verdict form.goffney is not challenging the special verdict form as such.he merely argues the verdict form submitted by plaintiffs,and the verdict returned by the jury,does not support entry of judgment on a battery theory.moreover,courts have declined to apply the waiver rule where the record indicates that the failure to object was not the result of a desire to reap a technical advantage or engage in a litigious strategy.woodcock fontana scaffolding equip.cal d,fn,witkin,cal.procedure ed.trial,failure to raise the objection to special verdict form does not always result in a waiver some element of negligence or culpability must appear.there is no waiver here because goffney raised the issue in the trial court.he alerted the court to the difference between medical negligence and battery in his demurrer to plaintiffs battery cause of action and he also objected to plaintiffs special jury instruction on the grounds that it confuses the issue of informed consent with battery.as defense counsel explained,under cobbs,lack of informed consent is medical negligence.lack of consent,period,is a battery in the medical context.the special jury instruction tends to equate both of those legal theories.goffney also raised the error in his motion for new trial.although he did not object to the phrase informed consent in the special verdict form,there is no indication goffney failed to object as part of a litigation strategy or to gain a technical advantage.he tried,but failed,to persuade the court it was allowing plaintiffs to conflate the distinct legal theories of negligence and battery.it was plaintiffs responsibility to tender their case to the jury.if plaintiffs chose to submit a verdict form tendering less than their full case to the jury,goffney had no further incentive to object.
plaintiffs cite jensen bmw of north america,th,d jensen,for the proposition that a party always waives any error regarding a special verdict form by failing to object to it before the court discharges the jury.in jensen,a jury awarded damages for bmw failure to comply with the warranty act act.the trial court denied bmw motion for new trial and bmw appealed,contending the special verdict form was defective because it failed to submit for jury resolution the primary issue of bmw liability under the act.id.at,d.the court of appeal affirmed,holding the special verdict form was not prejudicially defective and,in any event,bmw had waived its right to challenge the form by not objecting before the jury was discharged.ibid.
jensen is inapposite.there,the jury was allowed to award damages without first being asked if bmw was liable for violating the act.bmw wanted the jury to find it was liable before awarding damages,but it did not ensure the question was in the verdict form.here,and unlike bmw,goffney did not want the jury to conclude he committed a battery,so he had no obligation to ensure that questions on the verdict form addressed plaintiffs battery claim.
plaintiffs next the invited error doctrine precludes goffney from challenging the special verdict also unavailing.the doctrine of invited error is an application of the estoppel principle where a party by his conduct induces the commission of error,he is estopped from asserting it as a ground for reversal on appeal.norgart upjohn cal th,d,norgart.the purpose of the doctrine is to prevent a party from misleading the trial court and then profiting therefrom in the appellate court.ibid.plaintiffs,not goffney,invited the error.the jury did nothing more than follow the explicit instructions in the special verdict form,which plaintiffs counsel prepared.if plaintiffs wanted the jury to answer additional questions when navigating the special verdict form,they should have included them.they did not and,as a result,they are bound by the defective special verdict form.myers,supra,th at,fn,d.
we note goffney submitted a similar verdict form.but goffney had already lost his argument on plaintiffs erroneous special battery instruction and his motion for a nonsuit had already been denied.plaintiffs were responsible for pursuing an erroneous battery theory both in the special instruction and in the verdict form.plaintiffs received what they asked for a verdict establishing liability for medical negligence and nothing more.even if we assume,for the sake of argument,that goffney caused the defective verdict form,the invited error doctrine does not apply.the doctrine does not extend to situations where a party induces the commission of the error,but does not in fact mislead the trial court in any where a party endeavor s to make the best of a bad situation for which it was not responsible.norgart,supra,cal th at,d,see also huffman interstate brands th,d the invited error doctrine requires affirmative conduct demonstrating a deliberate tactical choice on the part of the challenging party de anza santa cruz mobile estates homeowners de anza santa cruz mobile estates th,d.here,there is no evidence goffney made a deliberate tactical choice to keep quiet about the verdict form at trial and then profit from it on appeal,nor is there any evidence goffney misled the trial court.in fact,the opposite is true goffney the court about the differences between lack of any consent and lack of informed consent.
the court below was troubled by the failure of the special verdict form to address plaintiffs battery claim.in its order denying the jnov motion,the court noted the distinction between negligence and battery and the absence,in the special verdict,of any findings that defendant committed a battery,even though the jury was presented with evidence of that intentional tort.the court analysis of the problem was correct.its solution,however,was not.the proper way to remedy the defective verdict was to grant goffney motion for jnov on plaintiffs battery claim,not to order a new trial.see myers,supra,th at,fn,d.the grounds for a new trial are wholly statutory,and there is no inherent power in the trial court to grant a new trial.witkin,supra,attack on judgment in trial court.simply put,goffney claim that the special verdict form did not include a finding on plaintiffs battery claim was not a ground for a new trial under any provision of section.
the court denial of goffney motion for new trial was not an abuse of discretion the court exclusion of two defense witnesses was harmless error 
the court declined to grant a new trial on plaintiffs negligence claim because it concluded the errors in the verdict form and special jury instruction did not infect the jury finding that goffney breached the standard of care nor was there any irregularity in that finding.the court also determined it properly excluded the testimony of gary flashner and nurse james palmer,two defense witnesses.in his writ petition,goffney contends a new trial on the negligence claim will cure the evidentiary error of excluding flashner and palmer.goffney contends flashner and palmer would have rebutted plaintiffs testimony that saxena was not a candidate for surgery.specifically,goffney argues flashner who treated saxena during his february emergency room visit would have testified saxena did not display any symptoms of congestive heart failure.palmer,who apparently was present during the february debridement and apligraf procedure,would have testified saxena was breathing normally and that neither saxena nor neelofer asked goffney to postpone the procedure 
the court exclusion of flashner and palmer stemmed from goffney failure to identify them during discovery.plaintiffs served judicial council of california form interrogatory interrogatory,which asked goffney to provide the name,address,and telephone number for each individual who witnessed the incident or the events occurring immediately before or after the incident who made any statement at the scene of the incident who heard any statements made about the incident by any individual at the scene or who has knowledge of the incident.in response,goffney stated he was not aware of any witnesses to decedent medical care other than those individuals identified in her sic medical records.goffney also failed to identify flashner and palmer in response to judicial council of california form interrogatory interrogatory,which asked goffney to list all witnesses having information supporting his denial of all material allegations and his affirmative defenses.in his response to that interrogatory,goffney stated it is anticipated that some or these entire affirmative defense sic will be supported by documents in sic decedent medical records that are available to all parties.
ten days before trial,apparently as part of the pretrial issue conference required by local court rule,plaintiffs served a motion in limine for an order excluding the testimony of witnesses not identified in discovery.the motion was nonspecific neither flashner,nor palmer,nor any other potential witness was identified.also,apparently as part of the same issue conference pursuant to local rule,goffney listed flashner and palmer on his trial witness list.on the first day of trial,goffney served a supplemental response to interrogatory listing names,including flashner and palmer,but failing to provide their contact information.the record on appeal does not contain any information regarding the court ruling,if any,on the motion in limine,but goffney counsel referred to the anticipated testimony of flashner and palmer during his opening statement without objection by plaintiffs.near the conclusion of plaintiffs case,however,when goffney announced that flashner and palmer would be his witnesses for the next day,plaintiffs objected.after hearing argument,the court excluded the testimony of both witnesses.
in his motion for new trial,goffney argued excluding flashner and palmer was highly prejudicial because they would have rebutted p laintiffs claim that saxena health was so impaired that the debridement and apligraf procedure should not have been performed.goffney also claimed his failure to list flashner and palmer in his interrogatory responses was not a misuse of the discovery process under section.presumably relying on thoren johnston washer d.thoren,the court concluded that excluding flashner and it characterized as witnesses with regard to the two issues that were among the most important at the trial was proper because their identities were well known to goffney when he responded to plaintiffs interrogatories and because goffney unjustifiably failed to list them in his responses.
broadly speaking,an appellate court reviews any ruling by a trial court as to the admissibility of evidence for abuse of discretion.people ex rel.lockyer sun pacific farming th,d.the court discretion is only abused where there is a clear showing it exceeded the bounds of reason,all of the circumstances being considered.id.at,d.even where a trial court improperly excludes evidence,the error does not require reversal of the judgment unless the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice.cal,art.vi.goffney has the burden to demonstrate it is reasonably probable a more favorable result would have been reached absent the error.tudor ranches,state comp.ins.fund th,d tudor ranches.as we discuss below,the court abused its discretion by excluding the testimony of flashner and palmer.but we can not,on the record before us,conclude the court exclusion of the two defense witnesses was prejudicial.
precluding a witness from testifying at trial is proper where a party willfully and falsely withholds or conceals a witness name in response to an interrogatory.thoren,supra,d at.where the party served with an interrogatory asking the names of witnesses to an occurrence then known to him deprives his adversary of that information by a willfully false response,he subjects the adversary to unfair surprise at trial,italics added.under these circumstances,an order barring the testimony of the witness must be sustained as a sanction ibid.
we note thoren does not stand for the proposition that evidence may be excluded based on the mere failure to supplement or amend an interrogatory answer that was truthful when originally served.biles exxon mobil th,d see also r b auto center,farmers group,th,d.nor does thoren stand for the proposition that evidence may be excluded on the ground an interrogatory answer is evasive or incomplete.the civil discovery act et provides specific remedies for evasive or incomplete discovery responses.the imposition of an evidence sanction is not one of the remedies.
section,subdivision a,provides that the party propounding an interrogatory may file a motion to compel a further response where the answer received is evasive or incomplete.and the failure timely to file a motion to compel a further response to an evasive or incomplete answer constitutes a waiver of any right to a further response,subd.c.the prevailing party on a motion to compel further responses is limited to an award of monetary sanctions,subd.d.an evidence sanction is available only where the responding party fails to obey an order compelling further response to interrogatories,subd.e.
the civil discovery act also warns,however,that the failure to respond to discovery,or the making of evasive responses to discovery,is not condoned.the failure e to respond to an authorized method of discovery,subd.d,and making an evasive response to discovery,subd.f are defined as m isuses of the discovery process.but the sanctions for misuse of the discovery process are limited t o the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of the civil discovery act.thus,the sanctions available to remedy evasive or incomplete responses to interrogatories are limited to those contained in chapter of the civil discovery act et.
the thoren case involved conduct not specifically covered by the civil discovery a willfully false answer to an interrogatory.giving a willfully false answer is not even included in the civil discovery act definitions of a misuse of discovery,unless the prohibition against causing unwarranted annoyance,embarrassment,or oppression,or undue burden and expense is broadly construed.see,subd.c.the thoren court,relying on a former provision of the civil discovery act,approved the exclusion of a witness testimony as a sanction for giving a willfully false answer,likening the false answer to no answer at all.thoren,supra,d at.a willfully false answer to an interrogatory must be treated as the equivalent of no answer at all.the discovery statute then extant authorized the imposition of an evidence sanction for the willful failure to serve and file answers to interrogatories.see fn,ante.while current law continues to treat a failure to respond to discovery as a misuse of the discovery process,subd.d,the imposition of an evidence sanction is now conditioned upon the violation of an order compelling the response,subd.c.thus,current law has replaced the former requirement for the imposition of an evidence the failure to respond was willful with the requirement that the responding party violated an order compelling the response.
although the statutory basis for the imposition of an evidence sanction has changed,thoren has never been overruled.its application,however,is narrow,covering a circumstance not specifically dealt with in the civil discovery act.thus,in the absence of a violation of an order compelling an answer or further answer,the evidence sanction may only be imposed where the answer given is willfully false.the simple failure to answer,or the giving of an evasive answer,requires the propounding party to pursue an order compelling an answer or further the right to an answer or further answer is waived and an evidence sanction is not available.t he burden is on the propounding party to enforce discovery.otherwise,no penalty attaches either for the responding party failure to respond or responding inadequately.weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group.
the party moving to exclude evidence as a sanction for discovery abuse has the initial burden of establishing grounds supporting the request.where,as here,the court has not issued an order compelling a response or further response to an interrogatory and where such an order has not been violated,the party moving for the exclusion of evidence has the burden of establishing the answer given by the responding party was willfully false,intentionally not true.here,goffney responses to interrogatories and directed plaintiffs to look in saxena medical records to determine the identities of individuals with knowledge of the incident,or who had information supporting goffney affirmative defenses.plaintiffs presente
