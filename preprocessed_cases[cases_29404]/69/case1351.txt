ireane kellogg sued her former employer,oilind safety,under the americans with disabilities act ada,et,and the fair labor standards act flsa,et.she claimed that oilind discriminated against her in violation of the ada by firing her after she was diagnosed with epilepsy,and denied her overtime payments to which she was entitled under the flsa.the jury found for her on both claims and awarded her damages.in addition,the district court awarded kellogg prejudgment interest,front pay under the ada,liquidated damages under the flsa,and attorney fees.oilind appeals.with respect to the ada claim,it argues that the jury improperly found that kellogg was a qualified individual who was substantially limited in a major life activity because the court erred in instructing the jury that driving is a major life activity,kellogg failed to prove that she was disabled within the meaning of the ada,and kellogg failed to prove that she was a qualified individual who could perform the essential functions of her job,with or without reasonable accommodation.it also argues that the court abused its discretion in awarding front pay under the ada.as for the flsa claim,oilind argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury verdict and that the court erred in granting kellogg liquidated damages.although we reject oilind other contentions regarding the ada claim,we agree that the jury was erroneously instructed that driving is a major life activity under the ada.we therefore remand for a new trial on the ada claim.we affirm the jury verdict on the flsa claim and hold that there was no abuse of discretion in the award of liquidated damages.
background 
oilind hired kellogg as a safety technician in worland,wyoming,in june.oilind is an industrial safety company that provides services,such as training and environmental monitoring,to industrial customers.it also rents,sells,and services safety equipment,such as gas monitors and air packs.oilind operates offices in states and during employed approximately people.the worland office is one of oilind four oilfield offices.at the time of trial,nine employees worked in the worland office.
as part of kellogg job as a safety as a safety supervisor,to which she was later traveled to oilfields to provide services to clients.kellogg also occasionally worked in the shop in worland,where she maintained and repaired breathing equipment and cylinders of compressed air.when kellogg worked in the field,she would pick up a company vehicle from the shop in worland and drive as much as two hours to the work site,where she would typically work a shift before leaving to drive back to worland.kellogg was paid as a salaried employee at the rate of a month,until she received a raise to per month in december.in addition,she received field bonuses based on oilind billings to customers.although the job posting described the job as hours per week,it is undisputed that kellogg sometimes worked more than hours a week.she testified that in her busiest month she worked hours above a pace.
on january,kellogg missed a day of work.the next day,when her coworkers asked where she had been,she had no recollection of the day before and had not realized that she had missed a day.she was seen that day by a doctor,who told her that she could not return to work until cleared by him.two days later,after losing consciousness at home,kellogg was hospitalized and diagnosed with complex partial seizures,a form of epilepsy.on january her doctor issued her a note allowing her to return to work,but not to drive until he saw her again.
some time in early february,kellogg took her doctor note to the worland office and asked to work in the shop.the wyoming district manager for oilind,aaron chamberlain,wanted to put her to work in the shop because they were shorthanded and could not handle the workload,but he first had to check with corporate headquarters.kellogg returned to the shop every week to check on her job on one visit to the shop,chamberlain told her that the corporate office considered her a liability,vol.iii at.in a letter dated may,oilind informed kellogg that it was not able to employ her in a position,which it declared hers to be,without a full release from her doctor.id.vol.vii at.without such a release,it would remove her from the payroll.kellogg never provided oilind with a release allowing her to drive.
kellogg brought suit against oilind under the ada,alleging disability discrimination,and under the flsa,alleging that she was entitled to overtime compensation.after an trial,the jury found for kellogg on both claims.on her ada claim it awarded her in compensatory damages reduced by the district court to the statutory maximum of,and in past wages and it awarded in overtime wages under the flsa.the district court additionally awarded kellogg in front pay under the ada,in liquidated damages under the flsa,in prejudgment interest,and in attorney fees under both the ada and flsa.
ii.discussion 
the ada prohibits employment discrimination against any qualified individual with a disability because of the disability.a.
a prima facie case of ada discrimination consists of three elements the plaintiff is a disabled person as defined by the ada is qualified,with or without reasonable accommodation,to perform the essential functions of the job held or desired and suffered discrimination by an employer or prospective employer because of that disability.
zwygart bd.of county comm rs,cir.only the first and second elements are at issue on appeal.
disability driving as a major life activity 
the first element of a discrimination claim under the ada is proof that the plaintiff has a qualifying disability under the statute.the ada defines disability as a a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual b a record of such an impairment or c being regarded as having such an impairment.the term major life activities is not defined in the statute,but a regulation promulgated by the equal employment opportunity commission defines it as functions such as caring for oneself,performing manual tasks,walking,seeing,hearing,speaking,breathing,learning,and working.i.
the categorization of an activity as a major life activity is crucial to the determination of disability.oilind argues that the jury verdict must be vacated because the jury was erroneously instructed that driving constitutes a major life activity under the ada.the district court first expressed its view in an order partially granting and partially denying a motion for summary judgment by oilind 
this court believes that there is no question that in wyoming,where public transportation is virtually,distances between towns is measured by hours of driving,economic conditions often require residents to seek employment outside of their local community,and long winter conditions significantly limit foot or bicycle travel,driving is clearly a major life activity.see toyota motor,kentucky,williams,d finding that major life activities refers to those activities that are of central importance to daily life.
vol.i at.oilind objected at trial to the instructions that included driving as a major life activity,but the objection was overruled.
the interpretation of a federal statute is a question of law which this court reviews de novo.scanlon white,comm r,cir.whether driving constitutes a major life activity under the ada is a question of first impression in this circuit.the two courts of appeals that have published opinions on the question have concluded that it is not.see colwell suffolk county police,cir chenoweth hillsborough county,cir.although driving is not one of the listed activities in the eeoc regulation,that does not end the inquiry because the regulation does not purport to give an exhaustive list.
it can not be disputed that driving is an extremely important daily activity to many,even most,adults.without the ability to drive,it may be very difficult to care for oneself or to work.indeed,we have recognized that the activity of c aring for one self encompasses normal activities of daily living including driving holt grand lake mental health,cir internal quotation marks omitted.but driving is,literally,a means to an end.the activities enumerated by the eeoc caring for oneself,performing manual tasks,walking,seeing,hearing,speaking,breathing,learning,and working are all profoundly more important in and of themselves than is driving.there are those who drive just for the pleasure of it hey,let go for a ride,but that practice is declining and some would now consider it unpatriotic.moreover,the importance of the enumerated activities is not dependent on where one lives they are valued as much by the resident of a major metropolitan area as by an isolated rural resident.driving,in contrast,may be a minor concern for one who is near convenient mass transit and can walk to work.
to conclude,as did the district court,that driving is a major life activity because of its importance to the performance of other major life activities,such as caring for oneself or working,would shortcircuit the analysis in determining whether one of those major life activities has been substantially limited.for instance,to show a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working,the plaintiff must,under the eeoc regulations,establish a significant restrict ion in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training,skills and abilities.j i.undoubtedly,an inability to drive will sometimes enable the plaintiff to meet this standard.see best shell oil,cir.likewise,a restriction on driving could cause one to be substantially limited in the activity of caring for oneself.but a plaintiff should not be permitted to bypass having to prove substantial limitations in these major life activities by providing only evidence that she can not drive.
we hold that driving is not itself a major life activity.because the jury was not required to indicate on the verdict form which major life activity or activities it found to be substantially limited,it is impossible to know whether the jury based its verdict on just the legally incorrect ground that kellogg was unable to drive.when an appellate court can not determine whether a jury reached its verdict on an incorrect legal theory presented in the instructions,it must set aside the verdict.see farrell klein tools,cir.we therefore vacate the verdict on kellogg ada claim.
sufficiency of the evidence 
oilind urges us to go further than merely setting aside the verdict.it argues that it is entitled to entry of judgment in its favor on the ada claim because there was insufficient evidence to support the jury verdict even on the theories of relief for which the instructions were correct.it contends that the evidence was insufficient to support two propositions necessary for the verdict that kellogg was a person with a disability and that she was a qualified individual.oilind moved on these grounds for judgment as a matter of law jmol under federal rule of civil procedure a and b and the district court denied the motions.we review this denial de novo.kelly metallics west,cir.
a jmol is warranted only if the evidence points but one way and is susceptible to no reasonable inferences supporting the party opposing the motion.we do not weigh the evidence,pass on the credibility of the witnesses,or substitute our conclusions for those of the jury.however,we must enter judgment as a matter of law in favor of the moving party if there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis with respect to a claim or defense under the controlling law.we must view the evidence and any inferences to be drawn therefrom most favorably to the party.
mcinnis fairfield communities,cir internal quotation marks omitted.for the reasons that follow,we agree with the district court on these issues.
disability 
oilind argues that kellogg did not establish that she is a person with a disability as defined by the ada because she did not show that she had an impairment that substantially limited her in the major life activities of working or caring for herself.establishing the existence of such an impairment,however,is only one of three ways to prove a disability under the ada.a plaintiff may also show that she had a record of such an impairment,b,or that she was regarded as having such an impairment,id.c.kellogg pursued at trial the theory that oilind regarded her as having an impairment that substantially limited at least one of her major life activities.yet oilind has not addressed on appeal that potential ground for finding kellogg disabled.because oilind has not argued,much less demonstrated,that the evidence at trial would not support a jury finding that oilind regarded kellogg as having an impairment that substantially limited one of her major life activities,we may assume that the evidence did support such a finding,so denial of jmol was correct.see lindstrom united states,cir arguments not raised in appellant brief are waived.
qualification 
the second element of an ada discrimination claim is proving that the plaintiff is a qualified individual with a disability.see zwygart,at.as we explained in tate farmland industries,cir 
the ada defines a qualified individual with a disability as an individual with a disability who,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.as a condition to performing the essential functions of an employment position,however,an individual must first satisfy the requisite skill,experience,education and other requirements of the employment position.m.if a plaintiff fails to establish that he has met either step of this analysis,he is not a qualified individual within the meaning of.
id.at footnote omitted.
there is no dispute that kellogg was qualified to do her job before she was diagnosed with epilepsy.at trial oilind claimed that there were two job requirements that kellogg could no longer meet after her diagnosis she could not drive,and she could not meet the standards in dot pipeline regulations to perform work in the shop,vol.iv at.in tate we discussed when an employer stated requirement for a job should be considered an essential function of the job 
the question of whether a job requirement is a necessary requisite to employment initially focuses on whether an employer actually requires all employees in the particular position to satisfy the alleged requirement.milton scrivner,cir holding under the ada that an essential function of a job must be actually required of all employees in the particular position.this inquiry is not intended to second guess the employer or to require the employer to lower company standards.see also ii,at,reprinted in,the ada does not undermine an employer ability to choose and maintain qualified workers.provided that any necessary job specification is,and consistent with business necessity,the employer has the right to establish what a job is and what is required to perform it.
applying these tests,we conclude that the jury could properly have found that neither of oilind claimed job requirements was an essential function of kellogg job.as to the first,the jury could find that driving was not an essential function of the job,because there was testimony that at least twice in the past,the worland office had allowed safety supervisors who had lost their driving privileges after infractions to work in the shop until their licenses were restored.as to the second,the jury could find that the ability to meet dot pipeline regulations which allegedly prohibited anyone on a medication from working in a not a requirement of the job,given that these regulations were never produced for the jury and no witness from the company was able to give more than a vague description of them.chamberlain,the district manager,said that he had been unaware of any regulations prohibiting kellogg from working in the shop until the corporate office told him so.when the company president was asked about the pipeline regulations,he testified that he was familiar with the ones applicable to oilind,but he did not identify any of them.he claimed that the medical restrictions for positi
