tommy morgan was terminated as a managing partner with new york life.
he brought an age discrimination action under the ohio civil rights act.
the jury found in his favor.
the jury awarded him in compensatory damages and in punitive damages.
new york life raises several issues on appeal that the district court erred in denying new york life motion for judgment as a matter of law and abused its discretion in denying new york life motion for a new trial despite its alleged legitimate business justifications for morgan termination that the district court abused its discretion in admitting statements of alleged age animus that were unrelated to morgan and were not proximate in time to his termination that the district court abused its discretion in declining to give new york life proposed jury instruction relating to statements of alleged age animus and that the district court improperly upheld the punitive damages award because the amount is excessive and does not comport with due process.
for the reasons that follow,we find no error in the district court decision to deny new york life motion for judgment as a matter of law and motion for a new trial.moreover,the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting statements of alleged age animus or in declining to give new york life proposed jury instructions.thus,we affirm its judgment as to the compensatory damages award.
however,we vacate the punitive damages award and remand the case to the district court with instructions to enter an order of remittitur reducing the award.
background 
on january,tommy morgan,who at the time was years old,was appointed managing partner of new york life insurance company northern ohio office.new york life conducts a nationwide business selling from its local offices life insurance,annuities,and related products and services.as managing partner,morgan was the senior executive in charge of the cleveland office and was responsible for achieving the performance goals set by the company for the office and its sales agent force.the company has approximately general offices that are organized into four zones,each with to general offices.previously,morgan had worked four years as managing partner of new york life smaller corpus christi office.the cleveland office is in the south central zone.
an office success is determined largely by sales revenue and manpower.the two interact in that sales are made by agents and managing partners such as morgan recruited new agents,trained and retained existing agents,and selected and trained other managers who would also recruit agents.according to phil hildebrand,who was and executive of insurance operations,manpower growth represents everything including future sales and the future management of the company.thus,the growth of the company from within was integral to its success.the managing partner also ensured that his office adhered to company and regulatory standards.
during his tenure as managing partner,morgan earned between and per year.the pay of any managing partner is based on objective criteria.managing partners receive a base pay that will increase or decrease depending on sales and manpower performance.robert,the chief operating officer of the south central zone,testified that if manpower grows faster than the assigned goal,the managing partner can earn up to more.if it drops,managing partner pay may fall as much as.
prior to morgan arrival,the cleveland office was performing well under the leadership of eric campbell.early in his tenure,morgan was given and agreed to a series of performance benchmarks for his position.other managing partners received similar benchmarks.manpower growth was an important component.morgan was to personally recruit at least eight new agents each year,assure that office recruiters meet their enlistment goals each year and cultivate retention of existing agents.the parties dispute how well morgan performed.
new york life notes morgan evaluation shows that he fell below office performance targets in each of the several categories,including actual office results versus goal revenue,new organization growth,life production,paid life growth,manpower and retention.the company uses an index that it calls growth profitably and accountability gpa as one means of measuring a manager performance.managing partners are periodically given a gpa score,ranging from to,based upon several performance criteria.morgan final adjusted gpa was.according to the evaluation,morgan failed to meet all but one of the seven targets set for his office.he exceeded his goal for manpower growth.morgan gpa was.morgan evaluation showed significant improvement in many areas new york life notes,however,that actual results were more than below goals and life production growth was minus,rather than the target of plus.morgan met or exceeded his goals in the other categories.his gpa was.morgan evaluation shows that he again failed to meet several goals,including manpower growth.the number of agents in the cleveland office fell from to.morgan was told to focus on recruiting,manpower development and retention.
morgan alleges that he consistently surpassed the performance criteria set for him.consequently,he earned income each year from to.moreover,the average in commissions was significantly higher during morgan tenure than it was in the five years before he arrived.according to morgan,however,a series of events which were beyond his control plagued the office.in,barrett weinberger was ranked second in the nation among all agents.he soon became disabled and his production went from about to zero.another agent,john tijanich,embezzled over million from new york life clients.new york life stipulated that morgan was not at fault in any way.jack guttman,a veteran agent who predated morgan arrival,was involved in some wrong dealings,completely unrelated to the insurance industry,and nyl terminated his contract.
according to new york life manual for managing partners,a written performance improvement program should be established if the gpa is less than.it further provides that a performance warning should be issued if the gpa is less than,or performance shows a continuous decline,even if the overall rating is acceptable.new york life internal evaluation and accountability system includes various cautionary directives that can be given to managing partners performance alert,written performance warning,final notice and termination.these are typically progressive steps.according to new york life,morgan july performance warning was based on downward trends.he first received a warning rather than an alert because,according to robert,morgan really was eligible for an alert.new york life set performance requirements for morgan to meet by december a gpa of or more increase in new organization commissions and a agent retention rate of.
at the time of morgan performance warning,new york life calculated his gpa as,a number morgan disputed,claiming it should have been.according to brad willson,who succeeded paul morris as senior of the south central zone,the gpa played only a small part in morgan performance warning.downward office trends were the primary consideration.willson stated that any gpa discrepancy would not have affected the decision.at the time,morgan acknowledged that improvement was needed in several areas.
when morgan performance did not improve after being placed on performance warning,he was placed on final notice.it was willson decision to place morgan on this status.according to new york life manual,a performance notice or final notice is issued in those situations where prior actions have not produced satisfactory results or where performance has deteriorated so rapidly that urgent action is required.at the end of the performance or final notice period,if the managing partner has not reached the objective specified in the improvement plan,his or her managing partner contract should be terminated.
morgan final written notice stated that he would be removed as managing partner if he did not meet seven specified requirements by june.one requirement was a five percent growth in manpower,which meant increasing the number of agents to.by june,it looked as though morgan had satisfied each requirement,including the five percent manpower increase.he reported exceeding his goal of agents by three.according to morris,four of the agents reported as part of the manpower increase zeno,abbott,kumahor,and chorak met the commission revenue requirement only by splitting commissions with other agents already in the office manpower count.morris explained that a proper commission split occurs when two agents work together to secure business and agree to share the commission earned by their combined efforts.new york life sought to avoid having poorly qualified recruits count in manpower because experience taught that these agents were often unsuccessful.manipulation of commissions was against company policy.
after an investigation,the corporate for agency standards,christopher tebeau,determined that four of the manpower triggers were based on splits that were not consistent with nyl rules.tebeau stated that three of the splits appeared to be gifts and the explanation as to the fourth was a lie.new york life alleges that when those four commission splits were deducted from morgan cleveland manpower count,he fell below the manpower count given to him as part of his final notice.morgan states that he was told by in august that although a few of the splits were questionable and would not be allowed,the rest were acceptable and that he met his requirement.on september,called again and told morgan that a fourth commission split involving zeno was in doubt.morgan acknowledged that zeno did no work on the sale of the annuity for which he received a split.
on september,morgan met with willson and.they informed morgan that his employment was terminated because he failed to meet the manpower requirements,as provided in new york life written manual.willson testified that he consulted with in deciding to discharge morgan.morgan was replaced by mo abdou,the old manager of new york life orlando office.
according to morgan,new york life decision to replace morgan with abdou is revealed in a document entitled managing partner selection process,which specifically referred to the cleveland office.the document contains the notation,update of,and listed the candidates for replacing the cleveland managing partner.the date listed appears to show that abdou had been selected for the position on or before september,a date before new york life had determined that morgan failed to meet the manpower requirement.a new york life witness testified that only a portion of the list was created on september and the remainder was created on september.
morgan filed suit against nyl.the district court granted new york life summary judgment motion as to morgan sex discrimination and defamation claims.morgan claim for age discrimination under ohio law and his claim for reverse race discrimination proceeded to trial.new york life moved in limine to exclude certain statements that morgan proposed to offer as evidence of alleged animus toward older workers.the trial court denied the motion.new york life proposed a jury instruction to guide the jury in evaluating any statements attributed to it and admitted into evidence.the court declined to give the instruction.new york life moved for a directed verdict on the age discrimination claim,which the court denied.
the jury found in favor of morgan on his age discrimination claim and awarded him in past and in future economic compensatory damages,in compensatory damages,and in punitive damages.it found in favor of new york life on morgan race discrimination claim.judgment was entered and the court denied new york life reserved directed verdict motion as to punitive damages.new york life filed various motions,which were denied by the district court on august.new york life filed its timely notice of appeal on september.
ii.analysis 
admission of statements without a jury instruction 
we will first consider whether the district court erred in admitting what morgan claims are statements made by senior morris and executive hildebrand,and whether the district court should have given new york life proposed jury instruction if the statements were admitted.a district court evidentiary rulings,including its refusal to give a proposed jury instruction,are reviewed for abuse of discretion.see taylor teco barge line,cir.
new york life claims the district court improperly admitted certain prejudicial statements,thus requiring a new trial.new york life contends that such remarks carry with them a high risk of prejudice in an age discrimination case because,if there is no other evidence of discrimination,the statements add an emotional element that was otherwise lacking as a basis for a verdict.see schrand federal pacific,cir.according to the company,therefore,the statements should be excluded under federal rule of evidence.
courts examine several factors in determining whether an employer statements evince bias.these include whether the statements were made by a or by an agent within the scope of his employment whether the statements were related to the process whether the statements were more than merely vague,ambiguous or isolated remarks and whether they were made proximate in time to the act of termination.peters lincoln,cir.statements such as a company is a young,vibrant,sales organization and it is time for the next generation are alone not enough to establish direct evidence of age discrimination when they are not said to or made about the plaintiff see smith baldwin,ohio app d.
an august,email from hildebrand announced various management changes and referred to a new generation of managerial talent.however,new york life points out that three of the five managers referenced in that memorandum as receiving better jobs ray,mckinley,and willson were morgan age or older.thus,new york life claims no inference of age bias can be drawn.moreover,the company notes that a statement several years earlier in a letter that time has passed him by related to jim torrell.new york life further contends that morgan also relied upon a statement made in an october,letter of morris regarding the hiring of an sales employee,which stated we need to bring young people like this through our system.morris testified that new york life needed a balance of ages for its employees.nyl asserts these statements were either not relevant or were too remote in time.acknowledged the performance reviews that morris did are littered with references.
at trial,substantial evidence of age discrimination was presented by morgan.although many of these statements are not particularly relevant to the employment decision at issue,we are unable to conclude that there was a significant risk of prejudice based on the district court admission of them.new york life also emphasizes the district court erroneous classification of certain statements made by morgan superiors about someone direct evidence.however,this error was made in the district court rulings,not in any statement to a jury.accordingly,there was no risk of prejudice based on the court description of the evidence.
new york life suggests that this classification distorted the relevancy analysis of this circumstantial evidence under rules and of the federal rules of evidence.some of the comments were vague or isolated remarks and were not proximate in time to morgan termination.others were fairly innocuous.it is therefore doubtful that the jury relied significantly on the statements in reaching its verdict.although most of the statements were thus not particularly probative of discrimination,there was little risk of prejudice in admitting them.therefore,the admission of the statements was not an abuse of the district court discretion.
new york life next alleges that if the statements were properly before the jury,then the district court should have instructed the jurors on how to evaluate them.new york life proposed instruction read as follows 
a plaintiff may prove age bias,either directly or indirectly,by offering evidence of remarks that are 
age related 
close in time to the employment decision at issue 
made by an individual with authority over the employment decision at issue and 
related to the employment decision at issue.
if the remarks are ambiguous,not close in time or related to the employment decision,and are not made by the decision maker,you should not rely on them as proof of age discrimination.
the district court found that new york life offers no authority whatsoever in support of its argument that such an instruction was required,let alone sufficient evidence that the court refusal to instruct the jury in this manner produced a seriously erroneous result.
the court reviews jury instructions as a whole to determine whether they fairly and adequately submitted the issues and applicable law to the jury.arban west pub,cir.a new trial is not required unless the instructions,taken as a whole,are misleading or give an inadequate understanding of the law.id.a district court refusal to give a jury instruction constitutes reversible error if the omitted instruction is a correct statement of the law,the instruction is not substantially covered by other delivered charges,and the failure to give the instruction impairs the requesting party theory of the case.taylor,at.
while such an instruction would not have been inappropriate,the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to give it.morgan correctly points out the jury was properly instructed that it was to determine solely whether the termination was discriminatory and it was not to be swayed by sympathy or emotion.moreover,new york life was free to argue its theory of the the remarks were vague or were not related to the employment decision.thus,the proposed instruction was substantially covered by the other instructions and the failure to give it did not seriously impair new york life theory of the case.we find,therefore,that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to give new york life requested jury instruction.
nyl motion for judgment as a matter of law or new trial 
we review de novo the denial of a party motion or renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law.see barnes city of cincinnati,cir.judgment as a matter of law may only be granted if,when viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the party,giving that party the benefit of all reasonable inferences,there is no genuine issue of material fact for the jury,and reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion in favor of the moving party.id.in reviewing the district court decision,we may not weigh the evidence,pass on the credibility of witnesses,or substitute our judgment for that of the jury.imwalle reliance medical products,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
we review the denial of a party motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion.see barnes fiberglas,cir citation omitted.reversal is warranted only if the court has a definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error of judgment.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
new york life claims that the district court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law or new trial on morgan age discrimination claim.under ohio law,an employer may not discriminate on the basis of age.see ohio a.
the same evidentiary framework used in analyzing claims under the federal law is also applied to age discrimination claims under ohio law.see campbell pmi food equipment group,cir citation omitted.a plaintiff must show that age was a determining factor in the employer decision.see id.the mcdonnell douglas test requires a plaintiff to first establish a prima facie case of age discrimination by showing that the plaintiff was a member of a protected class of persons,a person age or over,was discharged,was qualified for the position held,and,lastly,was replaced by someone outside of the protected class.id.
if the plaintiff meets his prima facie case,the burden then shifts to the employer to produce evidence of a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged employment action.see imwalle,at.if the employer meets its burden of production,the plaintiff must then show by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reason proffered by the employer was not the true reason,but instead was a pretext for discrimination.id.we have held that the reasonableness of an employer decision may be considered to the extent that such an inquiry sheds light on whether the employer proffered reason for the employment action was its actual motivation.wexler white fine furniture,cir.an employer business judgment is not an absolute defense to unlawful discrimination.id.
after a trial on the merits,this court no longer considers whether a plaintiff has established a prima facie case.both the supreme court and this court have held that a party framing its argument on appeal in prima facie terms,after a jury trial on the merits,has unnecessarily evaded the ultimate question of discrimination vel non.imwalle,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.a court duty at this stage is to determine the ultimate question whether a plaintiff has produced sufficient evidence to support a jury verdict that the employer discriminated against him on the basis of age.see id.at.however,courts review all of the evidence in the record,including evidence supporting the plaintiff prima facie case.see id.at quoting reeves sanderson plumbing,d.
the supreme court has stated that it is permissible for the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of discrimination from the falsity of the employer explanation.reeves,at.emphasis in original.proof that the defendant explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional discrimination,and it may be quite persuasive.id.
morgan alleged that new york life was determined to fire him because of his age.the company claims that it had business justifications for terminating morgan.he himself admitted that both revenue and manpower had fallen.new york life contends that although the district court found that morgan performance had improved in certain areas,that does not alter the undisputed evidence of downward revenue or manpower trends.moreover,robert testified that because the cleveland office was among the largest in the country,he would expect it to be one of the top performing offices.
new york life further alleges that the combined annual growth rate cagr analysis,which it sometimes used because of the fluctuation inherent in gpa,showed that morgan office was spiraling downward.however,morgan contends that because new york life used a cagr instead of the usual five,he did not receive proper credit for the growth that took place in his first year as managing partner in cleveland.new york life states that a analysis was used because morgan did not run the office before additionally,new york life claims there is no basis to dispute the conclusion of its auditor,christopher tebeau,that four of the commission splits used to satisfy cleveland manpower growth were inconsistent with company policies.new york life also asserts that the evidence is disputed that mo abdou name was selected from a list of managing partner candidates updated,meaning that the list of available candidates was updated then,not that the decision to terminate morgan employment was made then,instead of a date later in september.
new york life further asserts that the evidence does not support a finding of age discrimination against morgan based on disparate treatment of other managing partners.the district court comparison of abdou with morgan is misplaced according to new york life because,despite abdou gpa scores of and in and,it would have been contrary to policies to place him into remedial performance status such action is authorized only when the gpa is below or,as in morgan case,key office performance trends are down.new york life claims this was not true as to abdou.paul morris stated that abdou office had one of the better growth patterns in the zone during the years that he was in atlanta.additionally,new york life asserts that regarding the other managing partners the court addressed,there is no foundational basis to compare them with morgan,even if the company occasionally exercised its discretion to deviate from its normal rules for others under dissimilar circumstances.new york life notes,moreover,that morgan was not placed into any performance program after his star agent,weinberger,became disabled in.he was not given a warning until downward trends continued.
morgan points to several examples of when new york life appears to have deviated from its normal rules.in,ken savoie,who is younger than morgan and was the managing partner of the roanoke office,had an unadjusted gpa of,and an adjusted gpa of.savoie was placed on performance alert and new york life determined he would be brought in for training with several young managing partners who are in need of direction.new york life claims that savoie was not placed on performance warning because,under its policy,new managing partners receive an automatic adjustment to gpa,which resulted in savoie being increased from to.morgan states that no training like that which savoie received was provided to older managing partners.by,savoie gpa was.in july,willson noted that savoie gpa had been below every month that year and he would therefore be placed on performance warning.in march,new york life informed savoie that he had missed two of his targets,manpower growth and percentage of plan.savoie was told his employment would be terminated if he failed to meet five new objectives.savoie did not meet each objective.instead of increasing critical new organization production by the criterion,savoie production fell.his employment was not terminated.
morgan also notes that in june,the same month he was placed on performance warning,randy cox was ranked out of partners and had a gpa of.testified that although new york life policy is that individuals with gpas below are ineligible for promotion,the old cox was promoted.
in june,amy scott was the managing partner in columbus,ohio.at the time,she was years old and had a gpa of.despite the relatively low gpa,scott was promoted.noted that scott maternity leave was an extenuating circumstance in assessing her performance.
morgan notes that jeff slattery was a substantially younger managing partner in memphis.although slattery gpa in was a mere,he was praised by morris as a great young talent.slattery was told that he needed to emphasize recruiting and increase activity and selection.new york life did not place him on performance alert or performance warning.
morgan claims older employees were not treated as favorably.managing partner don helms,who was over years old,headed the atlanta office and was placed on performance alert in december when his gpa was.helms resigned while under performance warning.in,paul morris commended brad willson for show ing leadership and handl ing a difficult situation in tampa by helping mp bartlett come to a retirement decision.bartlett was a old managing partner who had a gpa of and had been placed on warning.
in a september,letter to phil hildebrand,morris noted that old managing partner jim torrell had done an outstanding job for a long time,especially in the previous three years which had been the best of his career.morris observed,however,that torrell is a manager from the past and not a manager for the future.although time ha d passed jim by,it was very important to morris that jim torrell be treated fairly.torrell,who had been a managing partner for years,was told that his position at the fairfax,virginia office was being eliminated as the result of a merger and he did not have a choice in the matter.torrell testified that although he had never discussed retirement plans with new york life and had no desire to retire,company officials picked his retirement date.
morgan also notes that testified that he first discussed with hildebrand morgan possible termination as early as august he further claims that various events were part of a deliberate scheme to terminate him.these include intentionally misstating morgan gpa as when it was actually skipping the first step of performance alert and moving directly to performance warning setting unrealistic objectives and then telling morgan that his numbers did matter because he was in the home office si ghts creating a false impression of a downward trend by improperly using a cagr instead of the standard cagr and a younger replacement,abdou,before morgan was terminated.thus,morgan asserts that ample evidence supported the jury verdict.
morgan further alleges that new york life has presented shifting explanations that provide additional evidence of discrimination.morris and willson apparently falsely told hildebrand that morgan signed a confession that he had forged or fraudulently misrepresented a commission transfer form and morris later testified that the sole reason morgan was terminated was that he failed to meet the manpower requirement by one agent,in that he had agents at the end of june instead of the called for in his performance plan.moreover,there was some confusion about precisely when company officials learned about the problems with the zeno commission split.morgan further notes that after initially denying he had a role in the termination decision,morris eventually acknowledged that the decision ultimately was his.additionally,although morris testified that morgan declined new york life offer of another job,he acknowledged there was no document that indicated an offer was made.morgan testified that he had talked to and willson in early about transferring,but this apparently was not discussed around the time of his termination.
morgan contends that new york life shifting explanations alone are enough to show discrimination.new york life claims it has consistently maintained the reason that morgan was terminated in september was because he did not meet the performance criteria noted in his final warning specifically the required manpower count of agents.according to new york life,the sole reason for morgan discharge was that he did not meet the manpower goal which followed a continuous downward trend.
morgan contends that new york life statements pertaining to older employees were confirmed by its practices.in and,six managing partners over the age of either retired or were terminated,while thirteen under were hired.additionally,morgan alleges that younger workers received preferential treatment and that performance ratings were manipulated.morgan asserts that he has presented overwhelming evidence satisfying each and every method of proof,including comments by supervisors,preferential treatment for younger workers,shifting explanations,manipulation of performance warnings and violations of new york life policy and practice.
we conclude that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that,in terminating morgan,new york life discriminated against him on the basis of age.some of the evidence on which morgan relies is not particularly strong.as we have noted,most of the comments are somewhat vague in that they do not relate to and were not made close in time to morgan termination.other evidence is stronger.the promotability index prepared by new york life entitled managing partner selection process listed candidates for morgan position and was dated september,which was before the company determined that he had missed the manpower count.although new york life alleged that the date was on the document because it was a continuously updated list,the jury was entitled to believe otherwise.as the district court noted,t he jury received evidence that,if believed,supported a finding that new york life decided to fire morgan before the employment target ever became an issue.the jury may have also credited statement that morgan termination was first discussed in august,though also suggests they were simply discussing his evaluation and his performance status.
although it is inappropriate for a court to second guess a company business judgment,new york life acknowledges deviating from its normal practices in certain circumstances.new york life maintains that these were dissimilar circumstances.this is true in at least one respect.savoie,cox,scott,bravada and slattery were all younger than morgan when new york life departed from its normal practices.all of these individ
