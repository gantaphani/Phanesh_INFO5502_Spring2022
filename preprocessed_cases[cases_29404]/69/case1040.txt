this is a case involving the question of human decency.the appeal involves a hostile work environment claim based on the sexual harassment of a female employee brought under title vii of the civil rights act of,and the missouri human rights act.
deborah eich was employed by the department of public safety for central missouri state university cmsu as a detective sergeant.she filed suit against cmsu,alleging that she suffered from a hostile work environment due to sexual harassment by two,brad drake and richard gillespie.she also alleged that cmsu unlawfully retaliated against her for complaining about the harassment.
a jury found in eich favor on her hostile work environment sexual harassment claim and awarded her in damages and in economic damages.the jury also found in eich favor on her retaliation claim but did not award any damages.the district court granted cmsu motion for judgment as a matter of law on eich sexual harassment and retaliation claims and set aside the jury award of in economic damages as not being supported by eich hostile work environment sexual harassment claim.in the alternative,the district court ordered that eich must accept remittitur of the damages from to or cmsu was to be granted a new trial.deborah eich appeals.we reverse.

eich first began experiencing problems with drake in the late.drake brushed up against her breasts during training sessions and frequently ran his fingers through her hair,rubbed her shoulders,and ran his finger up her spine.eich testified that she observed drake touching the hair and rubbing the shoulders of other female employees.frances behm,a female employee in the department,testified that drake rubbed her shoulders and touched her hair.drake often stopped by eich office and told her how pretty she was and asked her to run off with him somewhere.there was testimony that these types of innuendos occurred frequently.
on more than one occasion,during handcuff training sessions,drake stood behind eich and simulated a sexual act while eich was bent over and handcuffed as part of the training.eich testified that she observed drake simulate a similar sexual act with another female officer during a handcuff training session.during other training sessions in the presence of eich,drake simulated sexual acts with a nightstick by sliding the stick in and out of his hand.
eich and drake were required to attend two training sessions together in and.during the training session in arkansas,eich and drake were required to share a piece of equipment in order to complete their training homework.although eich and drake worked on their homework separately,on at least one occasion,drake asked eich to help him with a problem he was having with the equipment.when eich went to drake room to help,drake commented that eich nipples were hard because she had gotten cold by going outside.
at the training session in branson,missouri,drake grabbed at eich leg,touched her hair,and attempted to look down her blouse when she tried to retrieve a pencil he had dropped.drake conduct drew the attention of the training session instructor who approached eich at a break and asked if she wanted drake removed from the training session.eich testified that she was humiliated and embarrassed by the incident as she was trying to project a professional image and had been asked to serve on the board of directors of the organization sponsoring the training.
eich problems with gillespie began shortly after he started working for the department in.gillespie often made comments about eich body,hair,and face,telling her she had a pretty face and pretty hair.eich testified that gillespie talked with her about the appearance of other female employees,and eich once overhead gillespie comment on the chest size of eich and another female officer after they had been measured for bulletproof vests.
gillespie spent hours sitting in eich office talking about various topics,some and others personal.other employees teased eich about the amount of time gillespie spent in her office,suggesting that she was messing around with the boss.a running joke was that the chair in front of eich desk was richard chair.
gillespie rubbed his hand up and down eich leg during meetings and rubbed or pressed up against her while they talked.on several occasions,gillespie stood behind eich while she sat at her computer and pressed his groin area into her shoulder.gillespie once stated in the presence of eich and other officers that it was so cold that he had to fish around in his pants to find it in order to go to the bathroom.on another occasion,gillespie stated in the presence of eich and another officer about giving an individual arrested for child molestation a jar of vaseline to take to prison with him.

eich testified that gillespie would treat her poorly and criticize her job performance when she would ask gillespie to leave her office or complain to chief huff about gillespie behavior.eich alleges that cmsu retaliated against her for complaining of the sexual harassment.the basis of this allegation involves a market adjustment raise eich expected to receive in.

eich did not receive the market adjustment raise in july,despite her testimony that chief huff had promised she would receive the raise.chief huff testified that eich did not receive the market adjustment raise because she had received the additional raise in november and had some job performance problems.

ii.title vii sexual harassment 
the history of sexual harassment in the workplace was initially premised on the interpretation of title vii as found in meritor savings bank,fsb vinson,d.in defining sexual harassment under title vii,the supreme court followed the eeoc regulation cfr a that actionable workplace conduct may include unwelcome sexual advances,requests for sexual favors,and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.meritor,at.the supreme court quoted with approval from the eleventh circuit decision in henson city of dundee,cir 
sexual harassment which creates a hostile or offensive environment for members of one sex is every bit the arbitrary barrier to sexual equality at the workplace that racial harassment is to racial equality.surely,a requirement that a man or woman run a gauntlet of sexual abuse in return for the privilege of being allowed to work and make a living can be as demeaning and disconcerting as the harshest of racial epithets.
meritor,at.
the court noted that a single use of an ethnic or racial epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee would not affect the conditions of employment enough to violate title vii.id.the court observed that to be actionable,sexual harassment must be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment.id.the supreme court rejected the contention that title vii was limited only to economic or tangible discrimination and held that a sexual harassment claim can rest exclusively on a hostile environment theory.id.at.thereafter,the supreme court followed with two decisions relating to the liability of the employer.see burlington,ellerth,d,and faragher city of boca raton,d.
the most significant case in this series of cases by the supreme court is harris forklift systems,d.the court recognized that w hen the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment title vii is violated.id.at.internal citations and quotations omitted.the court pointed out that this standard 
takes a middle path between making actionable any conduct that is merely offensive and requiring the conduct to cause a tangible psychological injury conduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or beyond title vii purview.
id.however,more relevant to eich present appeal,the court observed 
but title vii comes into play before the harassing conduct leads to a nervous breakdown.a discriminatorily abusive work environment,even one that does not seriously affect employees psychological,can and often will detract from employees job performance,discourage employees from remaining on the job,or keep them from advancing in their careers.moreover,even without regard to these tangible effects,the very fact that the discriminatory conduct was so severe or pervasive that it created a work environment abusive to employees because of their race,gender,religion,or national origin offends title vii broad rule of workplace equality.the appalling conduct alleged in meritor,and the reference in that case to environments so heavily polluted with discrimination as to destroy completely the emotional and psychological stability of minority group workers,merely present some especially egregious examples of harassment.they do not mark the boundary of what is actionable.
id.at.internal citations and quotations omitted.thus,the court in reversing the court of appeals held s o long as the environment would reasonably be perceived,and is perceived,as hostile or abusive,there is no need for it also to be psychologically injurious.id.internal citation omitted.the court pointed out that this is not a mathematically precise test and that before one can say an environment is hostile or abusive,one must look at all the circumstances.id.at.the court observed 
these may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.the effect on the employee psychological is,of course,relevant to determining whether the plaintiff actually found the environment abusive.
one of the leading sexual harassment cases in this circuit is hathaway runyon,cir.the facts as demonstrated in the opinion set forth the circumstances under which a suit can be determined to be sufficiently severe or pervasive to submit the factual evidence to the jury.
the court in hathaway made the following factual summary of the evidence 
hathaway was physically touched in a sexually suggestive and intimate manner on two occasions by a coworker who had expressed a sexual interest in her.after she rebuffed his advances,norris and his friend wynn proceeded to laugh,snicker,and make suggestive noises at her for a period of eight months.this treatment frightened and intimidated hathaway.she feared that norris would fondle her again or undermine her work performance which he and wynn did by wrongly reporting her for mislabeling mail.she testified that she was terrified to pass within grabbing range of either norris or wynn and that she felt trapped when they blocked her exit from the narrow label room.the jury heard hathaway reproduce the noises that disturbed her,and it credited her position that this pattern of behavior created a hostile work environment related to norris earlier advances.see west communications,cir a few incidents of unwelcome physical touching combined with winks and intimidating stares with possible sexual overtones is sufficient to establish a hostile environment.
at.in reversing the district court judgment as a matter of law,the hathaway court observed 
evidence of conduct that creates a workplace permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult establishes a hostile environment claim under federal law.title vii does not,however,create a cause of action for all unpleasant or abusive behavior in the workplace.rather,the plaintiff must show that the conduct was discriminatory in nature and that she was singled out for such treatment on the basis of her membership in a protected category under the statute.in conducting its inquiry into the severity and pervasiveness of the conduct and into whether it was based on sex,the jury looks at all the circumstances supported by credible evidence 
justice scalia pointed out in his concurring opinion in harris that since congress set no clear standard defining a hostile environment,it must be left to virtually unguided juries to decide whether particular conduct is egregious enough to merit an award of damages.there is no bright line between sexual harassment and merely unpleasant conduct so a jury decision must generally stand unless there is trial error.
id.at.internal citations omitted.the court further observed 
a work environment is shaped by the accumulation of abusive conduct,and the resulting harm can not be measured by carving it into a series of discrete incidents.burns mcgregor,cir.although the district court correctly stated that the inference had to be drawn that the pattern of conduct presented in this case was all related,it did not proceed to review the sufficiency of the evidence in that light.the humiliating and intimidating effect of the snickers and noises on hathaway could have been interpreted by the jury to be caused by the nexus between that behavior and norris earlier sexual overtures.see king hillen,plaintiff perception of any one incident of harassment should be determined in the context of all incidents citing b.the jury could reasonably have decided on the basis of this interpretation of the evidence that hathaway was the victim of menacing treatment that stemmed from her rejection of norris sexual interest in her.
in the present case,we emphasize the sexual touching and sexual innuendos made in eich presence over a continuous period of time.her attempts to rebuff this harassment by reporting to her superiors was to no avail.we hold the facts as presented by this record,continuing over a period of seven years and involving numerous touchings and sexual innuendos,were sufficient for the jury to conclude that deborah eich was subjected to sexual harassment sufficiently severe or pervasive to establish a hostile work environment.the record here demonstrates the overall circumstances are much more egregious than those set forth in hathaway 
it is understandable that the district court and the defendant in the present case rely on duncan general motors,cir,a case in which this court has held that certain sexual harassment was not severe or pervasive enough to sustain the jury verdict for the plaintiff.in duncan,the majority of the court found that duncan working conditions were certainly not ideal and in many instances the environment that duncan endured at gmc was offensive and disrespectful id.at.nonetheless,the court,over the strong dissenting opinion of judge richard arnold,found that the conditions did not constitute a sexually harassing hostile environment sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of duncan employment id.
each case must stand on its own circumstances.our panel,in holding as we do,must rely solely upon what the duncan majority opinion reflects as being the facts of the case.the majority in duncan reasoned that although the actions of duncan booth were boorish,chauvinistic,and decidedly immature,they did not create a hostile work environment permeated with sexual harassment.id.the court observed that duncan presented evidence of only four categories of harassing conduct based on her sex a single request for a relationship,four or five isolated incidents of booth briefly touching her hand something booth did to all male and female employees,a request to draw a planter and teasing in the form of a poster and beliefs for an imaginary man hater club id.
in the present case,as the detailed facts clearly demonstrate,eich experienced more than the mere touching of the hand.on several occasions,drake brushed up against her breasts,and frequently ran his fingers through her hair,rubbed her shoulders,and ran his finger up her spine.on more than one occasion he stood behind eich and simulated a sexual act while eich was bent over during handcuff training sessions.in the presence of eich,the same officer simulated sexual acts with a nightstick by sliding the stick in and out of his hands and constantly rendered sexual innuendos directed to her and other female employees in the department.eich testified that gillespie rubbed his hand up and down her leg,brushed up against her when they spoke,and pressed his groin into her shoulder while standing behind her.
eich was subjected to a long series of incidents of sexual harassment in her workplace which went far beyond gender related jokes and occasional teasing.see faragher,at.we have held that o nce there is evidence of improper conduct and subjective offense,the determination of whether the conduct rose to the level of abuse is largely in the hands of the jury.howard burns,at.
we find the district court clearly erred in granting judgment as a matter of law under the evidence submitted to the jury in the present case.the discussion in hathaway,supra,the narrow circumstance under which a district court may grant a judgment as a matter of law in overturning a jury verdict 
the law places a high standard on overturning a jury verdict.judgment as a matter of law is proper only when there is a complete absence of probative facts to support the conclusion reached so that no reasonable juror could have found for the nonmoving party.on such a motion the court must assume as proven all facts that the nonmoving party evidence tended to show,give her the benefit of all reasonable inferences,and assume that all conflicts in the evidence were resolved in her favor.the grant of a motion for judgment as a matter of law will only be affirmed when all the evidence points in one direction and is susceptible to no reasonable interpretation supporting the jury verdict.the question of whether there is sufficient evidence to support a jury verdict is a legal one,and the district court decision to grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law is therefore reviewed de novo.
hathaway,at internal citations and quotations omitted.
in summarizing our reversal in this appeal,we note our statement made in jenson eveleth taconite,cir 
it should be obvious that the callous pattern and practice of sexual harassment engaged in by eveleth mines inevitably destroyed the of the working women exposed to it.the emotional harm,brought about by this record of human indecency,sought to destroy the human psyche as well as the human spirit of each plaintiff.the humiliation and degradation suffered by these women is irreparable.although money damage can not make these women whole or even begin to repair the injury done,it can serve to set a precedent that in the environment of the working place such hostility will not be tolerated.
id.at.in jenson,we dealt with a series of complaints by several female employees.what we concluded as to those employees in the jenson case applies singularly to deborah eich and any other woman who is subjected to sexual harassment in the workplace.men and women have every right to be left alone without sexual abuse in the workplace.this case,as well as well as others,point out the need for employers to set up training sessions to avoid repetition of the kind of claims made here so that the workplace does not become a hostile work environment.see davis mack,cir.rather than ignoring complaints of sexual harassment made by female or male employees,employers should take notice that they are not only condoning the psychological harm to their employees,but they are creating a loss of work efficiency within their own work environment.we express this court condemnation of sexual abuse in the workplace and continue to express hope that employers will strive to create a changed environment such that men and women of every race,color,or creed can feel free to work without a hostile environment.
iii.damages 
under eich sexual harassment claim,the district court submitted to the jury a form of jury verdict in which the jury found in eich favor and awarded damages in the sum of and economic damages in the sum of.on another form of verdict,the jury found in favor of eich under her retaliation claim but returned the verdict for no damages.the district court entered an order granting judgment as a matter of law in favor of cmsu on all claims.the district court also vacated the economic damages awarded under the sexual harassment claim on the ground that eich had not pleaded constructive discharge under this claim.the district court found that eich had pleaded constructive discharge only under her retaliation claim.however,the district court overlooked the fact that in submitting the verdict form on the sexual harassment claim,it allowed the jury to find both economic and damages in favor of eich.
the district court in instructing the jury on damages failed to differentiate between the economic damages to be awarded under the sexual harassment claim and the claim for retaliation.cmsu did not object to the form of the verdict.we can only assume,but need not do so,that a reason for not awarding economic damages under the retaliation claim was because it would have been duplicitous to the economic damages already awarded to the plaintiff under the sexual harassment claim.notwithstanding the pleadings,we view the court inclusion of the economic damages in its instructions under the sexual harassment claim and cmsu failure to object to the instruction to
