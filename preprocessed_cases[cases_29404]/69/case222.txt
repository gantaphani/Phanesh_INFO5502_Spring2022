in,the united states brought an antitrust action against the american society of composers,authors and publishers ascap.the suit resulted in a consent decree that provided certain protections for prospective music licensees.where,for example,ascap and a prospective licensee have reached an impasse over fees,under the consent decree,either may petition the united states district court for the southern district of new york to set a reasonable licensing fee.in,the united states entered into a similar antitrust consent decree with broadcast music,bmi.
in these parallel cases,separate petitions were filed in the southern district of new york requesting the court to set a reasonable rate after ascap and bmi were unable to agree on licensing fees with dmx,dmx,a provider of music music.in both cases,the district court louis stanton,in bmi and denise cote,in ascap adopted dmx proposals.bmi and ascap appeal.we affirm.
background 
ascap and bmi 
ascap and bmi are organizations pros.see generally bmi cbs,cbs.ascap was created in by music creators and publishers as an unincorporated membership association.bmi was founded by broadcasters in.each represents hundreds of thousands of songwriters,composers,and publishers who hold copyrights in millions of musical works.they negotiate,implement,and enforce agreements with licensees that grant the right to perform their members copyrighted songs.they collect license fees and remit royalties to the copyright holders.together,ascap and bmi license the music performance rights to most domestic copyrighted music in the united states.see id.at ascap and bmi have traditionally offered blanket licenses,or licenses that grant access to a pro entire repertory in exchange for a flat annual fee unaffected by the extent to which its music is performed.
in and,the united states filed separate antitrust complaints against ascap and bmi for unlawfully monopolizing the licensing of performing rights.see united states bmi,f d,cir aei.the government alleged,inter alia,that ascap and bmi blanket licenses,the only type of license offered when the suits were brought,constituted an illegal restraint of trade,and that arbitrary prices were being charged as the result of an illegal copyright pool.cbs,u.at.the government sought to enjoin ascap and bmi exclusive licensing powers and require them to offer different forms of licensing.id.at.settlement of these complaints led to the entry of two separate,but largely similar,consent decrees that continue to substantially control ascap and bmi licensing practices,id.at,and minimize the danger of unreasonable activity caused by ascap and supp d.bmi market power,k,gershwin pub,cir.see united states ascap,trade cas.cch,amended,no,wl,trade cas.cch july,ascap decree united states bmi,trade cas.cch,amended,cv,wl,trade cas.cch,bmi decree.

both the and the bmi decree include a rate court mechanism under which the united states district court for the southern district of new york has jurisdiction to determine reasonable license fees when the parties to a licensing transaction are unable to reach agreement.see,ix a bmi decree,xiv a see also infra note.
dmx,formerly known as thp capstar acquisition,is a leading commercial music service provider.it was formed on june.it supplies music to thousands of locations,including restaurants,shopping centers,hotels,retail stores,and similar public venues dmx does not offer particular songs rather,dmx music designers select songs based on the general genre and feel of a particular program.dmx typically delivers or uses approximately of its available musical compositions each year.these works are owned or controlled by more than different publishers.
dmx provides music programming to its customers through and delivery mechanisms.delivery involves the transmission of music to customers via direct broadcast satellite signals to the establishment sound system.delivery involves the transmission of music to customers through a proprietary dmx device that is installed at the customer location.both off and dmx customers have access to a wide array of programming.dmx data reflects the frequency with which particular works are performed.in contrast,dmx data identifies which works were distributed,but not their relative frequency.dmx also offers select and signature service.select service offers all or some of dmx various channels sorted by musical category.signature service involves music programming designed for the specific customer.
dmx main music industry competitors are muzak llc muzak,music choice,music choice,playnetwork,playnetwork,and trusonic,trusonic.in recent years,music consultants who utilize digital media devices and online music services to create programming for businesses have also created increased competition in the music industry.increased industry competition and the national economic downturn have also reduced dmx revenue and the fees that it charges its customers.from to,dmx average monthly revenue declined by percent.from to,the rates dmx charged its customers declined by percent.
in,dmx began a direct licensing campaign,contracting directly with individual music composers and their publishers.dmx pursued direct licenses,in part,to reduce the cost of business primarily associated with ascap and bmi blanket licenses.dmx hired music reports incorporated,a company specializing in music license administration,to assist in the design and implementation of its direct licensing campaign.
by late,dmx had signed direct licenses,covering more than separate music catalogs and hundreds of thousands of songs.dmx direct licenses typically provide each publisher with a pro rata share of an annual royalty pool.this amount represents all annual royalty payments attributable to each physical location at which a dmx program is performed.each publisher pro rata share is calculated from its percentage of plays on dmx channels as a proxy for plays across dmx entire service.dmx direct licenses also include a clause that ensures that each publisher royalties are calculated using the same pro rata allocation methodology.
in,dmx obtained a direct license from music publishing sony one of the industry largest music publishers that contained the same royalty allocation as all of dmx other direct licenses a pro rata share of the annual royalty pool.dmx believed that signing a major music publisher like sony,or one of its competitors universal music publishing group universal,emi music publishing emi,or warner chappell music publishing warner chappell,was necessary for a successful direct licensing program.dmx thus made substantial efforts to attract sony,offering a royalty advance of million and an administrative payment of.according to dmx,the advance was the price to be paid if dmx was to break through the powerful status quo and pioneer a new licensing paradigm.brief of applicant appellee dmx at,ascap dmx,cv cir.april.in,dmx license with sony was extended through.since,dmx has continued to increase the frequency with which it plays sony music.
ascap agreements with other music providers 
in,ascap entered into a blanket license agreement with muzak the ascap muzak agreement,the largest music service provider in the united states.the ascap muzak agreement provided that,from through,muzak would pay ascap a flat annual fee of approximately million or an effective annual fee of the ascap muzak agreement also provided that muzak annual fee would not increase if its subscriber base grew at an annual rate of percent or less.if the annual growth rate of muzak subscriber base was greater than percent,muzak agreed to pay ascap an additional annual fee of for each location in excess of the allotted percent growth allowance.in effect,the ascap muzak agreement growth provision provided that if,over the course of its license term,muzak increased its subscriber base at an annual rate of precisely percent,then muzak annual fee would drop to,averaging for the term.muzak also agreed to pay ascap a lump sum to settle all claims arising prior to,including claims for past due royalties.on april,as a result of muzak lack of growth and bankruptcy,ascap agreed to reduce muzak annual fee.
ascap also entered into agreements similar to the muzak ascap agreement with music choice,playnetwork,and trusonic that covered varying time periods between and.these agreements included annual rates between and.under these agreements,music choice,playnetwork,and trusonic also paid ascap substantial lump sums to resolve past disputes.
bmi agreements with other music providers 
from to,muzak paid bmi an annual fee of approximately to.in,bmi and muzak entered into a traditional blanket licensing agreement the bmi muzak agreement whereby muzak agreed to pay bmi a base fee of million over the license period beginning in and ending in.this fee translated into an annual fee of the bmi muzak agreement took into account approximately million that bmi alleged muzak owed for retroactive license fees.like the ascap muzak agreement,the bmi muzak agreement provided that muzak annual fee would be maintained unless the number of muzak locations grew at a rate greater than percent per year.if muzak grew at an annual rate of precisely percent,muzak could eventually obtain an annual fee of 
bmi offered the rate and a license similar to the bmi muzak agreement to dmx other competitors playnetwork and trusonic accepted bmi offer.
proceedings below 
on june,dmx requested an blanket license afbl,or a blanket license with a,from ascap.an afbl is essentially a blanket fee reduced to account for music directly licensed from music publishers and owners that also appear within the pro repertoire.bmi dmx.ascap and dmx,however,could not agree on a license fee.on july,pursuant to the,ascap applied to the district court the ascap rate court to set a reasonable rate for dmx requested license.ascap presented two fee proposals to the ascap rate court and maintained that a blanket license with a for direct licensing was not a reasonable fee structure.
first,ascap proposed a blanket license with no for dmx direct licensing program.this first proposal offered a flat fee calculated by multiplying an annual rate by the number of locations and then by the number of years of the license.ascap argued that this proposal was proportionate to the fees muzak agreed to pay ascap.
specifically,for the period beginning june,and ending december,ascap proposed a flat fee of for all performances of all works in the ascap repertory.ascap calculated this figure by multiplying the annual rate used in the ascap muzak agreement by,the number of dmx customer locations in,and then by and years,the length of the period from june,to december.in addition,for the period from through,ascap proposed an annual rate of,to be adjusted for inflation.to arrive at this rate,ascap divided the annual flat fee of by,the number of dmx customer locations in.
second,in the alternative,ascap proposed a blanket license with a static credit,or,based on the fees muzak agreed to pay ascap and on a portion of the payments dmx made to its direct licensors in.ascap second proposal offered the same flat fee proposed in the first option,reduced by a discount and then increased by an administrative fee.under this proposal,ascap suggested flat fee of or per year would be reduced by a credit for payments that dmx made to ascap members for performances of their works licensed through direct licenses.the credit was calculated by reducing the amount dmx paid for music first by percent to account for the portion of those payments intended to compensate publishers for mechanical rights,and second by an additional percent to identify those royalties that were paid to publishers for compositions not within the ascap repertory.the credit,however,would be offset by an additional administration charge of per year for expenses that ascap would incur in implementing the license.because dmx did not begin its direct license program until,the administrative fees would be applicable only from through.accordingly,ascap total proposed license fee of constituted the blanket rate of,reduced by the and the administrative fee of for the applicable period.
further,for the through period,ascap proposed the same blanket rate as its first proposal,adjusted for inflation in addition to the yearly administrative charge.for this period,under ascap second proposal,dmx would receive an annual credit,adjusted for inflation,to account for the amount of royalties dmx paid its direct licensors in fluctuations in dmx direct licensing would not affect its credit.
dmx contended that ascap agreements with other providers did not reflect the competitive market and,for the years following,a blanket license with a incorporating the extent to which it relied on direct licenses.dmx proposal involved a floor fee reflecting the minimum amount that dmx would be obligated to pay ascap even if all of the music that dmx performed was directly licensed an unbundled music fee,or the pure value of the performance rights for ascap music performed by dmx and the share of all dmx performances of music licensed to dmx solely by ascap the share licensed via ascap.combined,the floor fee and the unbundled music fee equaled the blanket fee,or the maximum amount to which ascap would be entitled under dmx proposal.
dmx contemplated the following rate formula the sum of the floor fee plus the unbundled music fee multiplied by the share licensed via ascap by multiplying the unbundled music fee and the share licensed via ascap,dmx would pay ascap an amount that varied depending on the extent to which dmx subscribers actually played ascap works that were also directly licensed.
specifically,dmx proposed a floor fee of per location and an unbundled music fee of per location.dmx,drawing from ascap records,contended that the floor fee represented the combination of for expenses specific to music service and for general overhead expenses.dmx calculated the unbundled music fee first by reducing the annual royalty pool from the direct license agreements by percent to account for the direct license agreements grant of mechanical and public performance rights.dmx then further reduced the resulting fee to reflect ascap percent share of total performances on the dmx network.
on december,following a bench trial,the ascap rate court cote,issued an opinion and order adopting dmx proposal to set the final rate.in re application of thp capstar acquisition,d s.ascap.the court rejected ascap first proposal because it found that the muzak agreement was not a reliable benchmark.id.at.specifically,the ascap rate court found that the license on which ascap relied was only one part of a much larger transaction settling existing disputes and resolving issues relating to an period it is dangerous to rely on a per location fee extrapolated from the starting point of a flat fee deal that allowed expected growth in locations and contemplated a possible decline in the effective rate from to over the license term dmx refused to enter a license premised on the same formula and economic conditions in the industry had changed since ascap and muzak entered into their agreement.id.at.with respect to ascap second proposal,the ascap rate court found that ascap failed to show that a rate for the pre period or a rate for was an appropriate base from which to construct the blanket rate ascap proposed flat fee for did not account for dmx substantial loss of customer locations during that period the ascap proposed did not reasonably reflect dmx direct license initiative,would discourage dmx from continuing with its direct licensing program,and represented a windfall to ascap members who did not directly contract with dmx and ascap failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its proposed annual surcharge for administering the credits.id.at.
on december,the ascap rate court entered judgment setting the specific terms of the rate.adopting dmx proposal,the ascap rate court set a floor fee of,a blanket fee of,and an unbundled music fee of the resulting annual fee was set at the blanket fee minus the product of the unbundled music fee and a direct license ratio of percent.the direct license ratio was set as the total number of ascap works transmitted by dmx service for which dmx has a direct license with at least one publisher of the work to reflect the ownership shares of the publisher,divided by the total number of ascap works transmitted by dmx service to reflect the share of the song ownership affiliated with ascap.
on june,dmx requested an afbl from bmi.the parties commenced negotiations but were unable to reach agreement.on january,bmi petitioned the district court the bmi rate court to determine a reasonable fee.bmi did not dispute dmx entitlement to an afbl.dmx and bmi agreed that the afbl fee should include a full blanket rate,or the amount dmx would pay if it used no bmi music a floor fee that dmx would pay even if it directly licensed all the bmi music it used and a crediting mechanism for calculating dmx discount off the full blanket fee for each music performance.the parties,however,disagreed as to how to value these components.
bmi proposed a rate with a blanket fee calculation based on the blanket license agreement it first entered into with muzak the bmi muzak agreement and later made with other the period.bmi proposed a total blanket fee of per location.to arrive at this fee,bmi increased its proposed annual fee of by percent to account for the additional costs of an afbl and the option value the afbl provides over the traditional blanket license.
dmx proposed a blanket license rate with bmi that incorporated its direct licensing program into its proposed fee structure this proposal was nearly identical to the one dmx proposed in ascap.specifically,dmx proposed a blanket fee of per location,representing an unbundled music fee for the rights to perform the works in bmi repertoire and a floor fee to compensate bmi for the value of its services and the benefits of a blanket license.dmx,referencing approximately direct licenses with music publishers as benchmarks,proposed a share of an annual royalty pool equivalent to percent of to represent the portion of dmx music performances drawn exclusively from bmi repertoire.
on july,following a bench trial,the bmi rate court stanton,rejected the bmi muzak agreement as a benchmark for the value of dmx afbl.bmi,d at.the court adopted dmx proposal and entered judgment setting a final annual blanket fee of,an annual floor fee of and a direct licensing ratio to be calculated using dmx performances as a proxy for all of its performances.id.at.
these appeals followed.
discussion 
on appeal,ascap and bmi principally argue that the district court in both cases set an unreasonable fee for their respective licenses with dmx by incorporating the extent to which dmx relied on direct licenses.first,ascap argues that direct licenses should not be factored into its licensing rate structure with dmx because a rate structure with an adjustable for direct licenses conflicts with the and is unreasonable second,ascap,in the alternative,and bmi both argue that direct licenses should only be marginally incorporated into their licensing fee structures with dmx.they argue that the district court in both cases erred by using dmx direct licensing agreements with music publishers as benchmarks for their respective licensing fees and that their licenses with dmx competitors should have been adopted as benchmarks because they were more accurate valuations of their services and more indicative of the competitive market.
we first discuss ascap contention that a rate structure with an adjustable conflicts with the we then discuss the district court rejection of ascap and bmi proposals and the reasonableness of the rates set by the district court.
ascap contends that a rate structure with an adjustable conflicts with the.ascap argues,inter alia,that by defining certain licenses and not defining a blanket license with an adjustable,the excludes the latter.the ascap rate court rejected this argument.
consent decrees are construed basically as contracts.aei,at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.when the language of a consent decree is unambiguous,deference is paid to the plain meaning of the decree language.id.the decree scope must be discerned within its four corners,and not with respect to what might satisfy one of the parties purposes.id.when the language of a decree is ambiguous,however,a court may consider,inter alia,extrinsic evidence to determine the parties intent,including the purpose of the provision and the overall context of the decree.id.we review the district court interpretation of a consent decree de novo and its factual findings for clear error.id.
the defines four types of licenses blanket,and licenses.see supra note and accompanying text.in addition,section v of the discusses through to the audience licenses,section vi discusses licensing,and section vii discusses per program and per segment licenses.see v,vi,vii.section vii c provides nothing in th e shall prevent ascap and any music user from agreeing on any other form of license,vii c.thus,although the defines types of licenses that ascap could provide to dmx,on its face,the plainly permits other forms of licenses and does not preclude blanket licenses with adjustable.
although we did not expressly address this issue in aei,bmi raised a similar argument in that case.aei,at.there,we explained that a request for a blanket license subject to a constitutes a request not for a new type of license,but for a blanket license with a different fee basis,over which the district court has authority and which the pro must offer.id.at,see also united states ascap,d,muzak concluding that the present may be construed to permit the issuance of a blanket license with a fee structure that reflects direct licensing arrangements previously entered into by applicants and the existence of such direct licensing relationships may and will be considered by this court in a rate court proceeding.we rejected the contention,then advanced by bmi,that the bmi decree applie d only to those licenses specifically mentioned in the bmi decree,and to the traditional blanket license with its traditional per premise fee structure.aei,at.our reasoning in aei applies with equal force here.
accordingly,the district court correctly rejected ascap contention that the does not permit a rate structure that features an adjustable.as the ascap rate court correctly determined 
the is an antitrust consent decree providing a mechanism for the setting of reasonable license fees in a unique market in which ascap indisputably exercises market power.while ascap may be unwilling to offer a blanket license with a for a direct licensing program,the terms of,the decisions interpreting and applying,and the record evidence from this trial each indicate that such a license is appropriate and justified here.
ascap,d at.we thus hold that the permits blanket licenses subject to to account for direct licensing,and we reject ascap claim that a blanket license with an adjustable conflicts with the.
ii.the rates 
applicable law 
under the and the bmi decree,ascap and bmi are required to grant to any music user making a written request therefor a license to perform all of the works in the ascap repertory,vi see bmi decree,iv a if the parties are unable to reach agreement,after prescribed periods of negotiations,either party may apply to the district court for a determination of a reasonable fee,ix a see bmi decree,xiv a in these rate court proceedings,the burden proof is on the pro to establish the reasonableness of the fee it seeks,ix b see bmi decree,xiv a if the pro establishes that its requested rate is reasonable,then the district court shall adopt it.see,ix d bmi decree,xiv a if the pro is unable to establish that its requested rate is reasonable,then the rate court shall determine a reasonable fee based on all the evidence,including a proposal from the music user,ix d see bmi decree,xiv a.
we review rates set by the district court for reasonableness.united states bmi,cir music choice.fundamental to the concept of reasonableness is a determination of what an applicant would pay in a competitive market,taking into account the fact that the pro,as a monopolist,exercise s disproportionate power over the market for music rights.united states ascap,cir realnetworks quoting music choice,at.benchmarks,or agreements reached after arms length negotiation between other similar parties in the industry,are often used by the rate court in determining the fair market value of the music.see id.in assessing whether another agreement provides a valid benchmark,the district court must consider whether the other agreement dealt with a comparable right,whether it involved similar parties in similar economic circumstances,and whether it arose in a sufficiently competitive market.see music choice,at.
we review for clear error the district court findings of fact relating to the benchmark agreements,including whether they were formed in a freely competitive market.see id.at benchmarks ascap movie channel,cir freely competitive market.adjustments to the benchmark to best approximate the fair market value of the music may be based on factual findings,but also may contain legal conclusions that we review de novo.music choice,at.
application 
under the and the bmi decree,the district court,in both cases,had the authority to set a reasonable rate for dmx licenses with ascap and bmi if ascap and bmi did not satisfy their burden of proving that their proposals were reasonable.see,ix b bmi decree,xiv a.for the reasons set forth below,we hold that it was not clearly erroneous for the ascap and bmi rate courts to find that the ascap muzak and bmi muzak agreements together,the muzak agreements did not reflect rates that would be set in a competitive market.see music choice,at.we also hold that,in both cases,the district court reasonably rejected ascap and bmi proposals and adopted dmx recommended benchmarks to set the licensing fees.see id.finally,we hold that rate courts can take direct licenses into account in setting rates between commercial music service providers and pros.we first discuss the district court rejection of ascap and bmi proposals we then discuss the reasonableness of the rates set by the rate courts.
ascap and bmi proposed benchmarks 
the district court reasonably rejected ascap and bmi benchmarks in both cases.although muzak and dmx are both commercial music service providers and the muzak agreements involved rights comparable to those at issue in this case the right to public performance,muzak and dmx respective market positions and the economic circumstances surrounding their negotiations with ascap and bmi differ markedly.the rate courts did not err,much less clearly err,in holding that the muzak agreements did not involve similar parties in similar economic circumstances and did not reflect rates that would arise in a sufficiently competitive market.see id.at.in both cases,the district court,after making detailed findings of fact and carefully considering the issues,properly rejected ascap and bmi overall proposals as unreasonable because they did not reflect rates that would be set in a competitive market.see id.
first,ascap and bmi proposed benchmarks did not account for dmx substantial and growing direct licensing program an economic circumstance that distinguishes dmx position from that of muzak.indeed,ascap first proposal would have charged a flat fee for the first four years and seven months of the license and an annual fee for the remaining two years of the license period.ascap second proposal of a blanket license with a static used the same annual fee as the first proposal,reduced by a credit equal to a fraction of the amount that dmx paid for music,plus an annual blanket administrative fee of.finally,bmi proposed an annual blanket fee of based upon its,million license fee with muzak.if dmx licensing rates with ascap and bmi did not meaningfully account for its direct licenses,dmx would effectively pay twice for musical works covered by a pro and its direct licensing program.these facts,however,were not factored into ascap first proposal or bmi only proposal,and their inclusion into ascap second proposal was effectively negligible.
second,as the district court found in both cases,ascap and bmi failed to show that the rates in their respective agreements with muzak excluded additional costs such as,for example,the resolution of audit and disputes,and the incorporation of growth allowances independent of the value of ascap and bmi grants to perform their members copyrighted music.indeed,ascap and bmi proposals were extrapolated from agreements with muzak for nearly and million that spanned the course of five years.ascap and bmi proposals then winnowed down these lump sums by muzak average number of locations to arrive at annual rates of and rates that were respectively proposed to increase to to account for time and inflation and to to account for the option value of an afbl over a traditional blanket license.additionally,the muzak agreements contained growth terms that had the potential to reduce muzak projected costs over the period of the license term,and both agreements resolved claims that either party could have had against the other prior to the agreement date,unless,in bmi case,rate court proceedings were initiated.thus,based on the evidence presented at trial,the district court,in both instances,reasonably found that ascap and bmi respective rates with muzak accounted for more than licensing fees.
finally,the district court also found that ascap and bmi benchmarks did not reflect a sufficiently competitive market and their proposals therefore did not reflect rates that would be set in a competitive market.see id.in both instances,the district court was entitled to find that the muzak agreements,upon which ascap and bmi proposals were based,were less competitively set than they would have been if muzak regularly used direct licensing or if music rights were more scattered among numerous performing rights societies.showtime,at.with respect to ascap second proposal,based on the testimony of ascap chief economist,it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to find that a static structure was and inequitable because it would effectively require dmx to pay more in total licensing fees and create incentives for dmx to abandon its direct licensing campaign.see ascap,d at.with respect to bmi,based on the evidence presented at trial,it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to conclude that dmx competitors had no realistic opportunity freely to negotiate the future fees for their licenses.bmi,d at.as the bmi rate court found,commercial music service providers who refused bmi rate and form license and proceeded to rate court faced the risk of retroactive payment claims from bmi because bmi had expressly reserved its right to seek such payments in any rate court proceeding.id.
accordingly,the district court in both cases reasonably found that ascap and bmi did not sustain their burdens of proving that their proposals were reasonable.no legal error contributed to these findings,and the findings,supported by the record,were not clearly erroneous.see showtime,at.in both instances,the district court thus had the authority to set a reasonable rate for dmx licenses.
ii.the rates set by the district court 
the ascap and bmi rate courts essentially set rates comparable to dmx direct license rates while providing an additional floor fee that guaranteed some compensation to ascap and bmi regardless of the extent to which dmx used their repertory.the rates set by the ascap and bmi rate courts and the use of dmx direct licenses as benchmarks were reasonable for the following reasons.
first,the rates set by the district court reasonably compensated ascap and bmi for their services.as the ascap rate court found dmx proposal acknowledges that pros provide important services to both its members and to music users.ascap,d at.indeed,the floor fee established by both the ascap and bmi rate courts compensated ascap and bmi for their licensing and overhead costs the floor fee established by the ascap rate court was based on ascap own records.inclusion of the floor fee into the fee structure also ensured that ascap and bmi would be com
