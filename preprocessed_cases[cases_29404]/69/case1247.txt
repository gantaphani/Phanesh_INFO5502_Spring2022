appellants oregon natural resources council,the sierra club and headwaters collectively,onrc challenge the united states forest service forest service approval of the proposed expansion of the mount ashland ski area masa,located in oregon siskiyou mountains within the rogue river and klamath national forests.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the forest service,finding it had not violated the national environmental policy act nepa,et,or the national forest management act nfma,et,in authorizing the masa expansion.we hold that the forest service failed to properly evaluate the impact of the proposed masa expansion on the pacific fisher,in violation of both the nepa and the nfma,and that it violated the nfma by failing to appropriately designate riparian reserves and restricted watershed terrain,as required by the rogue river national forest land and resource management plan rogue river lrmp and the northwest forest plan nwfp.accordingly,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the forest service and remand to the district court for issuance of the injunction specified in this opinion.
factual background and procedural history 
masa is a ski resort located approximately seven air miles south of the city of ashland,oregon.the mount ashland association maa operates masa under a special use permit issued to the city of ashland by the forest service.the city of ashland,in turn,leases the ski area to the maa.
for over twenty years,maa and the forest service have explored the possibility of expanding masa so as to accommodate beginner and intermediate skiers and snowboarders,as well as tubing and other facility upgrades,in an effort to ensure the ski area economic viability.in,the forest service released a final environmental impact statement and record of decision approving the general expansion of the ski area,but not addressing the specifics of any plan.in,maa submitted a detailed,proposed expansion plan to the forest service.the forest service subsequently solicited public comment concerning the proposed project,and in and released draft environmental impact statements eis.during the comment periods,the environmental protection agency and members of the public expressed concerns about the proposed project possible effects on erosion and sedimentation,watershed resources and water quality.concern was also voiced about the proposed expansion possible impact on the pacific fisher,a small carnivore related to the mink,otter and marten that inhabits certain forests,and other wildlife species.
in august,the forest service released a final environmental impact statement feis in which it analyzed six expansion alternatives.alternative and alternative are the only two expansion alternatives relevant to this appeal.alternative contemplates the maa constructing two new chairlifts and two new surface lifts,acres for new ski runs,and clearing four additional acres for lift corridors and staging areas,primarily within the western half of the special use permit area.the proposed ski run development would require the removal of approximately acres of trees,which would generate board feet of commercial grade timber.additionally under alternative,watershed restoration projects would be implemented,including structural storm water control and controls,such as the controlled placement of woody material.alternative,which is a variant of alternative,envisions limiting the environmental consequences of expansion in the middle fork area by requiring maa to use a lightweight,low ground pressure machine to clear ski runs and lift runs.alternative would permit maa to construct two chairlifts and two surface lifts and to clear approximately acres of new ski run terrain.
in september,the forest service issued the record of decision rod for the masa expansion,selecting alternative with some modifications adopted from alternative.it concluded that alternative would help ensure masa economic viability,with acceptable physical,biological and human environmental consequences.the forest service received notices of appeal to the rod.among these was an appeal from eugene wier,a wildlife biologist who had been employed by the forest service,detailing his concern regarding the expansion impact on the pacific fisher.in december,the forest service denied all administrative appeals to the rod.
in january,onrc filed suit against the forest service and regional forester linda goodman seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the grounds that the masa expansion project violated both the nepa and the nfma.specifically,onrc contends that the forest service failed to ensure the viability of the pacific fisher,a sensitive species to adequately consider and disclose the direct and cumulative impacts on the pacific fisher to analyze whether the expansion will comply with wetlands laws to adhere to rogue river lrmp and nwfp standards and guidelines for protecting watersheds and riparian areas to disclose a potentially high rate of error in the model that it used to estimate sediment impacts on the municipal watershed and to adequately disclose cumulative water quality impact by utilizing a computer model without disclosing its flaws,rather than cataloging and analyzing specific projects.
on february,after considering for summary judgment,the district court entered summary judgment against onrc.the court found that the forest service disclosure of potential erosion and water quality impacts in the feis complied with the nepa,and that the forest service did not violate the nepa or the nfma by failing to discuss compliance with applicable laws governing wetlands in the feis.it also found the forest service failure to classify land hazard zone terrain as riparian reserve was harmless and concluded that the proposed expansion satisfied the principal rogue river lrmp and nwfp requirements for land designated restricted watershed and riparian reserve.lastly,the district court held that onrc allegations regarding the pacific fisher mostly rely on materials that i have stricken,and events that final approval of the rod.onrc filed a timely notice of appeal from the district court judgment.we granted a stay of the district court judgment for the duration of this appeal.

discussion 
statutory.national environmental policy act 
the nepa mandates that covered governmental entities take a hard look at the environmental consequences of certain proposed actions.lands council,at.the nepa requires federal agencies to prepare an eis for major federal actions significantly affecting the environment.c.an eis is a thorough analysis of the potential environmental impacts that provide s full and fair discussion of significant environmental impacts and inform s decisionmakers and the public of the reasonable alternatives which would avoid or minimize adverse impacts or enhance the quality of the human environment.see also lands council mcnair,cir.
national forest management act 
the nfma imposes constraints on the forest service management of national forests.see see also ecology,austin,cir.procedurally,it requires the forest service to develop a land and resource management plan,also referred to as a forest plan,for each forest it manages.a.the nfma also requires that a forest plan provide for diversity of plant and animal communities,id.g b,and that f ish and wildlife habitat shall be managed to maintain viable populations of existing native and desired vertebrate species in the planning area,see also envtl.prot.info,at.any action taken by the forest service in a managed forest must comply with the nfma and must also be consistent with the governing forest plan.see ecology,at.
b.the pacific fisher 
nfma claim 
the forest service designated the pacific fisher a sensitive species due to substantial population declines and the possibility that the fisher could be listed as an endangered species pursuant to the endangered species act.see endangered and threatened wildlife and plants finding for a petition to list the west coast distinct population segment of the fisher,april,to be codified at pt finding that the pacific fisher warrants protection as an endangered species under the endangered species act of.under the rogue river lrmp,species classified as sensitive must be managed by the forest service to ensure that they do not become threatened or endangered due to management activities.the rogue river lrmp requires that where sensitive species occur in lands categorized as developed recreation,the biological evaluation process will be used during project planning to display the effects of proposed activities and w here such species are present,field evaluation data will be used to determine the effects and recommend measures to ensure that species viability is not jeopardized.the biological evaluation is a process which requires the forest service to conduct a a p review of existing information b f ield reconnaissance of the project area c d etermination of whether local populations listed and pets species will be affected by a project d a nalysis of significance of project effects on local and total populations of listed and pets species e w hen step four can not be completed due to lack of information,a biological or botanical investigation is conducted to gather the information needed to complete step four.onrc contends that the forest service violated the nfma by failing to abide by the rogue river lrmp requirement that it conduct a compliant biological evaluation to determine the impact of the proposed masa expansion on the pacific fisher.we agree and conclude that the forest service evaluation of the pacific fisher in the masa expansion area does not comply with the requirements of the rogue river lrmp and,therefore,violates the nfma.
in,forest service biologists prepared a biological evaluation for the masa expansion,which concluded that there was no suitable fisher habitat within the proposed project area and that no impact on fisher or fisher habitat was expected.however,in and,eugene wier,a forest service field biologist,identified pacific fisher within the project area.wier noted that the pacific fisher presence on mount ashland represented the furthest east and the highest elevation at which pacific fisher had been found within the siskiyou mountains.despite wier observations,the forest service did not update or amend its biological evaluation.the forest service addressed wier discovery of the pacific fisher within the expansion area in the feis by concluding that the project posed no threat to the pacific fisher because the expansion will impact less than one percent of the similarly forested land within three miles.this conclusion is based on an analysis of habitat in the proximity of the project area rather than documented local and total fisher populations.
we find that in this instance the forest service use of habitat as a proxy for population violated the nfma.we have recently explained that species viability may be met by estimating and preserving habitat only where both the forest service knowledge of what quality and quantity of habitat is necessary to support the species and the forest service method for measuring the existing amount of that habitat are reasonably reliable and accurate.earth island inst.forest,cir hereinafter earth island ii quoting native ecosystems council forest,cir emphasis added.
in earth island ii,we examined whether the forest service appropriately relied on habitat monitoring for determining populations trends of the woodpecker.id.at.although the forest service final environmental impact statement discuss ed various studies of woodpeckers that confirm ed their preference for burned forest habitat and presented tables listing areas in the project area assumed to provide high and moderate capability habitat,we concluded that t here is no indication that the usfs consulted current or accurate field studies to arrive at these numbers,and there is no identification of the methodology used in determining what constitutes suitable habitat.id.
we find the forest service analysis of the quantity and quality of the fisher habitat similarly devoid of supporting or explanatory data.in its feis,the forest service stated that o f the land within three miles of the s pecial u se p ermit area,acres are in a condition class similar to the forested site where the fisher was photographed.the acres of forested area that would be removed if alternative is implemented,amount to percent of the available acres of habitat within three miles.but other than commenting that it was similar to the environment in which the fisher was actually found,the forest service offered little explanation of its methodology for classifying the acres in question as suitable fisher habitat.
furthermore,the feis explicitly states that ecological relationships between fisher and habitat are largely unknown and t he use of habitat per seasonality and topography is currently unknown in the s pecial u se p ermit area.additionally,statements by two forest service biologists,eugene wier and william zilinski,reveal that the forest service had insufficient data and knowledge regarding the population of the pacific fisher,and the quantity and quality of habitat preferred by the pacific fisher to justify using habitat as a proxy for population.specifically,wier observed that the forest service know s nothing about how many individuals there are within the ashland watershed or in the greater population,where they nest,how large their home ranges are,and what constitutes the core habitat within the greater ashland watershed upon which these individuals depend for future survival.zilinski stated that the documented fisher purpose in the expansion area was unknown was it just foraging,investigating denning sites,or exploring for new territory 
thus,given the dearth of information about the local fisher population generally and the forest service failure to explain adequately how it identified suitable fisher habitat,we hold that the forest service habitat analysis was insufficient to satisfy the demands of the rogue river lrmp biological evaluation process,and is in violation of the nfma 
nepa claims 
onrc also argues that the forest service violated the nepa when it failed to disclose the potential impact of displacing the fisher and damaging habitat in the corridor linking the region and the southern cascades,and to discuss the effect future projects in the masa expansion area would have on the pacific fisher.we agree with onrc.
in marble mountain audubon society rice,cir,we held that the forest service failure to discuss the importance of maintaining a biological corridor in the klamath national forest violated the nepa.id.at.we explained that a lthough the feis acknowledges that the grider creek drainage is a biological corridor,it does not contain significant discussion of the corridor issue.id.here,we are presented with a similar problem.in this case,the forest service acknowledged that there is a biological corridor linking the region and the southern cascades,and concluded that the expansion would have an inconsequential effect on the fisher.the forest service failed to meaningfully substantiate this finding.
the forest service attempts to distinguish marble mountain on the basis that any impact on the biological corridor would be minimal because masa expansion would impact less than acres of the biological corridor,whereas in marble mountain more than acres of the biological corridor were at risk.we are not persuaded.while the number of acres at risk here is certainly less than that in marble mountain,the forest service has nonetheless failed to disclose the methodology it employed to determine that the expansion impact on the fisher would be inconsequential.merely disclosing the existence of a biological corridor is inadequate.id.where the forest service concludes that a project will not jeopardize a wildlife corridor,it must support that conclusion with at least some study or analysis of how the reduced corridor will affect the species at issue.id.
turning to onrc second nepa claim,federal law requires that an eis must analyze the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past,present,and reasonably foreseeable future actions.see also.a necessary component of nepa hard look is a sufficiently detailed catalogue of past,present,and future projects,and adequate analysis about how these projects,and differences between the projects,are thought to have impacted the environment.lands council,at.
the forest service feis violates the nepa because it fails to adequately discuss the impact on the pacific fisher of two future projects the construction of nine miles of new logging roads within three miles of the project area,which will require the cutting of approximately acres on the south side of mount ashland and a habitat restoration and fuel hazard reduction treatments,which include controlled fires.the feis simply states that n o adverse cumulative effects are anticipated.the only future project s anticipated near the s pecial u se p ermit area are the ashland watershed protection project,and ashland forest resiliency,which is sic not likely to affect fisher minimal associated human.
the forest service argues that it did not have to detail these projects impact on the fisher because the ski area expansion is modest.we reject this justification.we have repeatedly explained that generalized,conclusory assertions from agency experts are not sufficient the agency must provide the underlying data supporting the assertion in language intelligible to the public.see ocean advocates army corps of eng rs,cir wildlands ctr.bureau of land,cir.w hile the conclusions of agency experts are surely entitled to deference,nepa documents are inadequate if they contain only narratives of expert opinions.wildlands,at.more specifically,the nepa explicitly requires a cumulative impact analysis.a particular action may seem unimportant in isolation,but that small action may have dire consequences when combined with other actions.as we observed in wildlands center,s ometimes the total impact from a set of actions may be greater than the sum of the parts.for example,the addition of a small amount of sediment to a creek may have only a limited impact on salmon survival,or perhaps no impact at all.but the addition of a small amount here,a small amount there,and still more at another point could add up to something with a much greater impact,until there comes a point where even a marginal increase will mean that no salmon survive.id.at emphasis in original.
we can not excuse the forest service from the nepa requirement to include an adequate cumulative impact analysis in the feis.two future projects,the ashland forest resiliency project a logging project,and the ashland watershed protection project a habitat restoration and fuel reduction project,are scheduled to occur in the vicinity of the proposed masa expansion.though the forest service generally addressed the impact of these projects elsewhere in the feis,it failed to discuss in detail their impact upon the fisher as part of the cumulative impact analysis required by nepa.see earth island inst.forest,cir holding that a cumulative impact analysis violated nepa when a feis did not assess the role of foreseeable future projects on remaining suitable spotted owl habitat in a nearby home range core area within close proximity to the project area.
riparian reserves and restricted watershed terrain 
we next turn to onrc claim that the forest service violated the nfma by failing to appropriately designate riparian reserves and restricted watershed terrain as required by the rogue river lrmp and the nwfp.the rules governing the forest service designation and management of riparian reserves and watersheds are complex and overlapping.the principal source of these rules is the nwfp itself,and,derivatively,the aquatic conservation strategy acs adopted pursuant to the nwfp.under the acs,riparian reserves are essentially buffer zones along streams,lakes,wetlands,and areas,and watersheds are aquatic habitats or other hydrologically important areas.see pac.coast fed of fishermen ass ns,marine fisheries,cir.recognizing that riparian terrain offer s core areas of high quality stream habitat,and that watersheds are crucial to fish species and stocks and provide high quality water,the acs standards and guidelines prohibit or regulate activities in riparian reserves that retard or prevent attainment of the aquatic conservation strategy objectives.
the forest service must,however,comply with more than just the nwfp acs.when the nwfp was enacted,it did not completely displace existing forest management plans.in addition to setting out its own standards and guidelines,the nwfp also provides that the standards and guidelines of the individual forest management the rogue river effective where they are more restrictive or provide greater benefits to forest related species.accordingly,the forest service must also comply with the rogue river lrmp more restrictive standards and guidelines for lands designated restricted riparian,management strategy ms and for lands designated restricted watershed,management strategy ms.these standards and guidelines include the protection of all terrain within feet horizontal distance of perennial streams,wetlands and associated riparian vegetation restricted riparian ms and all acres designated as suitable for municipal supply watershed restricted riparian ms.these guidelines further provide that w hen conflicts exist between watershed management and other resources,the conflict will be resolved in the favor of the watershed resource.
designation of land as riparian reserve has significant consequences for the management of that land.specifically,the rogue river lrmp mandates that management activities in riparian reserves should not exceed 
a mineral soil exposed on soils classed as very slight,slight,or low or moderate erosion hazard soils 
b exposure on high or severe erosion hazard soils 
c exposure on very high or very severe erosion hazard soils.
pursuant to the nwfp,acs standard and guideline further prohibits the forest service from us ing mitigation or planned restoration as a substitute for preventing habitat degradation within riparian reserves,and explains that p riority must be given to protecting existing high quality habitat rather than compensating for management actions that degrade existing habitat through mitigation and restoration.
designation of land as restricted watershed terrain also has significant consequences.the rogue river lrmp includes specific soil disturbance standards and guidelines for areas designated as restricted watershed terrain and requires that management activities on restricted watershed ms lands not exceed a f orty percent mineral soil exposed on soil classed as very slight,slight,low or moderate erosion hazard soils b t hirty percent exposure on high or severe erosion hazard soils c f ifteen percent exposure on very high or very severe erosion hazard soils.
riparian reserves 
the nwfp assigns the riparian reserve designation to streams,ponds,lakes,and wetlands,including a buffer around these waterways.pursuant to the acs,and thus the nwfp,lands that are potentially unstable must be designated and managed as riparian reserve.using a landslide haza
