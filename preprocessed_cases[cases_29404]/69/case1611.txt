background 
appellant mykrolis and pall are competitors in the industry of filtration systems for semiconductor manufacturing.mykrolis is the assignee of the and patents.the and patents disclose fluid filtration systems having a filter module that can be simply inserted into and held in fluid tight connection with a manifold structure.in march,mykrolis initiated the present patent infringement lawsuit against pall and simultaneously moved for a preliminary injunction with respect to pall accused photokleen filter assembly product.mykrolis moved for a preliminary injunction on the ground that pall assembly product infringed at least claim of the patent and claim of the patent.
at the close of an expedited discovery period following the injunction request,the court held a evidentiary and claim construction hearing.on april,the district court issued a memorandum and order,setting forth its claim construction with respect to claim of the patent and claim of the patent.mykrolis,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the order also granted mykrolis a preliminary injunction,enjoining pall from making,using,selling,or offering to sell the product now being sold under the name photokleen filter assembly,or any colorable imitation thereof.id.at,dist.lexis,at 
pall thereafter ceased sales of the filter assembly and began selling a modified assembly.the new design referred to herein as the or the slotted assembly eliminated a tab on the bottom of the filter module component that previously engaged a slot in the manifold to provide proper alignment of the components.pall filed a motion seeking clarification of the scope of the preliminary injunction with respect to the new slotted assemblies,but pall withdrew that motion as moot because it concluded that its modified filter assemblies are without question not the filter assemblies nor colorable imitations thereof.instead,pall amended its declaratory judgment complaint seeking a declaration of noninfringement with respect to the new design.mykrolis moved the district court to hold pall in contempt for violating the preliminary injunction order by its sales of the assembly and requested damages that mykrolis allegedly suffered because of pall violations of the preliminary injunction order.the district court held a hearing on july,on mykrolis contempt motion and took the matter under advisement.
in august,before the district court ruled on the contempt motion,two events occurred.first,pall again modified the design of its accused products,this time removing the slot on the bottom plate of the manifold component platform,creating the slotless assembly.pall ceased distributing the slotted assembly in favor of the slotless assembly.second,pall moved to dissolve the preliminary injunction on the basis of two prior art references assigned to sumitomo bakelite,the sumitomo references,which pall argued raised a substantial question regarding the validity of the asserted patent claims.
on january,the district court issued an order holding pall in contempt of the court preliminary injunction order for its sales of the slotted assembly.mykrolis,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the district court assessed a fine against pall for mykrolis attorneys fees and costs in connection with the contempt.the january contempt order also granted pall motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction.id.at,dist.lexis,at.the district court concluded that pall has cast enough doubt on the validity of the mykrolis patents with respect to the sumitomo references that it can no longer be said that pall invalidity defenses lack substantial merit.id.
both parties now appeal the court january order.pall appeals the court finding of contempt however,pall does not contest the amount of the assessed fine.mykrolis the district court decision to dissolve the preliminary injunction.
it is axiomatic that the initial inquiry in any appeal is whether the court to which appeal is taken has jurisdiction to hear the appeal.woodard sage,en banc.this court is thus obligated to consider whether it has jurisdiction even when the issue is not raised by either party.bender williamsport area sch,d pandrol usa,lp airboss ry,citing view eng g,robotic vision.we apply federal circuit law to issues of our own appellate jurisdiction.int l tech.hughes aircraft,woodard,at.
pall contends that this court has jurisdiction over its appeal of the contempt order as an interlocutory appeal under c.section c provides that t he united states court of appeals for the federal circuit shall have exclusive jurisdiction of an appeal from an interlocutory order or decree described in subsection a or b of this section in any case over which the court would have jurisdiction of an appeal under section of this title.c.section a provides that the courts of appeals have jurisdiction over interlocutory orders of the district courts of the united states granting,continuing,modifying,refusing or dissolving injunctions,or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions,except where a direct review may be had in the supreme court.the contempt order which pall is appealing does none of these.
the supreme court has stated,in general,that section a should be narrowly construed 
because a was intended to carve out only a limited exception to the rule,we have construed the statute narrowly to ensure that appeal as of right under a will be available only in circumstances where an appeal will further the statutory purpose of permit ting litigants to effectually challenge interlocutory orders of serious,perhaps irreparable,consequence.unless a litigant can show that an interlocutory order of the district court might have a serious,perhaps irreparable,consequence,and that the order can be effectually challenged only by immediate appeal,the general congressional policy against piecemeal review will preclude interlocutory appeal.
carson am.brands,d internal citations omitted.since carson,at least one supreme court case acknowledged that the serious,perhaps irreparable consequence standard set forth in carson is intended to apply to situations like this one,where a court order does not on its face modify,grant,refuse,dissolve,or continue an injunction but where it is alleged to have the same effective consequence as an interlocutory appeal in section a.gulfstream aerospace mayacamas,d section a will,of course,continue to provide appellate jurisdiction over orders that grant or deny injunctions and orders that have the practical effect of granting or denying injunctions and have serious,perhaps irreparable,consequence.
in this case,pall argues that the contempt order is an appealable interlocutory order that falls within section a because in order to find pall in contempt,the district court continued or modified the injunction to include the products developed after and in response to the district court injunction.the district court contempt order does not,on its face,modify or continue an injunction,but this does not end the inquiry.where a district court interlocutory order effectively amounts to a modification,grant,refusal,dissolution,or continuation of an injunction,this court may have jurisdiction over an appeal of that order.see eli lilly medtronic,stating the order from which appeal has been taken not only found medtronic in contempt but also put into place injunctive relief supplementary to the injunction found to have been violated and,therefore,constitutes an order within the scope of section a see also gregory depte,cir agreeing that the usual rule is that an interlocutory civil contempt is not appealable,but finding that the sanction issued by the district court amounts to an independent preliminary injunction and thus is appealable at this stage internal citations omitted int l ass of machinists aerospace workers air lines,finding jurisdiction over the civil contempt order where it necessarily modified the july injunction or issued a completely new injunction.thus,we must consider whether the district court contempt order effectively amounts to either a modification or continuation of the preliminary injunction,as pall contends.we address each of these possibilities in turn.
there is a difference between a district court order that modifies an injunction and one that clarifies or interprets an injunction.although the distinction between an order interpreting an injunction and one modifying an injunction is not always clear,the distinction defines a boundary of appellate jurisdiction under section.motorola,computer displays int l,cir.here,the district court clearly stated that it was not modifying the original preliminary injunction when it found that pall sales of the slotted assembly violated the injunction.mykrolis,wl,at,dist.lexis,at stating the april,preliminary injunction applies to the with the slot internal parenthetical omitted.the district court held that the slotted assembly was a colorable imitation of the assembly,which was expressly covered by the original preliminary injunction.mykrolis,wl,at,dist.lexis,at stating that pall is enjoined from making,using,selling,or offering to sell within the united states the product now being sold under the name photokleen filter assembly,or any colorable imitation thereof.we conclude that the contempt order is merely an interpretation of the preliminary injunction and not a modification of the injunction within the meaning of section a.accordingly,no jurisdiction for pall appeal exists on this basis.
we next consider whether the contempt order continued an injunction.to characterize an interlocutory order as continuing an injunction under section a,the order must effectively prolong or extend an existing injunction.see robert morse,when does interlocutory order of federal district court,concerning previously issued injunction,modify or continue such injunction so as to be appealable under a,fed.the ninth circuit explained that an order that continues an injunction under section is an order that extends the duration of the injunction that would otherwise have dissolved by its own terms.united states oakland cannabis buyers,cir.similarly,the first circuit explained that for an interlocutory order to be classified as one that continues an injunction,the order must have a direct and demonstrable effect on the duration of a injunction.in other words,the later order must extend or prolong the restraint.sierra club marsh,cir.we follow these rules from the ninth and first circuits in this case,not because we are bound to,but because we find them persuasive,and thus,we adopt them as federal circuit law.
in this case,the preliminary injunction stated that its duration was until further order of this court.mykrolis,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the contempt order did not prolong,extend,or in any other way impact the duration of the preliminary injunction.accordingly,we hold that the contempt order can not be characterized as continuing the preliminary injunction within the meaning of section.
because the contempt order does not fall into any of the enumerated categories of appealable interlocutory orders in a,and because pall has not alleged that it would face irreparable consequence if it was unable to appeal the contempt order at this time,see carson,at,we hold that c does not provide this court with jurisdiction over pall appeal.
pall also contends,in the alternative,that this court has jurisdiction over its appeal of the contempt order under a.that statute provides,in relevant part,that t he united states court of appeals for the federal circuit shall have exclusive jurisdiction of an appeal from a final decision of a district court of the united states for every patent dispute arising under.a emphasis added.under this rule,known as the final judgment rule,parties may appeal only final decision s of a district court.nystrom trex,citing a.in applying this rule,the supreme court defined a final judgment as a decision by the district court that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.id.citing catlin united states.
in this case,pall argues that the contempt order is final within the meaning of section a because a fine has been assessed against pall.the supreme court,however,has rejected the notion that a civil contempt order is final,stating we deem it settled that an order punishing for contempt made in the progress of the case,when not in the nature of an order in a criminal proceeding,is regarded as interlocutory and to be reviewed only upon appeal from a final decree in the case.doyle london guar.accident.in doyle,the supreme court was considering whether the third circuit had appellate jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a district court contempt judgment against two defendants,ordering the two defendants to pay a fine or face imprisonment.id.at.the court found that the contempt was civil,not criminal in nature because the purpose of the contempt was not vindication of the authority and dignity of the court but rather to enforce the rights of private parties,to compel obedience to orders and decrees made to enforce their rights and to give them a remedy to which the court deems them entitled.id.at.due to the civil nature of the contempt,the court held the circuit court of appeals has no jurisdiction to review the judgment set forth.id.at.similarly,in fox capital,the supreme court addressed whether an appellate court properly dismissed an appeal of a contempt order,where the contempt issued to punish a party for failing to participate in discovery and the penalty included a fine of which was imposed unconditionally.in holding that the contempt order was not final,the court stated that d espite the contempt or the penalties therefor,the underlying proceeding may continue until its aim has been achieved.id.at.
the supreme court precedent dictates that civil contempts arising during the trial of related litigation are not appealable if adjudged against a party litigant,although such contempts are reviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the related litigation.d appellate review see also charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed.the supreme court rule in fox and doyle has been widely followed by other circuits.see purdy,cir the imposition of sanctions for civil contempt during the course of a pending action is an appealable final action only if the person held in contempt is not a party to the pending action.mcalpin lexington auto truck stop,cir a judgment of civil contempt is not itself a final decree,and therefore is not itself appealable in the absence of a final judgment.internal citations omitted union of prof l airmen alaska aeronautical,cir in summary,the order was for civil contempt and as such it was an interlocutory order and appealable as part of any appeal from the final judgment.cromaglass ferm,cir w ith respect to a party to the litigation,an order holding a party in civil contempt was in fact an interlocutory order and was not appealable except on final judgment.int l bus.machs.united states,cir hodgson mahoney,cir calling a civil contempt order assessing fines and incarceration unappealable before final judgment.
pall argues that this rule is not applied in the federal circuit,and it references seiko epson international.in seiko,the plaintiffs charged defendant with patent infringement for manufacturing certain ink cartridges,for which the court preliminarily enjoined.the plaintiffs amended their complaint to add further allegations of patent infringement,which included the addition of a new defendant,new products,and additional patents.plaintiffs also requested that the court modify the preliminary injunction to encompass these new infringement allegations.the court ruled that several of the plaintiffs patents were either invalid or unenforceable,and therefore,it dissolved the preliminary injunction with respect to these patents.the court amended the preliminary injunction to include one of the newly asserted patents but refused to expand the injunction to cover plaintiffs design patent,finding that it was not likely plaintiffs would succeed on the merits of that infringement claim.the district court also found defendants in contempt for continuing to manufacture the alleged infringing ink cartridges as well as the newly added models,in violation of the preliminary injunction.both parties appealed various aspects of the court august ruling,including the contempt order.id.at.
on appeal,the plaintiffs argued that this court did not have jurisdiction to review the contempt citation because orders of civil contempt are interlocutory and are not appealable before entry of final judgment.id.at.this court disagreed,finding that it did have jurisdiction over the appeal of the contempt order,but it did not indicate under what statutory section that jurisdiction arose.although the court noted the finality of the contempt order,we do not read seiko for the proposition that,under federal circuit law contempt orders are final decision s under section a,as suggested by pall.to do so would directly conflict with the supreme court doyle and fox cases,which hold that civil contempt orders are not final judgments,even when a fine is assessed.see doyle,at.fox,at.rather,this court had jurisdiction in seiko to review the contempt order because it effectively modified the injunction in that it expanded the scope of products beyond those enjoined by the terms of the original injunction.see seiko,at limiting relief for contempt for infringement to the products originally enjoined.in contrast,the contempt order at issue in this appeal did not expand the scope of the preliminary injunction.instead,as explained above,the order merely interpreted the breadth of the original injunction,finding that pall slotted assemblies fell within the express terms of the originally enjoined products.
based on the foregoing,we hold that the final judgment rule is not satisfied in this case.by holding pall in contempt for violating the preliminary injunction,the district court order did not end the litigation on the merits.nystrom,at citing catlin united states.to the contrary,the underlying litigation is still ongoing.therefore,we hold that this court does not have jurisdiction over pall appeal pursuant to a.
finally,pall argues that this court may properly exercise pendent or ancillary jurisdiction over its appeal of the contempt order because the court has jurisdiction over mykrolis of the dissolution of the preliminary injunction.in appropriate circumstances,pendent jurisdiction provides an appellate court with the discretion to review an interlocutory order that would not otherwise be reviewable in connection with review of a properly appealable order.see intermedics infusaid,regents of of.
it is appropriate for an appellate court to exercise pendent jurisdiction over an appeal where that appeal is inextricably intertwined with another appeal over which it does have jurisdiction such that it is necessary to review both to ensure meaningful review.clinton jones,d quoting swint chambers county comm n,d swint,at.citing kanji,the proper scope of pendent appellate jurisdiction in the collateral order context,yale,as stating o nly where essential to the resolution of properly appealed collateral orders should courts extend their jurisdiction to rulings that would not otherwise qualify for expedited consideration emphasis added see also papineau parmley,cir pendent appellate jurisdiction is a procedural device that rarely should be used because of the danger of abuse and that accordingly,we must exercise such jurisdiction only in exceptional circumstances.internal citations and quotations omitted.

in this case,pall appeal turns on whether the district court properly determined that the slotted assembly was a colorable imitation of the enjoined assembly mykrolis questions whether the court properly dissolved the injunction in light of invalidity concerns with respect to the asserted claims raised by the sumitomo references.consideration of the issues in the does not impact,let alone resolve,the issues in pall appeal.accordingly,we find that pall appeal of the contempt order is not inextricably intertwined with mykrolis of the dissolution of the preliminary injunction.
pall cited additional cases in which courts permitted pendent jurisdiction over unappealable issues because those issues were inextricably intertwined with appealable issues.see katz lear siegler,holding that appeal of the joinder of two defendants was inextricably intertwined with appeal of an injunction prohibiting suit against the defendants in another jurisdiction because the latter appeal involved factors pertinent to the former diamontiney borg,cir holding a civil contempt order inextricably intertwined with an underlying preliminary injunction because the review considerations were closely related latrobe steel united steelworkers of,cir allowing interlocutory appeal of a contempt order where the review of the contempt relief was impacted by the court review of the underlying preliminary injunction contrary to pall claims,each of these cases is distinguishable from this case because of the close relation of the appealed issues.here,as explained above,there is no overlap or impact between the issues on appeal.accordingly,we find that exercising pendent jurisdiction is not appropriate with respect to pall appeal.
nor do we find exercising pendent jurisdiction appropriate based on the fact that the district court decision on the contempt motion is in the same order that dissolved the preliminary injunction.our precedent acknowledges that in some circumstances,this court can review an entire order,and not simply the propriety of the injunctive relief.king instrument otari.for example,when an appellate court reviews a district court decision to dissolve an injunction,it should consider all of the issues that bear on the district court decision to dissolve the injunction.mclaughlin mississippi power,cir.yet appellate review is limited to only those issues,and here,the district court decision to dissolve the injunction was unrelated to its decision holding pall in contempt.presenting a ruling that is not otherwise appealable in the same physical document as an order dissolving an injunction does not make the unappealable ruling reviewable by this court under.
having thus concluded that we do not have jurisdiction over pall appeal of the contempt order under or and that exercising pendent jurisdiction is not appropriate because the contempt order is not inextricably intertwined with the remaining appealed issues,we dismiss pall appeal for lack of jurisdiction.

before addressing the merits of the appeal,pall argues that this court lacks jurisdiction to review the district court order because mykrolis failed to challenge a basis upon which the district court dissolved
