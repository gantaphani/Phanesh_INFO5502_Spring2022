the measure of damages for a real estate broker intentional misrepresentation to a buyer for whom he acts as agent is not limited to the losses suffered by the buyer.because the broker is a fiduciary,damages for intentional fraud may be measured by the broader rule.
factual and procedural background 
tim and dinora fragale purchased a home in long beach in,and several months later filed this lawsuit against the seller,earlene faulkner.the complaint alleged two fraud causes of action,for intentional and negligent misrepresentation,in connection with the sale.the real estate broker,vince messing,who represented both parties in the transaction was subsequently added as a defendant.
the fragales complaint alleged defendants falsely represented that no structural defects or safety problems existed with respect to a laundry room and bonus room addition to the house which had been constructed without permits from the city.in fact,there were material construction defects in the addition,including defective interior walls,electrical wiring and other problems,which were hidden from view behind paneling installed by faulkner husband.the fragales discovered the defects almost immediately after the purchase when tim fragale began to tear out the paneling in the course of remodeling.
the matter eventually proceeded to a jury trial.before trial began,messing filed,and the court granted,a motion in limine to preclude the fragales from presenting any evidence not relevant to the fraud claims pled in the complaint,specifically,any evidence of breach of fiduciary duty by messing.
at trial,the fragales presented testimony from messing,faulkner,tim fragale and lynn sims,a construction management expert.the testimony showed tim fragale met messing at an open house held by messing at the faulkner property in may.at messing suggestion,the fragales decided to use messing as their agent messing offered to give the fragales of his commission.on may,the fragales made a written offer to purchase the faulkner property.after two counteroffers,the fragales and faulkner signed a purchase agreement.on june,the fragales received a copy of the transfer disclosure statement prepared by faulkner.on this form,faulkner checked boxes indicating she was aware of significant in interior walls,ceilings,floors,driveways and sidewalks.however,she gave no explanation in response to the subsequent question asking for an explanation of any such defects.on faulkner transfer disclosure statement,she also checked boxes indicating she was aware of r oom additions,structural modifications or other alterations or repairs that were made without necessary permits and that were not in compliance with building codes.in response to the subsequent question asking for an explanation,faulkner wrote,l aundry room,bonus room,mbr closet,no permits.doorway can be closed if necessary from bonus room to br.messing did not instruct faulkner to expand on any of these items.messing had several discussions with tim fragale about the lack of permits,and explained that they were built without someone going down to city hall and pulling a building permit.the fragales employed a house inspection company to inspect the house.the inspector told the fragales he found no major defects,but listed a number of minor defects,including the lack of permits.
tim fragale was concerned about what was under the paneling,and on may,prepared a list of specific questions for faulkner.messing sent the questions by fax to faulkner,who was then in arkansas caring for an ill parent,and faulkner returned handwritten answers by fax.one question asked faulkner to describe the structural makeup of the walls in the rooms covered by paneling,and she responded,plaster board.another question asked,as to the unpermitted closet and laundry room,was whether the current owners made the improvements faulkner response was no.i bought house without permits.in response to the question,are rooms basically built to code without permits,faulkner responded,not sure.faulkner responded no to the question whether there were structural deficiencies that may be of safety concern that should be addressed upon taking possession of the property.tim fragale testified he told messing he needed to know the condition of the walls behind the paneling,and messing told him that he contacted the faulkners and they said the walls were fine.that it basically just cosmetic,you know.you just take the paneling off and you paint the walls and so he assured me that what was behind the paneling was just walls.fragale testified he knew the bonus room and laundry room were not permitted,and he talked to messing about what this meant and whether the rooms were built to code but just not permitted.messing told him,do worry about it,tim,they are fine.i mean,they are going to go for another years.there is no problem with those rooms.
when the fragales took possession of the house in august,tim fragale removed the paneling and found major alterations had been made that were concealed by the paneling,including removal of plasterboard,false ceilings and walls,dangling electrical wires and sockets,and so on.the fragales expert sims testified the cost of repair,including demolition of the structurally defective bonus room,would be 
at the close of the fragales,messing and faulkner moved for nonsuit.messing motion contended the fragales offered no admissible evidence of diminution in the value of the property,as required under civil code section.the fragales moved to reopen their case to allow tim fragale to testify as to the value of the property,and also moved to amend the pleadings to state a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty,based on evidence already presented.
the trial court ruled that diminution of value had not been established,and denied the fragales motion to reopen so that fragale could testify to diminution in value.the court found the offer of proof with respect to fragale proposed testimony was insufficient,because an owner of property is not qualified to testify unless he has information about comparable sales.the court denied messing motion for nonsuit and allowed the case to go to the jury on subparagraph of baji,namely,the cost of the repair.the trial court also denied the fragales motion to amend the complaint to add a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty on the grounds it was untimely and prejudicial to the defense.
the jury returned special verdicts against messing and faulkner,finding each of them liable for intentional misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation,and awarded damages against each on both causes of action messing filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,on the grounds the fragales offered no evidence of an intentional misrepresentation,and no evidence of the value of the property at the time of transfer.the court granted the motion.the minute order stated there was no evidence of what the market value of the property would have been had the true facts been known regarding the lack of permits and the lack of compliance with the building code,so that the fragales failed to show any damages within the meaning of civil code section.judgment was entered in favor of faulkner and messing,and the fragales filed a timely appeal from the judgment.
discussion 
the fragales argue the trial court erred in concluding they failed to present appropriate evidence of damages caused by messing misrepresentation,and in refusing to reopen the case for tim fragale testimony as to the value of the property.the fragales are correct on the first point,but not on the second.
the measure of damages.
the fragales principal contention is the trial court erred in relying on civil code section to find they failed to show any damages resulting from messing intentional misrepresentation.the fragales are correct.messing was agent for the fragales as well as faulkner in the transaction and therefore a fiduciary.the damages for fraud by a fiduciary are measured under civil code section,rather than section.while there is a split of authority on the point,we conclude the measure of damages for a fiduciary intentional misrepresentation is not confined to actual or losses.
we first describe the principles applicable to fraud damages,and then turn to the circumstances in this case.several points are well settled 
there are two measures of damages for fraud and.the measure restores a plaintiff to the financial position he enjoyed prior to the fraudulent transaction,awarding the difference in actual value between what the plaintiff gave and what he received.the measure places a defrauded plaintiff in the position he would have enjoyed had the false representation been true,awarding him the difference in value between what he actually received and what he was fraudulently led to believe he would receive.alliance mortgage rothwell cal th,d,alliance mortgage.
in fraud cases involving the purchase,sale or exchange of property,the legislature has expressly provided that the rather than the measure of damages should apply.alliance mortgage,supra,cal th at,d.civil code section provides the exclusive measure of damages for fraud in such cases.one defrauded in the purchase,sale or exchange of property is entitled to recover the difference between the actual value of that with which the defrauded person parted and the actual value of that which he received,subd.a.
civil code section does not apply,however,when a victim is defrauded by its fiduciaries.alliance mortgage,supra,cal th at,d.instead,in the case of fraud by a fiduciary,the broader measure of damages provided by sections and applies,fns.omitted.section is the general tort damage measure,permitting compensation for all the detriment proximately caused by the breach of an obligation not arising from contract civil code section provides that o ne who willfully deceives another with intent to induce him to alter his position to his injury or risk,is liable for any damage which he thereby suffers.
in the case of a negligent misrepresentation by a fiduciary,a plaintiff is only entitled to its actual or losses suffered because of the fiduciary negligent misrepresentation under section.alliance mortgage,supra,cal th at,d.
the supreme court has not decided whether the measure of damages under section might be greater for a fiduciary intentional misrepresentation id.at,d.
two points are clear from these principles.since no fiduciary relationship existed between faulkner and the fragales,their damages against faulkner are measured exclusively under civil code section.the fragales make no argument to the contrary.because they produced no evidence at trial of the actual value of the property they received,they failed to establish an essential element of their causes of action against faulkner.saunders taylor th,d judgment of nonsuit affirmed where purchasers offered no evidence of what the market value of the house would have been had the true facts been known regarding the lack of permits and the lack of compliance with building codes.the result is the same with respect to the fragales claim of negligent misrepresentation against messing.as the supreme court stated in alliance mortgage,supra,cal th at,d,a plaintiff is entitled only to its losses suffered because of a fiduciary negligent misrepresentation.
the result is different on the fragales claim against messing for intentional misrepresentation.joining those courts that have adopted the broader measure of damages for fiduciary fraud,we conclude that damages are not limited to losses.the result is consonant with the principle that the faithless fiduciary shall make good the full amount of the loss of which his breach of faith is a cause.salahutdin valley of california,th,d salahutdin,omitted discussing cases.
we acknowledge that the authorities are not uniform on whether a measure of damages other than losses may be applied in the case of an intentional misrepresentation by a fiduciary.since alliance mortgage,one court has concluded that loss is the appropriate measure of damages for intentional fraud by a fiduciary.hensley mcsweeney th,d hensley.in hensley,the fifth district reversed a judgment finding an escrow agent liable for breach of fiduciary duty,fraud by intentional misrepresentation and fraud by false promise,concluding the trial court erroneously instructed the jury with the rather than the measure of damages for the tort causes of action.in the absence of any contrary authority from the california supreme court ibid,the hensley court declined to depart from its decision in overgaard johnson d.overgaard.in overgaard,the fifth district applied the rule in a case of negligent misrepresentation by a fiduciary.overgaard,supra,d at.hensley did not discuss the propriety of distinguishing between intentional and negligent misrepresentations by a fiduciary 
the preferable view is that damages for fraud by a fiduciary should not be limited to losses.as stated in salahutdin,supra,the remedy afforded by sections and aims at compensation for any and all the detriment proximately caused by the breach.th at,d.commentators likewise state that,while there is a conflict in the decisions,the rule applies to an agent fraud.one commentator explains this result flows from the joint application of civil code sections and in fraud cases 
t he courts have carved a special exception to the rule in cases where the principal action against the agent is based on the agent fraud on the principal.the measure of damages for the principal action against his or her agent who is in a fiduciary capacity is measured by the joint application of two principles for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract,the measure of damages is the amount which will compensate for all the detriment proximately caused thereby,whether it could have been anticipated or not.one who willfully deceives another with intent to induce him to alter his position to his injury or risk,is liable for any damage which he thereby suffers.in an action by a principal against an agent arising from the agent fraud,these two principles have been interpreted as providing a measure of damages based on the broader rule because a fiduciary should be responsible to compensate his or her principal for the full amount of the loss caused by his or her breach of duty.miller starr,cal.real estate ed,footnotes omitted.
we agree with this approach,and conclude the measure of damages in a case of intentional misrepresentation by a fiduciary is not limited to losses therefore,the trial court was not required to penalize the fragales for failing to establish the loss they difference between the amount they paid for the house and what it was a result of messing intentional misrepresentation.
the fragales and messing both presented evidence of the cost of repair,and the jury award was presumably based on that evidence.the award effectively places the fragales in the position they would have enjoyed if messing false representation had been true it enables them to place the property in the condition which they believed existed at the time of purchase.while awarding the cost of repair effectively affords the fragales the benefit of their bargain,it also is an equitable measure of damages under the circumstances because it compensates the fragales for the detriment proximately caused by messing misrepresentation,as permitted under civil code section.indeed,any significant difference between the fragales is the difference between the amount they paid and the value of the house they the cost of repair is unlikely.accordingly,the trial court erred in entering judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the claim against messing for intentional misrepresentation 
the motion to reopen 
the fragales also contend the trial court should have allowed them to reopen the to enable tim fragale to testify as to the value of the property they received in the transaction.they claim his testimony would have supported an award against faulkner.we see no error.
when the court asked for an offer of proof with respect to fragale proposed testimony,counsel submitted that under the evidence code,the value of property may be shown by the opinion of the owner,subd.a.further,counsel stated t his owner bought a house he believed in a certain condition.the house in fact was not in that conditio
