patricia gray,an attorney,appeals from a judgment awarding her former client,as guardian ad litem for his two children plaintiffs,the sum of on and action against gray for legal malpractice.plaintiffs also have appealed from the judgment,contending the trial court erred in calculating the damages owed by gray.
background 
in december,and enrolled their children in the kidstop daycare facility in sonoma county,operated by donna and phillip moore.before enrolling the children,and checked with the county of sonoma social services department the county and were told that kidstop was licensed,no complaints had been made about it and it appeared to be a good daycare facility.this information was a factor in and decision to enroll their children at kidstop.on june,their older child reported that phillip moore had sexually molested her.their other child was too young to communicate his own experiences,but the older child reported that phillip moore had not molested him.in july,the younger child saw a newspaper photograph of moore and reacted violently,making comments that indicated moore had sexually molested him,too.
moore later pled guilty or no contest to molesting several children at kidstop,including the older child.
on july,and read a newspaper article about moore that mentioned that two minor complaints had been made about kidstop.went to the county and looked at its file on kidstop.it contained a number of complaints that predated and involvement with kidstop.there was a complaint that a baby gate had been left open.there were several complaints that the facility was taking care of more children than it was licensed to care for.one parent complained that donna moore had yanked an infant by the arm and had yelled at him.this child also was observed to have a splotchy red back and a bruise on one cheek.there was a complaint that the children at the facility were given skimpy lunches and no milk.there was a complaint that the moores dog,which was allowed to mingle with the children,had bitten a neighbor.
in november,and hired attorney james barrett and the law firm of cantor,barrett wheeldin to represent the minors in an action against the county for misrepresenting that no complaints had been filed against kidstop and that it was a good daycare facility.barrett obtained an order appointing to act as the children guardian ad litem,but took no further action.
in june,and saw a newspaper article reporting that other parents had filed a lawsuit against the county,and became concerned that barrett did not seem to be pursuing their case.they learned from a friend,an attorney,that they needed to take action against the county within a year of learning of the county misrepresentations.the friend gave them gray name,and they contacted her on june or.they told gray about the case,discussing the dates that they had learned about the molestations and the dates they learned about the county misrepresentations.gray agreed to take the case,telling them that they had a month in which to file claims against the county.and wrote to barrett that they would not be requiring any further assistance from him,asking him to forward his records on the matter to gray.
on july,gray filed claims against the county.the county rejected the claims for failing to file an application to file late claims.in september,gray filed an application to file late claims.gray then was elected to the bench,and transferred the case to an attorney who was representing other children and parents in actions against the moores.after this attorney filed suit against the county on plaintiffs behalf,the court granted summary judgment to the county on the basis that no application to file late claims had been filed.this court affirmed that judgment on appeal.
plaintiffs then instituted this action for legal malpractice against gray barrett,and the law firm of cantor,barrett wheeldin.barrett and his firm entered into good faith settlements with plaintiffs,each paying,for a collective payment of.the matter proceeded to trial against gray.a jury returned a special verdict,finding that as a result of the molestations,each child had suffered economic damages in the amount of and noneconomic damages in the amount of.the jury further found that phillip and donna moore were percent responsible for these damages and that the county was percent responsible for the damages.as to the legal malpractice claim,the jury apportioned negligence between and percent,barrett percent,and gray percent.the court thereafter entered judgment against gray in the amount of.
these appeals followed.
gray appeal 
of and claims 
actions against a public entity,such as the county,are governed by the california tort claims act,et.under the tort claims act,a plaintiff may not maintain an action for damages against a public entity unless a written claim first has been presented to the defendant and has been rejected.a claim based on a personal injury cause of action must be presented within six months of the date the cause of action accrued.after six months,a plaintiff may apply to the public entity for leave to present a late claim.the application must be presented within a reasonable time,not to exceed one year after the cause of action accrued.if the application is denied,the plaintiff may,within six months,petition the court for an order for relief from the procedures.christopher mojave unified school dist.th,d.the court,however,lacks jurisdiction to grant relief if the application to file a late claim was filed more than one year after the cause of action accrued.munoz state of california th,d.
plaintiffs position was and is that the cause of action against the county accrued on july,when and first learned that,contrary to the representations of the county,complaints had been filed against kidstop.the period for filing a claim without also filing an application to file a late claim,therefore,had expired by the time and hired gray on june.at that point,plaintiffs had to file an application to file late claims no later than july.although gray filed plaintiffs claims by that date,she did not file an application to file late claims,effectively precluding plaintiffs not only from obtaining relief through the claims procedures,but also from pursuing court action against the county.
gray position was and is that plaintiffs cause of action accrued not when they learned that the county misrepresentations were false,but on june,when they learned that at least one child had been molested.if gray is correct,the time for filing claims against the county expired before plaintiffs hired gray,and gray negligence,therefore,was not a cause of any harm to plaintiffs.
in general,a claim accrues upon the occurrence of the last element essential to the cause of action,even if the plaintiff is unaware of the cause of action.under the delayed discovery rule,however,the accrual date of a cause of action is delayed until the plaintiff is aware of his or her injury and its cause.the plaintiff is charged with this awareness as of the date he or she suspects or should suspect that the injury was caused by someone wrongful act.the period of limitations,therefore,will begin to run when the plaintiff has a suspicion of wrongdoing in other words,when he or she has notice of information of circumstances to put a reasonable person on inquiry.jolly eli lilly cal d.
code of civil procedure section,subdivision d,effectively codifies the delayed discovery rule in connection with actions for fraud,providing that a cause of action for fraud is not to be deemed to have accrued until the discovery,by the aggrieved party,of the facts constituting the fraud or mistake.in a case such as this,that date is the date the complaining party learns,or at least is put on notice,that a representation was false.in magpali farmers group,th,d,for example,the plaintiff allegedly was induced to leave his former employment by the representation that the defendant employer followed a nondiscrimination policy.the court held that the crucial event for accrual purposes was the date on which the plaintiff first learned that the employer actually followed a discriminatory policy,the date the plaintiff learned that the representation was false.id.at,d.in snow robins d,similarly,the court ruled that a cause of action for misrepresentations about a defective intrauterine contraceptive device accrued not when the plaintiff became pregnant,but when she learned that the manufacturer had misrepresented the effectiveness of the device.here,for purposes of plaintiffs claims of misrepresentation,the relevant date was july,when and learned that the county had falsely represented that it had received no complaints about kidstop.
gray cites soliman philip morris cir.the plaintiff in soliman suffered injuries resulting from use of tobacco.he contended that his cause of action for products liability was delayed until he first learned that the manufacturers had concealed the health hazards of smoking.the ninth circuit court of appeals rejected that claim,finding the injury itself provided reason for the plaintiff to suspect that the manufacturers had done something wrong.as noted by the court,o nce a plaintiff is aware that he has been injured by a product,he has enough information to commence a products liability action based on that injury.id.at,quoting arnold reynolds tobacco.at the most,soliman stands for the proposition that a person who suffers harm from a product is thereby put on notice that an earlier representation that the product will cause no harm was false.soliman has no application here,where the county never represented that moore would do no harm.
gray,citing miller lakeside village condominium th,d,points out that if a statute of limitations bars an action based upon harm immediately caused by a defendant wrongdoing,a separate cause of action based on a subsequent harm arising from that wrongdoing normally is barred.the rule stated in miller presumes that the plaintiff is seeking damages for separate injuries resulting from a single defendant wrong it has no application here,where there is one injury but separate claims,based on separate theories,against separate tortfeasors.
gray emphasizes that plaintiffs would not have had a cause of action against the county if they had suffered no injury.although gray is correct,it does not alter the fact that plaintiffs claims against the county were based on the county misrepresentation,and therefore did not accrue until plaintiffs were on notice that the county had made a misrepresentation.
jury instructions 
gray contends the jury improperly was instructed that a claim for negligent misrepresentation accrues on the date the plaintiff discovers the facts constituting a misrepresentation,or has or should have a suspicion that a misrepresentation has been made or has other knowledge that would put a reasonable person on inquiry.this contention is based on gray argument,discussed above,that plaintiffs claims for misrepresentation accrued on the date they learned of the molestations.we rejected that argument,and we reject this argument for the same reasons.
failure to construe late claims as petition to file late claims 
gray contends the county should have accepted the claims,filed on july,as petitions to file late claims.whether the county did or did not act properly was litigated in the earlier action,which long since has become final.since this contention had no place in the trial of this case and was not litigated in this case,it provides no grounds for reversing this judgment.
effect of prior settlement 
the jury found that each of the children suffered economic damages in the amount of and noneconomic damages in the amount of,for a total amount of economic damages of and noneconomic damages of.the jury also found that the moores were percent responsible and the county percent responsible for these damages.under civil code section,which distinguishes between economic and noneconomic damages in actions for personal injury,the county was jointly and severally liable for,representing all of plaintiffs economic damages,and severally liable for,representing percent of plaintiffs noneconomic damages the legal malpractice of gray and barrett,therefore,caused plaintiffs to lose claims valued at.the jury found that gray was percent responsible for the malpractice damages.the jury found that barrett and his firm were percent responsible and and themselves were percent responsible for those damages.barrett and his firm settled for.the trial court found that gray was entitled to a credit for a portion of this amount,calculating her liability in the following manner 
gray contends that the court erred in concluding that plaintiffs suffered any economic damages.according to gray,the court should have determined that the full amount of gray liability was percent of the total award,or,and then,pursuant to code of civil procedure section should have offset that sum by the paid by barrett and his firm.plaintiffs counter that under civil code section and espinoza machonga th,d,a nonsettling defendant is not entitled to offset that portion of another defendant settlement attributable to noneconomic damages.according to plaintiffs,therefore,the court should have offset barrett portion of the economic damages only against the economic damages owed by gray,a procedure,according to plaintiffs calculations,that would have left gray responsible for 
we find that neither of the theories for calculating damages asserted by the parties,nor the theory of damages adopted by the trial court,is correct.in the present action for legal malpractice,plaintiffs seek damages representing the recovery they would have had from the county but for the negligence of their attorneys.civil code section,which by its terms applies only to actions for personal injury,property damage or wrongful death,would have applied to any action by plaintiffs for personal injury against the county.under that section,the county would be jointly liable for plaintiffs economic damages,but only severally liable for their noneconomic damages.that the damages in the underlying personal injury action,however,could be characterized as economic or noneconomic,or that this characterization limited the extent of the county liability to plaintiffs,is of no import.here,although plaintiffs claims against the county were for personal injury,their suit against their attorneys was for attorney malpractice.such an action is not one for personal injury,property damage or wrongful death.it is an action for the value of the claim lost as a result of the failure to press a meritorious claim.smith lewis cal d,overruled on another point in in re marriage of brown cal d,fn.civil code section,therefore,does not apply 
gray is responsible for the full amount of plaintiffs loss,less the amount attributable to and negligence.under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,however,she is entitled to offset that amount by the sum paid by the settling defendants.the jury found that plaintiffs damages were,and that and were responsible for percent of that amount,or.the defendants,therefore,were jointly responsible for barrett and his firm then entered into good faith settlements,under which they paid.under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,gray is entitled to a credit for the full paid under the settlements.the damages award against gray,therefore,should have been only.
and appeal 
plaintiffs contend the evidence fails to support the findings that barrett was percent at fault for their damages and that and were percent at fault for those damages.plaintiffs argue that barrett failure to pursue their claims caused no harm to them because gray had a month to seek permission to file late claims after the case was transferred to her.they further argue that they can not be deemed to have been negligent in failing to pursue the claims themselves as they had hired attorneys to act on behalf of the children.
as discussed above in connection with gray argument concerning the proper apportionment of barrett settlement,once barrett and his firm entered into good faith settlements,their comparative fault in causing plaintiffs to lose their claims against the county became irrelevant.gray would be entitled to offset the settlement amounts irrespective of the percen
