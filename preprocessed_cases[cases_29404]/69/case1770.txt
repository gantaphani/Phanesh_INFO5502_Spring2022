background 
the parties tried the motion to quash on defendant moving papers.
defendant submitted the proof of service that plaintiff had filed with the trial court.it stated that a registered process server had served robert zara party in item,asian,male,years old,black hair,brown eyes,feet inches,pounds at rosewood ave san jose,ca.it further stated i served the party by personal service.i personally delivered the documents listed in item to the party or person authorized to receive service of process for the party on,at pm.and it noted that the notice to the person served on the summons was completed as follows as an individual defendant.
defendant submitted his own declaration that stated the following.i first noticed a summons and complaint in this action at my doorstep,upon returning to my home at or about on january.plaintiff proof of summons,filed in court,describes me as asian with black hair.i am not asian nor have i black hair nor are there any members of my household who fit that description,as was provided for me in plaintiff proof of service.i have lived alone as the sole member of my household for at least the last ten years.there are no other competant sic members of my household who could have competantly sic received the complaint and summons for this action.
defendant urged that it will be obvious that defendant is not asian and has mostly graying hair,although colored light brown for the last years,to disguise the gray.
plaintiff argued that the service of process statutes are to be liberally construed and defendant acknowledged actual notice of the service of the lawsuit in his declaration.it concluded since the purpose of the service statutes is to assure that due process is satisfied,and since in this case,the defendant had actual knowledge of the service,and since the provisions of the service statutes are to be liberally construed to effect service and uphold jurisdiction if actual notice has been received by the defendant,this service should be upheld as valid.
at the hearing,defendant argued as follows and the only point i am making is that liberally construed can only go so far before it becomes well,it at least must have an attempt to identify the person and an attempt to physically hand the summons to someone.neither of those were done.and the service was left there for over hours.and if liberally construed can be stretched that far,then it would effectively render the entire meaning of section vacant and it would invite servers to fraudulently submit to the court proof of summons which is possibly what happened in my case.
the trial court agreed with plaintiff service rules are to be liberally construed to effect service and uphold jurisdiction when actual notice has been received by the defendant.citation.here,defendant actually received a copy of the summons and complaint in this case as a result of the service.
discussion 
the parties reiterate their arguments on appeal.
the code of civil procedure specifies the various methods by which service may be made upon defendants who are sued as individuals.
the method described as personal service means service that is accomplished by personal delivery of a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the person to be served.if the complaint and summons were personally delivered to,handed to,defendant then he could be said to have been personally served.
a defendant may also be personally served by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to an agent authorized to accept service on behalf of that defendant.see weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group to,to,hereafter weil brown,civil procedure before trial.an authorized agent might include,for example,an attorney who has been expressly authorized to accept service,or a sheriff or jailer having custody of a prisoner.weil brown,civil procedure before trial,supra,to.
another alternative available for serving individual defendants is what is commonly known as substitute service.substitute service on an individual is accomplished by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the person dwelling house,usual place of abode,usual place of business,or usual mailing address other than a united states postal service post office box,in the presence of a competent member of the household or a person apparently in charge of his or her office,place of business,or usual mailing address,at least years of age,who shall be informed of the contents thereof,and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and of the complaint by mail,postage prepaid to the person to be served at the place where a copy of the summons and complaint were left,subd.b.
however,an individual may be served by substitute service only after a good faith effort at personal service has first been made the burden is on the plaintiff to show that the summons and complaint can not with reasonable diligence be personally delivered to the individual defendant,subd.b evartt superior court d.two or three attempts to personally serve a defendant at a proper place ordinarily qualifies as reasonable diligence.weil brown,civil procedure before trial,supra.
as is apparent from the facts,the issue in this case centers upon personal service,not substitute service.
according to section,subdivision b,proof of service made pursuant to section may be made by affidavit of the person making the service showing the time,place,and manner of service and the facts showing that the service was made in accordance with the applicable statutory provisions.the affidavit shall recite or in other manner show the name of the person to whom the papers served were delivered and,if appropriate,the title of the person or the capacity in which the person was served.evidence code section provides that a registered process server declaration of services establishes a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence of the facts stated in the declaration.see also floveyor,superior court th,filing of proof of service that complies with the applicable statutory requirements creates a rebuttable p
