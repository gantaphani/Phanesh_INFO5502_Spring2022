when the defendant,larry norwood,was arrested on april,state and federal law enforcement officers took a number of items of personal property from his possession and made a list of them.the list included a rolex watch,a bracelet,rings,and lighters.the government does not argue that the items were related to his drug offense.at the same time,the officers seized the truck he was driving,and the next day they delivered both the truck,and two bags described as containing personal property of his,to a trucking company for safekeeping.but the contents of the bags were not itemized in the delivery document.
when norwood later asked the company to return his personal property,he was met with a denial that the company had any of it.this was in the midst of the criminal proceeding against him he had been indicted in may,the month following his arrest,and he complained about his missing property to the district judge in a letter the judge received on december.the judge sent copies of the letter to norwood criminal lawyer,directing him to determine what steps should be taken to address norwood concerns about his property.it unclear what if anything the lawyer did in response to this direction he never submitted anything to the court.
on may,shortly after pleading guilty but before being sentenced,norwood moved the district court to order the government to return his missing property.rule g of the federal rules of criminal procedure authorizes the judge presiding in a criminal case to order the government to return property of the defendant that is in its possession if it has no reason to continue holding the property.the rule g proceeding may be maintained as an ancillary proceeding in the district court even after the criminal proceeding ends.okoro callaghan,cir,and cases cited there see also united states white,cir.the government filed a written response to norwood motion two weeks later,stating that it had inquired of the drug enforcement administration and the illinois state police and neither agency had norwood property.
at a hearing on july,the judge authorized norwood to proceed pro se for the remainder of his case though he had yet been sentenced,and discharged his lawyer.the judge also directed the government to inquire further into the whereabouts of norwood property.at his sentencing hearing,on august,the government reported that its further investigation suggested that the trucking company might have the property.the judge told norwood she could help him recover it if it was no longer in the government possession.she suggested he sue the state police in the illinois court of claims.
on november,while his appeal later dismissed from the criminal judgment was pending,norwood filed a motion in the district court seeking restitution by the government of the value of the missing property,which he claimed to be.the district judge denied the motion on may,on the ground that rule g does not authorize monetary relief.that is the order from which the present appeal has been taken.she was right about that,okoro callaghan,supra,at adeleke united states,cir united states hall,cir.the rule does mention monetary relief and it would be odd for a court in a criminal proceeding to be authorized to award damages to the defendant as a remedy for an irregularity committed by law enforcement to award damages against the government,in the teeth of the long line of cases which hold that waivers of federal sovereign immunity are not to be lightly presumed,mcmahon united states,though it is unclear why this should be so the supreme court has given no rationale for the creation of this rule.charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,ed see also united states nordic village,d dissenting opinion.
norwood motion for restitution did not mention,and in fact was unrelated to,rule g,as it sought monetary relief rather than the return,no longer possible,of his property by the government.the motion did not indicate a ground for the relief sought.the government responded on november,arguing that the court could award damages in a criminal case and,even if it could,norwood had no claim under the federal tort claims act.he replied on may,that he had a good claim under both the tort claims act and the tucker act.but he muddied the waters by arguing that the court jurisdiction over his rule g motion had not ended when the criminal proceeding had was true,but irrelevant,because he was no longer seeking the return of the property.the next day the district judge denied the motion for restitution on the ground that the court could not award damages in a criminal case.she did not mention norwood tort claims act or tucker act arguments.he renews them in this court.
the tort claims act authorizes suits against the united states for damages for loss of property caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment.b.there is an exception,however,for the detention of any property by any law enforcement officer.u.c see kosak united states,d.there are exceptions to the exception,c,but they are not germane to this case.and property seized by law enforcement officers and transferred to a third party is deemed still detained by the officers.parrott united states,cir hatten white,cir schlaebitz of justice,cir per curiam.so norwood claim under the tort claims act is for the further reason that the act requires exhaustion of administrative remedies,a osborn haley,d palay united states,cir,which,as far as we able to determine,norwood has not attempted.
the provision of the tucker act that he invokes authorizes federal district courts to entertain claims against the united states for up to that are founded on the constitution or a federal statute or regulation.a.apparently wishing to steer well clear of the statutory ceiling on the amount in controversy,norwood is asking for less than.if his claim exceeded,he would have to proceed in the court of federal claims.a see,talley dep t of agriculture,cir.
norwood claims to have been deprived of his property without due process of law.but the supreme court has held that the tucker act is not a general waiver of sovereign immunity,as it might appear to be the plaintiff must be able to point to a constitutional,statutory,or regulatory provision that can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation.united states mitchell,d quoting earlier cases see also united states testan,d willis united states,cir blueport united states.the standard example is the fifth amendment takings clause,which in so many words requires the government to award just compensation when it takes private property for a public use.see,preseault icc,d rose acre farms,madigan,cir.by virtue of the express constitutional command for payment of just compensation,takings claims under the fifth amendment have become one of the classic categories of cases under the tucker act.gregory sisk,litigation with the federal government c,ed.
some cases hold that a tucker act suit ca be based on a violation of the due process clause because that clause,unlike the takings clause,does say that victims of such violations must be compensated.martinez bureau of prisons,per curiam rothe development dep t of defense,cir.these cases produce a curious remedial asymmetry between the two clauses.the only reason the cases give for the,as we noted,it a conclusion rather than a that waivers of federal sovereign immunity are interpreted narrowly.duarte united states,cir.but we need to explain why we called the remedial asymmetry curious.
the takings clause allows more precisely,does not forbid the government to take people property for a public use,provided that the government pays just compensation,defined as fair market value.united states miller.shaikh city of chicago,cir.so defined,just compensation is less than full compensation what is called common law compensation.full compensation will often exceed fair market people would not sell their home for its fair market value,if only because of moving expenses.but while acknowledging that fair market value is not always full compensation,the supreme court in kimball laundry united states,blunted the point by saying that the shortfall is properly treated as part of the burden of common citizenship which again is a conclusion rather than a in a more practical vein remarked the difficulty of determining nonmarket values by the methods of litigation.id.at.
the fact that just compensation tends systematically to undercompensate the owners of property taken by eminent domain underscores the fact that such a taking is not a wrongful act.t he takings clause does not forbid takings it requires compensation for takings.rose acre farms,madigan,supra,at.just as buying a toaster is not a wrongful act but failing to pay for it is.in contrast,the due process clause absolutely forbids a deprivation of property without due process of law.such a deprivation is a wrongful act.that is why it is forbidden rather than merely priced.it seems perverse that the government should be able to flout due a person of his property with impunity at least if the deprivation is by law enforcement officers and without paying any compensation,by hiding,selling,or destroying because the natural recourse against the government for such suit for restitution or for not expressly authorized in the constitution,a statute,or a regulation.even the takings clause does not expressly authorize a suit for just compensation,yet it has been held to authorize such suits nonetheless.
but some of our cases,contrary to the martinez and rothe cases that we cited earlier,suggest that in the case of a governmental taking that is not for a public use,the property owner may be able to obtain full common law even under the takings clause,as suggested in lucien johnson,cir schroeder city of chicago,cir,and coniston village of hoffman estates,cir,viewed as an absolute bar to such a taking.and neither the federal tort claims act nor the tucker act exhausts norwood potential but we stress potential remedies.one possibility might be a claim against the federal officers who seized his property,rather than against the government six unknown named agents of federal bureau of narcotics,d,allowed such a suit as a remedy for an unconstitutional against the state officers under.but washington davis,d,holds that only intentional conduct violates the constitution,see also daniels williams,d personnel administrator of massachusetts feeney,d,and if that limitation is applicable is,if the officers accidentally even if negligently lost,rather than stole or wantonly destroyed,norwood bars a bivens claim,see polanco dea,cir see also denson united states,cir,as well as a claim against the state officers under.and a takings claim as well,since accidental injuries are not takings.lucien johnson,supra,at.
how a bivens claim would fare in this case can not yet be determined the record does not reveal what role the arresting officers or other officers who may have been involved played in the loss of norwood property.it is unclear whether they stole it,or lost it,or indeed just deposited it with the trucking company for safekeeping.if they lost it accidentally,or deposited it with the trucking company,there would be no denial of due process.norwood opening brief states that the government has lost his personal property which might seem to scotch any claim of deliberate wrongdoing.but actually the statement is ambiguous.it could just mean that the government lost norwood property because its agents had stolen it one of his filings in the district court states that the property was lost or stolen by governmental officials emphasis added.we do not yet know which.
a bivens suit may fail,regardless of the nature of the wrongdoing,because of the exclusion with irrelevant exceptions from the federal tort claims act of government liability for a property loss caused by law enforcement officers.the supreme court has become extremely chary of recognizing a bivens claim where either there is an adequate alternative remedy,or,though there is not and there is not under the federal tort claims act,as we have seen,recognition of such a right of action would disrupt a federal program or have other untoward consequence.see,wilkie robbins,d correctional services malesko,d schweiker chilicky,d,and other cases cited in arar ashcroft,cir en banc.in fact the court has not recognized such a right in a new class of cases since carlson green,d,thirty years ago.
the supreme court reluctance to recognize new bivens claims is related to its general retreat which began in cort ash,d,just a few years after bivens from recognizing implied rights of action.bivens had implied a right to sue for damages under the fourth amendment,which does mention any such right.allowing damages suits to be brought against federal law enforcement officers accused of having improperly disposed of a criminal suspect property might be thought an end run around the statutory exclusion of such claims when filed against the government itself.and we see that there may be alternative remedies to a bivens claim in a case such as this.
the supreme court in the malesko case did suggest that the recognition of a right to sue under bivens might be appropriate to provide an otherwise nonexistent cause of action against individual officers alleged to have acted unconstitutionally.correctional services malesko,supra,at emphasis in original.so maybe there is a ray of hope for norwood to succeed on a bivens claim.but the ray dims when we note that a authorizes the attorney general of the united states to settle,for not more than in any one case,a claim for personal injury,death,or damage to,or loss of,privately owned property,caused by an investigative or law enforcement officer employed by the department of justice acting within the scope of employment this fits norwood case to a t.but unfortunately for him a claim may be allowed only if it is presented to the attorney general within one year after it accrues,and the time is now up for his claim would have accrued no later than august,when,at his sentencing hearing,the government informed the court and him that it did have his property.his claim may have accrued even earlier,on may,when he first moved for the return of his property for the basis of the motion presumably was a belief that the property was being wrongfully withheld from him.
we note the absence of judicial review of the attorney general decision on whether or on what terms to settle a claim section b provides that a claim may be paid under this section only if the claimant accepts the amount of the settlement in complete satisfaction of the claim against the government.in other words,victims of torts by federal law enforcement agents are remitted to an administrative remedy that is final.k oriakhi united states,wl,at.if that remedy is adequate despite the absence of judicial review,this would probably scotch any bivens remedy.
a final obstacle to all of norwood potential remedies,but not necessarily an insuperable one under the peculiar circumstances of this case,is that a motion in a criminal case is not a proper method of commencing a civil suit.he was proceeding pro se,and when a district court conducting a rule e now g proceeding learns that the government no longer possesses property that is the subject of the motion to return,the court should grant the movant particularly a movant proceeding pro se an opportunity to assert an alternative claim for money damages.united states hall,supra,at.a pro se rule g motion should be liberally construed to allow the assertion of alternative claims.united states albinson,cir see also peña united states,cir jackson united states,cir.
norwood asked for monetary relief in a separate motion after his rule g motion was denied.he would have to pay a filing fee in order to convert the motion into a proper civil suit,united states howell,cir and if he wanted to make a bivens claim he would have to join the officers in their individual capacities as defendants and serve them.but the hall,albinson,and peña decisions that we cited would and jackson might permit such a conversion when the movant was pro se and we are not aware of any contrary authority.
this is not to say,and
