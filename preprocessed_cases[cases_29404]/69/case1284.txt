this is a punitive damages case involving nominal compensatory damages brought by a corporation for racial discrimination.
this case went to trial before a jury,so we state the facts and interpret the evidence most favorably to the party that was successful at trial 
the facts are well laid out in the published decision of the district court in an olympic pipeline company petroleum pipeline ruptured,interfering with the transportation of fuel from refineries in northwest washington to a distribution center in seattle.it took two years to fix the pipeline.during that period arco hired a number of companies to truck fuel from its blaine,washington refinery to the distribution center.
paul,gary,and deep bains are american citizens who were born in the punjab region of india.the bains brothers bought a gas station and convenience store in okanogan,washington.they were the first sikh family in the area.they did business under the name flying b,signifying that the bains brothers were flying high in the american business world.flying b soon owned five gas stations and employed thirty people.the brothers bought a tanker truck for about and got the necessary permits to haul gasoline to their stations.that investment put the bains brothers in an excellent position to make some money when the olympic pipeline ruptured and arco needed help.in march they signed a contract with arco to haul fuel.by then flying b was doing business as a corporation,the stock of which was owned solely by the three bains brothers.
in june,flying b started hauling fuel for arco,and in august,after getting the necessary permits and safety clearances from arco,the company bought three more trucks and hired more drivers,although the bains brothers themselves continued to drive trucks as well.but after four and a half months,about loads or million gallons of gasoline,and miles,flying b work ended on october,when arco terminated it.
during the period that flying b transported fuel for arco,the bains brothers and their drivers had to endure a considerable measure of abuse from bill davis,the lead man at arco seattle terminal where the drivers dropped off their fuel.davis did not like the flying b drivers and purposely made their unloading work at the seattle terminal difficult.he made a point of delaying the flying b drivers by ignoring their presence when they needed their papers signed after a delivery.because arco paid by the load about for each load,the delays meant that flying b drivers could haul fewer loads and make less money.davis made them stand out in the rain while other drivers were allowed to stay in their trucks or seek shelter.davis also falsely accused flying b drivers of various safety violations and made them clean up spills left by other drivers instead of making those responsible clean up their own spills.
davis rudeness by inference arose ethnic animus against sikhs.paul and deep bains,and many of the other flying b drivers,were religiously observant sikhs who wore turbans and long beards.davis started his relationship with paul bains by refusing to shake his hand.he called paul a diaperhead to his face despite paul protest that his turban was an important religious symbol.bains or paul were apparently too hard for davis to preferred raghead.one of flying b hired drivers said davis commonly called him stupid indian,motherfucking indian,and similar sobriquets,and when he asked for a rag after davis had told him to clean up a spill,davis refused and told him to take the fucking rag from your head and clean it.
after months of davis abuse,the morale of flying b drivers suffered and drivers threatened to quit.even the flying b drivers felt degraded by davis attitude toward their association with their company.davis asked both patrick dauer and morgan,the only two caucasian flying b drivers,how did you get hooked up with these fuckers 
eventually the bains brothers decided to report davis abuse to al lawrence,the manager of the seattle terminal and davis boss.the brothers decided that deep would talk to lawrence.deep told lawrence all about davis behavior,such as the names that davis had called them diaperhead,stupid fucking indian,raghead,and towelhead as well as how davis had told them to go back to india,and how he made the flying b drivers use slower pumps and stand outside in the rain.deep told lawrence that the flying b drivers were threatening to quit because of the hostile atmosphere.lawrence responded that perhaps davis was upset about something and asked deep to let him know if anything happened in the future.
but the problems continued and davis kept up his abuse.the flying b drivers were subjected to lengthy security checks when other drivers were not.deep complained to lawrence again,but it did not do any good.davis continued his ethnic abuse,and the security delays reserved exclusively for flying b drivers continued.gary bains went to lawrence and advised him yet again of the continuing abuse.but instead of stopping davis abuse,lawrence and arco stopped flying arco terminated flying b without giving a reason and without notice,not even the minimum notice required by their contract.flying b was forced to lay off a number of employees and to sell their now superfluous trucks.deep bains contacted tim reichert,the los angeles central dispatch manager,who was above lawrence in the arco hierarchy,to contest the termination,but to no effect.reichert claimed that there were too many trucks for the job.after this litigation had begun,arco claimed that flying b had committed various safety violations,including driving unsafe trucks,drivers smoking or using cell phones while delivering fuel,and drivers failing to clean up spills.
an important part of the case was whether the ethnic nastiness and coarse language was only davis independent foray into obnoxiousness,or whether arco,through davis supervisor,al lawrence,ought to have known about davis behavior and done something about it.the parties also disputed whether arco termination of flying b had anything to do with the racism.in addition to the bains testimony that they had complained to lawrence,a driver for another company,torrance holmes,testified that once he started chatting with the bains brothers,lawrence quit talking to him.holmes also testified that he heard davis brag that we kicked those ragheads out of here and they never coming back.
in his own testimony,bill davis admitted that he had used the term raghead once in a while when referring to the bains brothers in conversations with coworkers,typically when other people complained about flying b drivers.davis had admitted during discovery that he had used the term raghead with his boss al lawrence,but later clarified that this was when lawrence had asked him whether he had called the flying b drivers ragheads,and davis responded that he had not.thus,the gist of davis testimony was that he called the flying b drivers ragheads only behind their backs,not to their faces.lawrence never disciplined or reprimanded davis,but davis claimed that he quit using the term after his chat with lawrence.davis said he knew about arco policy that prohibited racial discrimination and discriminatory language.of course the jury may have disbelieved any or all of arco exonerating testimony.
an economist testified that flying b suffered a loss on account of the termination.he calculated this based solely on the profits the company would have made from november,when flying b was terminated,to june,when the pipeline was fixed and arco no longer needed drivers to move the fuel.
tim reichert,the manager above lawrence who had the authority to terminate flying b and did so,testified that he knew nothing about the ethnicity of flying b owners or drivers.reichert said that his motivations for terminating the contract were al lawrence assertions that flying b had a large number of safety violations,and his own concern that there were too many carriers transporting fuel to the terminal.
al lawrence testified that bill davis had advised him of numerous infractions by flying b,such as not using buckets to catch spills,leaving valves open,using cell phones while pumping,and lining up trucks improperly so as to inconvenience other drivers.almost all the complaints he heard about involved flying b,even though they were the smallest carrier arco used.lawrence said that he suspended flying b exclusively because of safety violations,and that race was never a factor.but lawrence conceded he had not documented any of these safety concerns when they occurred.lawrence had final authority over safety issues at the seattle terminal and made the decision to lock flying b out of the terminal facility,while tim reichert had final authority and made the decision to terminate the contract.
the jury delivered a special verdict.it found that arco had breached flying b contract,a state law claim,and awarded in compensatory damages for the breach.the verdict also established that arco had discriminated against flying b on account of race,in violation of,but that the actual damages to the corporation on account of this discrimination were nominal.the jury therefore awarded only one dollar in compensatory damages on the claim.in addition,however,the jury awarded five million dollars in punitive damages for the racial discrimination.arco moved for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial,or alternatively,to set aside or remit the punitive damages.the district court denied the motions.the district court awarded in attorneys fees and in costs,plus in additional fees and in additional costs,based on the proceedings.arco appeals.
judgment as a matter of law or new trial on 
arco argues that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law,or alternatively,a new trial,because a corporation can not suffer racial discrimination actionable under and because even if that is incorrect,the award of only nominal damages establishes that firing flying b was not motivated by race discrimination.
corporate plaintiff 
arco argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because,to establish a claim,a plaintiff must establish that it is a member of a racial group,and flying b can not meet this requirement because a corporation has no racial identity.we review a denial of a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo 
contrary to arco interpretation of,our decisions hold that a corporation has standing to bring a claim against a defendant that employs the corporation as a contractor,but imposes ethnic discrimination against the corporation employees.in parks school of business,we held that a school,which was organized as a corporation and mostly enrolled minority students,had standing to bring a claim because racial discrimination against its students would damage the corporation business by interfering with its right to contract with minority students.we went even further in thinket ink information resources,sun microsystems,where thinket,a corporation owned entirely by african americans,alleged that sun microsystems had deliberately refused to contract with thinket based solely on its status as an business we found that when a corporation has acquired an imputed racial identity,it can be the direct target of discrimination and has standing to pursue a claim under here,as in thinket,the corporation is owned entirely by sikh shareholders,and while not all of its drivers were sikhs,even the drivers testified that they were treated poorly by davis based on their association with what davis saw as a sikh company.flying b undoubtedly acquired an imputed racial identity,and its allegation that its contract with arco was terminated due to the effects of racial discrimination clearly gives it standing to pursue a claim against arco.
economic injury 
arco argues that the jury one dollar in nominal damages for the that the ethnic discrimination caused no economic harm as opposed to the breach of contract,for which was awarded,and that there can be no injury to a corporation without economic damages.arco moved for a new trial,which the district court denied.we review the district court denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion because we are reviewing a case that resulted in a jury verdict,we interpret the evidence,and state our account,most favorably to the parties successful at trial 
first,the district court instructed the jury that,because the plaintiff was a corporation,the jury could award damages,even nominal damages,only for harm to the corporation,not for the emotional distress to its owners or employees.we must presume that the jury followed that instruction 
second,the one dollar in nominal damages for the violation was not the whole of the jury verdict.the jury also found that arco had in fact discriminated against flying b because of race,that it caused a loss by breaking its contract with flying b,and that arco deserved to be punished for its racial discrimination to the extent of million.these verdicts could be viewed as inconsistent,but,as we held in white ford motor,a court has a duty under the seventh amendment to harmonize a jury seemingly inconsistent answers if a fair reading allows for it the district court was therefore obligated to ask not whether the verdict necessarily makes sense under any reading,but whether it can be read in light of the evidence to make sense.
we agree with the district court that the verdict is not inconsistent and does not establish the absence of economic harm.the district court correctly held that the jury may have found that flying b claimed damages for lost profits were not shown with reasonable certainty as required by jury instruction number.on the evidence in this record,the jury could well have concluded that racial discrimination had caused lost profits by delaying flying b drivers and thereby reducing the number of loads flying b hauled but the jury did not have testimony that would enable it to put a number on how many loads were lost so even though lost profits were proved,the amount of lost profits could not be established with reasonable certainty,as the jury instruction required.
the damages to flying b,as a predicate for punitive damages,do not have to be from the termination.section extends its prohibition against racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts to cover all phases and incidents of the contractual relationship,not just the termination of a contract the testimony established that arco employees made flying b drivers wait longer to fill their trucks and to use slower pumps than other drivers,and that flying b drivers suffered damaged morale.the jury could have concluded that flying b suffered economic harm during the contractual relationship from the intentional delays and its drivers damaged morale,which resulted in a reduced number of therefore less money under a contract that paid by the that all of this was caused by davis racial harassment.flying b economics expert testified that flying b would have made if it had continued to haul the same number of loads it did until the broken pipeline was fixed,but he did not offer testimony on how much money flying b lost because of the slowdowns caused by davis racial harassment.the jury could reasonably have concluded that flying b had made less money while it was hauling because of davis racial harassment,yet reasonably have found no number that it could attach to the harm,and therefore awarded nominal damages.
flying b was terminated by a manager who did not know that the company principals and most of its drivers were sikhs,so the jury could have found that the breach of contract damages compensated for the harm from the contract termination.but the jury could have concluded from the evidence that,had reichert not terminated flying b for safety violations,davis and lawrence would have found a way to terminate flying b anyway.the jury could have found that routine or debatable safety violations were flagged for reichert because of davis racial animus,whereas the same violations committed by a company would be ignored.possibly the jury found that under the contract flying b was entitled to notice,that arco immediate termination of the contract without notice cost flying b around in damages,and that putting the same under both the and the breach of contract causes of action would be double counting.the jury might therefore have put the damages under the breach of contract claim,but signified its agreement with flying b on the claim with its affirmative verdict on that claim.
the district court,having heard all the evidence,was able to reconcile the verdicts,and on our review of the evidence and arguments,we find no irreconcilable conflict 
pure motive 
arco argues that because tim reichert terminated flying b for reasons that the verdict establishes were nondiscriminatory,there can be no liability.that argument necessarily fails for the reasons explained above.even if reichert terminated flying b for reasons,that does not mean that arco,through davis and lawrence,did not nonetheless cause economic harm to flying b for racial reasons.
arco also makes a mixed motive argument,that if it can be shown that arco would have done what it did without the racial animus,then there can be no remedy.
we need not resolve this argument because the jury verdict establishes that arco did harm flying b for racial reasons by mistreating and delaying its drivers,and that arco deserved to be punished for it,regardless of whether the termination of the contract was for the safety reasons urged by arco.the verdict does not establish that arco would have terminated flying b had there been no racial animus.
an award of nominal damages does not mean that there were not actual economic damages,just that the exact amount of damages attributable to the improper conduct was not proven the court instructed the jury to award nominal damages if it found that arco had harmed flying b in violation of,but that flying b failed to prove damages as defined in these instructions.and that is exactly what the jury did.
jury instructions 
in jury instruction number,the court instructed the jury that it should find in favor of arco if it found that arco had proven that it would have made the decision to terminate the contract even if the race of the flying b owners and employees had played no role.arco argues that the instruction erroneously allowed the jury to find for flying b even if it concluded that flying b would have been terminated without any ethnic discrimination.arco objects to the sentence in the instruction that states this defense does not apply to any other forms of adverse treatment in the contractual relationship.as we explained above,however,the sentence was a correct statement of law.even if arco terminated flying b entirely for good,legitimate reasons,with no mixed motives at all,it would not have a defense to the entirety of flying b claim,if,for racially discriminatory reasons,arco imposed delays slow pumps,extra security checks,on flying b that reduced the amount of profits it could earn.there can,of course,be no legitimate reason for disparate treatment that imposes costly delays on account of the race of flying b owners and drivers.a claim lies on behalf of a corporation that is harmed economically in the performance of its contract because of race,even if neither the hiring nor the firing of the corporation was affected by race.
ii.managerial misconduct and liability 
arco argues that all the racial harassment of flying b people was done by bill davis,and that since davis was not a managerial employee arco portrays davis as a mere gas station attendant,the jury can not award punitive damages against arco as the corporation that employed davis.
arco correctly argues that it is not enough for an award of punitive damages to show that an arco employee acted maliciously to deprive flying b of its constitutional rights on account of ethnicity.kolstad american dental establishes,in the context of title vii punitive damages,that an employee conduct must be imputed to his employer to give rise to punitive damages liability agency principles limit vicarious liability for punitive damages awards under swinton potomac an employer has a good faith defense to vicarious liability for discrimination if it undertakes appropriate steps to prevent and correct discriminatory conduct by its employees.if the harasser is a supervisor,the employer may be held vicariously liable,but if the harasser is a coworker,the plaintiff must prove that the employer knew or should have known of the harassment and did not take adequate steps to correct it arco offers no reason why kolstad and swinton should not be applied in the context of a corporation that discriminates on account of ethnicity against another corporation that it hires as an independent contractor,and our decision to apply this body of law to liability in and other would foreclose such an argument.agency principles limit vicarious liability in claims as in title vii claims.
arco does not challenge the instructions that the district court gave on vicarious liability,just the sufficiency of the evidence to establish it.we review arco challenge to the sufficiency of evidence supporting the punitive damages award under the substantial evidence standard the test is whether the evidence,construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,permits only one reasonable conclusion,and that conclusion is contrary to that of the jury.
the district court reviewed the evidence with care,and concluded,correctly,that the jury could find that davis was not a mere gas station attendant,but a supervisor.while arco claims that davis had no managerial responsibilities,the evidence demonstrated that davis had direct control over the daily fuel hauling operation and fuel carriers.moreover,immediately after the termination of the contract,davis himself took credit for getting flying b terminated,bragging to b drivers about his part in kick ing those ragheads out of the facility 
even were davis not a supervisor,there can be no question under the evidence that lawrence was.lawrence was arco official in charge of the seattle terminal and,as tim reichert testified,lawrence had full authority over safety issues at the terminal,including the power to lock flying b out of the facility.the jury could conclude that when flying b first complained to lawrence about davis racial harassment,lawrence simply made excuses for davis behavior and did nothing about it.and when flying b repeated its complaints several times,lawrence did nothing to restrain davis,but instead terminated flying b without even the notice required by the contract.
davis testified that lawrence was present on occasions when he called the flying b drivers ragheads.the jury did not have to conclude,as arco urges,that lawrence locked out flying b only for safety violations.the jury could conclude,to the contrary,that lawrence perceived a conflict between flying b and davis harassment and intentional delays of those he called ragheads and that lawrence chose to back up davis.that suffices for corporate liability.if a company official with sufficient authority to subject the company to vicarious liability a racist employee conduct instead of protecting the victim from the employee,then the company is liable,even if the supervisor motivation is,such as loyalty to his subordinate or a desire to avoid conflict within the company.a written antidiscrimination policy does not insulate a company from liability if it does not enforce the antidiscrimination policy and,by its actions,supports discrimination 
iii.amount of punitive damages 
arco argues that the million in punitive damages awarded by the jury was excessive in light of bmw of north america,and in re exxon valdez we review the excessiveness of punitive damages de novo the guideposts we follow are the degree of reprehensibility,the disparity between the harm suffered and the punitive damages award,and the difference between this remedy and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases the gist of arco argument is that the harm to flying b was purely economic,and that the amount of punitive damages is too great relative to the amount of economic damages awarded.as to the amount of punitive damages,arco argument is partially correct.
state farm mutual automobile insurance enumerates the factors to be used when evaluating the reprehensibility of a defendant conduct.we look to whether the harm caus
