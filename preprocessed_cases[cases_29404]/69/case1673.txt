in a consolidated wrongful death action,one defendant settled with the decedent wife and his adult daughter for an unapportioned lump sum of million,and the two nonsettling defendants ultimately prevailed at trial.at a subsequent court proceeding,the wife and the daughter offered evidence pertaining to the allocation of the settlement proceeds.based on testimony from third party witnesses claiming the decedent was unhappy in his marriage and intended to get a divorce,the trial court found the marriage was on the verge of ending,even though there was no evidence the decedent had actually separated from his wife or filed for a legal separation or a marital dissolution.the court then allocated percent of the settlement proceeds to the decedent daughter and percent to the wife.we granted the wife petition for review,which challenged the trial court judgment and the court of appeal affirmance of that judgment.
we conclude,contrary to the wife assertions,that the trial court did not violate statutory law or act in excess of jurisdiction in undertaking to apportion the settlement proceeds.we also find the court was not required to allocate the proceeds based solely on the evidence admitted at the trial against the nonsettling defendants or on the perceived contribution that each heir damages claim supposedly made to the settlement amount.however,we further conclude the record fails to support the court finding that the marriage between the decedent and his wife was about to end.because that finding can not be sustained,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeal and remand the matter to that court for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.
factual and procedural background 
raymond corder corder married shaoping sherry corder wife in september.lisa corder daughter is corder adult daughter from a previous marriage.in may,eight months after the marriage to wife,corder was killed in a construction accident.
wife and daughter separately filed wrongful death actions in orange county against defendant morrow equipment company morrow and others.after the two actions were consolidated,morrow settled with both plaintiffs for an unapportioned lump sum of million.wife and daughter then entered into the following stipulation following the verdict or settlement of the wrongful death case,should the plaintiffs fail to agree on an allocation or apportionment of damages between the heirs,that either plaintiff shall have the right to a further trial regarding the allocation or apportionment of damages among or between the plaintiffs.furthermore,either party may supplement their witness list by identifying witnesses not previously disclosed and that those witnesses may be called as witnesses at the further trial proceeding.
wife and daughter went to trial against the two remaining defendants.the jury found neither defendant was negligent,and judgment was entered in their favor.shortly thereafter,wife and daughter began preparing for a further trial on apportionment of the million settlement proceeds from morrow.meanwhile,wife filed a separate action in the los angeles county superior court,seeking to quiet title to the proceeds.daughter responded by moving to set a trial date in the orange county case.
over wife objection,the orange county court ruled it had jurisdiction to apportion the settlement proceeds and set a hearing for that purpose.the court then indicated that,as part of the apportionment proceeding,it would consider not only the evidence it had heard in the wrongful death trial,but also,as the parties stipulated,new evidence that had not been previously presented.at the apportionment proceeding,much of the new evidence concerned daughter contention that corder,at the time of his death,was contemplating dissolving his marriage to wife because he suspected she was engaging in prostitution.specifically,daughter and wife presented various witnesses who gave conflicting testimony regarding statements corder allegedly made about his marriage and wife prior to his death.there was no evidence,however,that corder actually separated from wife or acted to initiate a legal separation or a marital dissolution.daughter also presented evidence of her relationship with corder.
after hearing the evidence,the trial court filed a judgment containing the following findings and conclusions.evidence at the allocation trial demonstrated two conflicting views of the decedent relationship to his wife,shaoping corder.lisa corder,decedent daughter,presented witnesses who testified that the decedent intended to divorce his wife.according to them the decedent felt that his marriage was a mistake because his wife had continued to work as a prostitute despite her promises to stop.witnesses also testified that lisa corder and her father had a very close relationship.lisa corder argument was that since decedent was on the verge of divorcing his wife,the wife share of the proceeds should be reduced drastically from what it would otherwise have been.
on the other hand,shaoping corder witnesses indicated that the marriage was a good one and there was no intent manifested by the decedent to divorce his wife.shaoping corder argued that because she would have been legally entitled to support from the decedent during the marriage,the lion share of the proceeds should go to her.
having considered the conflicting evidence presented and the arguments of counsel,the court finds most persuasive and credible the evidence that the marriage between shaoping corder and decedent was on the verge of ending.while it is true that decedent had not yet filed for divorce or contacted an attorney,the court finds that had the decedent lived the marriage would have lasted a relatively short period of time given decedent belief,expressed to several persons,that his wife was working as a prostitute against his wishes.decedent may not have expressed his state of mind to all of those close to him,but such is life.for reasons that are usually unknown,people often keep secrets from some close friends or relatives and not from others.the court finds unpersuasive the contention that lisa corder witnesses came into court to commit perjury regarding the prostitution allegations.
given the above findings,the court makes the following allocation as to the million dollar settlement proceeds lisa corder.shaoping corder.in making these findings the court has considered the total loss that each plaintiff suffered from the decedent death capitalization of names omitted.the trial court denied wife motions to vacate the judgment and to enter a different judgment or for a new trial.judgment was entered accordingly.
wife appealed the apportionment judgment and the denial of her posttrial motions.the court of appeal affirmed in a split decision.while all three justices agreed the trial court had jurisdiction to apportion the settlement proceeds,there was vigorous disagreement over the propriety of the apportionment.the majority concluded that daughter had standing to challenge the amount of wife share and was not estopped from doing so the evidence was sufficient to support the finding that raymond corder intended to divorce wife the award was not excessive as to daughter and inadequate as to wife,given the decedent intention to divorce,his close relationship with daughter,and the fact that wife award was significantly more than she was likely to have received as spousal support following an marriage,had corder not died and evidence of the settling defendant motives was properly excluded.these conclusions prompted the dissenting justice to declare there is something profoundly wrong in allocating percent of a wrongful death award to an adult child and only percent to the widow or widower.claiming the majority ignored california case law dealing with wrongful death damages,the dissenting justice contended that evidence of the decedent mere intention to divorce wife was irrelevant because the decedent had taken no concrete steps to effectuate or even initiate such action.
discussion 
we granted wife petition for review to address essentially three issues.first,does the trial court in a wrongful death action have jurisdiction to apportion among the plaintiffs the proceeds of a settlement obtained in the action,or is the court authority otherwise limited to apportioning an award of damages in such an action second,in a proceeding to apportion a settlement,is the trial court limited to consideration of the evidence introduced in the wrongful death action itself or the evidence that the defendant considered in arriving at the amount of the settlement third,did the evidence at the apportionment proceeding here,including the testimony of the witnesses who claimed the decedent intended to divorce wife,support the trial court allocation of percent of the settlement proceeds to daughter and only percent to wife 
jurisdiction to apportion settlement proceeds 
wrongful death actions are statutory in nature and governed by the code of civil procedure section establishes a cause of action in favor of specified heirs of a person whose death is caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another.the damages that may be awarded in a wrongful death action are those that,under all the circumstances of the case,may be just.
while each heir designated in section has a personal and separate wrongful death cause of action,the actions are deemed joint,single and indivisible and must be joined together in one suit cross,supra,cal d at.accordingly,the court or jury must compute the damages,if any,by considering the pecuniary damage suffered by all the heirs and return a verdict for one sum.watkins nutting cal d,italics added see rickards noonan d.in view of the nature of wrongful death awards,section provides the court shall determine the respective rights in an award of the persons entitled to assert the cause of action.
wife first contends that a settlement is not an award,and that section failure to employ the phrase an award or settlement in the above quoted sentence indicates the legislature did not intend to confer jurisdiction upon a trial court in a wrongful death action to apportion settlement proceeds.because section does not confer such jurisdiction,she argues,the only way a trial court is authorized to apportion a wrongful death settlement is in an action that is independent of the wrongful death action,such as an heir separately filed interpleader or quiet title action.wife also suggests that construing section as allowing judicial apportionment of settlement proceeds in a wrongful death action would defeat an heir right to a jury determination of disputed issues of fact relevant to the competing claims to a settlement fund where such issues were not presented to or considered by the jury in the wrongful death action.thus,wife evidently contends that section,by implication,either reserves or confers a right to a jury apportionment of any wrongful death recovery other than an award.
as a preliminary matter,we address wife characterization of this issue as one of jurisdiction.generally,when the state constitution or a statute provides a right to a jury trial,a trial court invalid denial or curtailment of that right is considered an act in excess of jurisdiction and reversible error.see generally witkin,cal.procedure ed.trial.section,however,represents a procedural and not jurisdictional statute whose procedural provisions can be waived.canavin pacific southwest airlines d.canavin,quoting cross,supra,cal d at,addressing former.in light of wife various assertions,we must decide whether the trial court acted either in excess of jurisdiction or in contravention of section when it resolved the competing claims between wife and daughter and apportioned the million in settlement proceeds.
in determining what the legislature intended with section,we look first to the words of the statute.smith superior court cal th,d.section provides in full in an action under this article,damages may be awarded that,under all the circumstances of the case,may be just,but may not include damages recoverable under section pertaining to a decedent cause of action.the court shall determine the respective rights in an award of the persons entitled to assert the cause of action.italics added.true,section omits express reference to settlements.but given that its first sentence undertakes to describe the damages that may be awarded in a wrongful death action,the circumstance that its second sentence employs the related term an award provides no compelling basis for distinguishing between awards and settlements as far as judicial apportionment is concerned.indeed,the statutory language does not purport to prohibit judicial apportionment in a wrongful death action that is resolved through settlement.nor does it suggest that jury apportionment is either authorized or required when a settlement occurs.
in this particular context,moreover,there appears no meaningful distinction between a award and a settlement.after a jury trial,the trial court must apportion an award among the heirs based on the pecuniary damages suffered by each heir.similarly,after a settlement,the trial court must apportion the settlement proceeds based on the identical pecuniary damages suffered by each heir.see,kim,supra,th,d.additionally,where,as here,a trial court has heard evidence of damages at the wrongful death trial against nonsettling defendants,having the same court apportion the heirs recovery of an award a settlement promotes judicial economy and efficiency,even if the court takes further evidence regarding the heirs competing interests therein.
notably,the relevant legislative history contains no suggestion the judicial apportionment provision was adopted to limit or otherwise alter existing decisional law that recognized the general equitable nature of apportionment proceedings and the specific propriety of judicial apportionment in wrongful death actions the statutory amendment to provide for judicial apportionment appears based upon legislative acknowledgement of the respective heirs competing interests in the award.the amendment reflects a belief it was more desirable not to add to the jury burden the task of apportioning the damages citation,and the practical consideration the trial judge had already heard the evidence of the pecuniary loss as to each heir and thus was the most desirable party to apportion the damages.citations.the legislative delegation of apportionment to the court is constitutional,promoting the nature of the remedy as envisioned by its creators without substantively depriving any heir of the right to a jury trial.canavin,supra,d at.thus,while the statutory provision is fairly viewed as codifying early case law establishing the propriety of judicial apportionment of wrongful death awards see ante,fn,neither its text nor its history suggests a purpose to limit the type of recovery appropriate for judicial apportionment,or an aim to expand the right to a jury trial to situations where none previously existed.
in view of the foregoing,we find no interpretive or other reasoned basis for construing section as precluding a trial court in a wrongful death action from apportioning a recovery obtained through settlement.estate of rogers d.similarly concluding that compromise settlements fell within purview of a statute providing only that damages awarded were separate property.in any case,even apart from section,judicial apportionment of a wrongful death settlement falls squarely within the contemplation of section,providing that when the justice of the case requires it,the judgment may determine the ultimate rights of the parties on each side,as between themselves.
case law is consistent with the conclusion that trial courts may complete the adjudication of all contested issues in a wrongful death by determining the appropriate allocation of settlement proceeds between competing heirs,kim,supra,th at,d determining that,in light of the statutory language and history,section provides for judicial apportionment of settlement proceeds,whether the competing claims are between the heirs of a single or multiple decedents smith premier alliance ins.th,d w hen the claims of all heirs are encompassed in a settlement,the court has authority to apportion the settlement estate of kuebler superior court d.the court has jurisdiction to apportion the settlement proceeds see also canavin,supra,d at,fn.
although the foregoing decisions did not specifically address the issues raised here,wife offers no authority contradicting their conclusions and statements.instead,she relies on changaris marvel d.changaris to argue the competing claims of heirs to a settlement fund can only be resolved by a court that has subject matter jurisdiction over the matter jurisdiction conveyed by bringing a separate interpleader or quiet title action.changaris involved a situation where one attorney had represented five different heirs in a wrongful death action.the heirs settled with the defendant tortfeasor for a amount,but subsequently could not agree on its allocation.facing a clear conflict of interest,the attorney filed an interpleader action and was discharged from further responsibility.changaris,supra,d at.changaris held,in the context of the interpleader action,that the trial court properly received evidence of the damage suffered by each of the parties whose rights had been compromised,and the evidence so taken supports the apportionment made.id.at.
like the court of appeal below,we find changaris unhelpful to wife position.even assuming a separate interpleader action was appropriate for the type of situation presented in changaris,that decision does not suggest that,where recovery in the wrongful death action is obtained by settlement and not by an award,the filing of an independent interpleader or other action is required to confer jurisdiction on a trial court to apportion the recovery 
although wife does not appear to assert a constitutional right to a jury trial on the issue of apportionment she does contend that judicial apportionment of a settlement threatens to deprive litigants of an asserted right under section to have a jury determine issues of fact,if the judge is permitted to make a determination of the value of each heirs sic claims independent of the factors used to reach the settlement.for the reasons below,we conclude section does not provide an alternative statutory basis for jury apportionment of a settlement or for requiring a jury determination of all facts relevant to such an apportionment.
section provides in full in actions for the recovery of specific,real,or personal property,with or without damages,or for money claimed as due upon contract,or as damages for breach of contract,or for injuries,an issue of fact must be tried by a jury,unless a jury trial is waived,or a reference is ordered,as provided in this code.where in these cases there are issues both of law and fact,the issue of law must be first disposed of.in other cases,issues of fact must be tried by the court,subject to its power to order any such issue to be tried by a jury,or to be referred to a referee,as provided in this code.
like the constitutional provision cal,art.i,section is historically based and does not expand the jury trial right beyond its common law scope.crouchman superior court cal d,see generally ante,fn.accordingly,section provides no independent basis for a right to a jury in the apportionment of wrongful death settlement proceeds.furthermore,to the extent wife assumes a separate interpleader action or a separate quiet title action would afford the right to a jury,she is wrong.union mutual life ins.broderick cal,interpleader thomson thomson cal d,quiet title action when possession of the property not involved see estate of phelps d.quiet title.
kim,supra,th,d,offers additional reasons for rejecting section as a basis for jury involvement in the apportionment context.as kim recognizes,proceedings to apportion a settlement fund among heirs are not actions for injuries within section contemplation,because they typically involve no allegation of injury infliction or wrongdoing by one heir against other heirs.kim,supra,th at,d.such proceedings simply concern two or more heirs who,as wrongful death plaintiffs,may or may not agree on the distribution of the recovery obtained and seek a determination as to the proper apportionment.see ibid.
also relevant here is kim rejection of the contention that heirs are entitled to a jury to decide the amount of damages each suffered,according to the rules applicable to wrongful death damages.kim,supra,th at,d.as kim explains,t his is an action for apportionment.the amount of damages was determined by the settlement,and no jury can now decide,as if in the first instance,the amount each plaintiff might have been entitled to recover from the alleged settling tortfeasors.appellants argue that the fact that the monies are available for disbursement does not negate their right to have a jury decide their damages.they are wrong.they gave up their right to have a jury decide their damages when they settled the wrongful death case.the only issue remaining is,indeed,apportionment.the fact that the apportionment will be made according to the law on wrongful death damages does not change that.ibid.
in sum,we conclude the trial court did not act in contravention of section or in excess of jurisdiction when it apportioned the settlement proceeds between wife and daughter.
allocation based on contribution of each heir claim to the settlement fund 
wife contends the trial court erred in apportioning the settlement fund based on evidence of the decedent alleged intent to divorce her,because that evidence was not introduced in the wrongful death action itself or considered in arriving at the amount of the settlement.to support this contention,she relies on the following passage from changaris,supra,d at page.w hether the lump sum be ascertained by trial or by compromise,no plaintiff can have any proper reason for contesting the right of any other plaintiff.if a party be defeated in his right to share,that does not increase the right of any other to a larger award.the right of each party plaintiff to recover,as well as the amount rightfully to be recovered,is separate and apart from the like rights of all the others and is neither added to nor lessened by the success or failure of any other party in establishing a right to recover or in proving the amount to be awarded under such right.italics added.this passage,wife argues,establishes a rule that prohibits heirs from attempting to increase their damages by attacking the claims of other heirs and precludes the trial court from allocating a settlement based on evidence the alleged tortfeasor did not consider in calculating the settlement amount.in other words,she explains,a trial court must allocate a settlement by considering the relative contribution that each heir claim made to the settlement fund,just as the trial court role after a wrongful death jury award is to make an allocation that reflects the extent to which each heir claim for damages contributed to the total award we find multiple reasons for rejecting these contentions.
first,wife overlooks a significant fact in this case.wife and daughter,while represented by separate counsel,entered into a stipulation providing,in the event they could not agree on an allocation of damages following the verdict or settlement of the wrongful death action,that either party would have the right to a further trial regarding apportionment,and that either party could call additional witnesses not previously disclosed.reasonably viewed,their stipulation reflected an agreement that resolution of the competing interests of wife and daughter in the million settlement could be based on consideration of otherwise admissible testimony from witnesses who did not testify at the trial against the nonsettling defendants.we see no reason why this stipulation should not be honored.see cohn bugas d.bemer bemer d,a stipulation may lawfully include or limit the issues to be tried,whether or not such issues are pleaded.
second,we find the reasoning of changaris flawed because it fails to recognize that heirs may have competing interests in a settlement fund,which will often be less than the sum of the separate claims.as the court of appeal reasoned below,in the face of this reality,the changaris court inexplicably denied the existence of any adversity between the wrongful death plaintiffs,saying no plaintiff can have any proper reason for contesting the right of any other plaintiff.changaris,supra,d at.if that proposition were true,a statutory provision for judicial apportionment would be largely unnecessary.courts adjudicate disputes,and disputes do not arise unless the litigants respective interests are adverse.the canavin court identified the potential tension between coplaintiffs in a wrongful death case as the raison for judicial apportionment.the statutory amendment to provide for judicial apportionment appears based upon legislative acknowledgment of the respective heirs competing interests in the award.canavin,supra,d at,italics added.and quite obviously,competing interests can not be adjudicated unless litigants are entitled to challenge their adversary position.
third,the assessments and intentions of a settling defendant are irrelevant to the merits of the heirs competing claims therefore,they deserve no consideration in a judicial apportionment proceeding.just as a defendant has no interest in the division which the plaintiffs may make among themselves,or which may be made for them,of the damages recovered in a wrongful death trial robinson western states gas.cal,see canavin,supra,d at,so,too,the division of a wrongful death settlement is of no concern to the settling defendant smith premier alliance ins,supra,th at,d spearman state farm fire casualty d,fn.indeed,a defendant offer to settle may be based on inadequate information due to incomplete discovery,or a failure to reasonably investigate the claims,or some other consideration having little to do with the merits of the heirs competing claims.thus,whether or not the heirs have stipulated to the introduction of additional witness testimony on the issue of apportionment,the trial court decision should not be dependent upon what a settling defendant considered relevant in calculating a compromise sum.
wife also relies on collins hemet valley hospital dist.d.collins to support her position.in that case,the trial court granted a petition filed on behalf of a decedent minor child for approval of a settlement with a defendant in a wrongful death action it then issued a second order determining that the parents of the decedent,who filed the action along with the minor,were not heirs or dependent parents of the decedent and therefore were not entitled to share in the settlement.id.at.collins reversed,finding the trial court was not called upon to determine whether and collins were actually dependent parents of the decedent.that would have been a proper question to be determined in a trial of the wrongful death action,but there was no trial there was a settlement based not on actual facts but claimed facts,and the fairness of the proposed settlement and division of the proceeds should have been determined on the basis of the claimed facts and the circumstances that produced the settlement offer.id.at.
collins is not on point.unlike the case before us,collins concerned a guardian ad litem petition for court approval of a settlement of a minor claim,and,presumably,the showing required for such approval.guardian ad litem may compromise a minor claim with court approval see cal.rules of court,rule requirements for petitions for approval of a compromise of a minor claim.moreover,while collins purported to speak to the issue of apportionment,it did not involve any stipulation between the decedent parents and the minor guardian ad litem for a further trial on apportionment,so it is unclear how collins might have ruled had t he trial court been called upon to determine whether and collins were actually dependent parents of the decedent.collins,supra,d at.finally,collins did not identify any case law or other authority in reaching the conclusions quoted above.accordingly,collins fails to provide meaningful support for wife contrary views.
we conclude the trial court was not required to allocate the million in settlement proceeds based solely on the evidence admitted at the trial against the nonsettling defendants or on the perceived contribution that each heir damages claim supposedly made to the settlement amount.
testimony regarding decedent intent to divorce and sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court allocation 
as relevant here,the trial court explained its allocation decision as follows lisa corder,decedent daughter,presented witnesses who testified that the decedent intended to divorce his wife.according to them the decedent felt that his marriage was a mistake because his wife had continued to work as a prostitute despite her promises to stop on the other hand,shaoping corder witnesses indicated that the marriage was a good one and there was no intent manifested by the decedent to divorce his wife having considered the conflicting evidence presented,the court finds most persuasive and credible the evidence that the marriage between shaoping corder and decedent was on the verge of ending.while it is true that decedent had not yet filed for divorce or contacted an attorney,the court finds that had the decedent lived the marriage would have lasted a relatively short period of time given decedent belief,expressed to several persons,that his wife was working as a prostitute against his wishes.capitalization of names omitted.as these findings indicate,the trial court focused on the disputed evidence regarding corder state of mind and his intentions shortly before his death.the court did not consider any evidence purporting to show that wife actually engaged in prostitution.
in this court,wife asserts the evidence at the apportionment proceeding,especially the testimony regarding corder alleged intent to divorce her,did not substantially support the trial court allocation of only percent of the settlement fund to her and the remaining percent to daughter.in this regard,wife argues a surviving spouse claim for future financial support can not be reduced based on a decedent spouse expressions of an intent to obtain a dissolution of the marriage at some point in the future.
before elaborating on wife contentions,we find it useful to review the rules governing the recovery available in wrongful death actions.as a general matter,damages for wrongful death are measured by the financial benefits the heirs were receiving at the time of death,those reasonably to be expected in the future,and the monetary equivalent of loss of comfort,society and protection.benwell dean d.benwell.specifically,this means that n o damages can be given for the pain or anguish suffered by the person who is killed,the damages being limited to the pecuniary loss suffered by the person or persons for whose benefit the right of action is given by reason of the death of the victim.citation.this pecuniary loss may be a loss arising from a deprivation of something to which the statutory beneficiary would have been legally entitled if the person had lived,or it may be a pecuniary loss arising from the deprivation of something which,from all the circumstances of the particular case,it could reasonably be expected such beneficiary would have received from the deceased had his life not been though the obligation resting on the deceased to bestow such benefit may have been but a moral obligation.citations.thus,there might be a reasonable expectation that if the life of a deceased had continued he might have accumulated a greater estate,and that the increased estate would have been inherited by the statutory beneficiaries as his heirs.or,there might be a reasonable expectation that if the life of a deceased had not been taken the statutory beneficiaries,or some of them,would have continued to receive from the one who was killed financial assistance,or services having a financial value.these are illustrations of direct financial benefits for the loss of which damages may be awarded.griffey pacific electric railway,griffey.
in addition to these types of direct financial benefits,there is that less tangible and not so immediate,but nevertheless real,pecuniary benefit which often may reasonably be expected from a continuance of the society,comfort and protection of the deceased.griffey,supra.at.the pecuniary value of the society,comfort,and protection that is lost through the wrongful death of a spouse,parent,or child may be considerable in cases where,for instance,the decedent had demonstrated a kindly demeanor toward the statutory beneficiary and rendered assistance or kindly offices to that person.beeson green mountain cal,wl opn.on rehg.in this regard,however,recovery is not available in wrongful death actions for the grief or sorrow attendant upon the death of a loved one.see krouse graham cal d.
powers sutherland auto stage cal,powers illustrates the distinction between the tangible and intangible benefits of a marriage relationship,and the circumstances that are relevant in assessing the pecuniary value of their loss.in powers,a husband and wife had been living separate and apart for over years,although they had not legally separated or divorced.the wife had not received any significant or consistent support from the husband during that time,and did not know his whereabouts in the years before he died.in addition,the husband had been living in illicit relations with and supporting another woman for three or four years prior to his death.id.at.
despite these circumstances,powers concluded the husband death had caused the wife to suffer pecuniary loss of her legally enforceable right of support.as powers explained,even though the husband had deserted the wife and for a long time contributed nothing to her support,and even though he may have intended never to return,yet so long as the marriage relation existed she was entitled to support from him in the absence of any evidence that she had forfeited the right by her own wrong.this was a right which she could at any time during his life have legally enforced.it was a right created by the marriage relation and would exist so long as the marriage relation itself existed.powers,supra,cal.at,but see carr pacific.d.indicating in dictum,and without reference to powers,that evidence of husband abandonment and nonsupport of family was relevant to issue of damages for loss of earnings.
while finding that an award of approximately per month over the husband estimated life expectancy was reasonable as compensation for the wife loss of her right of support,powers determined that a different conclusion was warranted regarding any claimed loss of the intangible benefits of the marriage in view of the fact that the wife and deceased had been living apart,nothing could have been awarded to her for the loss of the society,comfort,and protection of the deceased.powers,supra,cal.at.this conclusion is consistent with other decisions recognizing that factors relevant in assessing a claimed loss of society,comfort,and protection may include the closeness of the family unit at issue,the warmth of feeling between the family members,and the character of the deceased as kind and attentive or kind and loving.krouse graham,supra,cal d at,and cases cited therein.
here,wife concedes the quality of her marriage and corder state of mind toward her may have some bearing on a claim for loss of society,comfort,and protection.based on powers and the case law above,we agree.see also benwell,supra,d at.evidence of the nature of the personal relationship that existed between the decedent and the beneficiaries of a wrongful death action has a bearing on the compensation for loss of society,comfort and protection,and is therefore ordinarily admissible in such an action id.at.if it is proper for the beneficiary to produce evidence of the attitude and affection on the part of the decedent for the beneficiaries then defendant should properly be able to rebut or negate such evidence.accordingly,evidence of a decedent intent to seek a divorce,as well as other evidence reflecting a strained relationship,may not be categorically excluded from the determination of a surviving spouse wrongful death damages.
nonetheless,wife contends the evidence concerning corder intent to seek a divorce should not have been considered with respect to her claim for loss of the right of support.as in powers,she argues,such support was a direct financial benefit to which she was legally entitled by virtue of her marital status at the time of corder death.alternatively,she asserts,a decedent expression of an intent to divorce a spouse deserves consideration only where there is evidence the decedent engaged in affirmative action that manifested such intent.in this case,she emphasizes,there was no evidence that corder had initiated a marital dissolution or separation.
we do not view powers,supra,cal,as compelling the conclusion that,so long as a marriage relationship remains legally intact at the time of the decedent death,evidence of the decedent declared intent to end the marriage deserves no consideration in evaluating the surviving spouse claim for loss of future financial support.nor do we adopt such a conclusion here.as the wrongful death statute expressly contemplates,damages must be assessed based on the totality of the circumstances in each case.recoverable damages in a wrongful death action are those that,under all the circumstances of the case,may be just italics added.evidence that tends to show that a marriage is on the brink of being legally terminated appears to be material and to bear directly on the issue whether financial support is properly found a benefit reasonably to be expected in the future had the decedent lived.benwell,supra,d at.
at the same time,there is merit to the concern that evidence of a decedent mere expression of a desire to divorce a spouse,when the decedent had taken no steps to effectuate a marital dissolution or legal separation,seems a speculative basis for finding that a marriage would have been had the decedent not died.as wife points out,the reasons why couples stay married are complicated and personal,just as are the reasons why and when they get divorced.and as the dissenting justice below commented no doubt there are some relationships where the spouses form an intention to divorce on a daily basis,and the intention evaporates just as quickly.mere intentions can be wonderfully evanescent.moreover,we are mindful that california has a public policy in favor of promoting marriage.thus,even when spouses have formally commenced the process of legal separation or marriage dissolution,the governing law contemplates the possibility of reconciliation as the important issue.in re marriage of mckim cal d,see,california eliminated the concept of fault in marriage dissolutions in order to reduce the emotionally charged atmosphere and perhaps effect a reconciliation.
emphasizing that one is legally entitled to support from one spouse see,the dissenting justice found that,at the time of a spouse death,the surviving spouse would have every expectation of the pecuniarily measurable support embodied in the wrongful death award predicated on the late spouse earnings.in concluding that evidence of a decedent mere intent to divorce is too speculative to affect a surviving spouse wrongful death recovery for the loss of such earnings,he urged adoption of the following restriction regarding such evidence u nless legally cognizable,concrete steps are actual separation or filing for separation or existing legal rights and expectations between spouses remain intact,including expectations of continued support.california family law takes no account of a mere intention to separate or divorce.even taking the step of seeing a lawyer does nothing to alter legal rights already in place.
for purposes of this case,we need not decide whether evidence of these identified legally cognizable,concrete steps is either necessary or sufficient to establish that a marriage would not have lasted had the decedent lived here,the trial court found that corder marriage was on the verge of ending and would have lasted a relatively short period of time had corder lived,based solely on testimony from daughter witnesses claiming that corder said he felt his marriage was a mistake and he intended to divorce wife.as we shall explain,that testimony was insufficient to sustain these findings.
benwell,supra,d,is instructive on th
