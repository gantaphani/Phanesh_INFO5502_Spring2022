attachment is an ancillary or provisional remedy to aid in the collection of a money demand by seizure of property in advance of trial and judgment.doyka superior court d.california attachment law code civ,et is purely statutory and is strictly construed.bank of america salinas nissan,d.as germane here,a plaintiff seeking a right to attach order must show the probable validity of its claim.id.at.a claim has probable validity where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant on that claim.
in this case,kemp.construction,kemp,a prime contractor on two public works projects,sued its former subcontractor,titan electric corporation titan,for breach of contract,and sought a pretrial right to attach order.the court found kemp was entitled to the remedy,not because kemp had affirmatively shown the probable validity of its claim or established other requisite criteria,as was its burden,but because titan could not the issue of its breach of contract.the court allusion to the preclusive effect of prior litigation referred to a proceeding at which a los angeles unified school district lausd hearing officer determined kemp had grounds under public contract code section,subdivisions a and a for substituting titan out of its subcontract.
the court erred.collateral estoppel is an equitable concept based on fundamental principles of fairness.for issue preclusion purposes it means that a party ordinarily may not relitigate an issue that was fully and fairly litigated on a previous occasion.sandoval superior court d,italics added.the only purpose of the prior proceeding was to determine if kemp had permissible statutory grounds to substitute another electrical contractor on the public works projects.nothing in the record supports an inference,much less a conclusion,that the hearing officer decided breach of contract issues or that such issues were even submitted to him.there is simply no basis for concluding the parties fully and fairly litigated the issue of titan alleged breach of the subcontract.
ordinarily,when the court gives an incorrect legal reason for its ruling,we look for any other correct legal basis on which to sustain the order.rappleyea campbell cal th,d,mayflower ins.pellegrino d.a correct decision of the trial court must be affirmed,even if the grounds upon which the trial court reached its conclusion are not correct.one of the other bases for affirmance is substantial evidence,which allows us to make certain presumptions supporting the result.state farm fire casualty pietak th,d.however,where,as here,a respondent argues for affirmance based on substantial evidence,the record must show the court actually performed the factfinding function.where the record demonstrates the trial judge did not weigh the evidence,the presumption of correctness is overcome.lafayette morehouse,chronicle publishing th,d when the record clearly demonstrates what the trial court did,we will not presume it did something different.as stated in estate of larson d,the substantial evidence rule thus operates only where it can be presumed that the court has performed its function of weighing the evidence.if analysis of the record suggests the contrary,the rule should not be invoked.
such is the case before us,where both the minute order and the reporter transcript demonstrate the court never engaged in the process of weighing the evidence because it improvidently agreed with kemp argument that titan was barred from ing the issue of its alleged breach of contract and ruled accordingly.for that reason,we reverse and remand with directions to the court to weigh the factors relevant to kemp burden of showing entitlement to the attachment order.in exercising its discretion,the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective parties and make a determination of the probable outcome.loeb loeb beverly glen music,d.
as a preliminary matter,at the time of oral argument,we considered kemp motion to file a late brief and submitted it for determination in conjunction with our disposition of the appeal on the merits.we further allowed kemp to present its argument conditionally,subject to being stricken depending on our decision whether to allow the late filing of kemp brief.see cal.rules of,rule a.we now grant kemp motion.because kemp brief was presented to the court and titan counsel only days before oral argument,titan requested an opportunity to file a reply brief prior to our submission of the case.however,we deem a reply brief unnecessary titan carried its burden of affirmatively establishing reversible error in its opening brief and at oral argument.
turning to the facts,we remind the parties it is not our role to engage in an assessment of the evidence,and our summary does not establish the truth of any facts for any purpose.we simply place the controversy in context by reciting relevant material as variously alleged or attested in the pleadings and papers in the court file,including those documents of which titan and kemp have requested we take judicial notice,subd.d.on remand,neither party may derive any evidentiary benefit or suffer any detriment from our recitation.
the electrical subcontracts and events leading to kemp substituting titan out 
in march,kemp entered into two prime contracts with the lausd for public works improvement projects at huntington park elementary school huntington park and the los angeles center for enriched studies laces.under subcontracts valued at more than million,titan agreed to furnish labor,material,and equipment necessary for the electrical portion of both projects.
all went well for a while,but in february,for reasons that are in dispute,kemp agreed to advance payroll payments to titan for certain workers on the huntington project.the advances were to be drawn against titan accounts receivable for work titan had already completed.kemp made the payments until the latter part of april,then ceased.when titan could not meet the payroll on its own,its employees stopped working.kemp hired a r electric a r to replace titan on the two projects,and by the afternoon of april,a r,essentially using titan equipment and former employees,began performing the electrical work covered by titan subcontract.
the substitution hearing 
on the same day,april,kemp submitted a request to lausd to authorize the substitution of a r on both the huntington and laces projects.the proceeding is statutory,falling under the subletting and subcontracting fair practices act,public contract code section et the act,which,in pertinent part,confers a statutory right on the subcontractor originally listed by the prime contractor to perform the specified work.pub.contract code,land associates construction th,d.substitution of another subcontractor for the designated subcontractor is not allowed unless the awarding authority consents and one of certain situations exists.valley crest landscape,city council th,d.the circumstances justifying substitution,as relevant here,are set forth in public contract code section,subdivisions a w hen the listed subcontractor fails or refuses to perform his or her subcontract,and a w hen the awarding authority,or its duly authorized officer,determines that the subcontractor is substantially delaying or disrupting the progress of the work.
titan objected to the substitution.the matter was set for hearing before mark hovatter,an engineer and director of lausd facilities contracts.by the time the hearing went forward in august,both the huntington and laces projects had been completed by a r and another electrical contractor.in november,hovatter issued two decisions approving kemp substitutionof titan on both projects.hovatter found,an informal arrangement had been made between kemp and titan under which kemp advanced payments to titan from february through april.this was an arrangement above and beyond their contractual requirement and being done by kemp because they believed it was in their best interest.when kemp chose to discontinue this action,kemp was not in violation of its contractual requirement to pay titan.once kemp discontinued their arrangement of early payments to t
