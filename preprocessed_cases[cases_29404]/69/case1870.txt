sheppard mullin filed a special motion to strike the complaint a motion pursuant to code of civil procedure section section,contending that its legal representation in the plant litigation is protected activity,and fire can not show a probability that it would succeed on the merits of its claim.the trial court concluded that this action interferes with sheppard mullin right to petition,and thus,is protected activity under the law.however,the trial court went on to conclude that fire satisfied its burden to show a probability of success as to the merits of its claim,and therefore denied the motion.we disagree with the trial court conclusion that fire complaint arises out of protected activity,and so affirm the ruling denying the motion,but on other grounds 
ii.facts and procedural background 
a.the complaint 
fire complaint in this case alleges that it is an insurance company that was sued as a defendant in the litigation in.in that case,fire putative insured,paint company,claimed that fire had duties to defend and indemnify it against bodily injury actions brought against,it is alleged,sought to maximize the amount of insurance benefits fire may be forced to pay for such asbestos actions to amounts in excess of what is owed by fire under its insurance contracts.the interpretation of general liability insurance policy provisions under california law,and facts relating to the defense and settlement of underlying asbestos actions,are at the heart of the litigation.
the complaint also alleges that sheppard mullin represented fire in the litigation for a period of approximately two and years,during which fire entrusted sheppard mullin with confidential information.this confidential information included fire litigation strategies,its policies and positions concerning interpretation of insurance policy terms involved in asbestos related bodily injury claims and lawsuits,its settlement negotiation policies and strategies,and the identity of key fire decision makers.
the complaint alleges further that,in,fire was sued as a defendant in the plant litigation.the plant litigation is a declaratory relief action by plant insulation company plant concerning the existence and scope of benefits allegedly owed by plant insurers,including fire,for pending and future bodily injury lawsuits.like in the litigation,plant also seeks to maximize the amount of insurance benefits fire may be forced to pay for such asbestos actions.as in the litigation,the interpretation of fire policy provisions under california law and the conduct of underlying asbestos actions are at the heart of the plant litigation.
according to the complaint,sheppard mullin is representing,in the plant litigation,the informal committee of asbestos creditors,and two law firms providing legal representation to the creditors in their asbestos lawsuits against plant brayton purcell,llp and kazan,mcclain,abrams,fernandez,lyons,farrise greenwood plc.this representation came to light when fire learned that sheppard mullin had agreed to defend against subpoenas served on the firms in the plant litigation seeking communications between counsel for the asbestos and counsel for plant.the communications sought were relevant to,among other issues,the extent of cooperation between claimants and plant counsel in their efforts to maximiz e the amount of insurance benefits that may potentially be owed by fire and other insurers in the plant litigation.fire complaint in the present case alleges that,because of sheppard mullin prior representation of fire in the litigation,sheppard mullin has a conflict of interest that disqualifies it from playing its current role in the plant litigation.
in the course of representing,sheppard mullin is alleged to have characterized the relationship between the asbestos and plant as follows plant and the community of claimants holding asbestos claims against plant share a common interest with respect to this action,a ruling from the trial court construing the policies as broadly as possible and finding that plant has the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to it with respect to and for coverage of asbestos claims asserted against plant.
counsel for plant allegedly took a similar position in its opposition to a motion to compel production of communications between plant lawyers and the lawyers plant,as the insured,and the claimants as the injured parties,share a legal interest in the determination of coverage.plant wants as many cases covered as possible.the claimants want as many of their cases covered as possible.the insurers want rulings in this case that will minimize the number of cases covered under their policies.their interests here are adverse to those of plant and the claimants in the plant litigation.
fire complaint in this case also alleges that,in both the litigation and the plant litigation,the same type of insurance policy provisions are in issue,and the same type of legal arguments will be advanced by both sides.therefore,it concludes,sheppard mullin possesses confidential information by virtue of its representation of fire in the litigation in the evaluation,prosecution,settlement of claims concerning the plant litigation.as a result of these events,fire alleges,a conflict of interest exists giving rise to breaches of the duties of confidentiality and loyalty owed by sheppard mullin to fire.the prayer seeks an order preliminarily and permanently enjoining sheppard mullin from representing the committee of asbestos creditors,their counsel,or any related persons or entities in connection with the plant litigation.the prayer also contains a general request for damages unspecified except to allege that such damages resulted from the breach of the duties of loyalty and confidentiality owned to plaintiff by sheppard mullin.
sheppard,mullin motion 
in response to the complaint,sheppard mullin filed a special motion to strike asserting that it was entitled to a dismissal because the complaint arises from acts of sheppard mullin in furtherance of its right of petition and free speech,and because fire can not show a probability that it would prevail on its claim.included with the evidence proffered in support of the motion was the declaration of a sheppard mullin partner,steven sacks,who confirmed that sheppard mullin had been engaged to represent the informal asbestos creditors committee and however,sacks maintained that sheppard mullin had not been retained by to provide any insurance coverage advice in the plant litigation,and the firm had not participated in the litigation of such issues 
a declaration from another sheppard mullin partner,philip,also accompanied the motion.was the lead counsel for sheppard mullin in the litigation.in support of its motion,sheppard mullin also filed a declaration by sheppard mullin partner michael ahrens explaining the nature of sheppard mullin work in a series of bankruptcy matters,including proceedings involving western asbestos and the bankruptcy of thorpe where sheppard mullin again represented the creditors committee.the sheppard mullin attorneys vigorously denied that a conflict of interest existed.in addition,they pointed out that an ethical wall had been erected isolating the bankruptcy team in the plant litigation from contact with the files and those who worked on the litigation.
in opposition to sheppard mullin motion,fire filed a declaration by fire vice president of claims patricia noll.her declaration averred that sheppard mullin did not obtain a waiver of any conflict of interest from fire at the time sheppard mullin undertook its representation of the creditors committee.noll also enumerated the types of legal services provided to fire by sheppard mullin in connection with the litigation from july through march.
fire evidence in opposition to sheppard mullin motion also included a declaration from mark goodman,a law partner in the firm of squire,sanders dempsey llp,which replaced sheppard mullin as counsel for fire in the litigation in.goodman stated that,at the conclusion of its representation,sheppard mullin turned over boxes of documents to squire,sanders dempsey,which included,among other things,substantive reports prepared by sheppard mullin concerning fire litigation strategies,settlement strategies,liability analysis,certain discovery propounded responded to by sheppard mullin on behalf of fire and dispositive motions filed and opposed by sheppard mullin.
after receiving the parties briefs,the trial court issued an order requesting the parties to address additional questions.the parties separately responded,and the trial court conducted a hearing on the special motion to strike on december.at the conclusion of the hearing,the court orally confirmed its tentative ruling and then issued a written order on february.as to the issue we decide,the court concluded that the first prong of the analysis required in determining an motion had been satisfied.relying on peregrine funding,sheppard mullin richter hampton llp th,d peregrine funding,the court concluded that the complaint implicates protected activity.
iii.discussion 
like many intermediate appellate courts of this state,we have recently discussed california statute at considerable length,and have set forth in detail the applicable standard of review.as our colleagues in division two explained in herrera th,d,section,commonly referred to as the law,provides in relevant part a the legislature finds and declares that there has been a disturbing increase in lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances.the legislature finds and declares that it is in the public interest to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance,and that this participation should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process.to this end,this section shall be construed broadly.b a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.e as used in this section,act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue includes any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.
under the statute,the court makes a determination first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity,subd.b.a defendant meets this burden by demonstrating that the act underlying the plaintiff cause fits one of the categories spelled out in section,subdivision e citation.if the court finds that such a showing has been made,it must then determine whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim,subd.b citations.only a cause of action that satisfies both prongs of the,that arises from protected speech or petitioning and lacks even minimal a slapp,subject to being stricken under the statute.citation.
a ruling on a special motion to strike under section is reviewed de novo.citation.this includes whether the statute applies to the challenged claim.citation.furthermore,we apply our independent judgment to determine whether plaintiff causes of action arose from acts by defendant in furtherance of defendant right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue.citations.assuming these two conditions are satisfied,we must then independently determine,from our review of the record as a whole,whether plaintiff has established a reasonable probability that he would prevail on his claims.citation.citation,supra,th at,d,quoting thomas quintero th,d,italics omitted.
more recently,another court,in affirming the denial of an motion,noted that t he principal thrust or gravamen of a cause of action determines whether the statute applies.citation.the statute definitional focus is not the form of the plaintiff cause of action but,rather,the defendant activity that gives rise to his or her asserted whether that activity constitutes protected speech or petitioning.citation.the statute does not apply where protected activity is only collateral or incidental to the purpose of the transaction or occurrence underlying the complaint.citation.california back specialists medical group rand th,d,original italics california back specialists.
in california back specialists,a medical lien holder sued an attorney who had represented two personal injury plaintiffs who received medical treatment from the lien holder.the complaint charged that the attorney improperly failed to notify the lien holder of the settlement of the underlying personal injury action,and wrongfully disbursed the settlement proceeds to the clients without withholding funds owed the lien holder.california back specialists,supra,th at,d.in concluding that the attorney alleged actions were not protected activity,the court noted not all attorney conduct in connection with litigation,or in the course of representing clients,is protected by section.citations.id.at,d.in support of this conclusion,the court relied on three previous cases freeman schack th,d benasra mitchell silberberg knupp llp th,d benasra and moore shaw th,d,the first two of which are particularly instructive here 
freeman schack,supra,th,d,involved facts very close to this case.there,a lawyer was sued by two clients for breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,and professional negligence,based on allegations that he had entered into an relationship with one of the plaintiffs,but abandoned that representation in order to assume the role of attorney in the same litigation,as well as a second matter,for another client,the other plaintiff.the trial court granted the attorney special motion to strike on several grounds,including that the acts on which the suit was based constituted protected activity under the statute.id.at,d.
in reversing the trial court decision,the appellate court disagreed that the principal thrust of the complaint related to actions taken by the attorney in the course of the second representation,including the filing or settlement of that litigation t he activity that gives rise to schack asserted liability citation is his undertaking to represent a party with interests adverse to plaintiffs,in violation of the duty of loyalty he assertedly owed them in connection with the original litigation.i f the allegations of protected activity are only incidental to a cause of action based essentially on nonprotected activity,the mere mention of the protected activity does not subject the cause of action to an motion.citation.in our view,plaintiffs allegations concerning schack filing and settlement of the second litigation are incidental to the allegations of breach of contract,negligence in fail
