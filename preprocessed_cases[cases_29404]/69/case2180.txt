over a century ago,we declared that the courts of no state have gone further than texas in applying the doctrine of subrogation because our decisions recognize the doctrine to its fullest extent.today case requires us to decide whether this doctrine applies to a subcontractor seeking to recoup contractual payments from alleged tortfeasors.we hold that it does,provided the traditional requirements of subrogation are satisfied.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and remand to that court for further proceedings.
background 
the owner of the renaissance hotel in dallas hired price woods,price woods as general contractor to remodel a hotel meeting room.price woods in turn subcontracted the hvac and sheet metal work to frymire engineering,frymire.as part of its contract with price woods,frymire agreed to pay for any damages caused to price woods or the hotel owner by reason of frymire performance of the work and to obtain liability insurance to cover this indemnity obligation.frymire complied with the agreement by purchasing a general liability policy from liberty mutual insurance liberty mutual.
while working on the hotel air conditioning system,frymire employees installed an to a chilled water line.the water line later ruptured at the site of the valve,resulting in extensive water damage to the hotel.the hotel owner sought indemnification from frymire according to the terms of the contract liberty mutual paid the owner on frymire behalf and the parties signed an agreement releasing frymire and liberty mutual from all actions,claims,and demands stemming from the incident.
nearly two years after signing the release,frymire,by and through liberty mutual together,frymire,sued the manufacturers of the jomar international,and mixer together,jomar to recoup the indemnification payment,alleging damages from jomar negligence,product liability,and breach of warranty.jomar filed both traditional and motions for summary judgment,and the trial court granted both motions without explanation.the court of appeals affirmed,holding that frymire lacked standing to assert its claims because it failed to establish a right to equitable subrogation because the court based its holding solely on standing,it did not address whether summary judgment was appropriate under jomar other arguments 
ii.equitable subrogation 
the doctrine of equitable subrogation allows a party who would otherwise lack standing to step into the shoes of and pursue the claims belonging to a party with standing texas courts interpret this doctrine liberally although the doctrine most often arises in the insurance context equitable subrogation applies in every instance in which one person,not acting voluntarily,has paid a debt for which another was primarily liable and which in equity should have been paid by the latter.thus,a party seeking equitable subrogation must show it involuntarily paid a debt primarily owed by another in a situation that favors equitable relief 
the court of appeals held that frymire failed to satisfy any of these requirements,determining that frymire paid the hotel owner to satisfy its own contractual obligation and that the payment was voluntary and did not unjustly enrich jomar frymire contends that the court of appeals misapplied the subrogation requirements.according to frymire,the indemnity payment extinguished the tort debt primarily owed by jomar the indemnity payment was an involuntary payment made pursuant to a binding contractual obligation and jomar will be unjustly enriched if it escapes liability for its defective product because of frymire contractual payment.we address each of these issues in turn,considering the evidence in the light most favorable to frymire,the nonmovant 
a right to subrogation is often asserted by one who pays a debt owed by another,but we have yet to directly address what constitutes a debt owed by another.frymire urges us to focus on the debt potentially owed in tort by jomar to the hotel for the water damage caused by jomar faulty valve.frymire contends that it satisfied jomar debt by paying for the damages incurred by the hotel and is thus entitled to recoup that payment through equitable subrogation.jomar counters that the debt in question is the contractual debt owed by frymire to the hotel.having suffered extensive damage as a result of frymire work,the hotel turned to frymire,not jomar,for payment.jomar claims that frymire covered the damage according to the terms of a contract to which jomar was not a party and of which jomar did not have notice,thus satisfying a debt owed by frymire.furthermore,jomar argues that frymire should be prevented from asserting the rights of a party,the hotel,to which frymire was directly indebted.
jomar correctly argues that frymire contractual payment fulfilled a debt owed by frymire to the hotel however,the satisfaction of this contractual debt does not foreclose the existence and satisfaction of another debt owed by jomar to the hotel.we have previously permitted claims to proceed under similar circumstances 
in keck,mahin cate national union fire insurance of pittsburgh,pa,an excess insurer,acting on behalf of its insured,settled a lawsuit against the insured according to the terms of the policy.the excess insurer then sued the primary insurer for negligence and the defending law firm for legal malpractice,asserting claims on behalf of the insured under the doctrine of equitable subrogation the underlying facts in keck are strikingly similar to the facts highlighted by jomar in this case.the insured relied on the excess insurer for payment and never sought to recover damages from the law firm or the primary insurer.furthermore,the excess insurer settlement payment fulfilled a contractual obligation owed to the insured and was made according to a policy to which the law firm and the primary insurer were not parties and of which they did not have prior notice.nevertheless,we permitted the excess insurer claims to proceed 
jomar attempts to distinguish keck on the basis of its context and the identity of the party receiving payment.unlike keck,this case does not arise in the context of excess liability insurance.additionally,the excess insurer in keck satisfied its contractual debt with the insured through payment to a third party whereas frymire paid a contractual debt directly to the hotel owner.these differences do not persuade us to reach a different result here.equitable subrogation applies in every instance in which one person has paid a debt for which another was primarily liable.jomar points us to smart tower land investment,where we refused to extend subrogation rights to a mortgage holder who had paid property taxes on behalf of the mortgage debtor,as an instance where subrogation was denied to a party seeking to assert the rights of the payee in smart,we refused to allow the mortgage holder to assert the rights of the taxing authority against the mortgage debtor,not because the holder had paid the taxing authority directly,but because subrogation rights based in equity had been foreclosed by the terms of the mortgage contract we permitted the excess insurer equitable subrogation claims to proceed in keck,and,in spite of jomar arguments,we will permit frymire claims to proceed here if frymire indemnity payment satisfied a debt primarily owed by jomar to the hotel owner.
in response to jomar summary judgment motion,frymire presented a report on the water leak from its expert,johnie spruiell.spruiell inspected the at issue and concluded in his report that frymire employees installed the valve according to jomar instructions however,when installing an adjoining ball valve,the employees may have introduced torque into the copper tubing of the water line,causing the tubing inside the to fail.according to spruiell,once the tubing failed,the teflon tape sealing the valve to the water line quickly gave way,resulting in the water leakage.spruiell determined that a properly designed valve would not have failed under these circumstances.viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to frymire and disregarding any contrary inferences,as we must at this stage of the proceeding
