background and procedural history 
amex travelers cheques tcs are preprinted checks for amounts ranging from to.each one is identifiable based on a unique serial number.amex maintains that the tcs never expire,so they are contractually obligated to honor the tcs once they are issued.amex sells tcs for the face value amount,normally through a third party bank or travel service.the third party can charge a small fee,which it retains,but amex does not charge a fee beyond the face value of the tcs.amex claims that it can sell tcs without charging a fee because its contractual relationship with tc owners gives amex the right to retain,use,and invest funds from the sale of tcs from the date of sale until the date the tcs are cashed or used.amex asserts that this right to invest the funds is integral to the contract between tc owners and amex,and that it relies on these invested funds to remain profitable in the tc business.
when a tc is sold,the third party seller transmits the funds to amex and provides amex with the tc serial number,its amount,and the date and place of sale.generally,the seller does not provide the purchaser name,address,or any other identifying information.when amex sells tcs directly to consumers,it retains only the same information that it receives from third party sellers.
all fifty states,and the district of columbia,have a set of unclaimed property laws often called escheat laws,most of which are based on a version of the uniform unclaimed property act uupa.these laws require that once property has been deemed abandoned,the holder turn it over to the state while the original property owner still maintains the right to the property.the purpose of unclaimed property laws is to provide for the safekeeping of abandoned property and then to reunite the abandoned property with its owner.usually,before turning over abandoned property to the state,the holder must attempt to return the property by contacting the owner,using the owner name and last known address.if the holder is unable to return the property to the owner and turns it over to the state,the holder provides the state with the name and last known address of the owner.the holder is no longer liable to the property owner once it turns over the property to the state.the state then makes an effort to reunite the owner with the property.under new jersey custodial escheat statute,the rightful owner may file a claim to recover the property at any time after the property is turned over to the state.
however,travelers checks operate differently because issuers like amex generally do not obtain the names or addresses of the purchasers.thus,the requirement that holders send notice to the owner at the last known address before turning over such property to the state does not apply to travelers checks.travelers check issuers are also exempted from the requirement to include the owner name and last known address on unclaimed property reports.stat.ann.b.amex sends only the serial number,amount,and date of sale when tcs are sent to the state as unclaimed property.if amex determines that a cashed tc has a serial number indicating that it has been paid to a state as unclaimed property,amex seeks to reclaim those funds from that state.in new jersey,when such claims are filed,the treasurer returns the funds with interest.
until recently,all fifty states had a abandonment period for travelers checks but on june,the new jersey legislature passed chapter,which shortened the abandonment period for travelers checks from fifteen years to three years.stat.ann.b.the purpose of the statute was to protect new jersey consumers from certain commercial dormancy fee practices and to modernize new jersey unclaimed property laws.state of assemb.budget,statement to assembly,at june.under the state unclaimed property law,after an issuer transfers the presumed abandoned property to the state,the property is then administered through new jersey unclaimed property system.the state preserves the property in perpetuity for the owner,stat.ann.b,or for another state that can prove a superior right of escheat.stat.ann.b.
on september,amex filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of new jersey,alleging that chapter violated the due process clause,the contract clause,the takings clause,and the commerce clause of the constitution.amex also filed a motion for preliminary injunction,seeking to enjoin the state from enforcing chapter.on november,the district court denied amex motion for preliminary injunction with respect to travelers checks.amex filed a timely appeal.
ii.standard of review 
we generally review a district court grant or denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion,but review the underlying factual findings for clear error and examine legal conclusions de novo.brown city of pittsburgh,cir citation omitted.we have jurisdiction to review the order granting or denying a preliminary injunction under a.id.at.
iii.discussion 
a court must consider four factors when ruling on a motion for preliminary injunction whether the movant has shown a reasonable probability of success on the merits whether the movant will be irreparably injured by denial of the relief whether granting preliminary relief will result in even greater harm to the nonmoving party and whether granting preliminary relief will be in the public interest.crissman dover downs entm t,cir.the moving party failure to show a likelihood of success on the merits must necessarily result in the denial of a preliminary injunction.in re arthur treacher franchisee,cir.we evaluate the likelihood of success on the merits of amex four constitutional claims accordingly.
substantive due process clause 
the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment provides that no state shall deprive any person of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law.const.amend.xiv.it is well established that the due process clause contains both a procedural and substantive component.nicholas.state,cir citing planned parenthood of casey,d.substantive due process contains two lines of inquiry one that applies when a party challenges the validity of a legislative act,and one that applies to the challenge of a action.id.in a case challenging a legislative act,as here,the act must withstand rational basis review.id.to do so,the defendant must demonstrate the existence of a legitimate state interest that could be rationally furthered by the statute.id.citation omitted.the rational basis test,although not a toothless one,mathews lucas,d,requires significant deference to the legislature and assumptions.sammon bd.of med.exam rs,cir.t hose attacking the rationality of the legislative classification have the burden to negative every conceivable basis which might support it.fcc beach commc ns,d quoting lehnhausen lake shore auto parts,d.
amex argues that the sole purpose behind enacting chapter was to raise revenue for the state,which is not a legitimate state interest.but under rational basis scrutiny,a court inquiry is limited to whether the law rationally furthers any legitimate state objective.malmed thornburgh,cir emphasis added.it is enough that the state offers a conceivable rational basis for its action,and t he court may even hypothesize the motivations of the state legislature to find a legitimate objective promoted by the provision under attack.id.citation omitted.it is constitutionally irrelevant whether this reasoning in fact underlay the legislative decision fleming nestor,d.
the state submits that chapter was enacted to modernize the state unclaimed property laws by making the abandonment period for travelers checks more consistent with that of other property.the state also argues that chapter provides greater protection for property owners.they reason that shortening the abandonment period will facilitate the transfer of the property from a private company to the state at an earlier time this would provide greater protection for property owners because private companies are subject to greater economic instability compared to a perpetually solvent government entity.in general,taking custody of abandoned property is a legitimate state interest.see delaware new york,d states as sovereigns may take custody of or assume title to abandoned personal property.we agree that,as a corollary,the state has a legitimate interest in protecting its property owners and modernizing its unclaimed property laws to promote consistency.accordingly,we reject amex contention that chapter lacks a legitimate state interest.
amex contests that even if there are legitimate state interests,chapter fails to rationally further these goals.because amex has the burden of rebutting every conceivable rational basis,see beach commc ns,at,we examine each of amex arguments in turn.
amex first argues that shortening the abandonment period has no rational relationship to increasing property protection because of travelers checks not used after three years are used within fifteen years.thus,amex contends,it is irrational to conclude that travelers checks can be presumed abandoned after three years.but the statistics also show that over of all travelers checks are redeemed within three years.decl.of susan helms at,am.express travel related,d.even if amex disagrees with the state legislature presumption that travelers checks unredeemed after three years are abandoned,the rational basis test does not require mathematical precision in the legislature decisions.see heller doe,d.l egislative choice may be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data.beach commc ns,at.thus,amex argument is insufficient to overcome rational basis scrutiny.
amex next argues that shortening the abandonment period for travelers checks does not further chapter stated purpose of modernizing the state unclaimed property laws.but the state has a conceivable legitimate interest in making its unclaimed property laws more consistent for ease of administration.chapter accomplishes this by making the abandonment period for travelers checks the same as checks,drafts,and other similar negotiable instruments.see stat.ann.b.amex responds that unclaimed property laws require establishing different time periods based upon the nature of the property,so consistency is not a rational basis for selecting an abandonment period.but state laws can not be invalidated based on mere policy disagreements.see casey,at holding that under rational basis scrutiny,courts are not free to invalidate state law because they disagree with the underlying policy decisions.because modernizing unclaimed property laws through consistent abandonment periods is a conceivable rational basis for enacting chapter,amex fails to overcome rational basis scrutiny 
in addition,the state legislature could have rationally believed that the shorter abandonment period better protected customers by giving custody of the property to the state at an earlier time.conceivably,there are benefits to having property safeguarded by a sovereign instead of a private entity with a greater risk of insolvency.in addition,the state can hold the travelers check funds in perpetuity and must invest unclaimed property funds more conservatively than amex is required to invest its tc funds.compare stat.ann.c permitting investment in any investment which is rated in one of the three highest rating categories by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization with stat.ann.restricting investments of funds of unclaimed property trust fund to government bonds or notes or obligations.the state has offered several legitimate interests that justify shortening the abandonment period for travelers checks from fifteen years to three years.chapter rationally furthers these interests,and amex does not meet its burden of defeating every conceivable basis that might support chapter enactment.see beach commc ns,at.therefore,amex fails to show a likelihood of success on the merits of its substantive due process claim.
contract clause 
the contract clause under article i,section,clause of the constitution provides that n o state shall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts.to ascertain whether there has been a contract clause violation,a court must first inquire whether the change in state law has operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship.motors romein,d citations omitted nieves hess oil virgin islands,cir citations omitted.if this threshold inquiry is met,the court must then determine whether the law at issue has a legitimate and important public purpose.transport workers union of,local.transp,cir.if so,the court must ascertain whether the adjustment of the rights of the parties to the contractual relationship was reasonable and appropriate in light of that purpose.id.where the contract is between private parties,courts may defer to legislative judgment as to the necessity and reasonableness of a particular measure.trust of new jersey,d.but this review of legislative judgment is more exacting than the rational basis standard applied in the due process analysis.pension benefit guar.gray,d.
amex fails to show that chapter imposes a substantial impairment on amex contractual relationships with tc owners.while amex has the right to use and invest tc funds until the date the tc is cashed or sold,the duration of use is further subject to the lawful abandonment period set by unclaimed property laws.the supreme court has long established that 
the contract of deposit does not give the banks a tontine right to retain the money in the event that it is not called for by the depositor.it gives the bank merely the right to use the depositor money until called for by him or some other person duly authorized.if the deposit is turned over to the state in obedience to a valid law,the obligation of the bank to the depositor is discharged.
sec.sav.bank california.citation omitted.in anderson national bank luckett,the supreme court again stated that s ince the bank is a debtor to its depositors,it can interpose no due process or contract clause objection to payment of the claimed deposits to the state,if the state is lawfully entitled to demand payment.citation omitted.like banks,amex,as a debtor to the tc purchasers,only has the right to use the funds received from issuing a tc until either the owner or the state,under a valid law,claims the funds.accordingly,a state ability to claim abandoned property in the travelers check context does not ordinarily substantially impair travelers check issuers contractual relationships or otherwise violate the contract clause see sec.sav.bank,at.
in assessing substantial impairment under the contract clause,we look to the legitimate expectations of the contracting parties,trust of,at,and whether the modification imposes an obligation or liability that was unexpected at the time the parties entered into the contract and relied on its terms.see allied structural steel spannaus,d.an important factor in determining the substantiality of any contractual impairment is whether the parties were operating in a regulated industry.see energy reserves,kansas power and light,d citing allied structural steel,at.when a party enters an industry that is regulated in a particular manner,it is entering subject to further legislation in the area,and changes in the regulation that may
