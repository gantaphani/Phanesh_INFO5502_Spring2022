hutton contracting company,a north dakota corporation based in colorado,contracted to construct a power line and a line for the city of coffeyville,kansas.upon completion of the project the city refused to pay the final out of the contract price of,claiming that it was entitled to these funds as liquidated damages because of hutton delays.hutton sued the city in the united states district court for the district of kansas to obtain the unpaid amount of the contract price.see diversity jurisdiction.after a jury trial the court ordered the city to pay hutton retainage of minus in liquidated damages to which the city was entitled.
hutton appeals from this judgment,challenging four holdings by the district court that the contract clause did not excuse hutton for delays caused by late deliveries from its pole supplier that the contract provision was enforceable that the provision allowed the court to apportion delays between hutton and the city and that hutton was not entitled to prejudgment interest on its damages.hutton also challenges a special interrogatory asking the jury whether the parties had modified their contract and the court responses to questions from the jury.we have jurisdiction under and affirm.
background 
contract and performance 
the contract between hutton and the city is dated march.the engineer designated for the project was allgeier,martin associates,the engineer.rather than specifying when construction was to begin,the contract contained the following provision 
hutton agrees to commence construction on the project on a date hereinafter called the commencement date which shall be determined by the engineer after notice in writing of approval of the contract by the city and notice in writing from hutton that hutton has sufficient materials to warrant commencement and continuation of construction,but in no event will the commencement date be later than see special conditions calendar days after date of approval of the contract by the city.
vol.iv at.the special conditions provide that t he starting date shall be no later than may,id.at,but this date never figures explicitly in the parties arguments.the contract contemplated completion of construction within days of commencement excluding sundays,with flexibility for bad weather 
hutton agrees to prosecute diligently and to complete construction phases as described in strict accordance with the plans,specifications and construction drawings within calendar days excluding sundays after commencement date provided,however,that hutton will not be required to perform any construction on such days when in the judgment of the engineer snow,rain,or wind or the results of snow,rain or frost make it impracticable to perform any operation of construction and to extent of the time lost due to the conditions described herein and approved in writing by the engineer,the time of completion set out above will be extended if hutton makes a written request therefor to the city 
id.at.a provision that both parties call a clause gave hutton more time to complete the project in exceptional circumstances,provided that it submitted requests for extensions in writing 
the time for completion of construction shall be extended for the period of any reasonable delay which is due exclusively to causes beyond the control and without the fault of hutton,including acts of god,fires,floods and acts or omissions of the city with respect to matters for which the city is solely responsible provided,however,that no extension of time for completion shall be granted hutton unless within ten days after the happening of any event relied upon by hutton for such an extension of time hutton shall have made a request therefor in writing to the city,and provided further that no delay in such time of completion or in the progress of the work which results from any of the above causes or from any changes in construction which may be made pursuant to subsection d of this section which allowed the city to modify the construction plans and provide extensions therefor shall result in any liability on the part of the city.time extensions due to weather will be considered only when hutton is on site.
the contract required the city to pay hutton within days of the project completion 
upon completion by hutton of the construction of the project,the engineer will prepare an inventory of the project showing the total number and character of construction units and,after checking such inventory with hutton,will certify it to the city together with a certificate of the total cost of the construction performed.upon the approval of such certificates by the engineer,the city shall make payment to hutton of all amounts to which hutton shall be entitled thereunder which shall not have been paid,provided,however,that such final payment shall be made not later than ninety days after the date of completion of construction of the project as specified in the certificate of completion,unless withheld because of the fault of hutton.
id.at.but the amount owed would be reduced by in liquidated damages for each day by which the completion of the project was late 
the time of the completion of construction of the project is of the essence of the contract.should hutton neglect,refuse or fail to complete the construction within the time herein agreed upon,after giving effect to extensions of time,if any,herein provided,then,in that event and in view of the difficulty of estimating with exactness damages caused by such delay,the city shall have the right to deduct from and retain out of such monies which may be then due,or which may become due and payable to hutton,the sum of five hundred dollars per day for each and every day that such construction is delayed on its completion beyond the specified time,as liquidated damages and not as a penalty.
the parties have disputed the contractual commencement date,the completion date,and the number of days of excused delay.both agree that a commencement date of august,was set at a preconstruction conference on august.but hutton asserts that the city set the date arbitrarily,aplt.br.at,and therefore contrary to the contract.in any event,hutton began clearing the construction first step in the construction august.
four days later hutton sent a letter to the engineer stating that some utility poles would not be available before late october.the letter requested that the commencement date be adjusted to october,due to the insufficient material being on hand.the delivery of steel poles has been the cause of this delay.vol.iv at.
the engineer eventually responded to this letter on october,agreeing to the proposed start date on condition that the project be completed within days 
you have requested to begin construction on october.we will arrange to have an inspector there on that day.you have further requested the contract commencement day be moved to october.we have discussed this with jeff tullis at the city of coffeyville and reiterate their position stated during the preconstruction conference and again with you by telephone.the city of coffeyville is willing to forgo liquidated damages provided that the project is entirely completed within days as defined in the contract,with construction beginning on october.should the project not be completed within that time,each day that the project extends past the day construction period would be subject to liquidated damages.days used for clearing,those during which hutton performed its original clearing work,before the new commencement date of october would also then be included in the liquidated period.
id.at.hutton commenced construction on october.
hutton noticed in november that some of the poles that had been delivered were defective.delivery of poles had started in.on december it requested another time for of the late delivery of the remaining poles.it also submitted several requests for extensions due to weather conditions.
the lines were ready for use by march.but for more than a year the parties disputed whether the project had been completed.in a fax on april,the engineer sent hutton a list of tasks that it needed to perform.hutton responded on may,asserting that all tasks had been accomplished.a november,fax from the city to hutton stated that cleanup was not yet complete.finally,on august,the city sent hutton a notice that it was retaining the balance due of.it attached a letter from the engineer asserting that work was just completed on july,and claimed that it was entitled to further liquidated damages for delay but it offered to settle by paying of the retainage.
court proceedings 
seeking the full retainage,hutton filed its suit on august.it claimed that it had performed all its duties under the contract and was entitled to the full contract price.it contended that the construction commencement date under the contract was october,that construction was substantially complete by march,that the city either approved or was obliged under the contract to have approved extensions of time,and that the contract excused it from responsibility for delays caused by its suppliers.hutton also alleged that the city had violated its duty of good faith and fair dealing under the contract by not granting extensions of time,requesting unneeded repairs,and failing to facilitate the completion of tasks.the city countered that the project was not complete until july,and that it had not improperly denied extensions of time.the parties also disputed whether the engineer letter of october,modified any terms of the contract.
the district court resolved several issues before sending the case to the jury.it held that the contract clause did not excuse hutton delay caused by late delivery of poles,because the supplier tardiness did not qualify as extraordinary,beyond the control or fault of the bidder,as the clause contemplated.vol.ii at.it stated that problems with the supplier were not totally without the fault of hutton because it made the conscious choice to contract with this supplier and assumed the risk that that supplier would perform so that it could,in fact,perform on its contract with the city.id.at.the court also held that the contract provision was enforceable.
the district court submitted several special interrogatories to the jury.one asked whether the parties had modified their contract in accordance with the terms described in the engineer october letter to hutton.another asked how many days worth of liquidated damages should be denied the city because of its breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.during deliberations the jury requested that the court explain how damages would be computed based on the number of days of delay,but the court responded that the monetary amount was not for the jury to decide.in response to the special interrogatories,the jury found that the parties had agreed to a construction commencement date of october,that construction had been completed on may,significantly more than days after commencement that days of delay were excusable because of weather and that the city had breached its contractual duty of good faith and fair dealing and therefore should not recover liquidated damages for days of delay.
in entering judgment the district court held that the city was entitled to liquidated damages due to hutton untimely completion of the project for days that are unrelated to the city breach of the duty of good faith.vol.i at.the court also denied prejudgment interest on its award to hutton,explaining that the amount of the damages was not liquidated until the jury reached a verdict and that under kansas law trial judges have discretion to deny prejudgment interest.the final judgment incorporated liquidated damages against hutton for days of delay attributable to hutton minus days for which liquidated damages should not be recovered by the city because of its breach of its duty of good faith and fair dealing.id.at.the liquidated damages for days minus was.the court subtracted that amount from the retainage of to determine that the city owed hutton.
ii.discussion 
kansas law governs the substantive issues in this diversity case,and we review de novo the district court determinations of state law.see boyd rosene.mun.gas agency,cir.we review for clear error the district court findings of fact.id.
the contract clause contains the following language 
the time for completion of construction shall be extended for the period of any reasonable delay which is due exclusively to causes beyond the control and without the fault of hutton,including acts of god,fires,floods,and acts or omissions of the city with respect to matters for which the city is solely responsible.
vol.iv at.hutton argues that late delivery of utility poles was beyond the control and without the fault of hutton.id.in essence it contends that it should be excused for all delays caused by its suppliers or subcontractors,at least when those delays arise without its fault and are beyond its control.the district court rejected this contention on the ground that hutton could be charged with fault in selecting the supplier.
in our view,the district court essentially got it right.the most reasonable interpretation of fault of hutton in the clause is fault of hutton and those to whom it delegates its responsibilities under the contract.the contract did not specify a source of the poles.the city was concerned only with the ultimate performance,not whom hutton employed to reach the result.under hutton interpretation of the clause,it could protect itself from liability arising from a particular type of delay simply by arranging that a contractual partner assume responsibility for that type of delay.in other words,delays could be excused or not depending solely on whether hutton chose to outsource a particular operation or line of supply.it would be absurd to assume that the city was concerned about delay only when caused by hutton,and not by a supplier or subcontractor that hutton decided to employ.not only would hutton interpretation provide a perverse incentive for contractors to outsource work and supplies needlessly,but it also ignores the potential legal remedies of the contracting parties.under hutton view the supplier,the one ultimately responsible for the delay,would be immune from paying damages.because hutton would have no liability to the city arising from the supplier delay,the supplier would owe nothing to hutton on that account.and it is unclear how the city could have a contractual cause of action against the supplier,whose contract is only with hutton.see melvin eisenberg,beneficiaries,colum,owner should ordinarily not have cause of action against subcontractor unless contractor becomes insolvent.if,however,hutton is liable to the city for the delay,it could seek relief from its supplier.in particular,if hutton is concerned about paying damages caused by a supplier delay,it can protect itself by paying the supplier a higher price and obtaining a clause in its contract with the supplier.
we do not suggest that hutton was at fault in its choice of supplier,only that it is responsible to the city for its supplier delays when those delays are not themselves excused by a force majeure.hutton does not suggest that the supplier failure was caused by a natural catastrophe or the like.in short,a delay by a subcontractor or supplier is not itself a force majeure.
in so holding,we are not stating a new rule of contract law.although we have not found a kansas case in point,courts have treated contractors as responsible for the performance of their suppliers and subcontractors.see,johnson mgmt.group cfc,martinez,a contractor is responsible for the unexcused performance failures of its subcontractor olson plumbing heating united states,the contractor alone is responsible for the deficiencies of its suppliers and its subcontractors absent a showing of impossibility.plaintiff failure to produce a system was due to the deficient design of its supplier and was not the fault of the government.accordingly,a contractor assumes the risk that its subcontractor or supplier will fail,at least when its contract with the owner does not call for a specific supplier or subcontractor to complete a task.decisions to this effect generally arise in cases analyzing the contract doctrines of impossibility and impracticability,but the lesson from such cases is nevertheless helpful in interpreting a clause.as one treatise puts it 
when a promised performance is known by both parties to be impossible unless some third party performs,it may be a reasonable interpretation that the promise is conditional upon performance by the third party.the performance would then be discharged if the third party does not do its part.this will usually not be the interpretation,however,if nothing is said about the third party contract or involvement in the contemplated performance.in this context,a division among courts has developed in the middleman cases,in which a seller agrees to supply a good to a buyer but then contracts with another party to manufacture the good courts have been more inclined to bind the middleman to the contract if the contract is silent on the source of supply,and more likely to release the middleman if the source is referenced in the agreement the originating source was more likely to be a basic assumption on which the contract was made a sole source of supply contract if the source is mentioned in the agreement.
corbin on contracts footnotes omitted.see also morin.prods.volk,in this case,morin assumed the risk of performance it assumed the risk that delivery of the metal siding would be delayed by problems with its subcontractors and suppliers.there is nothing in the contract between the parties which excuses morin for delays caused by its subcontractors or suppliers.thus morin had an obligation to timely deliver.
we should add that our holding is a limited one.the sole concern here is damages for delay when time is of the essence of the contract.we are not deciding whether the city could have declared hutton in default,sought another contractor,and recovered from hutton for the increased cost.united states wegematic,cir friendly,rejecting an argument that performance was impossible and upholding liquidated damages for delay,but noting that it was not deciding whether the government could have recover ed not merely liquidated damages for delay but also the higher cost of replacement equipment.
hutton suggests that the clause of the contract supports its interpretation of the clause.it contends that the contract must contemplate that hutton would be excused upon the late delivery of essential materials because the commencement date was to be set after notice in writing from hutton that hutton has sufficient materials to warrant commencement and continuation of construction.vol.iv at.but we draw the contrary inference.because hutton is to provide notice that it has sufficient material before the commencement date is set,one would infer that it is responsible if its notice turns out to be erroneous.in other words,its notice constitutes a representation that the supply of necessary material will be adequate to complete the project on time delay caused by lack of material is then its responsibility.we note that the clause itself makes no reference to the availability of materials.
hutton also argues that the city is partly responsible for the poles delay because of the city own delay in approving specifications.but even if this contention were correct,partial responsibility does not matter under the clause,which makes the city delays relevant only with respect to matters for which it is solely responsible.vol.iv at.the city contributions to delays could,however,affect the amount of damages to which it is entitled we take up that question below.
hutton final argument on this issue is that it qualified its bid based upon the supply of the poles.aplt.br.at.hutton bid included the following letter dated march,which hutton argues was adopted as part of the contract please be advised that this bid proposal is being submitted with material deliveries as follows steel weeks after receipt of order.vol.iv at.but hutton does not explain the relevance of this notice.the city asserts that all specifications for the poles were resolved by july,and that receipt of the poles weeks later,on november,would have been well within the completion time frame under the modified commencement date of october.aplee.br.at.hutton offers no argument in response.
for the above reasons,we affirm the district court determination that the clause does not assist hutton.
liquidated damages 
hutton challenges two rulings of the district court concerning the contract provision.first,hutton argues that the provision is not enforceable because it is a penalty.second,it argues that even if the clause is enforceable,the city breach precluded its recovery of any liquidated damages,so apportionment of delay between hutton and the city was improper.
enforceability 
under kansas law,t he burden of proving that a liquidated damages clause constitutes an unenforceable penalty rests with the party challenging the provision.ipc retail,oriental gardens,d.in other words,t he use of the terms penalty or liquidated damages in the contract is given weight and is ordinarily accepted as controlling unless the facts and circumstances impel a contrary holding.white lakes shopping,jefferson standard life ins,internal quotation marks omitted.kansas courts distinguish unenforceable penalties from enforceable liquidated damages using two considerations first,whether the amount is conscionable,that is,whether it is reasonable in view of the value of the subject matter of the contract and of the probable or presumptive loss in case of breach second,whether the nature of the transaction is such that the amount of actual damage resulting from default would not be easily and readily determinable.id.internal quotation marks omitted.kansas law echoes traditional principles in this respect.see restatement second of contracts cmt.b restatement.
there is some doubt,however,about the temporal perspective from which kansas law evaluates the reasonableness of the provision.in other jurisdictions some courts consider only the reasonableness of the provision at the time of contract formation.that is,only future damages,as conceived prospectively when the contract is made,are relevant in evaluating the reasonableness of a provision.see,kelly marx,in addition to meeting the parties expectations,the single look approach helps resolve disputes efficiently by making it unnecessary to wait until actual damages from a breach are proved.by reducing challenges to a liquidated damages clause,the single look approach eliminates uncertainty and tends to prevent costly future litigation.other courts additionally compare the amount that would be awarded under the provision with the actual damages a promisee suffered that is,they take an additional retrospective look at actual damages.see yockey horn,cir if the nonbreaching party has suffered no damages whatsoever from the breach,the restatement suggests that the clause will be unenforceable,no matter how reasonable the estimate of damages was at the time of contracting.interpreting restatement,supra,and applying illinois law.
although in white lakes the kansas supreme court evaluated damages only in prospective terms,our review of kansas cases finds no definitive discussion of whether kansas courts would also apply a supplemental retrospective analysis.accord kelly marx,conducting a review of rules and concluding,based on white lakes,that kansas is one of only a few states in which the choice between a single look or second look analysis is unclear,rev.the city argues that kansas requires only a single,prospective look at reasonableness.hutton,however,contends that we also need to take a second retrospective look at the city actual damages to determine whether the provision was reasonable.the city may be correct but we can assume,without deciding,that hutton view is kansas law.
we summarily dispose of hutton argument on appeal that the clause was not prospectively reasonable.its appellate briefs fail to cite any occasion when it made this argument in district court,and we have found none.absent special circumstances,we will not reverse on a ground not raised below.see wilson merrell dow,cir.therefore,we need not address the issue.
we reject hutton argument on the merits.under a retrospective analysis,we compare the liquidated damages with the actual loss the city sustained from the construction delay.hutton argues that the city suffered no damages because it suffered no loss in revenue from delay in energizing the power line.to make this argument,hutton cites a letter from the director of coffeyville municipal light power 
bottom line,the city was not losing revenue or suffering in any way from the project being late other than the inconvenience of having a few more loose ends to keep track of than necessary.
although we could ask for more,i propose to withhold from the final payment request by the contract to reimburse the city for the estimated in additional costs resulting from the extremely long construction period.
vol.iv at.hutton would have us read this letter as an admission by the city that it suffered no damages at all from the delay.but in addition to noting that no revenue was lost,the letter also alleges that the city suffered approximately in damages from the delay through increased engineering and inspection costs.nothing limits provisions to compensating for lost revenue.a reasonable provision may well accommodate increased engineering and administrative costs.because the award of liquidated damages was near the figure,the provision in this case was retrospectively reasonable.
apportionment 
hutton also challenges the district court decision to apportion delays between hutton and the city rather than denying the city liquidated damages altogether.the jury answers to special interrogatories regarding the commencement date and the completion date established that the project was delayed by days.the court subtracted days for which the jury found that the city should not recover liquidated damages because of its breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.in other words,the court adjusted the amount of liquidated damages on the ground that hutton was responsible for only some of the days of construction delay.
hutton argues that because the jury found that the city breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing,the city may not seek any liquidated damages under the contract.hutton relies on several old kansas cases,although it admitted at oral argument that these cases are not decisive and that the issue is essentially one of first impression under kansas law.the city for its part cites no cases supporting the contrary position.
we agree with hutton that kansas decisions do not resolve whether a party in breach may recover liquidated damages for the portion of a divisible delay not caused by its own breach.two decisions are somewhat supportive of hutton argument against apportionment.in ritchie city of topeka,the principal case relied on by hutton,the kansas supreme court considered a provision.the court held that an owner could not collect liquidated damages for a construction delay because the owner occasioned delay and in effect notified the other party that it did not regard the forfeiture clause of the contract to be binding upon him the owner was estopped thereafter to insist on a provision in the contract where it had prevented the performance and to compel the payment of damages for which the owner was in a large part responsible would be unjust and inequitable.id.at.ritchie,however,does not appear to have considered the possibility that the delay was divisible into delays caused by the contractor and delays caused by the owner.a more recent,although unpublished,kansas supreme court decision cited by hutton,busch mcginnis.lexis.june,holds that when one contracting party makes it impossible for the other party to perform or fails to perform a condition precedent,the first party can not recover damages when the second party breaches the contract.but busch is inapposite because the city did not make it impossible for hutton to perform,at least with respect to those days for which the city received liquidated damages,and it did not fail to perform a condition precedent.
on the other hand,luminous neon,parscale,d,provides some support for apportionment.it cited favorably in dictum a washington case that apportioned liquidated damages,baldwin national safe depository.luminous described baldwin as follows in an action by lessor of signs to recover rental payments from lessee,provision in lease specifying liquidated damages of all unpaid past due rentals plus percent of all future rentals was properly used as basis for apportionment of damage,notwithstanding plaintiff partial breach.luminous neon,at.yet this favorable reference to another jurisdiction case is far from a clear holding on the question before us.
hutton also cites two old cases from jurisdictions other than kansas as standing for the proposition that when a party breaches,it necessarily becomes ineligible to seek any liquidated damages under a contract.see bauman peters,smith city of tahlequah.we note that these cases may never have represented a consensus among jurisdictions,even in their era.see,wallis wenham,apportioning liquidated damages for delay stone ramey,same.but even if they did,they are now unpersuasive for two reasons.first,they appear to reflect a hostility to liquidated damages that arose from an outdated view that while parties could determine their own contractual obligations,damages were the province of the courts.see ernst,manhattan constr,cir noting early judicial hostility to the use of privately agreed upon contract damage remedies.second,they appear to rely,as was common for opinions of the time,on the notion that decisions followed naturally from axioms that were presumed to be example,the axiom that once a party has violated the terms of a contract,it has abrogated all terms in the same contract and can not then enforce rights under it.thus,tahlequah,at,cited by hutton,quotes favorably the following language from a hoary authority known as ruling case law 
the plaintiff can not recover liquidated damages for a breach for which he himself is responsible or to which he has contributed,and as a rule there can be no apportionment of liquidated damages where both parties are at fault.hence,if the parties are mutually responsible for the delays because of which the date fixed by the contract for completion is passed,the obligation for liquidated damages is annulled,and in the absence of some provision under which another date can be substituted,it can not be revived.and so it has been held that a provision in a contract to the effect that deviations may be made at the instance of the owner without annulling or invalidating the contract,does not operate to renew a right to liquidated damages for delay in completing the work after the provision therefor has been abrogated by delay to which the owner materially contributed.
id.at.it then summarizes this principle as follows the right to recover liquidated damages being once abrogated can not be renewed or revived except by subsequent agreement.id.
for some time now,however,kansas contract law has followed the parties intentions rather than formalism.see koepp pribyl,the purpose of the contract,so as to carry out the intention of the parties,is to be arrived at by considering and construing the instrument in its entirety.and when there are gaps in the contract,kansas courts will fill them with terms that are reasonable in the circumstances.unified sch.dist,quoting restatement,supra.we believe that whether we surmise what the parties views would have been when the contract was executed or whether we simply insert a reasonable term in that contract,damages for delay should be imposed for those delays,and only those delays,for which the contractor is responsible.apportionment of damages based on fault comports with modern notions of fairness,as reflected,for example,in the adoption of comparative responsibility in tort actions.and such apportionment can encourage efficient behavior.see stop loss ins.brokers,brown toland med.group,th,d.persuasive authority supports this approach.
the supreme court long ago so interpreted a government contract.in robinson united states,the court held that damages could be apportioned under a contract that it described as follows 
the original contract provided that the contractor shall be allowed one day,additional to the time herein stated,for each and every day of delay that may be caused by the government that no claim shall be made or allowed to the contractor for any damages which may arise out of any delay caused by the government,and that the contractor shall pay for each and every day delay not caused by the united states.
id.at.in an opinion by justice brandeis,the court reasoned 
the fact that the government action caused some of the delay presents no legal ground for denying it compensation for loss suffered wholly through the fault of the contractor.since the contractor agreed to pay at a specified rate for each day delay not caused by the government,it was clearly the intention that it should pay for some days delay at that rate,even if it were relieved from paying for other days.
although the williston treatise,relying primarily on older cases,concludes that delay caused by the parties is not generally apportioned,it recognizes an exception for construction contracts in circumstances similar to ours 
in building contracts,the architect often has the power to extend the time of performance under certain circumstances,and a delay caused by the owner operates merely as an extension of the time for performance,and a new time is substituted for the old.in that event though the owner causes delay the builder is liable in liquidated damages,but the period of delay caused by the owner is deducted from the total delay.
richard lord,williston on contracts ed footnote omitted.as in the situations described by the treatise,the clause in hutton contract with the city extends the time for completion for delays caused by acts or omissions of the city with respect to matters for which the city is solely responsible.vol.iv at,although hutton was required to request the extension within days of the event.
moreover,our review of decisions during the past years shows that a strong majority adopt our view.see worth reg l airport bd.combustion equip,cir approving,under texas law,apportionment of liquidated damages for delay based on fault of parties,although reversing because answers to special interrogatories were irreconcilable ernst,at aetna cas.sur.sanitary water,applying south dakota law,which had not addressed this issue,and stating that recent case law is clearly in favor of such apportionment of fault and that simply because defendant contributed to the delay in the completion of the project,it should not be barred from recovering liquidated damages.hertzberg nunn bush shoe in re const.diversification,t he rule simply does not apply to a situation where responsibility for discrete days of delay can be apportioned under a per diem liquidated damages provision.stop loss ins.brokers,th at,d rejecting the prior rule,california courts have applied apportionment principles to allocate contractual liquidated damages where delays in construction projects have been caused both by the owner and by the contractor.calumet constr.metro.sanitary dist.of greater chicago,d,applying what it calls the modern rule of apportionment.but see san.pac,calling the traditional rule the better rule higgins city of fillmore,utah even when an owner is not entirely responsible for the delay,but has contributed thereto,he may be precluded from obtaining liquidated damages.we believe that kansas would adopt the modern view and allow liquidated damages to be apportioned when faced with damages that are in fact divisible,as they were here.
at oral argument hutton suggested that the period of delay in this case was not in fact divisible,for a day of delay in one part of the year might because of weather,for instance be more significant than one in another part of the year.but the very purpose of the contract provision was to avoid requiring proof of the significance of individual days of delay the contract provides for an undifferentiated sum of per day,regardless of the time of year or other characteristics of the delay.now is not the time for hutton to contend that days of delay are nonfungible.
we affirm the district court decision to apportion delay in awarding liquidated damages.
prejudgment interest 
hutton contests the district court denial of prejudgment interest on its damages award.but its argument is without merit.under kansas law prejudgment interest is generally allowable on liquidated claims and may be allowable on unliquidated damages where necessary to arrive at full compensation.miller botwin.in either event the award is a matter which lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.id.at see also leeper schroer,rice,bryan lykins,prejudgment interest on liquidated damages is a matter of equitable discretion rather than a matter of legal right.we therefore review denial of an award for abuse of discretion.see hofer unum life ins.of,cir.
a claim becomes liquidated when both the amount due and the date on which it is due are fixed and certain,or when the same becomes definitely ascertainable by mathematical computation.the fact that a good faith controversy exists as to whether the party is liable for the money does not preclude a grant of prejudgment interest.miller,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the court award of to hutton did not represent a liquidated amount before the entry of judgment because the amount itself,not just the liability for that amount,was subject to dispute.see restatement,supra,cmt.c,illus.a contracts to build a bungalow for b for.after completion but before b has paid the final,b occupies the bungalow but refuses to pay the balance because the workmanship and materials are unsatisfactory.a sues b and recovers only on the ground that b claim entitles him to compensation in the amount of.the sum of was not sufficiently definite to give a a right to interest on it.the allowance of interest is within the discretion of the court.the fact that a was himself in breach will be considered.hutton asserts that at a minimum,some of the retainage was undisputedly due to hutton and therefore liquidated.oddly,though,it does not identify a particular liquidated amount.more importantly,its assertion is simply incorrect.hutton stated in its trial brief that coffeyville claims that the project was not completed timely and that it is entitled to an offset against any monies it owes to hutton for liquidated damages.aplee.at.similarly,hutton states in its opening brief on appeal that after hutton filed the present litigation,coffeyville claimed days of liquidated damages under the contract,for a total of.aplt.br.at.clearly,then,the city disputed that it owed any portion of the retainage to hutton,and no portion of the award of was liquidated prior to judgment.
in any event,whether or not the damages were liquidated,the district court acted well within its discretion in denying prejudgment interest,particularly because hutton was itself partially at fault and the city presuit letter of august,offered hutton more than what it later obtained through its judgment.
special interrogatory on modification of contract 
the contract between hutton and the city called for a commencement date to be determined by the engineer after notice in writing from hutton that hutton has sufficient materials to warrant commencement and continuation of construction.vol.iv at.at a preconstruction conference on august,this date was set at august,although hutton has contended that the date was not set properly.
on august hutton requested that the commencement date be adjusted to october,due to the insufficient material being on hand.id.at.the october response from the engineer conveyed the city acceptance of the request,but subject to a condition coffeyville is willing to forgo liquidated damages provided that the project is entirely completed within days as defined in the contract,with construction beginning on october.id.at.that is,the city proposed to agree to hutton request if construction was completed within days from the new date otherwise,the city reserved the right to seek liquidated damages for delays that occurred before october.
the jury found that the commencement date was october,and that construction
