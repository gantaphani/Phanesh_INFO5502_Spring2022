these matters are before us on the petition for rehearing en banc of appellants haynes trane service agency,and frederick haynes.we also have a response from american standard.
upon the panel consideration of both pleadings,the petition for rehearing is granted for the limited purpose of revising and adding a paragraph in the rule section of our opinion,on pages to.the opinion filed on april,is vacated and the attached revised opinion is substituted in its place.
the petition and response were also circulated to all of the judges on the court who are in regular active service.as no judge called for a poll,the request for en banc consideration of these appeals is denied.
this is the second appeal in litigation between frederick haynes haynes and haynes trane service agency haynestsa and american standard trane trane.for almost four decades haynes operated a franchise of trane,a manufacturer of heating,ventilation,and air conditioning hvac products.after receiving his franchise,haynes formed haynestsa,which initially functioned as a service wing of his operations.haynestsa later entered into a separate agreement with trane to distribute certain hvac products.the disputes arose when haynestsa cheated trane by abusing a rebate program under which trane would reduce the price it charged retailers,such as haynestsa,to enable them to meet the retail prices of products sold by their competitors.trane terminated its distributorship agreement with haynestsa and,shortly thereafter,terminated haynes franchise.haynes and haynestsa brought suit in the united states district court for the district of colorado.trane counterclaimed.
an initial jury trial and appeal,see haynes trane serv.agency,am.standard.cir haynes i,whittled the case down to the following claims haynes claim that trane,despite language in the franchise agreement permitting it to terminate the franchise at will,could terminate only for good cause which it lacked because statements and conduct by trane had either a modified the agreement to require good cause or b equitably estopped trane from denying that the agreement required good cause claims by both haynes and haynestsa that trane breached fiduciary duties and trane counterclaims against haynestsa a for fraud based on its abuse of the rebate program and b for unjust enrichment and an accounting arising out of haynestsa allegedly fraudulent acts 
before the second trial the district court ruled that trane claim added nothing to its fraud claim that its accounting claim was dependent on trane proving its fraud claim and that if trane did prove fraud,an equitable accounting would be performed because a jury would have difficulty calculating trane damages.at the close of the plaintiffs case at the second trial the court granted judgment as a matter of law jmol against the claim of haynes and the claims of haynes and haynestsa.the jury then returned verdicts that haynes had established the elements of his claim and that trane had established its fraud counterclaim.after the jury was discharged,the court ruled that haynes misconduct precluded application of an equitable doctrine in his favor and,despite the jury verdict,entered judgment for trane on haynes claim.and with respect to trane fraud claim,the court appointed a special master for an accounting to determine damages.before the special master heard any evidence,however,the parties stipulated that trane damages were.
haynes and haynestsa appeal.exercising jurisdiction under,we affirm in part and reverse in part.haynes claim was properly dismissed because haynes presented insufficient evidence that his franchise agreement had been modified,and his unclean hands gave the district court authority to deny him an remedy.we reject haynes argument that our rulings on the first appeal regarding the sufficiency of his evidence of modification bound the district court under the doctrine,because the evidence he presented at the second trial was materially inferior to the evidence that we considered on that appeal.in addition,the district court did not err in dismissing the claims of haynes and haynestsa,because they failed to establish the requisites of a fiduciary relationship.again,the doctrine does not assist haynes on this claim because the evidence at trial was materially inferior to the evidence that we considered on the first appeal.finally,the district court erred in appointing a special master to calculate trane damages,because the calculation was not too complicated for a jury.a recalculation of damages by a jury,however,will also require resolving liability issues,so we must remand for a full trial of trane fraud claim.
background 
a.the parties relationships 
the second trial lasted days.to put our analysis in context,we summarize here the essential evidence at that trial.additional evidence will be addressed in our discussion of specific issues.
haynes relationship with trane began in when he took a sales position at trane boston franchise.over the course of the next decade he took on increasing responsibility and in his efforts were rewarded with an offer to run trane denver franchise.the franchise agreement was for an indeterminate length,and provided that it could be terminated by either party upon days notice to the other.aplts.app.vol.xii at.
haynes formed haynestsa soon after he received the franchise.initially haynestsa was a service wing of haynes operations.its role expanded in,however,when it entered into an agreement with trane to distribute trane unitary hvac products,smaller units for residential and applications.although the initial agreement was for a term of five and months,it was renewed on a yearly basis the following five years in substantially the same form.either party could terminate the agreement at will upon proper notice.
central to this case is a flexible pricing program that trane developed through a series of policy statements or sales plan s provided to its distributors.the program helped trane distributors compete for business.thus,although the program was not set forth in haynestsa contract with trane,haynestsa had good reason to participate.
the program worked as follows if a distributor risked being underbid by its competition,it could request a lowered price quote from trane.if the request was granted,the distributor could then sell the product at a reduced price and claim back that is,seek from trane a portion of the reduction.id.vol.xiii at.as a precaution against error or fraud,distributors were required to accompany claimbacks with the invoice number for the sale and retain a copy of the invoice for two years,thereby enabling trane to determine whether a distributor ultimately sold the unit for the stated price.if a discrepancy was discovered before trane credited a claimback,trane adjusted the claimback but even after a claimback was credited,trane reserved the right to recover the amount of credit improperly claimed.id.vol.xiii at.
although haynes was president of haynestsa,he had little experience in the market and therefore hired willard forward to manage that company distributorship venture.forward and his subordinates gamed the claimback program in a number of ways.denice louder,a billing administrator at haynestsa,testified that at forward behest she routinely submitted claimbacks that stated a price quote below the actual price at which haynestsa sold the item.she also testified that haynestsa submitted some claimbacks for nonexistent projects and others for units that had been secretly sold to trane salesmen claimbacks were available only for units sold to final customers.all told,louder testified that nearly every one of the claimbacks that she submitted to trane contained something that was completely right.id.vol.xi at.
periodically,trane would request random invoices from haynestsa to determine whether the amount haynestsa billed a customer matched the price stated in a claimback.when there was a mismatch,louder would recreate or alter the customer invoice so that it comported with the claimback documents previously submitted to trane.but haynestsa was not able to conceal the fraud completely.haynestsa unusually high claimback rate that is,the percentage of units for which it sought a claimback led trane to conduct an audit of its books in.trane auditor would ultimately visit haynestsa offices on three,april,and april discover significant discrepancies between haynestsa claimback submissions and its customer invoices.
during the weeks between the announcement of the audit in mid or and the arrival of trane auditor on march,haynestsa employees engaged in a concerted,though ultimately unsuccessful,effort to replace customer invoices with fraudulent invoices that matched the representations supporting the claimbacks.this effort came to the attention of haynes when two employees,denice louder and vicki graves,told him that invoices were being retyped to give to trane auditors and that employees were,in effect,covering our tracks.id.vol.vi at.haynes asked haynestsa chief financial officer,steven moss,to investigate the matter.moss reported back to haynes that invoices were indeed being recreated for the claimback audit.
haynes,however,did not inform trane of the coverup,despite several opportunities to do so.he said nothing to trane auditor on march.on march a former haynestsa employee informed trane that haynestsa was generating false claimback documentation.trane officials flew to denver and confronted haynes with that accusation on march.during the meeting haynes adamantly denied that haynestsa kept two sets of books,id.vol.v at,again neglecting to mention that fake invoices had been typed for the audit.
during the continuation of the audit in april,the extent of haynestsa abuse of the claimback program became apparent.extrapolating from the limited sample of claimbacks reviewed,the auditor estimated that haynestsa had collected in undeserved claimbacks.trane also confirmed that haynestsa had attempted to conceal discrepancies by altering and recreating invoices.when trane confronted haynes with its findings,he asked for the auditor report so that he could investigate its accuracy he did not confess his awareness of the coverup effort.
on june trane terminated haynestsa distributorship agreement.shortly thereafter it gave haynes notice that it would terminate his franchise in days the length of notice required by the franchise agreement.when it terminated the franchise agreement,trane suspected that haynes was aware of the claimback abuses.that suspicion would be confirmed during the second trial when haynes testified that he had been aware before the march audit that haynestsa employees were recreating invoices to give to trane auditors.
procedural history 
the first trial and appeal in this case are relevant to this appeal insofar as our rulings on the first appeal established the law of the case,which the district court was presumptively obliged to follow on remand.that law of the case must be addressed in our discussion of three issues on appeal.but we postpone our summary of the earlier proceedings until our discussions of the issues.for now,we summarize only the proceedings after remand.
haynes primary allegation at the second trial was that trane breached his franchise agreement by terminating it without good cause.according to haynes,good cause was lacking because any abuse of the claimback program or subsequent coverup occurred at haynestsa,not at his franchise.although the franchise agreement stated that it was terminable at will after notice,haynes contended that it had been modified by trane consistent pattern of terminating franchises only for cause.alternatively,he alleged that various representations by trane induced him to rely on a requirement,which,under principles of equitable estoppel,trane could not deny.trane defended on the grounds that the franchise agreement had not been modified and that it had made no representations that could support an claim.it also asserted that haynes unclean hands made it improper to apply equitable estoppel for his benefit.
in addition,both haynes and haynestsa asserted that trane had breached fiduciary duties arising from a confidential relationship.they alleged that while trane had made gestures to induce their trust,it was in fact scheming to cut out middlemen and assume control of their operations.in their view,trane had used haynestsa erroneous claimbacks as an excuse to carry out this underhanded policy.trane denied that it had any fiduciary relationship with either plaintiff.
trane countered with a fraud claim against haynestsa,alleging that haynestsa had knowingly submitted false claimback requests and schemed to cover up its efforts.trane also raised claims against both plaintiffs for unjust enrichment and an accounting,specifying in the pretrial order that these equitable matters could be addressed by the district court at an appropriate time.id.vol.i at.in response to these counterclaims,the plaintiffs contended that trane fraud claim was precluded by the rule which bars certain tort claims for economic loss arising out of a contractual relationship and that trane equitable claims for unjust enrichment and an accounting were not maintainable because fraud damages would provide trane with an adequate remedy at law.id.at.
haynes and haynestsa did not prevail on any of their claims at trial.at the close of evidence the district court granted jmol against haynes claim.on his claim the jury found that he had established the elements of equitable estoppel and that trane had terminated haynes franchise agreement without good cause.but the court nevertheless granted judgment to trane on this claim,reasoning that haynes failure to inform trane of the claimback coverup made it improper to apply an equitable doctrine in his favor.as with haynes claim,the district court disposed of the plaintiffs claims by granting jmol against them at the close of evidence.
trane prevailed only on its fraud claim.during a pretrial hearing the district court had ruled that trane and accounting claims were not viable as freestanding equitable claims.at the same time,the court concluded that trane lacked an adequate remedy at law for fraud because having a jury review individual claimbacks to calculate damages would unduly prolong proceedings.accordingly,the court construed trane accounting claim as merely seeking a remedy for fraud,ruling that if trane prevailed on its fraud claim at trial,an equitable accounting would be performed to calculate its damages.the court rejected haynestsa argument during the same hearing.the jury then found that haynestsa had followed a pattern or practice of fraudulent conduct in submitting claimbacks.id.vol.ii at.over haynestsa objection,the court appointed a special master for an accounting of the amount of damages trane sustained.id.vol.iii at.but the special master never had occasion to calculate trane damages.after haynestsa reserved the right to appeal the special master appointment,the parties stipulated that trane fraud damages were.the district court adopted the parties damages stipulation and awarded trane an additional in prejudgment interest and costs.
haynes and haynestsa appeal,presenting the following issues whether the district court violated the law of the case determined in the first appeal by granting jmol against haynes contract claim whether the court exceeded its equitable authority and contravened the jury verdict by refusing to grant relief to haynes whether the court violated the law of the case by granting jmol against the plaintiffs claims whether trane fraud claim is barred by the rule and whether the jury should have been permitted to determine trane damages.we affirm the district court resolution of all issues but the last.
ii.discussion 
a.haynes.modification 
haynes contends that his franchise agreement with trane,which permits either party to terminate at will on notice,was modified by trane statements and conduct so that trane was required to have good cause before it could terminate the agreement.at the second trial the district court granted jmol on this claim at the close of the evidence.
haynes sole contention on appeal with respect to his claim is that the district court grant of jmol on this claim violated the law of the case by defying this court holding on the first appeal that he had presented sufficient evidence to support a verdict in his favor on the claim.to assess that contention we first address the merits of the district court decision.it will then be clear why haynes argument fails.
jmol can be properly granted when a party has been fully heard on an issue during a jury trial and has failed to present a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for the jury to find in its favor.a.in considering whether jmol is warranted,a district court must draw all reasonable inferences in support of the nonmoving party.see mcinnis fairfield,cir.we review a district court grant of jmol de novo.see id.
the parties assume that wisconsin law governs haynes franchise agreement and,in particular,whether that agreement was modified to require good cause for termination.we thus proceed from the same assumption.see grynberg total,cir adopting parties assumption of applicable law.under wisconsin law a contract can be modified by the conduct of the contracting parties but only when the acts are unequivocal in their character.nelsen farmers mut.auto.ins,internal quotation marks omitted accord carnes stone creek,cir applying wisconsin law.acts which are ambiguous in their character,and which are consistent either with the continued existence of the original contract,or with modification thereof,are not sufficient to establish a modification.nelsen,at internal quotation marks omitted.
thus,to prevail on his modification claim,haynes had to show that trane acted in a way that was unequivocally inconsistent with enforcing the franchise agreement as it was written,that is,as an agreement that could be terminated without cause.haynes did not meet this burden.at best,the evidence presented by haynes showed that trane had consistently provided cause when terminating franchises in the past.in particular,haynes testified that he had never heard of a franchise being terminated without cause and that,when discussing terminations,trane had always emphasized a cause.aplts.app.vol.v at.likewise,trane official don testified that every franchise termination of which he was aware had been with cause.id.vol.vi at.but a pattern of terminating with cause is not unequivocally inconsistent with retention of the power to terminate without cause.trane could properly reserve the extraordinary power to terminate without cause even though it had never had occasion to exercise that power.the wisconsin supreme court has recognized that prior failure to exercise a contractual right is not unequivocally inconsistent with enforcing that right.see presser siesel constr,failure to request construction of contractually required barricade not an unequivocal act that would support a contractual modification.
haynes attempts to overcome these legal principles with a argument.he correctly points out that in haynes i we held that the district court had erred in granting jmol against the same claim.haynes i,at.according to haynes,our decision in haynes i mandated that his modification claim go to the jury on remand.we disagree.
the doctrine generally dictates that prior judicial decisions on rules of law govern the same issues in subsequent phases of the same case.been,cir.the doctrine is not,however,an inexorable command our precedents recognize several exceptions to its operation.wessel city of albuquerque,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we have said,for example,that a judicial determination is not the law of the case in later proceedings involving substantially different evidence.id.internal quotation marks omitted.that exception applies here.haynes presented substantially weaker evidence of a contractual modification in the second trial.
in haynes i we noted three items of testimony that prevented the court from properly granting jmol haynes testimony that trane officials,at franchisee meetings,communicated trane policy of only terminating franchise agreements for cause,at haynes had testified that it was trane stated policy that they only terminated franchise holders for cause,aplts.app.vol.iv at the testimony of trane official don that he interpreted franchise agreements to require cause for termination,and that he had never terminated a franchise agreement without cause,haynes i,at and the testimony of another trane official,james schultz,that he was not aware of any time when a franchise agreement was terminated except for cause,id.
thus,the evidence presented at the first trial showed both a pattern of terminating for cause and,more importantly,a stated policy of terminating only for,one that a trane official felt was contractually required.aplts.app.vol.iv at haynes i.at.the evidence of a communicated policy was necessary to our decision in haynes i,because a policy of terminating franchises only for cause would be inconsistent with enforcing an provision.the absence of that evidence at the second trial for reasons unknown to us was a crucial difference.in that circumstance,the district court was not bound by our previous determination that jmol was improperly granted against haynes modification claim at the first trial.
equitable estoppel 
haynes argues next that even if the franchise agreement was not modified to contain a requirement,trane should have been equitably estopped from denying the requirement.under wisconsin law the doctrine of equitable estoppel has four elements action or,on the part of one against whom estoppel is asserted,which induces reasonable reliance thereon by the other,either in action or,and which is to his or her detriment.milas labor ass of.the jury found that haynes had established the elements of the claim.nevertheless,the district court refused to apply the doctrine for haynes benefit.the court reasoned that haynes did not fairly deal with trane in relation to haynestsa abuse of the claimback program.aplts.app.vol.iii at.it stressed that haynes had been told by haynestsa employees that they were retyping invoices in preparation for trane audit yet he did not relay this information to trane or its auditors.the court concluded that such misconduct by haynes must not be rewarded with a grant of equitable relief.id.at.on appeal haynes contends that the district court erroneously denied him the benefits of equitable estoppel.we review the district court refusal to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel for abuse of discretion.spaulding united transp.union,cir.legal determinations underlying the court decision are,however,reviewed de novo.see clark state farm mut.auto.ins,cir.
as haynes concedes,wisconsin law permits a court to deny relief despite proof of its four elements.o nce the elements of equitable estoppel have been established as a matter of law,the decision to actually apply the doctrine to provide relief is a matter of discretion.nugent slaght.in exercising its discretion,a court must take into consideration any other evidence and facts respecting the equities of the parties.id.internal quotation marks omitted see meyer reif,equity has always preserved the elements of flexibility and expansiveness quoting pomeroy,equity jurisprudence,mulder mittelstadt,same.
one factor considered by courts is whether the party requesting the remedy has engaged in substantial relevant misconduct.see.patients comp.fund mary hosp.of milwaukee.this concern flows from the general principle that only parties with clean hands can invoke equitable relief.id.internal quotation marks omitted.of course,a litigant unrelated misconduct may not be used to deny him an equitable remedy.see huntzicker crocker,equity does not demand that its suitors shall have led blameless and pure lives.to preclude relief,rather,the misconduct must be connected with the matter in litigation and have in some measure affected the equitable relations subsisting between the two parties.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
against this backdrop,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying haynes the benefit of equitable estoppel on the basis of his unclean hands.haynes sought an equitable decree that he was entitled to keep his franchise.his fitness as a franchisee is directly related to the relief he sought.by failing to inform trane that his employees had been retyping invoices in preparation for the claimback audit,haynes demonstrated his untrustworthiness as a franchisee,much less a business associate.it was not an abuse of discretion to deny equitable relief when the evidence of his misconduct established that he was unworthy of being a franchisee.mckennon nashville banner publ g,d doctrine not applicable to restrict relief under statute establishing important national policy against discrimination.
on appeal haynes argues that the district court decision to apply the doctrine against him nevertheless rested on several legal errors.he argues first that his misconduct should not have been considered because the decision to apply or deny equitable estoppel must be based on the equities of only those facts triggering the estoppel doctrine,the defendant conduct inducing the plaintiff detrimental reliance,and the resultant harm to the plaintiff.aplt.br.at.because haynes alleged failure to disclose haynestsa claimback abuse was not conduct establishing one of equitable estoppel elements,haynes concludes that the court was not free to consider it in denying him equitable relief.
to begin with,we doubt the coherence of the legal rule proffered by haynes.it is hard to imagine how parties invoking equitable estoppel could engage in misconduct that also established an element of equitable estoppel,such as reasonable reliance.in any event,haynes has not cited a case that expresses or supports his proposed rule.he relies almost exclusively on a string of cases in which unclean hands was not an issue.see crossarm,chem.specialties,d,affordable erecting,neosho trompler,milas,at nugent slaght,gonzalez teskey.
the only other case he cites applies the general rule that only misconduct related to the matter in litigation warrants application of the doctrine.fields,christensen,quoting huntzicker,at.the question in fields was whether the misconduct of a official prevented the center from enforcing against its medical director a covenant not to compete.id.the official had improperly held himself out as a physician and had deceived the internal revenue service by representing the clinic as a nonprofit organization entitled to status.id.but the court concluded that these misdeeds were insufficiently related to the controversy because they evidently did not prompt the medical director to leave the center and seek competing work.see id.to the contrary,the director attempted to negotiate a new employment contract with the center for several months after becoming aware of the misconduct.id.the case before us is readily distinguishable because trane never exhibited lack of concern about haynes failure to disclose his knowledge of the claimback coverup it had no occasion to do so because it did not know of the failure when it terminated his franchise.unlike misconduct acquiesced in,haynes dishonesty bears directly on the equitable relations subsisting between the two parties.huntzicker,at.
haynes also argues that by holding him responsible for haynestsa alleged abuse of the claimback program,the district court failed to honor haynestsa distinct legal status.this argument mischaracterizes the basis of the district court decision.in refusing to apply equitable estoppel,the court focused not on what haynestsa did,but rather on haynes personal failure to play straight with trane during its investigation.his wearing a haynestsa hat did not immunize him from the consequences of his own dishonesty.
haynes reply brief on appeal appears to raise another argument against the application of the doctrine against him.he suggests that this equitable doctrine applies only to freestanding equitable as promissory to an equitable doctrine applied in the context of a legal claim as equitable estoppel is applied to his claim.but he cites no supporting authority,nor does he account for the lengthy discussion in nugent regarding judicial discretion in applying the doctrine of equitable estoppel.see at.in any event,we need not pursue the issue further because we do not ordinarily review arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief.ferry gonzales,cir 
finally,haynes argues that the district court determination conflicted with the jury finding that trane lacked good cause to terminate his franchise.that finding,contends haynes,implies that the jury found that he had not engaged in wrongful conduct.thus,the district court determination that haynes acted reprehensibly that is,that his hands were unclean contradicted the jury verdict and thereby violated his right to a jury trial.we disagree.
true,the seventh amendment prevents district courts from applying equitable doctrines on the basis of factual predicates rejected,explicitly or implicitly,by a jury verdict.see bartee michelin,cir.if a jury resolves a factual issue,the court may not ignore that determination in fashioning equitable relief or applying an equitable doctrine.ag servs.of,nielsen,cir.but that is not the situation here.indeed,the district court determination rested on facts that the jury would not have had occasion to consider in its deliberations.in pertinent part,the court instructed the jury on good cause as follows 
y ou must also determine whether good cause existed when the trane company terminated the franchise agreement good cause is defined as a fair and honest cause or reason determined in good faith on the part of the person exercising the authority to terminate.good cause requires an exercise of good faith based upon reasonable,just,and fair grounds.reasons that are pretextual or based on improper motive do not constitute good cause.in determining whether the trane company had good cause for termination,you may consider whether the trane company decision followed an investigation of facts that was appropriate under the circumstances.
vol.x at.this instruction makes good cause turn on what trane reason was when it terminated haynes franchise.the jury would not have considered what trane did not know at the time of termination,such as haynes awareness that fraudulent invoices were being typed for trane audit.but it was this awareness that,according to the district court,dirtied his hands and required denial of equitable relief.accordingly,the district court determination rested on findings not precluded by the jury verdict.ag,at.haynes seventh amendment argument fails.
plaintiffs claims 
haynes and haynestsa have alleged that trane breached fiduciary duties arising from a confidential relationship.they claim that trane assumed fiduciary duties by inducing their trust,and breached those duties by maneuvering to squeeze,and ultimately seize control of,their operations.the district court granted jmol against these claims at the close of evidence,and the plaintiffs contend that in doing so it violated the law of the case established on the first appeal.as with haynes claim,we consider the merits of the claim before addressing the law of the case.our review is de novo.see mcinnis,at.
because the parties assume that trane fiduciary obligations if any were controlled by colorado law,we assume the same.see grynberg,at.under that law,to prevail on a claim based on a confidential relationship,the plaintiffs had to show that they reposed trust in trane doing so was justified or was invited,ostensibly accepted,or acquiesced in by trane trane assumed a primary duty to represent their interest s in the subject of the transaction the duty that arose by reason of the confidential relationship extended to the subject matter of their claims and they were damaged by the violation of that duty.equitex,ungar,internal quotation marks omitted.
we need not analyze the final four elements,for the plaintiffs evidence failed to satisfy the first.as the plaintiffs stress,haynes testimony could support the second element he stated,for instance,that trane management had told franchisees that they should trust the trane company,and that they were in a partnership type of relationship.aplts.app.vol.v at.he also testified that trane officials stated that philosophically,we strive to view and treat our distributors as a partner first,a customer second,and a friend third.id.at.but the plaintiffs had to show more to establish the first element they had to show that they actually reposed trust in trane.see equitex,at.they presented no evidence,however,that they trusted trane.
indeed,haynes testimony demonstrated that his relationship with trane was,if anything,one of deepening mistrust.he explained that as early as he and other franchisees had formed an association of franchisees in response to adverse trane policies.according to haynes,strong disagreements arose in the when trane limited the profits franchisees could draw from the sale of products before sharing with trane.haynes explained that franchisees generally felt very,very strongly that there was no reason for trane to participate in third party transactions,aplts.app.vol.v at,and that he personally viewed this and other trane conduct as an incursion on the managerial autonomy secured by his franchise agreement.moreover,haynes was not concerned merely with trane managerial overreaching there was a graver threat.haynes testified that in trane unveiled its plan to acquire its independent franchises.in sum,the evidence showed that the plaintiffs were on their guard in their dealings with trane.with no evidence of their reposed trust,there simply was not a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find in the plaintiffs favor.a.no fiduciary relationship existed.
the plaintiffs contend,however,that the doctrine requires that we reverse the district court rejection of their claims.they point to our holding in haynes i that the district court erroneously granted summary judgment against those claims.see.at.according to the plaintiffs,that holding precluded jmol in the second trial.we disagree.
as an initial matter,it is not certain whether a reversal of summary judgment operates as the law of the case to prevent a later grant of jmol.compare stagl delta air lines,cir rejecting contention that reversal of summary judgment was law of the case preventing jmol on ground that propriety of jmol is to be determined by the record that is made after remand,not by the law of the case doctrine,with kerman city of new york,cir law of the case bars jmol on evidence previously deemed sufficient to overcome summary judgment.but we need not resolve that issue here.even if a ruling on summary judgment can create the law of the case controlling a later jmol determination,an exception to the doctrine applies here.in haynes i we reversed summary judgment on the basis of an affidavit by haynes.see.at.in that affidavit he stated that,based on the parties relationship and a number of assurances made by trane,he did trust trane.aplts.app.vol.i at.this statement satisfied the first element of the claims.but,as noted above,his testimony at the second trial omitted this assertion.the district court did not depart from any legal principle established in haynes i by ruling at the second trial that the plaintiffs had not made out their claims.thus,the doctrine did not bar entry of jmol.see wessel,at.
trane fraud counterclaim 
we now turn to trane fraud counterclaim against haynestsa.trane alleged that haynestsa knowingly submitted false claimbacks and schemed to cover up those erroneous submissions by creating phony invoices.the jury entered a special verdict that haynestsa had followed a pattern or practice of fraudulent conduct in submitting claims for payment under the price assistance program.aplts.app.vol.ii at.haynestsa contends on appeal that trane fraud counterclaim is barred by colorado rule.it also contends that the district court erred in appointing a special master to calculate trane fraud damages.we disagree with the first contention but agree with the second.
whether the rule operates to bar trane fraud counterclaim is an issue of law that we review de novo.level commc ns,llc liebert,cir internal quotation marks omitted.again we apply colorado law because the parties arguments presume that it governs this claim.see grynberg,at.
colorado rule has been formulated as follows a party suffering only economic loss from the breach of an express or implied contractual duty may not assert a tort claim for such a breach absent an independent duty of care under tort law.town of alma azco.the rule does not bar damages claims for physical harm to persons or property.id.the colorado supreme court has explained that by limiting the tort liability of contracting parties,the rule aims to maintain the boundary between contract law and tort law.id.at.
in some other jurisdictions the rule focuses on the damages alleged and whether those damages can be sufficiently linked to performance or nonperformance under a contract.see cooper power,union carbide chems.plastics,cir applying wisconsin law hoseline,diversified,cir applying florida law.but the applicability of colorado rule turns on the nature of the duty allegedly breached,not the nature of alleged damages.see town of alma at see also id.at stating that colorado rule would be more aptly named the independent duty rule internal quotation marks omitted.even if a claim asserting only economic loss could be framed as a breach of contract,it is not barred by colorado rule if it rests on an independent duty of care under tort law.id.at.
under colorado law,for a duty to be independent of a contract,and thus actionable in tort notwithstanding the rule,two conditions must be met.first,the duty must arise from a source other than the relevant contract,at mentioning fiduciary duties and certain tort doctrines as examples.second,the duty must not be a duty also imposed by the contract.see brw,dufficy sons,grynberg agri tech.that is,even if the duty would be imposed in the absence of a contract,it is not independent of a contract that memorialize s it.brw,at.
trane correctly contends that tort law imposed a duty on haynestsa to abstain from fraud.see town of alma,at observing that a common law fraud claim is based on violation of a duty independent of contract.we do not understand haynestsa to argue otherwise.rather,the thrust of haynestsa argument is that its alleged scheme regarding claimbacks breached express contractual duties.the alleged duty under tort law,it asserts,was memorialized in its distributorship agreement with trane,which required it to submit accurate claimbacks and granted trane a right to recover any amount improperly claimed.aplts.app.vol.viii at.haynestsa contends that trane fraud counterclaim boils down to an allegation that these contractual duties were breached.
trane responds that the rule can not bar a tort claim for intentional fraud.but we need not reach that issue.haynestsa argument fails in any event because the tort duty alleged by trane is not duplicated in trane contract with haynestsa.haynestsa distributorship agreements,including the agreement that was terminated,say nothing about claimbacks.trane claimback policy is not contained in the contract between trane and haynestsa but solely in the sales plan s that trane provided its distributors to describe trane practices regarding claimbacks.id.at.
