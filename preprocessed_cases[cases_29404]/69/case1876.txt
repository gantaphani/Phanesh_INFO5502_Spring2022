christine brewer,a longtime waitress employed at the cottonwood golf club restaurant,quit her job in march.shortly thereafter,brewer filed this action against her employer,premier golf properties,lp,dba cottonwood golf club cottonwood alleging a cause of action for age discrimination,and seeking compensatory and punitive damages and attorney fees.her original complaint also alleged causes of action for meal break and rest break violations,and her first amended complaint added a fourth cause of action alleging other violations of the labor code.
after the first phase of the bifurcated trial,the jury special verdict on the age discrimination claim found in favor of cottonwood.brewer asserts the trial court erroneously excluded certain exhibits at trial and those errors were prejudicial and require a new trial on her age discrimination claim.
the other claims decided during the first phase of the bifurcated trial involved alleged labor code violations.the jury returned special verdicts in favor of brewer on most of her pleaded labor code violations,and awarded damages totaling less than for unpaid regular and overtime wages.the judgment also included approximately for unpaid meal and rest break wages,as pay stub penalties,and for minimum wage penalties.cottonwood appeal asserts the expiration of the statute of limitations barred the award of some of these penalties and brewer failure to exhaust her administrative remedies entirely bars her recovery of penalties.
the most significant monetary award was the punitive damages award.the jury,in a special verdict that accompanied the special verdicts exonerating cottonwood of age discrimination but finding labor code violations,issued a separate special verdict finding cottonwood had acted with fraud,oppression or malice toward brewer.a subsequent special verdict question was submitted to the jury to clarify the claim to which the malice finding applied.the jury answered that its malice conclusion was based on the labor code violations and not on the conduct underlying brewer age discrimination claim.the court then proceeded with the second phase of the trial to determine the amount of punitive damages,and the jury awarded as punitive damages.cottonwood appeal raises numerous challenges to the judgment,including that punitive damages are not available for the pleaded violations of the labor code 
the trial court,by a posttrial order,also awarded a portion of the attorney fees and costs sought by brewer.on appeal,both parties challenge this order.
common factual background 
brewer,a longtime waitress at the cottonwood golf course restaurant,worked the afternoon shift and was generally the only server.her remuneration was composed of an hourly wage paid by cottonwood and tips received from customers.
in july cottonwood bought the golf course and related amenities.the golf course facilities were old and its patronage was declining,and cottonwood sought to correct various management and accounting problems and to restore profitability to the business.
in december cottonwood hired longhauser as its food and beverage manager.he sought to change the ambience of the restaurant from a coffee shop atmosphere to a steakhouse atmosphere,and also opened a snack bar located on the golf course.after cottonwood decided to change the restaurant ambience,brewer was offered the position at the newly created snack bar,which she accepted.however,around january,approximately eight days after starting at the snack bar,brewer injured her back while performing her duties.shortly after brewer injured her back,cottonwood abandoned the snack bar concept.
brewer returned to work on february,and wanted to resume her former afternoon shift at the restaurant.longhauser knew she did not want to work the morning shifts,which were less lucrative because of the nature of the clientele.however,newly hired waitresses were then working the afternoon shifts,and longhauser therefore assigned brewer to work the less lucrative morning shift.this shift required that she be at work at,and she was later assigned to report at on march,brewer renewed her request to be assigned to the afternoon shift,but cottonwood denied the request because,b ased on the current customer profiles,staff sales and levels of productivity,cottonwood believed the overall profitability of the food and beverage business would be enhanced by retaining her assignment to the morning shift.a few weeks after her request for the afternoon shift was denied,brewer resigned.two months later,after obtaining a right to sue letter from the feha,brewer filed this lawsuit.
cottonwood appeal the underlying judgment 
cottonwood raises a series of challenges to the punitive damages award and to the damages and penalties awarded under various provisions of the labor code.
a.the underlying proceedings 
the pleadings and evidence 
the factual basis for the damages and penalties awarded under the labor code statutes were based on brewer claims that cottonwood violated the labor code in two distinct areas.first,brewer complaint alleged she was denied the meal breaks and rest breaks mandated by section there is substantial evidence to support the jury finding in her favor on those claims.brewer testified she was never provided those breaks,was never told she could take those breaks,and was specifically told she could not take those breaks.there were some days when she worked nine or hours without a break.
brewer first amended complaint also alleged cottonwood did not pay her the wages she earned for the hours she actually worked,and therefore did not pay her wages at the required minimum wage rate,and did not give her accurate itemized wage statements.there is substantial evidence to support the jury finding in her favor on those claims.at trial,conrad cottonwood controller conceded cottonwood was required to pay employees for every minute of work.however,brewer presented documentary evidence in the form of her time sheets and spread sheets summarizing those timesheets demonstrating that over the course of numerous pay periods cottonwood had underpaid brewer,both for the regular hours she worked and for the overtime she worked conrad conceded that,because brewer was paid the minimum wage,if cottonwood paid her for only a portion of the hours she actually worked on any given day,cottonwood did not pay her the minimum wage for that day.
the special verdicts and judgment 
the jury found cottonwood paid brewer less than the minimum wage,brewer was owed in unpaid wages,and she had not been paid the minimum wage for a total of pay periods.the jury also found cottonwood had paid brewer less than the legal overtime compensation,and brewer was owed in unpaid overtime wages.the jury found cottonwood had not provided brewer with meal periods on occasions,had not provided brewer with rest periods on occasions,and had on occasions knowingly and intentionally failed accurately to set forth the total hours she worked on her itemized wage statements.
the jury,although finding that cottonwood adverse job action against brewer was not based on her age,nevertheless returned a special verdict finding cottonwood had acted with oppression,fraud or malice.the court,after lengthy consultations with counsel,elected to submit a supplemental special verdict to the jury to clarify the factual basis on which the jury oppression,fraud or malice finding was premised the supplemental special verdict returned by the jury stated that its malice conclusion was based on the labor code violations and not on the conduct underlying brewer age discrimination claim.
over cottonwood objection,the jury then heard evidence solely related to cottonwood financial condition and considered the amount of punitive damages.the jury awarded.
the judgment 
the judgment,as entered by the court on february,based on the jury special verdicts,incorporated the jury awards for unpaid wages in the total amount of and punitive damages in the amount of.the judgment also included for wages due for meal period violations and for wages due for rest period violations apparently under section as penalties pursuant to section and in penalties pursuant to section the court also incorporated a provision entitling brewer to recover attorney fees and costs pursuant to section and costs pursuant to code of civil procedure section.
posttrial motions 
brewer moved for an award under section of costs in the amount of as supplementary to those costs she claimed under code civ.proc.and attorney fees of.the court denied her requested supplemental costs and awarded attorney fees in the total amount of.
the parties filed for jnov or alternatively for a new trial.the court denied brewer motion in its entirety,and denied cottonwood jnov motion.however,the court entered a conditional order on cottonwood new trial motion,ordering that cottonwood motion for new trial would be denied if brewer consented to a reduced punitive damages award of,but absent that consent,cottonwood new trial motion would be granted on the grounds of excessive damages.brewer accepted the reduced punitive damages award without waiving her appellate rights.both parties have appealed the judgment and orders 
punitive damages 
general principles 
there are two sets of guiding principles that inform our decision with regard to punitive damages.first,under california law,punitive damages are constrained generally by the restriction that they are ordinarily recoverable only in an action for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract where the requisite culpable conduct is also present.the word contract is used in this section in its ordinary sense to mean an agreement between the parties,not an obligation imposed by law despite the absence of any such agreement.ward taggart cal d.accordingly,when the cause of action is based on an agreement between the parties,rather than ex delicto obligations arising by law,punitive damages are ordinarily not recoverable,even where the defendant has violated his or her obligations maliciously or in bad faith.applied equipment litton saudi arabia cal th,d.
second,because the claims on which brewer recovered involved violations of statutorily imposed obligations that accreted to the employment contract between cottonwood and brewer,the availability of damages may also be constrained by the new remedy doctrine.as explained in de anza santa cruz mobile estates homeowners de anza santa cruz mobile estates th,d,that doctrine provides that w here a statute creates new rights and obligations not previously existing in the common law,the express statutory remedy is deemed to be the exclusive remedy available for statutory violations,unless it is inadequate.italics added accord,rojo kliger cal d,in such situations the statutory remedy is exclusive,stevenson superior court cal th,d.however,when the statute merely recognizes a cause of action because the claim had a preexisting common law analogue,then all forms of relief granted to civil litigants generally,including appropriate punitive damages,are available unless a contrary legislative intent appears.turnbull turnbull ara transportation,d.turnbull.
we are convinced,both by application of the new remedy doctrine and under more general principles that bar punitive damages awards absent breach of an obligation not arising from contract,punitive damages are not recoverable when liability is premised solely on the employer violation of the labor code statutes that regulate meal and rest breaks,pay stubs,and minimum wage laws.
we agree with cottonwood contention,which brewer does not dispute on appeal,that the labor code statutes regulating pay stubs and minimum wages create new rights and obligations not previously existing in the common law.moreover,those same statutes provide express statutory remedies,including penalties for the violation of those statutes that are punitive in nature,that are available when an employer has violated those provisions.section,subdivision e,provides that any employee suffering injury as a result of a knowing and intentional failure by an employer to comply with the pay stub requirements is entitled to recover the greater of all actual damages or fifty dollars for the initial pay period in which a violation occurs and one hundred dollars per employee for each violation in a subsequent pay period,not exceeding an aggregate penalty of four thousand dollars,and is entitled to an award of costs and reasonable attorney fees.similarly,section,subdivision a provides that any employer who pays or causes to be paid to any employee a wage less than the minimum wage shall be subject to a civil penalty as follows for any initial violation that is intentionally committed,one hundred dollars for each underpaid employee for each pay period for which the employee is underpaid for each subsequent violation for the same specific offense,two hundred fifty dollars for each underpaid employee for each pay period for which the employee is underpaid regardless of whether the initial violation is intentionally committed.here,brewer sought and recovered the maximum penalty available for cottonwood pay stub violations,and the judgment contained an additional penalty of pursuant to section for the overtime violations.we are not persuaded by brewer argument that the remedies set forth in the statutory scheme were not intended to be the exclusive remedy available for statutory violations and brewer does not articulate any basis for concluding those penalties are so inadequate that other remedies should be permitted.
similarly,the regulations requiring employers to provide meal breaks and rest breaks,tit,subd.a,and providing numerous forms of remedies for their violation,also appear to have created new rights and obligations not previously existing in the common law,and the statutory scheme provides a comprehensive and detailed remedial scheme for its enforcement.rojo kliger,supra,cal d at.those remedies include an award in the nature of liquidated damages under section murphy kenneth cole productions,cal th,d,because damages from missed meal and rest breaks are obscure and difficult to prove,the legislature may select an amount of compensation for the violation without converting that remedy into a penalty for statute of limitations purposes,injunctive relief see generally,and potential statutory penalties see we are convinced that,because the meal and rest break provisions of the labor code established a new and comprehensive set of rights and remedies for employees and n o such specialized rights and remedies existed at common law the remedy provided in the statute is exclusive of all others unless the statutory remedy is inadequate.quoting turnbull,supra,d at.de anza santa cruz mobile estates homeowners de anza santa cruz mobile estates,supra,th at,d.
brewer argues that turnbull and commodore home systems,superior court cal d,among other cases,have concluded that w hen a statute recognizes a cause of action for violation of a right,all forms of relief granted to civil litigants generally,including appropriate punitive damages,are available unless a contrary legislative intent appears commodore,at,turnbull,supra,d at,regardless of whether the right embodied in the statute had a common law analogue that would have supported a cause of action for which punitive damages were recoverable.neither case supports brewer argument.the language contained in turnbull was dicta,because that court ultimately concluded the statute in issue there did limit the plaintiff to the prescribed statutory remedies.turnbull,at.commodore is equally inapposite.in commodore,the court evaluated whether an employee,who alleged he was discharged because of his race,could recover punitive damages even though such damages were not identified as a recoverable damage under california fair employment and housing act feha.commodore concluded punitive damages were recoverable,based in part on the absence of any statutory delineation of the remedies available in civil suits,but more importantly because the common law already recognized a tort cause of action for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy that supported recovery of punitive damages,including wrongful discharge based on racial animus.commodore,at.because the feha expressly disclaimed an intent to repeal any califor
