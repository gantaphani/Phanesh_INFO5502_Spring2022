facts and procedural background 
from to,bob farrell opened farrell ice cream parlours farrell around the united states.in,he sold all of them to marriott corporation,which opened an additional restaurants.around,marriott sold the ice cream parlors,only to take them back three years later.marriott shut down all farrell operations in the,except for a single farrell operating in san diego.
chan,who had worked at a farrell ice cream parlour as a teenager,formed kirin and in bought the farrell trademarks and trade names.in november he opened a farrell in temecula but closed it in early because it was not profitable.
before closing that farrell,kirin entered into a series of written agreements with parlour in to develop farrell subfranchises in california.the agreements consisted of an area development agreement ada and a rider to the ada.the ada gave parlour the exclusive right to subfranchise farrell in california,subject to kirin written consent and except for kirin reserv ing to itself the right to itself,or through an affiliate,own and operate farrell ice cream parlour restaurants which are located a minimum of two and a half miles in any direction from an existing restaurant or a restaurant then under construction in accordance with a franchise agreement or an approved subfranchise agreement under the subfranchise agreements,parlour was to receive an fee and royalties in the form of a percentage of the net sales.
the ada required parlour to open a minimum number of restaurants within a certain time period.parlour ultimately opened only one store within the required time,a farrell in santa clarita,which opened in.the limited partnership that owns the center provided the funds.before then parlour had been unable to find any investors.
parlour was also unsuccessful in obtaining investors for additional restaurants.accordingly,parlour set up the limited partnerships of fun foods block and fun foods to fund the building of farrell at the block in orange and in aliso viejo,respectively.for both partnerships,the limited partners contributed percent of the funds.
in december,kirin and parlour executed a settlement and mutual release agreement,which extended parlour time to open the second restaurant to december and gave it an additional year to open the other restaurants.the parties thereafter signed an amendment to the settlement agreement.kirin terminated the ada in october for parlour refusal to pay over in attorney fees relating to the amendment.
parlour,fun foods,and fun foods block sued defendants.parlour alleged causes of action for breach of contract,intentional fraud,negligent misrepresentation,and defamation.fun foods and fun foods block brought a claim for interference with prospective business advantage.
at trial plaintiffs expert,robert wunderlich,testified to the amount of damages caused by defendants conduct,referencing eight locations in his analysis.three of them,the block,aliso viejo,and fresno,had specific plans for opening a restaurant.for these he calculated franchise fees and lost profits owed to parlour.for the one location already open,santa clarita,and the remaining four locations,wunderlich assessed only franchise fees owed to parlour.the fees included a charge,plus royalties in the form of a percentage of the gross sales.
projections provided by parlour formed the starting point of wunderlich analysis for both the franchise fees and lost profits.wunderlich did not know who created the projections or his or her education,training,or experience.but he knew the projections were prepared on behalf of parlour principals,who were experienced in these sorts of businesses.if parlour had not provided the projections,wunderlich would have had to develop them himself.
he also used these projections to determine expenses and bench marked that by looking at actual expenses and analyzing the financials of the santa clarita location and in general for the industry.he did not use parlour projections for the first two years but rather allowed for a ramp up time.as wunderlich explained,so the first two years have lower sales than actually were contained in this projection.and then beyond year,that when i reached the stabilized period and used parlour projections.
in addition,wunderlich obtained market data about a couple of dozen ice cream parlors.he looked at the publicly available information for one chain of restaurants called friendly,a publicly traded company.according to wunderlich,friendly is a chain of about or so restaurants,which is similar to farrell in that it has both the ice cream end and the food end.the earnings projected by parlour were lower than the friendly chain,which indicated to him that parlour projections were reasonable.he also considered some projections from ice cream stores,but relied more on the data for friendly because it had both the ice cream component and the food component,where the others were purely ice cream parlors,smaller operations than ones which would be serving a full menu.
he further considered the two farrell that were open,santa clarita and san diego.to determine san diego revenues,expenses,and profits,wunderlich spoke only to parlour principals.for santa clarita,the profit and loss statement covered the entire center,precluding wunderlich from determining the restaurant profit and loss from its operations alone.but he was able to do a rough appraisal of the net profits by allocating or apportioning expenses.he looked at line items,tagged some of the expenses as or,and allocated the rest according to revenue.he determined that the santa clarita restaurant was generating a positive profit when he did a reasonable allocation of the operating expenses to the restaurant.
the sales from santa clarita were lower than plaintiffs projections,which he concluded was because it did not receive business but rather most of its business tended to be from people already there at the arcade,as opposed to itself being a big attraction.and so in plaintiffs view,the santa clarita location was not as attractive of a location as the other s for which they had plans.for that reason,he did not use the actual santa clarita numbers as a starting point for his other estimates.
wunderlich started with revenues and deducted expenses,such as labor,rent,insurance,and other items of overhead to arrive at net profit.he divided the amount of damages suffered by plaintiffs into three categories loss of franchise fees a charge plus a percentage of revenue,lost profits,and extra expenses incurred in implementing the ada.he calculated that parlour lost franchise fees would be about million,lost profits for the block,aliso viejo,and fresno would be about million million for the block,for aliso viejo,and million for fresno,and the extra expenses incurred collectively by plaintiffs would be,for a total of about million.
as to the lost franchise fees,wunderlich took a percentage of the gross revenue,and adding a flat fee,discounted it to present value.according to wunderlich,franchise fees are based only on a percentage of revenue s o you do have to consider expenses.you do even have to consider profitability.a s long as the stores are open and earning revenue,parlour would receive franchise fees.
for the in extra expenses,wunderlich separated the expenses between parlour,fun foods block,and fun foods.using parlour bank account records,he added up the expenses that would be wasted if it could not develop the locations,which totaled.he did the same thing with fun foods block and fun foods and determined their extra expenses were and,respectively.
a jury found in plaintiffs favor on all causes of action except defamation.it awarded parlour million,fun foods and fun foods block million.the trial court denied defendants motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for new trial.
after oral argument,plaintiffs filed a supplemental letter brief on issues raised by the court.we ordered the letter brief filed and allowed defendants an opportunity to respond.plaintiffs moved to strike portions of defendants reply letter brief and subsequently applied to file a reply to defendants opposition.the motion to strike is denied.the application to file a reply to defendants opposition is granted.
discussion 
defendants contend the evidence was insufficient to support the damage award because the expert opinion on which it was based was so speculative that the trial court should have excluded the opinion and the opinion can not constitute substantial evidence to support the verdict.we agree in part.
general legal principles 
damage awards in injury to business cases are based on net profits.citation.electronic funds solutions,llc murphy th,d.net profits are the gains made from sales after deducting the value of the labor,materials,rents,and all expenses,together with the interest of the capital employed.citation.citations.a plaintiff must show loss of net pecuniary gain,not just loss of gross revenue.citations.kids universe th,d kids universe.
where an established business operation is prevented or interrupted,damages for the loss of prospective profits that otherwise might have been made from its operation are generally recoverable for the reason that their occurrence and extent may be ascertained with reasonable certainty from the past volume of business and other provable data relevant to the probable future sales.citations.kids universe,supra,th at,d,citing grupe glick cal d.on the other hand,lost anticipated profits for an unestablished business whose operation is prevented or interrupted are generally not recoverable because their occurrence is uncertain,contingent and speculative.nevertheless,they may be recovered where the evidence makes reasonably certain their occurrence and extent.citations.kids universe,supra,th at,d certainty as to the amount is not required reasonable certainty is sufficient.id.at,d.these principles apply to both tort and contract cases.id.at,d.
i f the business is a new one or if it is a speculative one,damages may be established with reasonable certainty with the aid of expert testimony,economic and financial data,market surveys and analyses,business records of similar enterprises,and the like.kids universe,supra,th at,d.t he experience of similar businesses is one way to prove prospective profits.citations.also relevant is whether the market is an established one.citations.id.at,d see jon kreedman meyers.d.a plaintiff or a third party prior experience in the same or similar business has been held to be probative citations as has a plaintiff or a third party experience in the same or similar enterprise subsequent to the interference.citations.kids universe,supra,th at,d.similarly,prelitigation projections,particularly when prepared by the defendant,have also been approved.citation.the underlying requirement for each of these types of evidence is a substantial similarity between the facts forming the basis of the profit projections and the business opportunity that was destroyed.citation.ibid.e xpert testimony alone is a sufficient basis for an award of lost profits in the new business context when the expert opinion is supported by tangible evidence with a substantial and sufficient factual basis rather than by mere speculation and hypothetical situations.citations.id.at,d.
we apply these principles to plaintiffs evidence with respect to their claims for lost profits,lost franchise fees,and consequential expenses.
lost profits 
wunderlich calculated lost profits for restaurants located in the block,aliso viejo,and fresno.these had specific plans for opening,but were unestablished businesses for which lost prospective profits are recoverable only where the evidence makes reasonably certain their occurrence and extent.citations.kids universe,supra,th at,d.we conclude the evidence does not make this showing.
wunderlich calculations for these three locations relied on projections provided by parlour,market data about friendly and a couple of dozen other ice cream parlors,plus the two open farrell.we discuss these in turn.
proforma projections 
defendants criticize wunderlich calculations for relying on groundless proforma projections.bold and capitalization omitted.they contend the projections were speculative because they contained disclaimers stating the projections were not based on actual operations,were not assured to reflect actual results,and were estimate s of start up expenses of the project.they further assert that wunderlich had no idea of the source of the projections other than he received them from parlour or its attorney.the expert did not know the qualifications,education or training,if any,of the person or persons preparing the projections or methodology used in preparing the projections.defendant contentions have merit.
the projections that formed the basis for wunderlich opinion were from an offering circular prepared by parlour and given to potential investors.they were not based on actual operations,but rather consisted of parlour assumptions for the next five years.each contained disclaimers that the income and expense estimates might not reflect actual results.the record does not reveal the method used to calculate the projections.
there is evidence that paul kramer,parlour chief operating officer and secretary,prepared the projections with the help of court huish,a parlour officer.kramer had been involved in the restaurant business for many years,actively overseeing the operation of numerous restaurants and participating in restaurant franchising.this experience gave him intimate knowledge of the industry,including raising capital,hiring staff,and providing proper training.huish holds a master degree in business administration and is also experienced in the restaurant business,including years working for the huish family fun centers,during which time it purchased and sold franchises.later huish invested in and helped raise nearly million for three fun centers in idaho,utah,and colorado.
despite their extensive experience,neither testified to any particular qualifications that would allow them to predict income,expenses,or profits for a farrell,as opposed to any other restaurant.nor did anyone testify as to the facts underlying the projections or the calculations used to prepare them.there was no testimony they based their predictions on the operation of the single farrell that parlour was able to open in santa clarita or on any other actual numbers that would be reliable indicators of future income,expenses,or profits of a farrell in another city.
kramer did testify that he consulted with chan in preparing the projections.chan admitted he had discussed the projections with kramer and a parlour shareholder,and that we backed into our numbers,meaning we knew what we had to do in order for this to be economically viable.chan further admitted that,based on the fact that the projections are estimates,or proformas,you ca really say they inaccurate.they could be optimistic,but they not necessarily inaccurate.but none of this shows how the projections were actually calculated or upon what facts they were based.
although prelitigation projections are relevant and admissible,especially when they are prepared by the defendant kids universe,supra,th at,d jon kreedman meyers,supra,d at,the projections must nevertheless be based on facts that are substantially similar to the lost business opportun
