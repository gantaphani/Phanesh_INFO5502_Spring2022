factual background 
the project 
the queen anne place school project the project involved construction of a new elementary school in los angeles.in march,following competitive bids required by law,the district contracted with lewis jorge construction management,lewis jorge to construct the project for approximately million.by late,the district became dissatisfied with lewis jorge,and on february,the district declared lewis jorge to be in material breach and default.at that time,lewis jorge claimed it had completed work totaling million,or approximately percent of the original contract price 
on april,the district governing board adopted a declaration of emergency pursuant to public contract code section which allowed the district to enter into a contract to complete the project without advertising for or inviting bids.the district then sought completion cost proposals from other general contractors.completion of the project required correction of certain work performed by lewis jorge.to assist potential contractors,the district created a list that identified the remaining work and work to be corrected.the district received cost estimates from three general contractors,including hayward,and ultimately selected hayward to complete the project.
the completion agreement between hayward and the district 
in june,hayward and the district entered into a completion contract for the project completion agreement.paragraph of the completion agreement states that the contract can be generally described as a cost plus percentage fee with a guaranteed maximum,pursuant to which the district agreed to pay hayward for cost of work,labor,and actual costs,plus a fee of percent calculated as a markup on the actual costs incurred.paragraph states 
contractor guarantees that the maximum amount payable by the district for the cost of the work plus the contractor fee described in paragraph will not exceed four million five hundred thousand dollars.
in paragraph,the parties agreed that the scope of hayward work included the items listed on the list.that paragraph states 
the contractor obligation to complete the work in accordance with this completion agreement and the contract documents shall include the responsibility to correct deficiencies in the work performed by the former contractor,without limitation,as noted on the current correction list issued by the district.
the correction list referred to in this paragraph consists of a list prepared by the district architect,and an list prepared by the district inspectors.the final entry on the architect list states corrections or comments made in regard to the list during this review do not relieve the contractor from compliance with the requirements of the drawings and specifications.this review is only for general conformance with the design concept of this project and general compliance with the information given in the contract documents.the contractor is responsible for confirming all quantities,dimensions and techniques of construction coordinating all work with that of all other trades and performing his work in a safe,acceptable and satisfactory manner.
each page of the list prepared by the district inspectors contains the following caption this is a courtesy list and should not be taken as a final inspection punch list.this is not the punch list of minor corrective items made at the final inspection.
after hayward and the district executed the completion agreement,great american issued a performance bond for million that guaranteed hayward performance of the contract.
hayward work and the district advance of sums exceeding million 
not long after hayward commenced work,a dispute arose between hayward and the district concerning work that was not listed in either of the lists.this work included correcting defects in the stucco work and subsurface defects in the bathroom tile work.in december,hayward advised the district that many unforeseen conditions made it necessary to increase the contract price beyond million.in may,the board of education allocated million to complete the project.after the board action,the district issued a purchase order for million to complete the project.payment was made to hayward under an express reservation of rights,which stated that the advancing of costs to hayward is without prejudice to all of the district rights to recover the monies advanced against all responsible parties,including hayward and its surety company if appropriate.
in early february,the parties met to discuss the payments.on february,the district wrote hayward a letter explaining the district position that cost of the work in excess of million,plus certain change orders,were hayward contractual responsibility.the district demanded that hayward and its surety,great american,return more than million the district paid to hayward over and above the million contract price.hayward and great american refused,and in march the district commenced this action.
procedural background 
the complaint 
the district complaint alleged breach of contract,breach of performance bond,and declaratory relief.the district sought a declaration that the completion agreement required hayward to complete construction of the queen anne place elementary school project,including all deficiencies existing in the project at the time hayward commenced work thereat whether such deficiencies were latent or patent,and that hayward agreed to so perform,all for the guaranteed maximum price payable by the district of.hayward and great american filed answers to the complaint,and hayward for breach of contract,rescission,and declaratory relief 
the district motion for summary adjudication 
in june,the district moved for summary adjudication on the issue of contract interpretation.specifically,the district sought a ruling that hayward was contractually obligated to complete all work on the project,including all deficiency corrections,for a guaranteed maximum cost of million.in opposition,hayward argued that triable issues of material fact precluded summary adjudication of this issue and that the completion agreement was ambiguous as to the scope of hayward obligation to correct deficient work.hayward proffered extrinsic evidence to support its position and argued that the trial court was required to consider this evidence on a provisional basis before determining whether or not the contract was ambiguous.the district objected to hayward evidence as inadmissible extrinsic evidence being presented to vary,alter add to the terms of an integrated written instrument in violation of california law.the trial court agreed with the district,and on august,issued a minute order sustaining the district objections to evidence in support of hayward opposition to the summary adjudication motion.without indicating whether or not it had given provisional consideration to hayward evidence,the trial court concluded that t he contract is not ambiguous.the trial court then granted the district motion for summary adjudication on the issue of contract interpretation,concluding 
hayward had a duty under the contract to complete the project by performing all work in conformance with the completion agreement and the contract documents including the responsibility to correct deficiencies in the work performed by the former contractors without limitation as notes on the correction list issued by the district.in the contract each of the parties contracted for certain risks in exchange for certain benefits.hayward was required to do the work for an amount not to exceed million.
the district motion to bifurcate legal issues and motion for judgment on the pleadings 
in september,the district moved to bifurcate trial on six legal issues,and the trial court granted the district request to try two of these issues whether contract modifications were required to be in writing,approved by the district board,and signed by both parties and whether district field representatives had legal authority to modify the contract.
the district also filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings relating to hayward rescission and declaratory relief claims.in its motion,the district argued that the completion agreement was a contract awarded pursuant to statutory competitive bidding requirements and could not be set aside as a matter of law.the district maintained that the completion agreement was a continuation of the competitively bid lewis jorge contract,which was never extinguished,but which had been transitioned to hayward pursuant to article of the lewis jorge contract 
in january,the trial court granted the district motion for judgment on the pleadings,relying on california case law holding that a contractor may not abandon a public contract and seek recovery under equitable remedies,because public works contracts may only be made under prescribed modes.see amelco city of thousand oaks cal th,d,amelco.the trial court stated 
hayward is subject to a public contract which arose initially by competitive bidding.it was altered and modified as required by public contract code section d through article as well as public contract code section.this transition does not exempt it from public contract code section d neither hayward nor the court can,therefore,rescind the contract to invoke some form of equitable recovery.
on the two bifurcated legal issues,the trial court concluded that all change orders for payment for extra work must be in writing and signed by the parties,and that all change orders for extra work must be in writing and approved by the district.it also concluded that the field representative s of the district did not have the authority to alter,amend,modify and or change in any way the completion agreement and the contract documents.the trial court then invited briefing on the question of whether or not there were any writings which conform to paragraph of the completion agreement obligating the district to pay more than the million plus executed change orders.
hayward identified a purchase order which it claimed obligated the district to pay more than million.on march,the trial court ruled against hayward,finding,among other things,that the purchase order did not bind the parties because it was not signed.the trial court then concluded that the district was only obligated to pay the million contract price plus executed change orders.in its march,minute order,the trial court requested briefing by the parties identifying any remaining legal issues.
the remaining issues 
in response to the trial court march,order,the district submitted briefs on four legal issues whether hayward was obligated to repay the district in funds advanced over and above the million contract price whether great american was jointly and severally obligated to repay the whether hayward claims for interest,penalties,and attorney fees were no longer viable and whether hayward breach of contract cause of action based on misrepresentation was no longer viable.the district maintained that these issues could be decided as a matter of law,in light of the trial court previous rulings on the district motion for summary adjudication and motion for judgment on the pleadings.hayward argued that the trial court prior rulings were erroneous and that unresolved factual issues precluded the trial court from deciding,as a matter of law,the issues identified by the district.
great american joined in hayward arguments and claimed the right to assert all of hayward affirmative defenses.great american also identified the following remaining legal issues relating to the district claim on the performance bond whether hayward completed the projected and corrective work noted on the punch list for million,thereby exonerating great american obligation on the performance bond whether the work performed by hayward over the million was outside the scope of the contract whether great american is liable under the terms of the performance bond for sums paid by the district in excess of million whether,in light of the trial court ruling on the district motion for summary adjudication that the contract was not ambiguous,hayward obligations under the completion agreement were limited to patent defects pursuant to paragraph of that agreement and what preclusive effect,if any,the consent of surety had on great american defenses.
on may,the trial court ruled that hayward could not maintain a cause of action for breach of contract based on misrepresentation,because hayward recitation of the facts does not contain any showing that any omissions were actively concealed or that material information was intentionally omitted by the district.the trial court further determined that great american was jointly and severally obligated to repay amounts owed by hayward to the district.the court stated the issues raised by great american regarding hayward obligations have been previously decided.great american performance bond is a broad form bond obligating it jointly and severally with hayward to repay the d istrict the monies it overpaid hayward under its reservation of rights.the trial court then ordered hayward and the district to file briefs setting forth any remaining legal issues.
in response,hayward briefed two issues whether or not the district breached implied warranties that the plans and specifications were complete,accurate,and free from defects and whether the district breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.on september,the trial court ruled against hayward on these two issues.the parties agreed to meet and confer and to file a joint statement on the remaining legal issues.
the parties agreed that certain issues involved factual questions to be presented to a jury at trial the parties also agreed that issues relating to the district entitlement to prejudgment interest,attorney fees and costs should be resolved through posttrial motions.the parties were unable to reach agreement on a joint statement,however,and submitted separate briefs on the remaining legal issues.
in its brief,the district argued that several of hayward and great american affirmative defenses to the district claim for repayment of were based on undisputed facts that had been presented previously to and considered by the trial court in ruling on the district motion for summary adjudication and motion for judgment on the pleadings.the district maintained that unless hayward or great american presented new facts supporting those affirmative defenses,the trial court prior rulings were dispositive as a matter of law.
hayward contended that issues remained concerning several of its affirmative defenses.great american joined in hayward contentions and in addition,claimed the following of its own affirmative defenses remained for trial waiver,estoppel and unclean hands fraud,misrepresentation and concealment district breach of contract and contract terms mistake mitigation of damages fault of others no proximate cause and failure of conditions.
the november,hearing 
a hearing on the remaining legal issues was held on november.the minute order for that hearing states as to hayward and great america n request for trial on the affirmative defenses to the district breach of contract action,this court has previously ruled.these issues were previously raised or could have been raised prior to the court rulings as reflected in the minute orders of august,january,and march.on november,great american filed an exception to the trial court november,ruling,claiming that the issues on the affirmative defenses were never determined,or were erroneously determined,in prior hearings and rulings,and that great american had been denied due process because the trial court november,ruling was without notice or opportunity to be heard.
at a status conference on september,the trial court granted great american leave to file a motion for an order determining that the completion agreement was legally invalid because the district emergency declaration pursuant to section was inadequate.great american filed its brief in support of this motion on october.on october,great american also filed a request for clarification on the trial court ruling granting the district motion for summary adjudication.
on november,the trial court stated that its ruling granting the district motion for summary adjudication was based on both the district emergency declaration pursuant to section and the trial court determination that the completion agreement was not a separate contract but a continuation of the competitively bid lewis jorge contract.the trial court also concluded that the completion agreement was not illegal but was validly let and modified pursuant to public contract code d and article of the lewis jorge contract as well as public contract code,the emergency declaration statute.
a judgment in the amount of,less an offset of pursuant to a stipulation of the parties,was entered against hayward and great american,jointly and severally.prejudgment interest on the sum of was also awarded to the district.judgment was also entered in favor of the district on all causes of action asserted in hayward.
after entry of judgment,the district moved for its attorney fees and costs pursuant to section.on april,the trial court granted the motion and awarded the district,jointly and severally against hayward and the district.
this appeal followed.
contentions 
hayward contends the trial court erred in granting the district motion for summary adjudication concerning the scope of hayward obligation under the completion agreement because the trial court failed to consider credible extrinsic evidence to determine if the contract is reasonably susceptible to hayward interpretation the trial court erred by concluding,as a matter of law,that the completion agreement could be modified by only one method and that,because this method was not followed,hayward was precluded from pursuing a claim for extra work the trial court improperly granted the district motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that hayward could not maintain a cause of action for rescission the trial court erroneously concluded that hayward could not sustain a breach of contract claim against the district based on the theory of implied warranty and the trial court erred by denying hayward a right to trial of factual issues including alleged misrepresentations by the district.hayward further contends that,because the underlying judgment must be reversed,the postjudgment fee award must also be reversed.
great american adopts all of hayward contentions.in addition,great american contends the trial court erred by concluding as a matter of law that great american was jointly and severally liable with hayward to repay to the district sums paid to hayward over and above the million contract price the trial court erred in determining that the completion agreement was legal and enforceable and the trial court erred in denying great american a jury trial on its affirmative defenses.great american further contends the trial court erroneously concluded that great american was jointly and severally obligated to pay the district attorney fees under the terms of the performance bond the amount of attorney fees awarded to the district was excessive and,because the underlying judgment must be reversed,the attorney fee award must also be reversed.

extrinsic evidence 
hayward and great american contend the trial court committed reversible error by not considering,on a provisional basis,extrinsic evidence proffered in support of hayward interpretation of the completion agreement.the trial court concluded that the parol evidence rule excluded such evidence because it was being offered to alter,vary,or add to the terms of an integrated contract.
the parol evidence rule is codified at civil code section and code of civil procedure section it generally prohibits the introduction of any extrinsic evidence,whether oral or written,to vary,alter or add to the terms of an integrated written instrument.citations.alling universal th,d.the parol evidence rule does not,however,prohibit the introduction of extrinsic evidence to explain the meaning of a written contract if the meaning urged is one to which the written contract terms are reasonably susceptible.citations.bmw of am.new motor vehicle bd.d,fn.
where the meaning of the words used in a contract is disputed,the trial court must provisionally receive any proffered extrinsic evidence which is relevant to show whether the contract is reasonably susceptible of a particular meaning.citations.i t is reversible error for a trial court to refuse to consider such extrinsic evidence on the basis of the trial court own conclusion that the language of the contract appears to be clear and unambiguous on its face.wolf superior court,supra,th at,d.
the decision whether to admit extrinsic evidence involves a process.first,the court provisionally receives without actually admitting all credible evidence concerning the parties intentions to determine ambiguity,whether the language is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation urged by a party.if in light of the extrinsic evidence the court decides the language is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation urged,the extrinsic evidence is then admitted to aid in the second the contract.citation.asp properties group,fard,th,d,citing winet price th,d.when a dispute arises over the meaning of contract language,the first question to be decided is whether the language is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation urged by the party.if it is not,the case is over.citation.citation.people ex rel.lockyer reynolds tobacco th,d,citing oceanside fid.fed.bank th,d.
the extrinsic evidence proffered by hayward and rejected by the trial court included the declaration and deposition testimony of toby hayward,an officer of hayward,and the deposition testimony of a hayward employee named jeff bahr.in his deposition testimony,hayward stated that during initial contract negotiations with the district,he discussed with district representatives the scope of hayward obligation to correct defective work performed by the previous contractor and expressed the view that hayward responsibility was limited to items listed on the list.hayward further testified that district representatives told him during initial meetings that hayward would not be required to tear apart walls to view underlying conditions to determine whether they were constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications.bahr testified that when hayward encountered certain defects in the tile work early on during the project,district representatives mike merritt and steve olshan stated that correcting those defects was outside the scope of hayward work because they were not listed on the list.
the record does not indicate whether the trial court provisionally considered this extrinsic evidence before concluding that the contract was not ambiguous.the trial court did not expressly find that paragraph of the contract was not reasonably susceptible to hayward interpretation.we can not conclude,on the basis of the record before us,that it is not so susceptible.
the contract language itself is not so clear and explicit that it is unambiguous on its face.it states that hayward obligation to complete the work shall include the responsibility to correct deficiencies in the work performed by the former contractor,without limitation,as noted on the current correction list issued by the district.hayward contends that the phrase as noted on the current correction list issued by the district refers to hayward responsibility to correct deficiencies in the work performed by the former contractor.the district maintains that the phrase as noted on the current correction list issued by the district unambiguously refers to the two words immediately preceding it without limitation.the current correction list mentioned in paragraph,however,does not state that hayward obligation to correct defective work performed by the previous contractor was without limitation and encompassed both patent and latent defects.the architect list contains the general disclaimer that the items listed therein are the result of a review only for general conformance with the design concept of this project and general compliance with the information given in the contract documents.it further states that c orrections or comments made in regard to the list during this review do not relieve the contractor from compliance with the requirements of the drawings and specifications.the district inspectors list states that t his is a courtesy list and should not be taken as a final inspection punch list.this is not the punch list of minor corrective items made at the final inspection.the following corrections and omissions are noted to prevent their being overlooked and should not be construed to be the punch list of minor corrective items made at the final inspection.neither document states that hayward obligation to correct defective work included latent as well as patent defects in the work performed by the previous contractor.
we reverse the trial court order granting summary adjudication in the district favor and remand the matter for the trial court to consider extrinsic evidence relevant to interpretation of the contract.because the trial court,on remand,will determine the scope and extent of hayward contractual obligation to correct defective work performed by the previous contractor,we need not,at this juncture,address hayward argument as to whether the contract was or could be modified to allow payment for additional work.

trial court ruling and the parties contentions 
the trial court granted the district motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the third,fourth,and fifth causes of action for rescission and declaratory relief in hayward on the grounds that the completion agreement was a public contract which arose initially by competitive bidding subject to section,subdivision d,and that n either hayward nor the court can,therefore,rescind the contract to invoke some form of equitable recovery.hayward contends the trial court decision was erroneous because it adjudicated matters beyond those pleaded in the,and because,as a matter of law,the remedy of rescission is available when a public entity misrepresentation and concealment of material information constitute a breach of contract.
the district contends that section,subdivision d applies,because the completion agreement was not a separate contract,but merely a continuation of the lewis jorge contract,which had been competitively bid pursuant to section.the district claims that it transitioned the lewis jorge contract to hayward pursuant to article of that contract,which accorded the district the right,in the event of a contractor default,to complete the contract by whatever method the district may deem expedient.the district maintains that its emergency declaration under section was simply an independent basis for transferring the contract from lewis jorge to hayward.as support for its argument,the district relies on the common law doctrine known as the continuing contract exception.see,shore central contra costa sanitary dist.d.shore,and garvey school dist.paul,garvey.
applicable law 
sections and 
section requires school districts to award contracts for public projects by competitive bidding.subdivision b of that statute provides in part the governing board shall let any contract for a public project involving an expenditure of fifteen thousand dollars or more,to the lowest responsible bidder who shall give security as the board requires,or else reject all bids.
the competitive bidding requirements of section do not apply to all public projects.acret,cal.construction contracts and disputes ed.section excepts from competitive bidding requirements certain contracts entered into in emergency situations in an emergency when any repairs,alterations,work,or improvement is necessary to any facility of public school to permit the continuance of existing school classes,or to avoid danger to life or property,the board may,by unanimous vote,with the approval of the county superintendent of schools,m ake a contract in writing or otherwise on behalf of the district for the performance of labor and furnishing of materials or supplies for the purpose without advertising for or inviting bids,subd.a.
section,subdivision d 
section,subdivision d,governs the termination,amendment,and modification of contracts entered into by public agencies.subdivision d of that statute states where authority to contract is vested in any public agency,excluding the state,the authority shall include the power,by mutual consent of the contracting parties,to terminate,amend,or modify any contract within the scope of such authority.section,subdivision d states that subdivision d of the statute does not apply to contracts that are subject to competitive bidding requirements paragraph shall not apply to contracts entered into pursuant to any statute expressly requiring that contracts be let or awarded on the basis of competitive bids.contracts of public agencies,excluding the state,required to be let or awarded on the basis of competitive bids pursuant to any statute may be terminated,amended,or modified only if the termination,amendment,or modification is so provided in the contract or is authorized under provision of law other than this subdivision.the compensation payable,if any,for amendments and modifications shall be determined as provided in the contract,subd.d.
section,subdivision d does not apply 
section,subdivision d,by its terms,applies to public contracts required to be let or awarded on the basis of competitive bids pursuant to any statute.the parties do not dispute that the completion agreement was not entered into pursuant to statutory competitive bidding requirements.section,subdivision d accordingly does not apply.
the district contention that its contract with hayward was not a separate contract,but merely a continuation of the competitively bid lewis jorge contract,is not supported by the record.before entering into the completion agreement,the district board of education adopted a declaration of emergency under section,authorizing the district to enter into contracts for the completion of the project without competitive bidding.the completion agreement itself refers to that emergency declaration.it makes no reference to article of the lewis jorge contract,the provision now invoked by the district as the means for transferring the lewis jorge contract to hayward.although the completion agreement incorporates the terms and conditions of the lewis jorge contract,it does not state that it is a continuation of,or transfer of the lewis jorge contract,nor has the district provided any evidence of the parties intent to do so.
the continuing contract exception,on which the district relies as the basis for claiming the completion contract was subject to competitive bidding requirements,is inapplicable.the continuing contract exception is a common law doctrine courts have applied to uphold the validity of a contract entered into by a public agency without complying with statutory notice and competitive bidding requirements in certain emergency situations.for example,in garvey,supra,the court determined that a school district could,without publishing notice for competitive bids,enter into contracts necessary to complete a project initially undertaken by a contractor to whom the work had been awarded by competitive bid.the court reasoned that competitive bids were not necessary because the initial contract had not been abandoned,and the school district was proceeding in accordance with the terms of a contract still in existence,which had been let according to law,and which by its terms provided for the then existing emergency.id.at.in shore,supra,d,the continuing contract exception was applied to uphold the validity of a contract let by a county sanitation district to complete a sewer project left unfinished by a defaulting contractor.the court in shore reasoned that the subsequent contract was a mere continuation of the county existing,and admittedly legal,contract with the previous contractor.id.at.
garvey and shore are inapposite.neither case addressed rescission of a public contract under section,subdivision d.moreover,both garvey and shore predate the enactment of section,which excepts contracts entered into by a school district in emergency circumstances from the statutory competitive bidding requirements relied upon by the district in this case.added by stats,ch,derivation,former,enacted by stats,ch,former,enacted by stats,ch,former,enacted by stats,ch,former school code,former political code,enacted by stats,ch.the continuing contract exception does not support the conclusion that the completion agreement was a competitively bid contract subject to section,subdivision d.the trial court erred by concluding that section,subdivision d bars hayward rescission causes of action as a matter of law.
amelco does not bar hayward rescission claims 
the district contends that amelco,supra,cal th,d,bars hayward rescission causes of action.that case,however,is inapposite.amelco concerned a contractor claim to set aside a public works contract awarded pursuant to competitive bid on the theory that the parties had abandoned the contract change order process,and to recover in quantum meruit for the actual cost of the project.the court in amelco concluded that allowing contractors to recover in quantum meruit for the actual as opposed to the bid cost of a project would encourage contractors to bid unrealistically low,with the hope of prevailing on an abandonment claim,and would be fundamentally inconsistent with the competitive purpose of the bidding statutes.id.at,d.
the completion agreement at issue here was not entered into pursuant to the competitive bidding statutes,nor is hayward seeking to recover its actual costs under an abandonment theory of liability.the court in amelco did not hold that rescission claims may never be asserted against a public entity,or that a contractor may never recover for extra work caused by a breach of contract.amelco accordingly does not bar the rescission causes of action asserted in hayward.
we reverse the trial court order granting the district motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the causes of action for rescission and declaratory relief in hayward 
hayward of implied warranty claims 
the trial court concluded that hayward could not maintain a for breach of contract based on misrepresentation or nondisclosure of material facts because hayward recitation of the facts does not contain any showing that any omissions were actively concealed or that material information was intentionally omitted by the district.citing jasper construction,foothill junior college dist.d.jasper,the trial court stated that a breach of contract action for misrepresentation or against a public entity must involve an affirmative misrepresentation or an intentional.the trial court further noted that hayward admitted in deposition that it neither possesses nor is aware of any evidence of such affirmative misrepresentation or intentional concealment.
there is a conflict in authority as to whether a contractor must prove intentional concealment by the public agency in order to recover on a claim for nondisclosure of material facts.compare jasper,supra,d at.jasper and thompson pacific construction,city of sunnyvale th,d thompson with welch state of california d.welch see also acret,cal.construction contracts and disputes,supra.the first and sixth district courts of appeal have concluded that a showing of intentional concealment is necessary.in jasper,supra,d at page,the first appellate district stated that there must be an affirmative misrepresentation or concealment of material facts in the plans and specifications in order for the contractor to recover on a breach of implied warranty claim.the sixth appellate district is in accord in order to recover on such an action,the contractor must prove that the agency affirmatively misrepresented,or actively concealed,material facts which rendered the bid documents misleading.thompson,supra,th at,d.both courts reasoned that affirmative misrepresentation or concealment is required to avoid burdening public entities with liability where the contractor underbids due to lack of diligence in examining specifications and plans which are themselves accurate.citation.thompson,supra,at,d,quoting jasper,supra,at.
the third district court of appeal,on the other hand,has rejected a requirement of affirmative misrepresentation or active concealment.in welch,supra,d,the trial court concluded that a state agency was not liable for misrepresentation or nondisclosure in an action by a public works contractor because the contractor failed to prove that the agency actively and intentionally concealed information concerning site conditions that significantly increased the cost of repairing an underwater pier.the third district reversed the judgment,reasoning as follows it is well established that,in a tort context,the suppression of a fact by one who gives information of other facts which are likely to mislead for want of communication of that fact is actionable.citations.in such context,there is no requirement of proving an affirmative fraudulent intent to conceal.citation.the same premise applies logically to public construction contracts where liability is based on breach of an implied warranty instead of a tort theory.citation.hence,the state had a legal duty to disclose information if to do so would have eliminated or materially qualified the misleading effect of the misrepresentation id.at.
one authority has suggested that this conflict in the case law can perhaps be reconciled by the following careful elucidation non disclosure of a material fact is itself an affirmative act sufficient to constitute active misrepresentation.acret,cal.construction contracts and disputes,supra.the same authority notes,however,that i f this reasoning is not persuasive,welch appears to be the better authority.jasper appears to be contrary to the weight of authority across the united states,at least insofar as it limits liability to instances of positive misrepresentation.ibid.
we agree that the standard set forth in welch is the better one and apply that standard here.hayward may maintain a for breach of contract based on nondisclosure of material information if it can establish that the district knew material facts concerning the project that would affect hayward bid or performance and failed to disclose those facts to hayward.we therefore reverse the trial court ruling that hayward can not,as a matter of law,maintain a against the di
