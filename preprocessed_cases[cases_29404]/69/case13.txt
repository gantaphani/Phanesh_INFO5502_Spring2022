on july,jbw which stands for john wilson was registered as a massachusetts limited liability company.jbw operating agreement stated that its specific business purposes and activities contemplated by the founders of this llc included to invest in stocks,bonds,derivatives,commodity futures,financial futures,stock index futures,options on stocks,and options on futures.
wilson was listed as the only registered agent in the operating agreement and the certificate of organization,and in an affidavit,wilson said that he was the manager and sole administrator of jbw.wilson was also listed as the only manager in the operating agreement,which said that except as otherwise specified or provided under state law,all management decisions relating to the llc business shall be made by and be the sole responsibility of the manager.wilson that he was the only person with trading authority over jbw account.
wilson did not register as a commodity pool operator cpo with the cftc,nor did he file a notice with the national futures association nfa stating he was exempt from registration.before his tenure with jbw,wilson had been registered with the nfa from about to as an associated person of tradex group llc.he also previously had a personal commodity futures account,which wilson testified was not profitable.
in september,wilson brother and a number of acquaintances invested in jbw.wilson referred to these investors as founders.their investments were used to create a fund,and jbw began trading in october,in part using an algorithm called the humphrey program.by january,jbw had thirteen investors and approximately in contributions.according to a cftc division of enforcement investigator,jbw bank records showed that between and,at least investors deposited about million in jbw bank account.
wilson testified that he did not tell his investors that he had limited experience trading on commodities,though he agreed that he had limited experience.there was no requirement that the investors have trading experience,and as far as wilson was aware,the investors,other than his brother,had no experience in futures trading.he said that he told some,but not all,of the investors about the risks involved with commodity futures trading,and there was no document of any kind given to investors describing the risks of engaging in commodity futures trading.
jbw began trading in october and stopped trading in september,and its account at mf global,a commodity broker,was closed in may.wilson lost almost million in trades and returned about to investors.
wilson investors with jbw net asset value nav on a weekly,biweekly,or quarterly basis.on at least four instances,wilson overstated jbw value.first,a december,stated that as of november,today nav was,while jbw november,bank statement listed its account value at market as.second,a december,stated that as of december,today nav was,while jbw december,bank statement listed its account value at market as third,a march,said that today nav was,while jbw february,bank statement listed its account value at market as.fourth,a may,said that today nav was,while jbw may,bank statement listed its account value at market as.
as to this last egregious overstatement,wilson said that the amount provided as today nav in the may,email was an estimate,but he acknowledged that the word estimate did not appear anywhere in the.
a series of in september misrepresented jbw value and then tried to explain the misrepresentation.on september,wilson investors that today nav was.however,the did not include that two days september,jbw had lost.jbw account value at market on september,was actually about on september,wilson investors apologizing for not informing them about the million loss on september,stating i want to apologize for not reporting the loss of in my weekly report.wilson wrote that his intention was not to deceive but to roll the loss into the next week and hopefully show some recovery.he continued,c learly,a recovery was not the case because i experienced the second major loss on the following monday.specifically,on september,jbw lost.in his september,wilson said that he would send a report later in the month explain ing how he plan s to recover from this.a september trading statement listed jbw account value at market and balance at the end of the month as.
on september,wilson sent investors an with the subject recovery plan.it stated that wilson would transfer of his personal funds to the trading account for the beneficial interest of each investor of record on the high water mark.as a result,each investor will recoup approximately of their loss on day one.the included that t he automated trading program will be modified with a stop loss order feature to avoid accumulation of losing positions which got us in trouble in the first place.wilson also said that he would segregate contributions from new investors.
wilson did transfer of his personal funds to jbw,but he did not have the time to modify the trading program to include a stop loss order,nor did he segregate the funds from new investors.
on september,a new pool participant,daniel mann,invested in jbw when wilson initially spoke to mann about the fund in may or june of,the fund was showing a strong performance.in september,wilson told mann over the phone that jbw had taken a loss,but he did not specify what the loss was which,by september,was about million.wilson said that he felt a moral obligation to tell mann there had been a loss,but he told him nothing other than it was a loss.mann did inquire further,and agreed to invest his money with wilson regardless.when mann made his investment,wilson said to him that the fund was worth about million,which wilson knew was inaccurate,but wilson was afraid that otherwise mann would not invest the money wilson also did not include mann on the september to investors that informed them of the losses suffered in.on september,wilson sent an to mann,saying that wilson would monitor mann investment in such a way that if any time the equity fall s wilson will insure all funds are in cash,and will contact mann for further direction.
jbw suffered further losses after mann investment.on december,wilson mann telling him that the nav of mann investment on that day was.jbw balance at the end of that day was approximately.three days later,on december,wilson mann a certificate of beneficial interest dated september.the certificate said that mann constituted a beneficial interest in jbw on september,around was in the fund.wilson testified that he had calculated mann as a percentage of the high watermark of the fund,which was about million.he testified that he calculated it this way because it was his intent all along to recover the entire fund back to the or million that he consider ed the high watermark with his own contribution of trading separately and contributing into the fund.he said i t was a grievous error on his part showing the power of his addiction.in december,jbw lost,leaving its balance and account value at market at.
mann made a second investment of around december.wilson testified that before placing mann second investment in the fund,he had told mann that jbw had suffered further losses since the first investment but that he had made up the losses.however,wilson also testified that he did not disclose that jbw had lost more than million in september and that he did not recall telling mann that the certificate of beneficial interest he had sent on december,was inaccurate.on february,wilson mann that mann balance was on january.jbw bank account statement from january,listed its balance at,and its account value at market at.on february,mann sent an to wilson stating that of course,he want s the same downside limit of loss on the that he had on the original.wilson testified that he did not honor the ten percent provision,and mann investment was ultimately lost.
on september,the cftc filed a complaint against wilson and jbw in the federal district court of massachusetts,alleging violations of cea a a c cea a a c and a b cea a b the cftc moved for summary judgment on february,requesting a permanent injunction,restitution,and civil monetary penalties.the district court granted the cftc motion for summary judgment in an order dated may.cftc.wilson,d.it granted the cftc requests for injunctive relief and civil penalties and determined that i n the absence of a showing by the cftc of any personal gain on wilson part as the result of the fraud,the appropriate measure of a civil penalty is the statutory amount,rather than a trebling of the investors losses as the cftc proposes.id.
on may,the cftc filed a motion for partial reconsideration with respect to restitution,in which it contended that under the circumstances of this case as well as first circuit precedent,restitution should be calculated by reference to the customers losses.the district court denied the motion in an order dated july.cftc wilson,d.it found that t he additional cases cited by the cftc neither compel an order of restitution as a matter of law,nor are the facts of those cases analogous to those in this case,id.at,and concluded that its disagreement with the cftc was a difference of opinion,id.at.on october,the district court issued a final judgment for a permanent injunction and a civil monetary penalty in the amount of.this appeal and followed.

failure to register as a cpo 
under,with certain exceptions,i t shall be unlawful for any commodity trading advisor or commodity pool operator,unless registered under this chapter,to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce in connection with his business as such commodity trading advisor or commodity pool operator.those claiming to be exempt from this requirement must file an electronic notice with the nfa.b.wilson did not register as a cpo,nor did he file a notice of exemption with the nfa.wilson agrees that i t is undisputed that jbw capital was a commodity pool,and that he did not register as a cpo with the cftc or nfa.he also does not claim he qualifies under any exception to registration.
instead,wilson contends that there were disputed facts as to his reliance on and engagement of several professionals,and that t he record below demonstrates that he sought out,engaged and relied upon the advice of the professionals.we assume that wilson has not waived the argument that liability for failure to register requires scienter 
we agree with the district court that the registration requirement does not contain a state of mind limitation to liability.wilson,d at cftc british am.commodity options,cir describing as a flat prohibition against using the facilities of interstate commerce to give commodity advice unless registered and concluding that the district court had erred in requiring proof of fraud or misconduct to grant an injunction.we also note that failure to register under the analogous securities and exchange commission registration provision,a,has been held to be subject to strict liability.see,sheldon.profit sharing plan trust smith,citing sec blavin,aff,cir.because cpo registration is a strict liability offense,wilson can not raise a reliance on professionals defense,even granting him the questionable factual assumption that such a defense would be available in his case.we affirm the district court decision that wilson is liable under.
commodity fraud 
wilson was held liable under two commodity fraud provisions a,a general fraud provision,which makes it unlawful for any person,in or in connection with any order to make,or the making of,any contract of sale of any commodity,inter alia,to cheat,defraud,willfully make a false report or statement,or willfully deceive or attempt to deceive another person in regard to any order or contract and,a parallel statute forbidding fraud and misrepresentation by commodity trading advisors and cpos.see stotler cftc,cir.under,it is unlawful for a cpo,inter alia,to employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud any client or participant or prospective client or participant or engage in any transaction,practice,or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or participant or prospective client or participant.a b.
liability attaches under a when there is the making of a misrepresentation,misleading statement,or a deceptive omission scienter and materiality.cftc hunter wise commodities,llc,cir quoting cftc fitzgerald,cir.wilson does not dispute the elements required to prove a violation of a.
wilson does raise numerous issues with the district court determination that based on the undisputed facts,wilson violated this provision.these claims are meritless.
wilson clearly made numerous false and misleading statements and reports,including those in his to investors about today nav,those about his recovery plan,and those in his communications to mann about mann investment.indeed,wilson acknowledges that t he evidence showed that wilson sent certain emails to investors,which were incomplete or inaccurate in several respects.
as to scienter,wilson argues that the record does not show knowing misconduct or severe recklessness,and so does not support a finding of scienter.our circuit has held that liability under can be found based on recklessness.see first commodity of boston cftc,cir explaining that has a specific willfulness,or scienter requirement,id.at,and that willful behavior includes reckless actions in the commodities fraud context,id.at.a reckless misrepresentation is one that departs so far from the standards of ordinary care that it is very difficult to believe the speaker was not aware of what he was doing.id.at.there is ample evidence in the record for us to determine that wilson acted recklessly,without reaching whether he did so knowingly 
for example,wilson testified that the september,stating that today nav was was an intentional statement and admitted that the was a bsolutely not accurate when it was sent out.he also characterized the amount provided as today nav in the may,as an estimate even though the word estimate did not appear anywhere in the.further,wilson admitted that when he told mann what percentage mann investment was of the fund in,he gave mann a fictitious number it was basically of two and a half million.he admitted he did not tell mann that there was in fact not million in the fund because of f ear,simple as that and a concern that mann would not invest the money if he learned the truth.further,wilson acknowledged that he needed mann money to help regain the losses jbw had suffered.wilson admitted that when he received funds from mann and told mann that he would deposit the funds in the next few days,he did not tell him about the losses that jbw suffered in the preceding days.wilson said that he incorrectly based mann beneficial interest in the company as stated in the certificate of beneficial interest on the high watermark of the fund b ecause his intent all along was to recover the entire fund back to the or million that he consider ed the high watermark it was a grievous error on his part showing the power of his addiction.
wilson protests that he must have lacked scienter because if he had intended to act fraudulently,he would have liquidated his own position in jbw long before september.this argument fails.wilson could have acted recklessly,whether or not intentionally,with regard to false or misleading statements,even as his money remained in the fund.indeed,his own testimony explains that he made the misrepresentations in order to attract and retain investors.wilson admitted that he did not tell mann about the losses incurred because of fear mann would not invest in the fund otherwise.wilson to investors explaining why he failed to inform them of the september,loss revealed a similar motivation of not wanting to scare investors.he wrote that his intention was not to deceive but to roll the loss into the next week and hopefully show some recovery.clearly,a recovery was not the case whether or not wilson intention was to deceive investors,he knowingly sent an that he admitted understated jbw actual value on september,
the cases that wilson relies on from the securities context to support his claim that he lacked scienter because his money remained in the fund do not apply here.in in re worlds of wonder securities litigation,the ninth circuit affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment to the defendants with regard to the plaintiffs claims under b and rule of the securities exchange act,cir.with regard to one group of defendants,the company officers,the court found that t he plaintiffs produced no direct evidence of any scienter on the part of the officer defendants and instead sought to rely on speculative inferences that arise from the officer defendants allegedly suspicious conduct.id.at.there,the court found that t he detailed risk disclosure in the p rospectus negates an inference of scienter.id.with regard to another group of defendants,the directors and major shareholders,the court noted that it was faced with mere speculation and conclusory allegations.id.at quoting in re worlds of wonder sec.it then found that under the facts of that case,e ven if the evidence was sufficient to permit an inference that one or more of the defendants had access to inside information,the defendants actual trading would conclusively rebut an inference of scienter.id.as to the directors and major shareholders,there was no evidence that any of the defendants intentionally or recklessly engaged in fraudulent conduct,only that the defendants had access to undisclosed adverse,material information when they sold the company securities.id.here,however,wilson own statements viewed most favorably to him provide direct evidence not only that he had accurate information about jbw performance but also that he intentionally or recklessly withheld that information from investors,in at least one instance out of fear of losing a potential investor.and so,the fact he kept his funds in jbw can not rebut a finding of scienter here.
as to materiality,there is no doubt that the misrepresentations were material.a statement or omission is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important in making an investment decision.see tsc,northway.here,it is clear that there was a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would have considered information about today nav,the value of the fund on the market,and the recovery plan as important to his or her investing decisions.see bruhl price waterhousecoopers int l,the fact that a hedge fund investor would consider factors other than the nav statements,or the fact that some investors would have access to different data,does not eliminate the nav statements as a relevant and material matter to be considered in the investment calculus.sec princeton econ.int l,d,fitzgerald,at given the extremely rosy picture for profit potential painted,a reasonable investor surely would want to know before committing money to a broker that or more of rjfco investors lost money.
wilson suggests that the inaccurate statements were immaterial because the evidence is undisputed that no member of jbw capital sought to buy or sell his or her membership interests in jbw,or attempt ed to buy or sell such jbw membership interest,in reliance of such emails and in contravention to the provisions of the operating agreement,and t he evidence submitted by the cftc demonstrated that none of the investors pulled their funds in september.similarly,wilson argues that t he evidence showed that not only were these events disclosed to mann,but that he continued to hold his investment for months after disclosure,thereby ratifying the transactions.
however,reliance is not an element required to prove a violation of.see slusser cftc,cir suggesting that the actions proscribed by a may be condemned without proof of reliance.wilson arguments therefore miss the mark because they do not address whether his misrepresentations were material but instead discuss whether investors actually acted on material information or omissions.
finally,wilson asserts that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the commodity fraud provisions due to the absence of material,undisputed evidence that demonstrated any misrepresentation of the appellants was in connection with any order to m ake,or making,a future contract.see a.he contends that there were no transactions which were in connection with the september.this claim fails as well.wilson concedes that a ctionable misrepresentations include those made to persons when soliciting funds.see saxe hutton,cir hirk agri research council,cir.and wilson admitted that he made false representations to mann out of fear,simple as that that mann would not invest his money otherwise,and that he needed mann money to regain losses jbw incurred.this statement alone would be sufficient to find a violation of a,as it was in connection with the making of,a contract of sale of a commodity.a.how many misrepresentations there were does not change our affirmance,as wilson does not sufficiently raise a challenge to the amount of civil monetary penalties imposed see united states zannino,cir.
further,other circuits case law makes clear that t he plain meaning of broad language can not be ignored.hirk,at explaining that b y its terms,section is not restricted in its applications to instances of fraud or deceit in orders to make or the making of contracts,id.at,but also encompasses conduct in or in connection with futures transactions,id.at see r w tech.servs.cftc,cir examining the legislative history of and concluding that the provision should be construed broadly rather than narrowly.
wilson knowingly or recklessly issuing account statements that fraudulently misrepresented the nav of pool participants investments also violated a.see cftc arjent capital mkts.llc,cv,wl,at,see also cftc pmc strategy,llc,d,delivering,or causing the delivery of,false account statements to pool participants constitutes a violation of the commodity exchange act princeton econ.int l,d at finding that letters overstating the accounts nav certainly were in connection with later sales
