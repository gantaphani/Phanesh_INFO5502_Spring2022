facts and procedural history 
underlying judgment 
the jhaveris filed jhaveri i against appellants and dubois for breach of contract and fraud,obtaining a jury verdict in their favor for a total of million,as noted above.just prior to the verdict in jhaveri i,the jhaveris discovered teitelbaum and dubois had transferred community real property into the name of each wife,as her sole and separate property,and made other conveyances to avoid collection of any judgment the jhaveris might obtain in this action.
fraudulent conveyance action 
in december,the jhaveris filed an action for fraudulent conveyances including as defendants teitelbaum,dubois,their spouses,coin company and others acting with them jhaveri ii.in jhaveri ii,the jhaveris alleged the defendants participated in fraudulent property transfers in violation of the uniform fraudulent transfer act,ufta as part of a larger conspiracy to avoid paying the judgment in jhaveri i.in addition to equitable remedies,the complaint prayed for general,special and punitive damages against all defendants.the jhaveris sought to recover at least million,as well as compensatory and punitive damages,from dubois and his wife,connie.
settlement by duboises 
in july,the jhaveris and the duboises submitted to a mediation in jhaveri ii.appellants chose not to participate in the mediation.as a result of the mediation,the jhaveris agreed to settle their claims against the duboises globally for the sum of million.as part of the settlement agreement,the duboises agreed to assist the jhaveris in collecting the jhaveri i judgment and in prosecuting jhaveri ii.
the jhaveris served notice of this settlement on appellants in september 
the duboises paid the jhaveris under the settlement agreement before filing for bankruptcy in november.
motion for good faith settlement in fraudulent conveyance action 
in september,appellants brought a motion in jhaveri ii for a determination of the good faith of the settlement between the jhaveris and the duboises under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a the court deferred ruling on the motion ordering further briefing regarding the allocation of the settlement and the financial condition of the duboises.however,before the court could hear and issue a ruling on the continued motion,the duboises filed a notice informing the court of their bankruptcy filing automatically staying any proceedings against them.
motion for execution of partial satisfaction of judgment 
appellants returned to the court below in august.they moved for an order requiring the jhaveris to file an acknowledgment of partial satisfaction of judgment in the amount of,to be credited against the million compensatory damages award entered jointly and severally against appellants and dubois in the present action,subd.b.
the parties stipulated that the jhaveris settlement with the duboises contemplated they would jointly pay the jhaveris million.the parties further stipulated that the settlement agreement was silent on how the million should be allocated as between the duboises in jhaveri ii and as between compensatory and punitive damages in jhaveri i and agreed that no other court had adjudicated the issue of allocation.
appellants argued the face amount of the settlement,million,should be allocated equally between the joint and several liability for compensatory damages and dubois separate liability for punitive damages in jhaveri i,so that of the settlement should be allocated to economic damages and to dubois separate liability for punitive damages.thus,they argued should be credited to the economic damages awarded in jhaveri i.the jhaveris,on the other hand,argued that because connie dubois also was a party to the settlement and benefited from the dismissal with prejudice of the claims asserted against her in jhaveri ii,half the settlement funds should be attributed to extinguishing her obligations,half attributed to dubois liability in jhaveri i,and half of that remaining half,of the amount paid or,should be credited to dubois joint and several liability for the economic damages in jhaveri 
the court indicated the issue before the court was not what rights appellants would have in a suit for contribution against dubois or vice versa,nor was the court being asked to make an determination whether the not yet adjudicated settlement by dubois was a good faith settlement for purposes of extinguishing any claims for contribution.
the court reasoned that the first issue presented was whether the judgment debtors are entitled to credit for the amounts actually paid under the settlement agreement,rather than the amounts agreed to be paid but in fact were not paid.appellants argued they were entitled to the benefit of section,which provides when fewer than all joint tortfeasors settle with a claimant,the claims against the nonsettling tortfeasors are reduced by the amount of the consideration paid.italics added.appellants contended the reference in the statute to consideration paid should be construed as meaning the face amount of the contract,rather than cash received.the court ruled under general principles of equity and economics the judgment debtors should receive credit only for amounts actually paid under the settlement agreement,the same method used for purposes of cutting off accrual of interest on a judgment.
the trial court indicated the second issue presented was whether the amount of credit should be reduced by to reflect connie dubois buying her peace and whether some or all of that amount should be viewed as having to do only with judgment debtor dubois buying his p ea ce.the court concluded that,in the absence of clarity between the parties,an equal apportionment between dubois and his wife would be equitable,given that the next suit was pending and connie dubois was at risk as the person in nominal possession of the assets.the court found that connie dubois was independently at risk and had a personal,financial interest to be protected by obtaining the settlement in jhaveri ii.thus,it determined the settlement funds received should be attributed to extinguishing dubois liability in jhaveri i and to extinguishing connie dubois obligations in jhaveri ii.
order for partial satisfaction of judgment and appeal 
noting that the jury in jhaveri i had awarded punitive damages against dubois in an equal ratio to the amount of compensatory damages awarded,the court attributed of the settlement payments received to dubois joint and several liability for compensatory damages and of such payments to his separate punitive damages liability in jhaveri the parties did not dispute that only of the amount attributed to dubois liability would be subject to credit against the judgment 
the court therefore ordered the jhaveris to prepare,serve and file a partial satisfaction of judgment in the amount of as of the date the money was paid.
in compliance with the trial court order,the jhaveris executed,served and filed a notice of partial satisfaction of the jhaveri i judgment in the sum of 
appellants timely appealed the court order.
contentions 
appellants essentially contend the trial court erred in failing to credit the entire amount of the million settlement against the judgment,the jhaveris are judicially estopped by their statements in jhaveri ii from asserting any amount less than should be credited towards the judgment,and there was no substantial evidence to support any allocation to connie dubois liability.
standard of review 
on appeal,we will uphold the factual findings supporting the trial court decision on a motion for satisfaction of judgment if the findings are supported by substantial evidence.george nolte consulting civil engineers,magliocco d.we will presume the existence of every fact the finder of fact could reasonably deduce from the evidence in support of the judgment or order.people kraft cal th,d.moreover,the constitutional doctrine of reversible error requires that a judgment or order of the lower court be presumed correct.nelson united technologies th,d.therefore,all intendments and presumptions must be indulged to support the judgment or order on matters as to which the record is silent,and error must be affirmatively shown.ibid.the appellant has the burden to demonstrate there is no substantial evidence to support the findings under attack.foreman clark fallon cal d.

discussion 
application of section to postjudgment settlement 
the court in jhaveri ii never determined whether the settlement between the jhaveris and the duboises was reached in good faith.appellants contend that regardless of whether the settlement was found to be in good faith,pursuant to section the trial court should have reduced the claims against appellants by the million amount that the duboises promised to pay the jhaveris in the settlement agreement.we disagree,finding section inapplicable to the facts at hand.
section,provides,in pertinent part where a release,dismissal with or without prejudice,or a covenant not to sue or not to enforce judgment is given in good faith before verdict or judgment to one or more of a number of tortfeasors claimed to be liable for the same tort,or to one or more other mutually subject to contribution rights,it shall have the following effect a it shall not discharge any other such party from liability unless its terms so provide,but it shall reduce the claims against the others in the amount stipulated by the release,the dismissal or the covenant,or in the amount of the consideration paid for it whichever is the greater.italics added.
the jhaveris essentially contend that section is not applicable to this case.the jhaveris argue at length that section is part of a statutory scheme governing only c ontribution a mong j oint t ortfeasors see west civ.proc.ed.tit,ch,and therefore section does not provide a remedy against an injured plaintiff.we agree with the jhaveris,but for a more basic reason.
when the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous and its meaning plain,there is no need for statutory construction.be western truck exchange th,d be.in this case,the intent of the legislature is plain as the words in the statute are clear and unambiguous.we need not examine the context of section to construe its meaning.section clearly and unambiguously states it applies to a release,dismissal with or without prejudice,or a covenant not to sue or not to enforce judgment given in good faith before verdict or judgment to one or more of a number of tortfeasors italics added.section thus applies only to a settlement entered into with a cotortfeasor before a verdict or judgment.this interpretation is supported by established case law.be,supra,th at,d southern cal.white trucks teresinski d.halpin superior court d.similar considerations bear upon section,which contains comparable language and complements section.teresinski,supra,at.

there is no dispute that the settlement between the jhaveris and the duboises occurred after not before the judgment.by their plain terms,sections and do not govern the settlement in this case,and the trial court properly concluded in determining the appropriate credit to be given against the judgment those statutes do not apply.be,supra,th at,d distinguishing settlements made before verdict or judgment from settlements after judgment torres xomox th,d authorities applicable to good faith settlements do not apply to settlements which occur after damages have been awarded winzler kelly superior court d.operative where the release is before judgment.we accordingly reject appellants arguments premised on the applicability of sections and.

judicial estoppel doctrine inapplicable 
appellants assert that,at the minimum,the doctrine of judicial estoppel should be applied to reduce the claims against appellants by because the jhaveris previously took the position in jhaveri i i that their claims should be credited in such amount by the duboises settlement.we disagree,for several reasons,not the least of which is that the factual prerequisite to invoke the doctrine is not present here.
the judicial estoppel doctrine precludes a party from gaining a litigation advantage by espousing one position and then seeking a second advantage by taking an incompatible position.aguilar lerner cal th,d.the dual purposes of the doctrine are to maintain the integrity of the judicial system and protect parties from unfair strategies of their opponents.ibid.judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine,and its application is discretionary.mw erectors,niederhauser ornamental metal works,cal th,d,aguilar,supra,at,d.
