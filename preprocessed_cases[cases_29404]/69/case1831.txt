at first blush,this appeal presents what appears to be a relatively issue did the trial court properly calculate the amount of restitution owed by defendants yvonne and michael chappelone for the theft of a large quantity of retail merchandise from yvonne employer,target upon closer examination,however,this appeal presents numerous complexities,such as how to value merchandise that was already damaged prior to the theft whether the merchandise should be valued at its retail or wholesale price and whether the calculation should be based on the diminution in value of the merchandise since the bulk of it was recovered by target.the trial court grappled with these and other questions and,following a contested restitution hearing,ordered defendants to pay restitution in the amount of.
defendants contend that the court abused its discretion in calculating the amount of restitution owed and the restitution order violated their sixth amendment right to a jury trial.we conclude that their first argument has merit,but the second does not.we thus reverse and remand,but not for a jury trial.
background 
the embezzlement 
in,began employment at the vallejo location of target,a nationwide retail store that sells a wide range of consumer goods.initially,she worked at night,restocking shelves and returning items to their proper locations.in april,she was promoted to reverse logistics,where she was responsible for seeing that damaged items and merchandise withdrawn by manufacturers were returned to the appropriate entity for credit or otherwise disposed of.yvonne had to remove some items from the sales floor,while others were already in the stockroom.all of the items were then sorted onto pallets in the stockroom pending disposition.
yvonne and shawne camp,an investigator in target assets protection department and the primary witness for target at the restitution hearing,both testified regarding the pallet system.although the system is not entirely clear from their testimony,this is how they described it 
the merchandise for which yvonne was responsible was divided into three categories,and items,with a separate pallet designated for each category.crcs were items that were damaged in transit to target or returned by customers because they did not work when purchased.the customer was issued a full refund or replacement,and the item,which still had a dollar value,was returned to the stockroom to be placed on the yellow pallet.those goods were then shipped to a central location and,from there,returned to the vendors,who issued a credit to target.examples of items that would be included televisions,videos,and dvds.
camp explained items this way yellow,that would be what we call crc,so when a guest or a customer brings something back,such as an ipod to target and they say i bought this ipod,it does work,they are given a refund or given a new ipod.that ipod still has a dollar value to it,so the disposition is given automatically by the computer by the employee that doing the return on that ipod.a disposition would be given to that item of a yellow label,meaning that a yellow label would be placed on that ipod.that then signifies once it gets back to the stock in the back stockroom area,that that ipod is to go on a particular pallet,which is called the crc pallet.we then conduct sweeps where a trailer that brought merchandise into target would be loaded with these pallets that are supposed to go back to crc,which i believe is in indianapolis.so that ipod eventually would be loaded back onto a trailer and sent to crc in indianapolis,where we would receive full credit back from the vendor.items were typically the most valuable of the three pallets.
merchandise was considered salvage,typically consisting of items or sets that were missing components when purchased,as well as clearance items that had been reduced to up to percent off but still did not sell and were thus withdrawn from the sales floor.these items were donated to a charity for cents on the dollar of the last retail price.some items,such as vitamins and food,could not be donated for any money,and were simply given away at a total loss to target.
camp gave the following example of items an example of that would be if somebody brought in a toy,if somebody brought in a box of legos that maybe retails for a hundred dollars,and they said that,you know,it was missing some of the pieces when they got it,that item then can be given a green label meaning salvage.so once that item is taken from the service desk,it would be brought to the back room,and it would be placed on another pallet beside that crc pallet that would be considered a salvage pallet.that stuff that we then donate to like the goodwill.but when i say donate,it not given free of cost.instead,as noted,target received cents on the dollar of the last retail price.camp further detailed the items that target could not dispose of for any money there specific items that we are not allowed to donate for a profit where we just have to donate them free of cost.items would be things like vitamins and cereals,foods,pretty much any type of food,except for can not donate liquor.but that would be something that we would have to set up a separate donations place,so maybe like a women a battered women shelter or something,and we just give them all these vitamins,and there is no cents on the dollar for that.
the third pallet was for items,which included damaged merchandise that could not be sold and no longer had any financial value to target.these would include things such as diapers,food items,cosmetics,toiletries,toilet paper,household products,small appliances,glassware,flatware,and clothing.as another example,if a camcorder was removed from a box to be used as a display item,the box would be returned to the stockroom where yvonne would it.when asked about more expensive items,like an electronic item missing a charger,yvonne explained,if something is minus percent and it should go back to crc,it going to be overridden and.items were the least valuable of the three pallets.
in addition to the yellow,green,and items,the pallets also occasionally included new merchandise that nighttime employees transferred from the front of the store to the stockroom.yvonne was responsible for removing the new merchandise from the pallets and returning it to the sales floor.
in addition to seeing that merchandise was shipped out to crc for return to vendors,yvonne responsibilities also included disposing of green and goods,that is,damaged or otherwise unsellable items that could not be returned to the merchandisers.target had an arrangement with goodwill industries,a organization that would take all of the unsellable merchandise,paying target cents on the dollar for the items.at a certain point,however,the goodwill pickups became unreliable,and when yvonne reported this problem to her manager,he advised her to find an alternative way to dispose of the merchandise.yvonne contacted a number of charities,but no one was willing to accept all of the merchandise,instead wanting first to look through the items and pick out just what they would like.
to help yvonne,michael spoke with thomas clarke,an acquaintance who volunteered with the rotary club,a charitable organization that performs community service.clarke agreed to accept the merchandise on behalf of the rotary club and distribute it to various nonprofits.because the rotary club lacked the capacity to transport and store the volume of merchandise that was available for distribution,michael would pick it up from target in his trailer and take it home,and clarke would retrieve it from there and distribute it.according to yvonne,her manager was present on multiple occasions when michael picked up the items.
in june,shortly after yvonne promotion,target received a phone tip reporting that yvonne was stealing merchandise.a surveillance of yvonne failed to turn up anything out of the ordinary.
in may,target received a second such tip.the store began another surveillance,this time uncovering a massive theft.an investigator initially observed michael drive a trailer onto target property,load it with merchandise,and drive away.the trailer was traced to defendants,so investigators began watching their home in american canyon,where they were observed loading merchandise into a sports utility vehicle.the investigators did not intercept them,however,and instead followed yvonne as she drove the vehicle to oregon.
once in oregon,yvonne first stopped at a residence later determined to belong to her daughter.she then continued on to a second residence,that belonging to her mother,barbara beattie.on beattie property,there was a main home,a second home,and a barn with an additional storage area attached.a search of the buildings uncovered a small amount of target merchandise in the main home.in the second home,the upper floor was set up like a showroom,displaying living room and dining room merchandise.many of the items had target price tags or were brands carried by target.investigators also discovered shelves lined with toiletries,some bearing a clearance label used by target when it reduced the price of an item.
the barn,in which the investigators found a garage sale sign,appeared to have been converted into a store full of target merchandise.there was clothing displayed on hangers and merchandise laid out on long tables.looking through the items,the investigators determined that much of the merchandise came from target,since some of the brands were specific to target and some of the items bore a label or logo indicating it was from a target store.
adjacent to the barn was a storage area that contained totes and totes of merchandise.in front of the barn was an area covered with tarps,under which there was more target merchandise.next to the barn was a area that contained larger target items,like lawn furniture.
it was subsequently learned that beattie began receiving merchandise from yvonne in december and received it through may,when the theft was discovered.during that time,she held three or four garage sales to dispose of merchandise,earning in her estimate.of that,she gave yvonne approximately.
investigators also searched defendants home in american canyon.there,they discovered target merchandise in the house,in the garage,and in a camper on the property.they also recovered target merchandise,including lawn furniture and bicycles,from a storage unit in vallejo.at yvonne daughter oregon residence,they discovered target merchandise in the house,garage,and an attached storage area.
defendants were arrested and the merchandise seized.the items recovered in california were transferred to a rented storage unit near defendants home.the oregon merchandise was loaded into and transported to a target distribution center in oregon,where it was held until it could be inventoried.eventually,per fbi instructions to retain the merchandise,it was consolidated at a target distribution center outside of sacramento and stored in rental trailers pending resolution of the case.
the criminal proceedings 
by amended felony complaint filed may,the solano county district attorney charged defendants with one count of conspiracy to commit grand theft,burglary,and receiving stolen property count,one count of grand theft by embezzlement count,subd.a and two counts of receiving stolen property counts and,subd.a.yvonne was additionally charged with four counts of second degree commercial burglary counts through.
on november,michael pleaded no contest to the conspiracy charge,and yvonne pleaded guilty to the conspiracy and grand theft charges the remaining charges were dismissed with a waiver.
on april,the court suspended imposition of sentence and placed defendants on five years probation,with yvonne to serve days and michael days in county jail under the sheriff alternative program.both were ordered to pay a restitution fee of,a probation fee of,and a court security fee of,as well as restitution to target in an amount to be determined by the court.following a contested restitution in detail court ordered defendants to pay restitution to target in the amount of,subject to an offset should target receive anything of value for the recovered merchandise.defendants immediately presented a check for to demonstrate their good faith intent to make restitution to target.
the court scheduled a hearing for may,for a progress report,but subsequently took the matter off calendar and ordered the parties to work with the probation department to determine any offset resulting from target disposition of the recovered property.
defendants appealed from the april,order of restitution 
at a september,hearing before the trial court,target investigator camp confirmed that with the exception of wine that was thrown away,all of the merchandise was donated to charitable organizations at a total loss to target.he also confirmed that target neither sought nor received a tax credit for the donations.
the restitution hearing 
at the outset of the restitution hearing,the prosecutor stated that the people were seeking restitution in the amount of.this amount included merchandise valued at,which was based on an extrapolation prepared at target headquarters that looked at shortages in target stores comparable to the vallejo store for the years,and.fifty percent of the shortages,or,was attributed to yvonne.
alternatively,the prosecutor sought to establish that at a minimum target was entitled to,which was comprised of for the merchandise,for inventory services and investigation expenses,and for transporting and storing the recovered goods.camp,the target investigator,explained how target arrived at these numbers.as to the value of the merchandise,he explained that target retained rgis,a national inventory service,to inventory the merchandise.rgis scanned every single item that was recovered and produced an inventory listing each item and a corresponding dollar amount for it.when scanning,rgis did not differentiate between items that were new or damaged and,if damaged,whether they would have been yellow,green,or.instead,all items were scanned at their last retail value.the total value of the recovered merchandise based on that method was,which included in merchandise recovered from defendants home and recovered from oregon.the inventory did not include the merchandise that yvonne mother sold at the garage sales or that had been given to the rotary club.however,the inventory did include,in yvonne approximation,worth of items seized from her house that belonged to her and had not been stolen from target.
camp also testified that target expended for rgis services as well as investigation expenses.the latter included travel expenses for target investigators while in oregon,including rental cars,hotel rooms,and meals.
additionally,camp explained that per fbi instructions,target was required to retain the recovered merchandise until the case was resolved.after rgis completed its inventory,the merchandise was transported to a single distribution center outside of sacramento.lacking the capacity to store such a large quantity of merchandise indefinitely,target leased six at per month to store the merchandise pending disposition.the charges for transporting the goods and the storage trailers totaled,which included rental costs through february.
at the time of the restitution hearing,camp could not say with certainty what target was going to do with the recovered merchandise.he was certain,however,that none of it was going to be returned to the sales floor,and thought it likely that target would donate it all and take a tax.
yvonne also testified at the hearing.in addition to describing her job responsibilities and the pallet system,she admitted that at the time unsellable goods were being given to the rotary club,she began appropriating goods from the stockroom,some of which she took to oregon and some of which she kept at home.most of the goods,according to yvonne,were green or.she admitted,however,that some of the items were new,having been placed on the stockroom pallets by the night crew.
when asked for her estimate of the value of the merchandise she stole,yvonne responded that the full retail value was.because much of the merchandise was unsellable,however,she estimated its actual value to target to be to.
clarke from the rotary club also testified.when asked about the condition of the merchandise he received,he explained m ost of the stuff would have a green label on it,be salvage.some of the stuff was broken.sometimes there would there was a dinner set or something,a dish would be busted sic in there,and it would be a full thing.some things we got were out of date,obviously,because like when we be putting toys together for christmas,we be stuff would come through there i call it a grab bag.i mean,you open a box and see what in there.sometimes there could could be some shampoo or soap,but you could tell there something leaking.beattie description of the merchandise was consistent the items were missing things,they broken,everything was damaged.
following testimony,the court heard argument.the people reiterated their request for restitution based on target headquarters extrapolation,this time asking for.they derived this number by deducting for yvonne property that was mistakenly confiscated and in employee payroll costs,both of which were included in the original.
in contrast,defense counsel urged the court to value the merchandise in the range of to,based on what the merchandise was worth when it was stolen.he argued that the merchandise was worth significantly less than the claimed by target since much of it was damaged prior to the theft and would have been donated.while he conceded the investigation expense,he challenged the for transportation and trailer rental,arguing the merchandise could have been stored elsewhere or dealt with in a more reasonable manner.
alternatively,defense counsel argued that if the court was going to order restitution of approximately for the merchandise,which was the full value of the goods based on the rgis inventory,such an order necessarily meant that the recovered merchandise had no value to target.if so,he requested that it be released to defendants to sell to help with the restitution order.the court summarily rejected that suggestion.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the court rejected the prosecutor request for for the merchandise based on the extrapolation,labeling it too speculative.the court then ordered restitution as follows i going to make a finding that basically the storage costs in this case are reasonable as related to appropriate investigation in this case.it may not be a perfect investigation and not an austere one from the defense view,but i think it appropriate,and i make a finding that the cost of reasonable and related investigative endeavors are compensable in a restitution order.i think generally the conduct of target and its various agents were reasonable in this case and their expenses are reasonable.so,basically,i going to award those.my order is also going to be that restitution is going to be joint and several as to both defendants.and i am going to order restitution in the amount of,and i reach that as follows.the reasonable value of the seized is less than what was the seized property is.i going to order that.i also going to order in addition to that,and that would be inventory services,rentals,hotels and meals and so forth.in addition to that,which is essentially storage costs.
the court also noted that the of property seized from defendants american canyon home and the beattie made from selling target merchandise at garage sales was a wash.
when defense counsel objected that target likely plan of donating the merchandise and taking a tax was at odds with the court awarding full retail value,the court responded,not necessarily.they can do whatever they want with it.they can abandon it,for all i care.i made a finding that i think the reasonable amount of value of that property when your client stole it is over now,if target gets some kind of benefit from donating these things,in other words,their tax liability for is somehow reduced by a hundred thousand dollars because of donation of this stuff,i would consider reducing your clients restitution liability by that amount 
based on target representation that it would know within probably one week what it was going to do with the merchandise,the court set a hearing for a progress report on may.on that date,however,target represented that it was still in the process of disposing of the merchandise and did not yet know if it would receive any benefit to offset the restitution amount.it was agreed that from there on out,the probation department would supervise any remaining restitution issues,and the matter was taken off calendar.
as previously noted,target ultimately donated the merchandise at a total loss and did not claim a tax credit for the donations.
discussion 
a.the law of restitution and standard of review 
in people giordano cal th,d,giordano,our supreme court summarized the origin of the state restitution scheme in,california voters passed proposition,also known as the victims bill of rights proposition established the right of crime victims to receive restitution directly from the persons convicted of the crimes for losses they suffer.citation.the initiative added article i,section,subdivision b to the california constitution it is the unequivocal intention of the people of the state of california that all persons who suffer losses as a result of criminal activity shall have the right to restitution from the persons convicted of the crimes for losses they suffer.restitution shall be ordered from the convicted persons in every case,regardless of the sentence or disposition imposed,in which a crime victim suffers a loss,unless compelling and extraordinary reasons exist to the contrary.
the giordano court further explained that california constitution,article i,section,subdivision b,which is not,directed the legislature to adopt implementing legislation.citations.giordano,supra,cal th at,d.section was the legislative response.in its current incarnation,it provides that a victim of crime who incurs any economic loss as a result of the commission of a crime shall receive restitution directly from any defendant convicted of that crime,subd.a.subdivision f states that,subject to certain exceptions not applicable here,i n every case in which a victim has suffered economic loss as a result of the defendant conduct,the court shall require that the defendant make restitution to the victim or victims in an amount established by court order,based on the amount of loss claimed by the victim or victims or any other showing to the court the court shall order full restitution unless it finds compelling and extraordinary reasons for not doing so,and states them on the record.restitution shall be of a dollar amount that is sufficient to fully reimburse the victim or victims for every determined economic loss incurred as the result of the defendant criminal conduct,subd.f.subdivisions f a through f k identify,without limitation,examples of economic losses that are recoverable by the victim,including losses to property.
a defendant is entitled to a restitution hearing to dispute the determination of the amount of restitution,subd.f.as recently explained,at a victim restitution hearing,a prima facie case for restitution is made by the people based in part on a victim testimony on,or other claim or statement of,the amount of his or her economic loss.citations.once the victim has,the people have made a prima facie showing of his or her loss,the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that the amount of the loss is other than that claimed by the victim.people millard th,d millard.see also giordano,supra,cal th at,d,the burden is on the party seeking restitution to provide an adequate factual basis for the claim.
a restitution order is intended to compensate the victim for its actual loss and is not intended to provide the victim with a windfall.millard,supra,th at,d in re anthony th,d.while the court need not order restitution in the precise amount of loss,it must use a rational method that could reasonably be said to make the victim whole,and may not make an order which is arbitrary or capricious.people thygesen th,d thygesen see also in re brian d.court may use any rational method of fixing the amount of restitution which is reasonably calculated to make the victim whole and which is consistent with the purpose of rehabilitation people ortiz th,d w hile the amount of restitution can not be arbitrary or capricious,t here is no requirement the restitution order be limited to the exact amount of the loss in which the defendant is actually found culpable,nor is there any requirement the order reflect the amount of damages that might be recoverable in a civil action.people akins th,d same.
we review the trial court restitution order for abuse of discretion.millard,supra,th at,d people akins,supra,th at,d people baker th,d thygesen,supra,th at,d.
b.the court abused its discretion in ordering restitution in the amount of for the stolen merchandise 
defendants present numerous arguments challenging the amount of restitution the court ordered them to pay for the stolen merchandise.some of the arguments are and warrant reversal.
the trial court improperly awarded target a windfall when it ordered restitution based on the last retail price of the merchandise 
section,subdivision f a provides that a crime victim is entitled to restitution for the f ull or partial payment for the value of stolen or damaged property.the value shall be the replacement cost of like property,or the actual cost of repairing the property when repair is possible.ibid.defendants contend that here,instead of awarding target the replacement cost of like property,the court overcompensated the store by relying on the rgis inventory which inflated the value of the merchandise.this is so,they reason,because all items were scanned at their last retail price when their value to target was in fact significantly less.we agree.
it was undisputed at the restitution hearing that the stolen merchandise included yellow,green,and items,as well as some new items.according to yvonne testimony,most of the items that she appropriated were green or merchandise.beattie described most of it as missing things,they broken,and noted that e verything was damaged.target investigator camp testified that the items recovered included some,or salvage,merchandise.finally,clarke from the rotary club described the grab bag of damaged goods he received for distribution.given that the bulk of the goods were unsellable because they were either damaged merchandise or clearance items withdrawn from the sales floor,the retail price of these goods was not reflective of their value to target.
more specifically,as to the items,if it was an item that had been put on clearance but still did not sell,it would have scanned at the last clearance price.if it was a salvage item because it was missing a were the bulk of the would have scanned at the full retail price.these items,however,had been destined for donation at cents on the dollar of the last retail price.consequently,on all such items,target was awarded a windfall of percent.
other items,such as food and vitamins,were to be given away for free,as were all goods.these items scanned at either their full retail or clearance price,even though their value to target was effect,a percent windfall 
as a specific example,the inventory included numerous display items.while target sells some display items such as camcorders,it does not sell other display items such as video game consoles.those nonsellable display items would have scanned at their full retail price,even though target would have donated those goods for cents on the dollar,giving target a windfall of percent.
the people present multiple arguments in opposition to this conclusion,none of which is persuasive.first and foremost,they protest that it would have been virtually impossible to accurately calculate the value of the merchandise i t would be virtually impossible for target investigators to determine the value of the property when taken since it can not be determined,if the property is damaged,whether the item was damaged at the time the property was stolen from target,or damaged during the handling,transportation,or storage of the goods.testimony established that the goods were loaded into a truck on the target premises and transported to the cappelone sic residence.from there,some of the merchandise was transported to clarke residence,and some to daughter and mother residences in oregon.in oregon,the goods were stored outside under tarps,in the barn,and in the garage and residence for possibly more than a year.there is no method to determine the condition of each item when it left the target store,unless at the time of recovery,the item was in perfect condition.even if the item was in perfect condition,it would be impossible to determine when stole each piece of property to determine its value at the time of conversion,since products are generally marked down or put on sale over time.
the trial court was clearly cognizant of these issues,expressing rightly not imposing a greater burden on target than it had already suffered i not going to make them go through incredible hoops and itemize every single thing and report to the court as to exactly what they have done with each and every one of them,because i think it would be unfair,and it would be like them getting victimized twice.we in no way begrudge the court refusal to require target to assess each recovered item individually in an attempt to determine if they had been yellow,green,or when stolen,and what the value was at the time of theft.in the court own words,this would have been burdensome and onerous perhaps,as the people claim,a virtual impossibility.
nevertheless,courts are often confronted with restitution situations that require complicated calculations.giordano,supra,cal th at,d,calculation of spouse loss of support people baumann d.lengthy hearing to determine extent of loss attributable to defendant embezzlement,taking evidence from several witnesses and receiving checks into evidence people baker,supra,th at,d calculating restitution for the theft of cattle,including whether it was appropriate to order restitution for calves that were likely born while the cows were misappropriated.this complexity of calculation,however,does not absolve the court from awarding restitution in a rational manner that is reasonably related to the victim loss.and although imprecision does not necessarily amount to an abuse of discretion giordano,supra,cal th at,d,no abuse of discretion shown despite court methodological imprecision people akins,supra,th at,d no abuse of discretion because more than one reasonable way to calculate restitution,it did so here did because it clearly resulted in a merchandise value that was highly inflated over the actual value of the merchandise to target.while the rgis inventory was a reasonable starting point,the value should have then been discounted to reflect the true nature of the goods.
the people also dispute that most of the merchandise was damaged,suggesting instead that a large percentage was new.in support,they direct our attention to the probation report,which cites a target loss prevention officer as stating that percent of the recovered merchandise would have been sold on the sales floor prior to the theft.according to the report,yvonne was seen picking merchandise off the shelves on the sales floor as if she was shopping and choosing items out of the warehouse which could have been sold on the sales floor.citation.the report also cited beattie as stating that a year prior to the search,yvonne started bringing ready to use items and then expanded to unopened boxes of new things.this,according to the people,establishes that yvonne stole new merchandise from target.while yvonne admitted at the restitution hearing that the stolen merchandise included some new items that had been placed in the stockroom by nighttime employees,all testimony at the of yvonne,beattie,clarke,and even camp,target own described the stolen merchandise as largely damaged and unsellable.to claim that most of it was new is simply contrary to the record.
the people also challenge defendants reliance on thygesen,supra,th,d,a case we find particularly instructive.defendant bendix thygesen rented a used cement mixer from a small equipment rental company.he failed to timely return the mixer,claiming it had been stolen,and ultimately pleaded guilty to theft of the mixer.the probation report estimated the mixer replacement value at for a new one and to for a used one.at a restitution hearing,the manager of the rental company testified that he did not know the age of the mixer,its original cost,or how often the mixer had been rented prior to its loss.offering a catalog containing list and discounted prices for mixers that were similar but not identical to the stolen mixer,he then testified that the replacement cost of the mixer was.he also requested for the loss of use of the mixer,testifying that the monthly rental cost was and that the mixer had not been replaced in the months since the theft.required by the court to choose between receiving for the mixer replacement or for the loss of use,the manager elected to receive restitution for the loss of use,which the trial court then ordered.id.at,d.
the court of appeal reversed.it observed that because a victim is to be made whole and must be reimbursed for every economic loss,there was no logical reason why the trial court made the manager choose between the replacement value of the mixer or the months loss of rental value.thygesen,supra,th at,d.more significantly for our purpose,the court further noted that as to the replacement value of the mixer,the award should have been predicated on the replacement cost of like property in accordance with section,subdivision f a.id.at,d.in the case of the mixer,that meant what it would cost to replace it with a mixer of like type and age.the court explained as to a victim,the purpose of the restitution statute is to make that victim whole,not to give a windfall.the rental company is not entitled to replace a used mixer with a brand new one at appellant expense,absent some extraordinary facts.if the company were a car rental agency that lost a ford taurus,it would be entitled to the replacement value of a similar ford taurus,not a model.ibid.
likewise here.target was entitled only to restitution equal to the value of the stolen property,and by all accounts at the hearing,the value was substantially less than the last retail price for most goods.by failing to account for the fact that a majority of the stolen merchandise was already damaged at the time of the thus destined for trial court awarded target restitution for property that was of greater quality than that which defendants stole.this contravened section,subdivision f a mandate that the victim is only entitled to compensation for like property.as such,it was an abuse of discretion.
the people claim thygesen does not stand for the proposition that the court can not use the value of a new item as the basis for restitution for a stolen or damaged item of the same kind.instead,they attempt to distinguish it on the facts,explaining,the situation here differs from that in thygesen.simply stated,target is not in the business of renting items.nor is it in the business of selling used or outdated goods,such as the recovered stolen merchandise.investigator camp testified that it was target policy not to reshelve for sale the recovered goods,presumably to protect the target name and reputation.moreover,in thygesen,the stolen property was one cement mixer owned by a rental business.the cost of the one used mixer plus the loss of use could be easily proven and calculated.in this case target basically lost the value of six containing various types of goods that had been stolen,in addition to stolen goods that were never recovered.as discussed above,it would be impossible to determine the condition of each item when it was stolen and when each item was stolen,in order to calculate the value of the item at the time it was stolen.
it is true,as the people agree,that thygesen is based on a different set of facts.this does not,however,negate the point of law for which it stands as directed by section,subdivision f a,restitution is to be based on the replacement cost of a like item.thygesen,supra,th at,d.here,that means target was entitled to the replacement value of mostly damaged merchandise.
the people suggest that instead of thygesen,this case should be governed by people foster th,d,in which the defendant was ordered to pay plus a percent fee for a persian rug he stole during a residential burglary.the amount was based on the victim statement to the probation officer that she had paid for the rug.id.at,d.on appeal,defendant challenged,inter alia,the restitution order,arguing that it was improper to base the restitution award on the original cost of the rug.id.at,d.the court disagreed,concluding that absent unusual circumstances,or a showing by the defendant to the contrary,the original cost of a stolen item may be treated as evidence of replacement cost for purposes of restitution.id.at,d.the people seem to read foster as suggesting that in certain circumstances,the court may award restitution equal to the cost of a new replacement.this is not the case,as recognized by thygesen,supra,th,d.foster merely reaffirms that the proper measure is the replacement cost,and recognizes that in certain that have no applicability original cost may be evidence of the replacement cost.
the trial court improperly awarded target a windfall by ordering restitution based on the merchandise retail price instead of wholesale price 
defendants also argue that the trial court erroneously awarded target a windfall by calculating the value of the merchandise based on the retail price,or the price at which target sells the merchandise to its customers,instead of the wholesale cost,or the price at which target buys the goods and which it would pay to replace them.this,they argue,awarded target profits on the merchandise when,in fact,they were only entitled to the replacement cost,which is the wholesale price the people disagree,claiming that v ictim restitution can be based on the retail value of the property stolen.this is so,they reason,because section,subdivision f entitles target to a dollar amount that is sufficient to fully reimburse the victim or victims for every determined economic loss incurred as the result of the defendant criminal conduct and,they specifically note,section,subdivision f e expressly identifies profits lost by the victim as a compensable item.the people argument is flawed for one fundamental reason the prosecutor presented no evidence that target lost any profits as a result of the theft.
most of the stolen merchandise was never going to be sold to customers because it was,quite simply,unsellable.the items were to be returned to the vendors for credit to target.although never expressly stated by camp,logic dictates that target would only receive a credit in the amount it paid to acquire the product from the vendor certainly the vendors do not credit target for its potential profit.the items were damaged goods that could not be donated for any compensation and were given away for free.there is no rational basis for awarding profit on such merchandise.finally,while some items were to be given away at a total loss again not justifying an award of profit,others were to be donated at percent of the last retail price.there was no evidence offered at the restitution hearing that the percent target would have received for these goods exceeded the wholesale price.in other words,there was no evidence that target profited when it donated the salvage goods to charities.it was the prosecutor burden to produce prima facie evidence of this loss.millard,supra,th at,d giordano,supra,cal th at,d.this,it failed to do.
as to the small percentage of new,sellable items,there was no evidence that there was not a comparable replacement to sell to target customers.these were not unique products,but were consumer goods that target sold in abundance.indeed,the fact that target is a massive,nationwide retail store with a system for tracking goods suggests the items stayed in stock and no customer was ever deprived of a purchase.see people ortiz,supra,th at,d victim of music counterfeiting scheme was not entitled to recover for potential loss in sales of music cassette tapes because counterfeit tapes had been recovered and therefore could not be s
