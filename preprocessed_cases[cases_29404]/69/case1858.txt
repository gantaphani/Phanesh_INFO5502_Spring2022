introduction 
in this appeal from an order denying petition for approval of transfer of structured settlement payment,appellant,henderson receivables origination llc hereinafter henderson,contends that the superior court exceeded its authority in issuing the order.for the following reasons,we reverse and remand with instructions 
factual background procedural 
henderson,an indirect subsidiary of wentworth,llc,is a factoring company.factoring companies engage in the business of paying people,who have received a structured settlement annuity because of a successful tort claim,a lump sum payment and,in exchange,the right to some or all of the structured settlement annuity payments is transferred to the factoring company.henderson earns a profit,in part,by paying these persons a lump sum payment that is less than the discounted face value of the annuity payments.partially in response to federal tax legislation that would provide favorable tax treatment to structured settlement transfers that were,california enacted a law,the structured settlement transfer act hereinafter ssta,that requires disclosures to the seller of the structured settlement payment rights,notice to the attorney general,and court approval.see,et.
the court approval process requires the factoring company to file a petition in the county in which the transferor resides for approval of the transfer,attaching copies of the petition,the transfer agreement,the disclosure form,the annuity contract,any qualified assignment agreement and the structured settlement agreement,a list of the names and ages of the transferor dependents,notice of the court hearing date,and notice of a right to respond,subd.c.
after consideration of the petition and its attached documents,any written support or opposition by interested parties,and any evidence presented at the hearing,the court grants or denies the petition.in order to grant the petition for approval,the court must expressly find the transfer is in the best interest of the transferor,taking into account the welfare and support of the transferor dependents the transferor has been advised in writing to seek independent professional advice and either has received that advice or knowingly waived it the transferor has received the disclosure form the transfer agreement complies with insurance code sections and the transfer does not contravene any applicable statute or court order the transferor reasonably understands the terms of the transfer agreement and disclosure form and the transferor understands his or her right to cancel and does not wish to do so,subd.a.
the transfer agreement is effective only upon approval in a final court order,subd.a.the court that approves the transfer retains continuing jurisdiction to interpret and monitor the implementation of the transfer agreement,subd.f.a transfer that is not and does not comply with the requirements of the ssta is void.
since the ssta requirement went into effect,california courts have approved thousands of structured settlement transfers henderson alone has obtained judicial approval of more than structured settlement payment transfers throughout california.however,beginning in march of,several superior court judges in fresno county began to deny petitions for court approval of structured settlement payment transfers based upon actual or perceived misconduct on the part of factoring companies and concerns that the transfers could violate the provisions in the annuity contracts and underlying settlement agreements.henderson has appealed of these orders.this court has consolidated those appeals.
on april,judge donald black issued a tentative ruling in a pending henderson petition proceeding in re david fleming.the tentative ruling denied the petition for approval because it found that henderson had not complied with the requirements of the ssta.the tentative ruling criticized henderson for omitting material information and documents from the petition for court approval,and voiced the concerns about the provisions.in addition,judge black found that henderson had a pattern and practice of referring lawyers to the sellers in violation of the ssta independent counsel requirement and directed that the fleming order be served on the attorney general and state bar,and attached to certain future ssta petitions.
although the fleming tentative order did not explicitly void prior court approvals of ssta petitions,the tentative ruling concluded that errors similar to the ones that the court found in the fleming petition,such as the failure to include required documentations with the petition and to comply with the independent counsel requirement,would void any prior court approval of ssta petitions.in addition,the tentative ruling stated that henderson was not entitled to the structured settlement payments that were transferred and that henderson could not recover the lump sum payments that it made to the transferors.the tentative ruling required henderson to serve the order on each person who had transferred payments to henderson in approximately fresno and kern county petition cases as well as the insurers in those transactions.
henderson had a number of other ssta petitions pending in fresno county.before similar orders could be issued in those special proceedings,henderson filed requests for dismissal of all its pending petitions.most of these petitions,including all of the petitions before judge black,were not dismissed.
with respect to the instant case,henderson submitted a request for dismissal without prejudice of the red tomahawk petition on may.because a voluntary dismissal without prejudice had not been entered by may,on that date,henderson submitted a notice of withdrawal of the petition and also a request for dismissal with prejudice.
the instant red tomahawk petition was the third petition that henderson filed in order to transfer a structured settlement payment from red tomahawk to henderson.henderson filed the first petition for approval of the transfer of a single annuity payment from red tomahawk on august.according to henderson,before the matter was heard by the trial court,red tomahawk informed henderson that she wished to cancel the sale.as a result,on october,henderson filed a request for dismissal without prejudice,which was entered by the clerk.
in late,red tomahawk informed henderson that she had changed her mind and wished to move forward with the transfer.henderson filed the second petition for approval of the transfer of the payment on december.on january,judge adolfo corona denied the petition without prejudice because,among other reasons,the annuity and settlement agreement contained provisions barring sales.in denying the petition,judge corona specifically stated that the denial of this petition is without prejudice to a petition brought,by,or expressly consented to in writing by the owner of the annuity.
because henderson believed that it could address the court concerns,on march,henderson filed the instant petition,which was substantially similar to the second petition.this petition was assigned to judge black.
on the afternoon of may,judge black issued a tentative ruling on the red tomahawk petition by posting it to the superior court website.in the tentative ruling,judge black rejected henderson requests for a voluntary dismissal with or without prejudice because henderson was not a plaintiff for the purposes of dismissal under section,denied the petition for approval of the transfer,and entered a judgment of dismissal with prejudice.the hearing on the tentative ruling was scheduled for the next day.
the tentative ruling concluded that the petition must be denied because the annuity contract bars transfers and assignments.the tentative ruling also found that henderson failed to meet the disclosure requirements of the ssta because henderson had conceal ed the annuity terms by not including the page of the annuity that contained the provisions.
the tentative ruling further found that the petition should be denied because henderson referred the transferor to a conflicted attorney for advice on the transfer.judge black stated that he reviewed the henderson petitions that were filed in fresno county,as well as in kern and riverside counties,and found that henderson was continually referring certain attorneys to the transferees.judge black appears to have concluded that these attorneys are conflicted because they write estoppel letters that are expressly stated to be written for the benefit of henderson.the estoppel letters contain the attorney opinions as to the transferor purported understanding of the transfer agreement.judge black found that these estoppel letters represented that the attorneys had explained the terms of the transfer agreement,but that the letters did not contain representations that the attorneys had provided their clients,the transferees,with the advice that was required by the ssta,such as whether the client should enter into the agreement in the first place,whether there are tax consequences,or whether the client might lose government benefits such as ssi,medicare,or medicaid upon receipt of the lump sum.judge black concluded that these attorneys had violated their fiduciary duties of undivided loyalty and competence to their clients,the transferees.according to judge black,these attorneys can more properly be characterized as henderson counsel masquerading as attorneys for the transferors in order to push the sales through by creating a false appearance of independent counsel.because of henderson alleged pattern and practice of using conflicted attorneys,judge black ordered the clerk to serve a copy of the order on the attorney general and the state bar.
the tentative ruling also held that insurance code section not only bars approval of petitions in which counsel is not independent,it provides that even if approval were obtained by such subterfuge,the attempted purchase would be void.the tentative ruling further held that henderson could not recover the funds it expended on such voided transactions because henderson had unclean hands since henderson used conflicted attorneys.
henderson former counsel failed to request a hearing or appear at a hearing on may.accordingly,on may,the tentative ruling became final.
henderson then moved to vacate the may,order under code of civil procedure,section,subdivision b on the ground that the order was the result of the mistake of henderson former counsel in failing to request a hearing following the issuance of the tentative ruling on may.henderson also filed an objection to the order.in the objection,henderson argued,among other things,that the may,order violated henderson right to due process because henderson was not given notice and an opportunity to be heard before the court made its ruling which purportedly addressed collateral issues.henderson also objected to the court independent investigation of the various petitions that were filed in fresno,kern,and riverside counties,especially given that the court did not notify or consult the parties prior to the investigation.finally,henderson objected to the court apparent ruling that prior structured settlement payment transfers were void because henderson contended that such a ruling intruded upon the authority of other superior court judges and their final court orders approving ssta petitions.
the hearing on the motion to vacate and the objection was set for july.on july,judge black gave notice on the court website that,at the hearing to be held on the next day,he also would address whether the transfer was usurious,which if true,would provide another reason to deny the petition.in response,henderson filed an amended objection addressing the new usury issue.
on july,judge black issued an order granting henderson motion to vacate the may order and then entered a new order on july.
in the july,order,judge black denied henderson requests for voluntary dismissal of the petition with our without prejudice,concluding that henderson was not a plaintiff for the purposes of section.
judge black defended his heightened scrutiny of the petition,including his review of matters outside of the pleadings,based upon his conclusion that the ssta demanded that the court scrutinize the transaction.according to judge black,the purpose of the ssta is to place any attempt to purchase structured settlement payments under the strictest scrutiny and the superior court duty of oversight in the case is similar to situations such as where the claim of a minor is settled,or the named parties to a class action desire to settle the matter on behalf of all those within the class,which are situations in which the court duty of oversight has even been characterized as fiduciary in nature.thus,judge black concluded that he was not unduly entangled and embroiled in the matter because he was following the demands of the ssta.
judge black also concluded that henderson has engaged in a pattern and practice of shopping for different judges by submitting multiple petitions which concealed prior petitions or transfers and by seeking dismissals in light of adverse tentative rulings.judge black further concluded that henderson distinct lack of candor in its dealings with the court and the superior court affirmative duties where counsel are concerned supported his independent investigation of other henderson petitions to determine whether counsel for the transferees were independent.according to judge black,counsel is not independent because the same counsel appear over and over,repeatedly,for the transferees in this and other courts and because the chances of each and every transferee hiring the same attorney are so miniscule,the inference is clear they are referred by,and thus owe their compensation to,the factoring companies.judge black also concluded that the purpose of the estoppel letters prepared by the attorneys is to provide evidence against the transferees in any future dispute.
judge black further concluded that the provision in the annuity contract applies to bar the transfer,notwithstanding article of the california commercial code,because that article does not apply to annuity contracts.judge black also found,for the first time,that the transfer violated california usury laws because the transfer was in the nature of a loan,and not a sale.
judge black concluded that henderson was afforded due process because petitioner or its affiliates were parties to every single proceeding mentioned herein and thus have access to all of the files and record to which the court has referred.moreover,petitioner was notified of the court concerns about its practices with regard to these petitions in the tentative ruling posted on april,for the fleming matter.judge black further contended that he had provided sufficient notice of the tentative ruling,and that,in any case,henderson now had received the opportunity to be heard.
judge black ordered henderson to attach the order to any future petitions that it or wentworth or any affiliates filed in fresno county in the next five years.he also ordered that the order be sent to the attorney general and the state bar.
finally,judge black held that t he legislature provided that approval is but one of three requirements to avoid an automatic default finding that a given transaction as void.insurance code section b.therefore,judge black concluded that other persons or entities might be affected by his ruling and that they should be notified.thus,judge black ordered henderson to serve a copy of the order on each person or entity listed in any proof of service for any and all of the fresno county petitions listed in exhibits attached to the order,as well as any california agent for service of process for affected insurers.
henderson timely appealed and also filed a petition for a writ of supersedeas to stay enforcement of the trial court order pending appeal.on october,this court granted henderson petition for the writ of supersedeas.
