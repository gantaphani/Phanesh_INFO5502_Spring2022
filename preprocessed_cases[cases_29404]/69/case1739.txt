this appeal involves the esoteric subject of reinsurance.we resolve it on principles of appellate review.
appellant transport insurance company transport insured aerojet general corporation aerojet under a liability policy issued in,and that same year entered into the three reinsurance contracts pertinent here.numerous suits were brought against aerojet,and as early as it begin submitting claims for property damage to transport,which it denied based on a policy exclusion.notwithstanding that denial,transport began paying some investigative expenses,and began to submit claims to the reinsurers.a december decision by the california supreme court held that site investigative expenses could be covered,and in late transport finalized a settlement with aerojet,agreeing to pay million.transport claimed that over million of this was the responsibility of the reinsurers,and in december submitted its billing and final proof of loss to them.
years went by without resolution,and in transport filed separate lawsuits against each reinsurer,which lawsuits were consolidated.following an day trial,the jury quickly answered no to special verdict questions whether the lawsuits were timely filed,and judgment was entered against transport.
transport appeals,an appeal that has generated over pages of appendices,volumes of reporter transcripts,and pages of briefing,including a page appellant reply brief.and,transport tells us,the appeal presents two issues of first impression in california,issues that when decided by this court,will have an impact far beyond the confines of the specific dispute in this case t his court opinion is likely to become the lead authority on issues involving the statute of limitations in reinsurance claims,not only in california,but possibly throughout the nation apparently inviting us to publish some lengthy opinion addressing the claimed issues.we decline the invitation,and resolve the appeal under principles of appellate review,most fundamentally the doctrine of invited error.and we affirm.
background 
the insurance contracts 
in july,transport predecessor,transport indemnity company,issued to aerojet a blanket excess liability insurance policy,providing coverage from july,to july.the pertinent limit of liability was the difference between as a result of any one occurrence or in the aggregate and underlying retention of each occurrence.transport also agreed to defend aerojet and pay litigation expenses,a defense obligation that had no policy limit.
following issuance of the policy to aerojet,transport entered into three contracts of reinsurance,the contracts pertinent here.the first two reinsurance contracts were with international surplus lines insurance,a predecessor to tig insurance company tig,one of the two respondents here the third reinsurance contract was with unigard mutual insurance,a predecessor to seaton insurance seaton,the other respondent.for consistency with the proceedings below and the briefing,we will refer to tig and seaton.
reinsurance contracts are classified as either facultative or treaty.reinsurance is facultative if it covers the reinsured risk on an individual policy.the majority of reinsurance contracts are placed under a treaty,which covers the reinsured risk for an entire class of policies.prudential reinsurance superior court cal th,d.as justice croskey treatise explains,facultative and treaty reinsurance agreements may be further classified as to the distribution of risk between the original insurer and reinsurer.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group.under reinsurance,the reinsurer assumes a specified percentage of the risk and premiums associated with the particular percentage of the risk and premiums associated with the particular policy or class of policies covered.ibid.under reinsurance,the reinsurer pays losses only after they exceed a specified amount the retention.ibid.
the coverage details of the reinsurance contracts are not germane to our discussion and will not be set forth in detail.suffice it to say that the classification of coverage as pro rata or excess of loss was germane to some of the issues between transport and the reinsurers,and the subject of much testimony at trial.
one provision in each of the reinsurance contracts is germane,however when loss was to be paid.as to this,the tig contracts stated that payment of its proportion of loss and expense paid by transport will be made by tig to transport promptly following receipt of proof of loss.the seaton contract stated that p ayment of seaton proportion of loss and expense incurred by transport will be made to transport promptly upon receipt and approval by seaton of proof of loss in form satisfactory to seaton.
transport represents that reinsurance issues are rarely seen in appellate courts,and its lengthy briefing refers to the claimed dearth of authority pertinent to what it claims are the issues here.we thus digress to discuss reinsurance,and some of the features attendant to it.
reinsurance 
reinsurance is defined in insurance code section a contract of reinsurance is one by which an insurer procures a third person to insure him against loss or liability by reason of such original insurance.as described in a leading insurance treatise,reinsurance is a contract by which one insurer transfers to another insurer all or part of the risk it has assumed under a separate policy or group of policies in exchange for a portion of the premium.in essence,reinsurance is insurance for insurance companies.reinsurance provides insurers with the ability to spread the risk they have assumed,thereby preventing any one insurer from suffering a catastrophic loss.couch on insurance revised ed.reinsurance,couch.the insurer obtaining the reinsurance is called the ceding insurer.
our colleagues in division four described it this way reinsurance is a special form of insurance obtained by insurance companies to help spread the burden of indemnification.a reinsurance company typically contracts with an insurance company to cover a specified portion of the insurance company obligation to indemnify a policyholder in the event of a valid claim when a valid claim is made,the insurance company pays the first level insured,and the reinsurance company pays the insurance company.the reinsurance company obligation is to the insurance company,and the insurance company the reinsurer is thus the insured,or more appropriately the reinsured.ascherman general reinsurance d,fn.accord,catholic mutual relief society superior court cal th,d.
one aspect of reinsurance that distinguishes it from other insurance is that reinsurance contracts have no limitation provision,no reference to when suit has to be brought on the reinsurance contract.according to couch,a s there is typically no special statute of limitations for reinsurance contracts,the statute of limitations for contracts generally will apply.couch,supra.
among the other distinguishing attributes of reinsurance are the sophistication and expertise of the insured more accurately,reinsured which are themselves insurance companies.another is that the reinsurer does not itself investigate or adjust claims,but relies on the ceding insurer to do that.so,as transport briefing repeatedly tells us,the parties are essentially aligned not adverse.this passage is illustrative r einsurers must treat their reinsureds with utmost good faith.citation.this duty of extreme good faith arises out of the traditional mores of the industry under which reinsurance is seen as an honorable engagement where gentlemen agreements were often secured by a handshake.citation.indeed,case law has referred to reinsurers and their cedents as partners rather than adversaries.citation.because of this venerable history,d efences sic based on available periods of limitation usually have not been taken by insurers in the london reinsurance market,and some participants in the market feel that it is a custom not to assert them.citation.moreover,this duty of utmost good faith does not terminate when litigation commences.citation.indeed,transport asserts,seaton and tig can hardly feign ignorance of their duty to treat transport at all times with utmost good faith,as that duty was the subject of considerable expert testimony and argument at trial.fns.omitted.
apparently alluding to this concept in her closing argument at trial,transport counsel quoted a statement that she saw written in a reinsurance book,a book that was a whole catalog of cases about reinsurance and how reinsurance works the quote goes like this reinsurance is insurance between consenting adults.
seemingly based on the above principles,transport infers that it is unseemly,if not downright inappropriate,for reinsurers to even think of asserting such a thing as a limitations defense.what might have been,might have been.it is no longer.
the introduction to the chapter on reinsurance in the most recent edition of the other leading insurance treatise makes the point this way reinsurance has emerged from the shadows in the last years.at the time of the publication of the prior edition of this volume and for many decades before that,the reinsurance relationship was a quiet,backstage business transaction between insurers and their reinsurers.that transaction was carried out as an honorable undertaking or a gentleman agreement.policyholders and their attorneys saw no reason to probe those relationships,and courts had few occasions to interpret reinsurance contracts or adjudicate responsibility for the payment of losses.for a variety of reasons,including the sheer enormity of actual and potential liability for environmental and other claims and a series of insolvencies hitting both insurers and reinsurers,all that now has changed.holmes appleman on insurance,fns.omitted appleman.
in other words,all issues are fair game,including statutes of limitations,which brings us to the case at the heart of much discussion below,and here continental cas.stronghold ins,cir stronghold.
stronghold 
stronghold,decided in by the second circuit court of appeals,was an action by continental casualty continental,a reinsured,against several reinsurers that had refused to pay based on the statute of limitations.the district court ruled against the reinsurers,and they appealed.the second circuit affirmed,holding that the causes of action accrued when continental notified the reinsurers of its losses under the reinsurance policies and the reinsurers subsequently denied coverage.stronghold,supra,at.but the court of appeals went on the timeliness of continental claim thus turns on a fairly simple question when were its losses due and payable under the reinsurance policies the representative policy offered by the parties is hardly a paragon of clarity.but,we are able to discern at least one condition that continental had to satisfy before its right to indemnity could mature.loss,if any under the policy is to be reported to the reinsurer as soon as practicable.w e construe the notice provision to mean that continental had to report any actual losses,payments made on its underlying insurance policies within a reasonable period of time under the circumstances.citation.we also conclude that continental was entitled indeed probably obligated to wait a reasonable time for the reinsurers to decide whether they would pay or not,and,if so,how much.id.at.
finally,and apropos transport utmost good faith assertions here,the court said this although it has been said that the relationship between a reinsured and its reinsurer is not technically a fiduciary one citation,centuries of history have treated both as allies,rather than adversaries.citation.it is customary,for example,for both to share the premium paid by the underlying insured for coverage.citation.often they jointly prepare and defend unfounded claims by overreaching insureds.citation.because custom and usage have established a gentility and unity of interest between the reinsured and its reinsurer,citation,a generation ago,we doubt that the defendants would even have considered asserting a statute of limitations defense.citation.with the collapse of prominent british reinsurers,and the financial distress of lloyd of london,times may have changed.citations.as francois villon sighed ou sont les neiges where are the snows of yesteryear.stronghold,supra,at.
as noted,stronghold was decided in.this is how appleman described the case in the second circuit held that,where a reinsurance contract required that losses be reported to a reinsurer,the loss did not become due and payable by the reinsurer and the statute of limitations on an action against the reinsurer did not commence to run until a reasonable time elapsed after the ceding insurer gave notice of the loss to the reinsurer.appleman on insurance,supra.
that,then,was the setting when the state of affairs between transport and its reinsurers reached some significant milestones arising out of aerojet claims against transport.
the claims 
aerojet primary business was the development and production of missile and rocket motors for nasa and the armed forces.aerojet was sued in a number of actions alleging damages caused by toxic contamination of groundwater involving pollution at aerojet sites in rancho cordova and azusa,california,and began submitting claims to transport as early as,including for both loss and expense.though transport did start paying some expenses,it denied the claims for loss based upon a pollution exclusion.this ultimately led to much litigation,including,most significantly,the case leading to the opinion filed by the supreme court on december,aerojet general transport indemnity cal th,d,aerojet.there,following long and tortuous litigation through the lower courts id.at,d,the supreme court held that while transport had no duty to pay aerojet losses at rancho cordova,if certain criteria were met site investigation expenses might constitute defense costs covered under the policy.the supreme court remanded the case to the court of appeal,to be sent back to the trial court.aerojet,supra,cal th at,d.
following a mediation,in september aerojet and transport entered into a settlement by which transport agreed to pay in exchange for a release of all claims under the aerojet policy,including for both rancho cordova and azusa.the settlement agreement did not allocate the amount between loss and expense,or between rancho cordova or azusa.
according to transport brief,with this settlement the reinsurers contractual obligation to pay for their proportionate share of the aerojet claims arose.and b y letter dated december,transport submitted its final billing in the aerojet matter to tig,seeking the full amount of its reinsurance claim,a total of.citation.this was sent on transport behalf by vito peraino peraino sent the letter to william pascale,tig manager of assumed reinsurance claims.citation.the letter stated we have finalized our billings,having assembled all prior payments,and enclose our billing to you for this matter.as this matter was rather complex and carries with it a bit of history,we would like the opportunity to meet with you to present our claim,and to answer any questions you might have.
as to seaton,transport says that on or about december,peraino initiated the claims process with seaton by submitting transport initial proof of loss,which proof of loss was accompanied by a letter with language identical to that quoted above.and,transport says,as with the tig claim,it is this final billing that is controlling for the purpose of the causes of action asserted here.
much of the testimony at trial focused on the numerous communications between transport and the reinsurers that ensued,and hundreds of exhibits were introduced.similarly,much of the parties briefing sets out these communications in great detail we do not consider these communications pertinent to the issues before us,and do not recite them.however,a few facts are pertinent here,especially apropos transport utmost good faith assertions,facts that occurred primarily during the years that the aerojet coverage litigation was ongoing.those facts include communications within transport and with its counsel,and show that transport was aware that the statute of limitations could be an issue an awareness that existed even before stronghold was decided.here are some examples.
in,chet nalepa,senior vice president at transport sister company,american empire surplus lines insurance company,began to assist in transport collection efforts,and brought in outside counsel at lord,bissell brook,seeking advice regarding tig consistent denials of liability.nalepa also sought an update from transport regarding its earlier threat of litigation,emphasizing that because of its size,the claim is a matter of substance and requires attention to detail.transport did not respond,and nalepa ultimately closed his collection file.
in late,nalepa retained counsel at a second law firm,deborah cohen of pepper hamilton scheetz pepper hamilton,which had assisted transport in another matter.as his letter to cohen put it we are getting involved in this effort because of a prior litigation you have filed i spoken to eve rosen and she has blessed our involvement at this point.i am hopeful that your office will be able to assist transport further in recovering what appears to be long overdue reinsurance proceeds.nalepa letter ends with this this file is troublesome from a number of aspects and your considered legal opinion will be helpful.
by november,pepper hamilton had drafted a complaint against another of transport reinsurers,and a note on the front of the draft asked whether other reinsurers,such as unigard,seaton predecessor,should be added as a defendant.
cohen communicated with transport several times about the statute of limitations,including,for example,in a july memorandum where she expressed concern about the possible application of the statute of limitations,and advised that the issue could not sit.a november,letter from cohen was similar,expressing concern about the statute of limitations on some of these billings.
following the december supreme court decision in aerojet,supra,cal th,d,cohen wrote nalepa,advising transport that it should update its billing to tig,provide a reasonable time period for questions,and then demand payment and i f payment is not made,litigation should be commenced in july,transport sent updated bills to tig for expenses,stating that all billings are due days after receipt.
in june,transport sent another bill to tig,accompanied by a cover letter drafted by cohen,which letter she described as follows i have tried to wordsmith the letter to set this up for litigation.
following the september settlement with aerojet,transport brought in a third law firm,luce forward,hamilton scripps luce forward,to allocate the settlement between the aerojet sites and between loss and expense,in order to bill the reinsurers.some issues arose as to just how to apportion,and one attorney at luce forward told transport that it is unlikely that anyone is just going to write a check regarding the proposed allocation,and another that his expectation was that the matter was likely to go to litigation at the end of the day.they also warned transport regarding the statute of limitations transport rosen understood in that ultimately there was going to be some litigation.indeed,in september,attorneys at luce forward drafted a complaint by transport against tig and seaton 
it was not until many years later that transport filed any lawsuit.
transport lawsuits 
on january,transport filed a complaint against tig,followed four days later by a complaint against seaton.both complaints alleged two causes of action,for declaratory relief and breach of contract,based on the respective reinsurer failure to pay its proportionate share of the aerojet settlement.
tig filed its answer on march,seaton on april.both asserted the affirmative defense that transport claims were barred by the statute of limitations applicable to breach of contract claims.code civ,subd.the actions were later consolidated.
the motions for summary adjudication and summary judgment 
on april,transport filed motions for summary adjudication,the first against tig,the second against seaton.the motions were addressed to the affirmative defenses,and argued that as a matter of law transport claims were not barred by the statute of limitations for contract claims.transport brief describes its motions this way as authority,transport cited and quoted extensively from prudential lmi com.insurance superior court cal d,and forman chicago title ins.th,d,which hold that the statute of limitations is tolled during the time an insurer is investigating a first party insurance claim.
significantly,in its motions below transport also cited stronghold,a citation not mentioned in its brief to us.and as to stronghold,transport said that the court there observed that,as a general matter,new york law requires both a a demand for payment and b either a rejection of that demand or lapse of a reasonable time for payment.
tig and seaton filed opposition to transport motions,and also their own motions,each seeking summary judgment based on the statute of limitations defense.these motions also cited stronghold.so,too,did transport opposition to the reinsurers motions and its reply on its own motion.for example,its opposition to seaton motion said that stronghold,the only reinsurance case dealing with the issue is fully consonant with california law,and fully supports transport position.seaton argues there were two possible dates for accrual under new york law,the first being when the reinsurer denied coverage,and the second being after a reasonable period of time after a claim is submitted.seaton position is squarely contradicted by controlling california law.stronghold is fully consonant with prudential lmi,supra,cal d,to the extent each case teaches that the limitations period does not run during the claims process,and only commences or reactivates when the insurer has formally and unequivocally denied the claim.
transport reply on its own motion asserted that the custom and practice of the industry confirm that the claims did not accrue until a final offer or denial was communicated.the only reinsurance case on point,stronghold,confirms this.further,california coverage law comes to the same result via the prudential lmi line of cases where the statute is tolled while the insurer investigates and negotiates the claim.
the four motions were heard on march,before the honorable charlotte woolard,who began by announcing her rulings on the numerous evidentiary objections.she then turned to announcement of the tentative rulings regarding the motions that bring us here today,and in connection with transport motions referred to equitable tolling and equitable estoppel.after judge woolard completed her tentative rulings,counsel for tig argued at length against the applicability of equitable tolling.similarly,counsel for seaton asked that judge woolard take another look at prudential lmi.
on april,judge woolard issued two orders,each addressing transport motion against the particular reinsurer and that reinsurer motion against transport,orders that were thorough indeed,with lengthy discussions of the law.the two orders were similar in fact,in great part identical and as relevant here,provided in pertinent part as follows the parties have not cited,and the court has not found,any reported california decision addressing the question of when a cause of action for breach of reinsurance contract accrues.a persuasive decision from the second circuit court of appeals is most directly on point.in continental cas.stronghold ins,supra,the second circuit held that,under new york law,a reinsurance cause of action accrues when the loss insured against becomes due and payable under the policy.citation.looking to the policy at issue,the court found that the reinsured was required to report its losses within a reasonable period of time.citation.the onus was then on the reinsurer to decide,after a reasonable amount of time in which to make its coverage determination,whether it would pay the claim.citation.under these circumstances,the second circuit found that the plaintiff causes of action accrued after the plaintiff submitted its claims to the defendant,and either the defendant denied the claim or a reasonable period of time elapsed without a decision from the defendant.citation.
from there,and addressing,for example,the motions,judge woolard went on to note that a fter transport submits a proof of loss,seaton allegedly breaches the contract,and transport causes of action accrue,where seaton denies a covered claim or seaton takes an unreasonable amount of time to communicate its coverage decision.from that point,plaintiff has four years in which to file its action against defendant.and from there,judge woolard went on to deny the motions on the ground that triable issues exist as to whether seaton ever formally denied transport claims reflected in the proofs of loss and when the causes of action nonetheless accrued after a reasonable amount of time passed for seaton to have evaluated the claims.the analysis in the order as to the motions was similar.
the case proceeded to a jury trial,which began on may.as that trial is described by transport the coverage dispute here included the defendant reinsurers contentions that the facultative reinsurance certificates did not mean what they stated and are excess of loss certificates as opposed to pro rata transport suffered no loss to be reinsured and transport allegedly made a bad faith allocation to the reinsurers of the underlying settlement.and,of course,there was the issue of the statute of limitations.
the parties had submitted trial briefs,and as to the statute of limitations issue transport brief said this the defendants first stated defense focused primarily on statute of limitations which fails under the holding of stronghold decision and pursuant to this court orders denying the motions for summary judgment.as this court well knows,continental casualty stronghold insurance,supra,held that the statute of limitations does not start to accrue until the reinsurance claim is denied.in passing discussion,the stronghold court also noted that an alternative time would be a reasonable time following submission of the final proofs of loss if the reinsurer did not act upon the final proofs.this court referenced both accrual tests in the orders finding triable issues of fact and denying the summary judgment motions.
transport had also filed its objections to tig special instructions,which as pertinent here,included the following special instruction violates this court orders on the statute of limitations affirmative defense.the issue is when the claims accrued the four year time period accrued either when tig definitively denied the claim or when a reasonable period passed after submission of the final proofs of loss.italics added.
prior to trial judge woolard dealt with in limine motions,one of which was tig motion to bifurcate,to try first the statute of limitations defense.judge woolard indicated her inclination to deny the motion,following which counsel for tig attempted to convince her to change her mind.replying,counsel for transport argued as follows your honor,that completely misstates the issue in a reinsurance context.it a rehash of their failed summary judgment motion.that was one of the arguments that they made in their motion,and it was rejected by this court in favor of applying the holding of stronghold which the court found the persuasive authority as the only authority relevant to the issue of accrual.our claim is a breach of contract claim which under the holding of stronghold and this court adoption of that holding in this case as the law in the case,it accrues when tig or seaton denied the claim.and that when the four years start,or a reasonable time after submission of the final proofs of loss,which goes into,of course,custom and practice on all fronts including supplementing proofs of loss.
the jury instruction ultimately given on the statute of limitations was as follows affirmative defense statute of limitations.in this case,transport claims against the defendant accrued after transport submitted its claims to defendants and when,one,defendants denied the claims,or,two,a reasonable period of time elapsed after the submission of the claims without a decision by the defendants.if seaton either denied the claims or a reasonable period of time elapsed following submission of the claims by january,transport claims against seaton were filed too late and are time barred.if tig either denied the claims or a reasonable period of time elapsed following submission of the claims by january,transport claims against tig were filed too late and are time barred.
the genesis of this instruction is central to the issue here and will be discussed in detail below.suffice to say here that at the least transport agreed to this instruction if it did not propose it.
the parties agreed to submit the matter with special verdict forms as to each reinsurer,asking the jury to answer specific questions,the first of which was,do you find that transport timely filed its lawsuit against the particular reinsurer 
transport closing argument was late in the afternoon of june,following which judge woolard gave her concluding instructions,instructed the clerk to swear the bailiff,and the matter was then in the hands of the jury.it was close to.at the next morning,the jury returned with the verdicts,answering no to the two questions numbered.
judgment was entered on june.
the motion for new trial 
on june,transport filed a motion for new trial,asserting two grounds insufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict and instructional error,the inclusion of the second prong of stronghold and failure to instruct on equitable estoppel.on the second ground,the motion contended that the court erred because nowhere in prudential controlling california supreme court precedent does the court peg the length of the statutory limitations period to something as vague as a reasonable time after the insured submits a claim.for that matter,neither does the holding in stronghold.to the contrary,it is consistent with prudential in requiring a denial before the statute can expire.
following opposition and reply,the motion came on for hearing on july,and on july,judge woolard denied it.on august,transport filed its notice of appeal.
transport agreed to the statute of limitations instruction,if it did not propose it,and any claim that it was erroneous is barred by the invited error doctrine 
transport first argument is that the trial court instructions regarding the statute of limitations was prejudicially erroneous because it contained an incorrect statement of law regarding accrual and utterly failed to address tolling.we conclude that the argument is barred by the doctrine of invited error.
under the doctrine of invited error,when a party by its own conduct induces the commission of error,it may not claim on appeal that the judgment should be reversed because of that error.mary city of los angeles cal d,and authorities there collected mary.as a leading treatise puts it,an appellant can not complain of error it personally invited.in other words,one whose conduct induces or invites the commission or error by the trial court is estopped from asserting it as a ground for reversal on appeal.eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group,citing norgart v.the upjohn cal th,d,and multimedia,bank of america technology operations,th,d.
we have described the doctrine this way it is an application of the estoppel principle where a party by his conduct induces the commission of error,he is estopped from asserting it as a ground for reversal on appeal.citation.at bottom,the doctrine rests on the purpose of the principle,which is to prevent a party from misleading the trial court and then profiting therefrom in the appellate court.citations.munoz city of union city th,d.
it has been said that the invited error doctrine applies with particular force in the area of jury instructions.stevens owens corning fiberglas th,d,and numerous cases have held that a party who requests,or acquiesces in,a particular jury instruction can not appeal the giving of that instruction.see,nevis pacific gas electric cal d,electronic equipment express,donald seiler d,and numerous cases there collected gherman colburn d.instruction.
claiming to describe what occurred before judge woolard,transport brief asserts that p rior to closing arguments,the court and counsel discussed the various jury instructions the parties had submitted.citation.seaton trial counsel submitted a statute of limitations instruction on its own caption which tracked the trial court prior ruling on the summary adjudication motions.citations.the court accepted this and instructed the jury.
transport description as to the origin of the instruction is less than candid it had as much to do with the instruction,if not more,than did seaton.
the instruction was the subject of lengthy argument below,ten pages to be exact.it arose in the context of,as judge woolard described it,jury instructions disputed by transport,and specifically in transport argument that tig had agreed to a different instruction than the one it proposed.the claimed agreed to instruction was the one to which transport and seaton had instruction transport now complains of here.
so,to set the stage for that discussion,counsel for seaton advised judge woolard that a lthough the instructions are on my caption,they are basically there because they are the result of our conference.and we have retyped some of them and some of these have mine on the side because they basically are on my letterhead,but not necessarily proposed by me.italics added.judge woolard thanked seaton counsel for being kind enough to take the laboring oar on having all of this produced so that we could address it in a reasonable fashion,and then went to the argument the first one is special instruction number,affirmative defense statute of limitations.
the next person to talk was counsel for transport,who asserted that tig proposed instruction does not track the court ruling or the case law in stronghold.and,in fact,we have an agreed instruction,if you look at the last document,there is an agreed instruction on an affirmative defense statute of limitations which specifically tracks the court ruling.that why it agreed.this one the instruction proposed by tig does not and should not be given.
lengthy argument ensued,with counsel for tig urging that its proposed instruction be given counsel for transport vigorously argued otherwise,urging that judge woolard give the instruction it had agreed to with seaton.this instruction,transport counsel stated,is,in fact,tracking the court i mean there is reason why seaton agreed to it.it is directly language in the court ruling obviously it a reasonable period of time after something,and the after something was after the claims were submitted italics added.
counsel for tig replied,himself citing to stronghold,to which counsel for transport responded as follows 
the court looked at the contentions made by the parties here and there is not an issue of late notice here either.so the issue is as the court described it,either they gave us a definitive denial at which time the clock would start ticking or the claims were submitted and there was no further communication after they were submitted and a reasonable time passes.that the issue.it ca be the way they want it in the abstract.it confusing to the jury.it not the standard adopted by this court in the ruling where the court literally said,under these circumstances the second circuit found that plaintiff causes of action accrued after the plaintiff submitted its claims to defendant and either one,the defendant denied the claims,or two,a reasonable period of time elapsed without a decision from the defendant.it obviously not a reasonable period of time elapsed in the abstract t hey want to make it as abstract as possible to slant things in their favor,but that not the law of the case here.and that why seaton and transport have agreed on this language,and we thought we had an agreement from tig and obviously we do.
counsel for tig reiterated that he quoted from stronghold transport counsel responded briefly,followed by more argument from counsel for tig.then,transport counsel said this 
the standard has to do with when does a breach of contract claim accrue,not when could you sue.when does the breach of contract claim accrue.and what stronghold was looking at was different set of factual circumstances so then the opinion in stronghold,the actual holding in stronghold is just the first standard and that is actually consistent with the custom and practice testimony we received in this trial.what the court did in ruling on the adjudication motions it used stronghold as a guide,but adapted the stronghold decision to the facts as presented in the for summary judgment.and that why on page of the ruling,the court specifically found that the cause of action starts to accrue when the claims are denied or when a reasonable period of time has elapsed after submission of the claim without a decision by the defendants.
following a brief interchange,counsel for transport went on with more references to stronghold your honor,if we were going to go purely on the stronghold decision and not the court orders,which is the law of the case,the n we have to only have the first standard,which is the statute only begins to accrue when the defendants denied the claims because that was literally the holding.the rest of the language in the opinion is really dicta,explaining the circumstances of stronghold in the particular situation which is not our situation 
to this judge woolard replied as follows but i found the dicta to be persuasive.i am just wondering if i misspoke in my writing of these orders.
saying nothing in response to judge woolard observation,counsel for transport went on for two more pages.finally,judge woolard asked if there was anything further,and counsel for tig replied just that counsel misstated what happened in stronghold.it was stipulated that notice was timely.the only issue in stronghold was accrual,and the court has already read stronghold and understands its prongs.and i read from page of the opinion what the prongs were and that the additional language we are objecting to does appear and that why we are objecting.
judge woolard then ruled she would give the affirmative defense statute of limitations as what i thought to be the jury instruction.regarding the special instructions that tig has submitted for statute of limitations,the court is not going to give that.
seeking to avoid application of the invited error rule,transport quotes language from mary,supra,cal d,a case it cites numerous times in its brief.the quoted language includes this but the invited error doctrine does not apply when a party,while making the appropriate objections,acquiesces in a judicial determination.citation.and this an attorney who submits to the authority of an erroneous,adverse ruling after making appropriate objections or motions,does not waive the error in the ruling by proceeding in accordance therewith and endeavoring to make the best of a bad situation for which he was not responsible.mary does not avail transport.what happened there is a far cry from what happened here.
the issue in mary concerned the possible vicarious liability of the city of los angeles for the conduct of police sergeant schroyer who while on duty raped a woman he had detained.as of the time of trial one case had held that the plaintiff had stated a valid cause of action against the county for the intentional misconduct of a deputy sheriff,that the sexual misconduct flowed from the very exercise of his authority.mary,supra,cal d at.that case was white county of orange d,and the trial judge in mary gave an instruction based on that case.mary,supra,at.
b ecause the record indicated that the city had requested the instruction,the supreme court solicited briefing from the parties to determine whether the doctrine of invited error should bar the city from contending that,as a matter of law,sergeant schroyer was acting outside the scope of his employment when he raped plaintiff.mary,supra,cal at.the supreme court held for the city,that the doctrine should not apply,but not on any basis providing solace to transport.rather,it was because of the city position throughout,which the supreme court described as follows 
the record shows that the instruction was proposed under the following circumstances.throughout the proceedings in this matter,the city challenged the decision in white county of orange,supra,d.the trial court correctly considered itself to be bound by the appellate court decision in white.citation.at the instruction conference,the court told the parties that notwithstanding the city objections,it would instruct the jury in accordance with white,and that unless the city proffered an alternative instruction it would give plaintiff proposed instruction,which was based on white.the city then submitted,and the court gave,the instruction quoted above.
immediately after the case was submitted to the jury,the trial court gave the parties an opportunity to tie up any loose ends relating to any matter that had not yet been put on the record.counsel for the city then explained the circumstances which led it to submit the instruction at issue d uring our many,many hours of discussions concerning jury instructions,i did indicate to the court that we did not believe that white was an appropriate case with which the jury should be instructed as it was not an appropriate statement of the law.the court indicated that it would follow white and unless i wanted plaintiff instructions to be the ones to go to the jury,i would be requested to draft an instruction based upon the language in white.in response to that,the defense submitted an instruction based upon white which the court read to the jury.for the record,i would like it to be clear that we do not believe that white is the authority that should be followed and that we objected to giving any instructions in accordance with the white case,albeit,we did submit an instruction based upon the court request.the trial court agreed with counsel account,but pointed out that the precise wording of the instruction was the city.mary,supra,cal d at.
after reciting the doctrine of invited error,the supreme court went on with the language quoted above on which transport relies.and then went on further here,the city did not invite the trial court to instruct the jury that liability for a sexual assault can arise from a police officer exercise of official authority.to the contrary,it took the opposite position throughout the case,including the instruction conference.the city never induced the trial court to follow white it merely acquiesced after objecting to the court decision to instruct in accordance with white,and submitted an instruction in accordance with that decision.although the city would be barred from attacking the specific language of the jury instruction it submitted,it is,under the circumstances of this case,not precluded from asserting that white was erroneously decided mary,supra,cal d at.
as demonstrated above,the conduct of transport counsel is nothing like that of counsel for the city in mary,who throughout the proceedings challenged the decision,who during many,many hours of discussions indicated that the law was wrong,and was not an appropriate case with which the jury should be instructed.put otherwise,the invited error doctrine did not apply because the party acquiesced while making the appropriate objections.id.at.that hardly describes transport conduct here.
in electronic equipment,supra,d,our colleagues in division three were met with a similar argument as that transport makes here.rejecting it,and the many cases appellant had cited,the court held as follows in all of the cases cited the party alleging error had strenuously made his objection and then acted defensively to lessen the impact of the error.no waiver can be predicated on this course of action.citation.here appellants did not formally make an objection except to offer an alternative definition,and they ultimately and expressly stated that they had no objection to the court definition.the error was thus waived.d at.here,as noted,transport agreed to if it did not propose the language in the instruction.it did not object,let alone strenuously.
transport opening brief,referring generally to arguments made in reply to the opposition to its new trial motion,essentially asserts that it acquiesced in the instruction that judge woolard virtually insisted on giving,at one point describing the instruction as one she craft ed as transport counsel acknowledged at oral argument,judge woolard did not craft the instruction.and the only insistence was by transport counsel.
a may,email from transport counsel to opposing counsel dealing with the proposed jury instructions was put before judge woolard in tig opposition to transport new trial motion.the email reads in pertinent part as follows per our discussions on friday,i would appreciate a copy of the list of instructions to which we agreed and i would appreciate any revisions of the specials that defendants might want to offer as to the affirmative defense of statute of limitations,we must insist that the specific language of the court order derived from the stronghold decision be used and suggest the following wording should be used,going on to propose language essentially identical to that in fact contained in the instruction given.italics added.
in its reply brief,transport asserts that when this court applies the actual invited error doctrine to the actual facts of this case where it is clear transport in fact objected to the reasonable time prong aa the court will inevitably conclude that transport trial counsel did not invite error and has properly preserved the important issues this case presents for appeal.we conclude otherwise.
the sole record reference aa is transport brief attempt in its reply to seaton opposition to its motion for summary adjudication to distinguish stronghold.that brief attempt was in its reply memorandum,quoted above,a memorandum of november.transport cites to nothing between then and the june,court session when the instructions were settled in any way objecting to the language.
at another place transport reply asserts that its counsel agreed to the instruction because the trial court had already ruled on the pertinent legal issues and the instruction accurately tracked the court prior albeit erroneous legal ruling on the law.and,transport goes on,its counsel had little to gain by continuing to dispute a legal issue the court had already decided and possibly something to lose aggravating the trial judge,who was still conducting the trial.
we offer two observations.first,the claim that advocating a position with an experienced judge would somehow aggravate her is sheer speculation not to mention demeaning.beyond that,as the supreme court confirmed in le francois goel cal th,d,there is nothing binding about a trial judge ruling on a motion for summary adjudication,as such a ruling can be revisited on the court own motion we hold that code of civil procedure section and limit the parties ability to file repetitive motions but do not limit the court ability,on its own motion,to reconsider its prior interim orders so it may correct its own errors.id.at,d.and the court added this we can not prevent a party from communicating the view to a court that it should reconsider a prior ruling although any such communication should never be ex parte.we agree that it should not matter whether the judge has an unprovoked flash of understanding in the middle of the night citation or acts in response to a party suggestion.if a court believes one of its prior interim orders was erroneous,it should be able to correct that error no matter how it came to acquire that belief.id.at,d.the supreme court even added this practical tip for counsel nothing would prevent the losing party from asking the court at a status conference to reconsider a ruling.ibid accord,nieto blue shield of california life health ins.th,d.
here,as quoted above,judge woolard herself said that she wonder ed if i misspoke in my writing of these orders.as also noted,counsel for transport said nothing in response,which is perhaps not surprising,as transport was pushing strongly for the instruction.
in its reply brief transport cites to some invited error cases that refer to the doctrine as one involving a decision made for tactical reasons,with the following authority c people dunkle cal th,d,the invited error doctrine is inapplicable,as it does not appear tri
