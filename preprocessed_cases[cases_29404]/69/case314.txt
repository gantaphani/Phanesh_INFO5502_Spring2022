in the district court,plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of new york state voter enrollment scheme,in particular election law.that statute states that when a political party fails to receive at least votes for that party gubernatorial candidate in the previous election,see id,defendants commissioners of the state board of elections are required to remove that political party name from the voter registration form and convert voters in such party to voters.the statute thereby removes a voter affiliation with such party from the state registered voter lists.
that removal is challenged in this litigation as violating voters constitutional right of association.the right of association guarantees individuals the right to join with individuals to accomplish a shared political objective that is protected by the first amendment.see citizens against rent control berkeley,d.the constitution accords the same protection independently to associations as it does to individuals.id.at.
background 
plaintiffs political organizations and their members include new york state green party,libertarian party,right to life party,liberal party,and marijuana reform party.the green party and its members original plaintiffs brought this action in which the other parties and their members intervenor plaintiffs later intervened contending that election law violated their first amendment rights of speech and association and unreasonably discriminated against them in violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment of the constitution.
new york state voter enrollment scheme 
new york law states that a political organization which supports candidates for public office shall be designated as either a party or an independent body.a political organization is designated as a party,with all of the benefits that accrue to such categorization,if at the last gubernatorial election such organization candidate for governor received at least votes.see law.a political organization is designated as an independent body if its candidate for governor received fewer than votes in the last gubernatorial election.see id.both a party and an independent body under the election law refer to what are more colloquially known as political parties.for the sake of clarity,we will use the term party when referring to a political party that qualifies for the designation of party under new york law,and political party or independent body when referring to an organization that fails to qualify for the party designation.
a number of unique benefits accrue to a party.first,only a party can automatically place a candidate on the ballot for statewide election without first undertaking the burden of a special petition drive in order to do so.see id.further,a party may choose their statewide candidate in a closed primary election,while an independent organization may not.id.a closed primary is an election in which only those voters enrolled as members of that particular party are allowed to vote.for such an election to take place,the state,the party,and the local boards of elections who administer primaries must be able to identify whether a voter is actually a member of a given party and thus eligible to participate in the primary.new york enrollment scheme allows registered voters to enroll in parties,see id.k vi,and requires the publication of voter enrollment information to facilitate such identification.see id.
when plaintiffs brought their suit and still today with respect to any to this suit,the voter registration form which a voter must fill out in order to register to vote in new york allowed those filling out the form to enroll as a member of a party and included a box to check for each political organization that qualified as a party.see id.k vi.the form had an extra box for voters who did not wish to enroll in any party.id.the registration form noted that in order to vote in a primary election,a voter had to be enrolled in a party.id.f.there was no box labeled other,or any other way for a voter to enroll in or express an affiliation with another political organization.
new york law further requires the local boards of elections to process the voter registration forms and to maintain and make available to the public registration lists indicating the names and addresses of all registered voters for each election district over which the boards have jurisdiction.id.local boards must also make enrollment lists available to the public,and such lists must include the voters names,addresses and party affiliation or list the voter as.id.currently,the enrollment lists do not indicate voters affiliation with other political parties,and thus do not indicate whether a voter has been affiliated with a political party in the past that either never enjoyed the party designation or at one time was designated a party,but subsequently lost the party status.parties use these enrollment lists to conduct closed primaries,but they also use the lists for many other purposes,such as identifying new voters,processing voter information,organizing and mobilizing party members,fundraising,and other activities that influence the political process.
as noted above,if a party fails to receive votes for its gubernatorial candidate in an election,it will be treated as an independent body,and not a party,in the next election.in connection with this change in status of the political body,the local boards must erase the enrollment information of any member of a former party and change the status of that individual to on the registration poll record.see id.plaintiff political party members claim that,as a practical matter,thus deprives them of the ability to declare publicly their political affiliation,and to have that affiliation maintained and publicized in the enrollment lists.they additionally maintain that the challenged law deprives them of the ability to use the enrollment list information to conduct party building activities.
c.the instant case 
on december,after it failed to obtain votes for its gubernatorial candidate in the election,the green party and several of its current and prospective members filed a complaint against the new york state board of elections,the new york city board of elections and the commissioners of each body.the city board of elections did not oppose the claims.plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction that would prohibit the state defendants from enforcing election law.they requested that defendants be prohibited from taking any steps that would prevent voters from enrolling in any political party that had previously gained recognition as a party,and that the court require defendants to continue to include a voter enrollment status in the enrollment lists even if they had enrolled in a party that was about to lose its status.the district court granted plaintiffs application for a temporary restraining order on december,finding under burdick takushi,d,and schulz williams,cir,that plaintiffs had alleged violations of their first and fourteenth amendment rights and that the interests the state used to justify the challenged provisions were neither compelling nor reasonable.
on january,the district court conducted a hearing on plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction,and subsequently granted that motion on may.green party i,d.the court found new york voter enrollment scheme,and election law in particular,imposed a severe burden on the first amendment rights of the green party and its supporters,id.at,and that the law unreasonably discriminated against minor political parties and their supporters.id.at.as such,the scheme could only withstand constitutional challenge upon a showing of a compelling state interest.id.at.
the district court further found defendants had failed to show that the challenged aspects of the election law scheme advanced any legitimate state interest,let alone a compelling and narrowly tailored one.id.at.the preliminary injunction ordered defendants to a maintain on the state voter registration form a box for voters to enroll in the green party,and b ensure that the local boards of elections maintained the enrollment status of voters who had enrolled in the green party in the past,and continued to enroll such voters in the future,at least through the gubernatorial election of.id.at.
after the district court issued this injunction,the remaining plaintiffs,the liberal party and the right to life party both of which had lost their status as parties as a result of the elections and the libertarian and marijuana reform parties neither of which had ever won recognition as a party,but had placed candidates on the statewide ballot in the election,moved to intervene.the trial court granted intervenors motions and on july,held a hearing on the intervenors application to have the preliminary injunction extended to them.in an order dated september,the district court extended the preliminary injunction to the intervenors and thus enjoined enforcement of against them as well.green party ii,wl,dist.lexis,at.the order also required defendants to open new york voter enrollment scheme to plaintiffs by revising the voter registration form to include an option labeled other write in that would be followed by a blank line permitting voters to declare their political affiliation with any political organization by writing the name of such political organization on that line.in conjunction with that revision,the court further required the voter registration form to include instructions notifying voters that they could use the other line to enroll in a political organization that was not one of the parties identified on the form.id.at.
in addition,the court directed local boards to maintain and update the enrollment information of voters currently enrolled in or who in the future might use the form to enroll in any of the plaintiff parties.since some voters would have been disenrolled from the liberal and right to life parties,the state board was ordered to use its best efforts to notify those voters that they could in those parties by completing a new form.finally,the district court ordered the defendants to ensure that these directives remained in force so long as the plaintiff parties continued to enjoy sufficient support to place statewide candidates on the ballot in the most recent gubernatorial election.id.at.
in another order issued on the same day,the district court prohibited defendant new york state board of elections from including green party voters as unenrolled in the voter enrollment information published on its website.this other order also required the state board to provide the green party with the same voter enrollment data,in the same form,as it provided to parties.green party state bd.of elections,wl,dist.lexis,at green party iii.
the state defendants appealed.for the reasons set out in the discussion that follows,and because we agree substantially with the district court may,opinion,we affirm.
discussion 
i preliminary injunctiona.issuance standards 
to obtain a preliminary injunction the moving party must show,first,irreparable injury,and,second,either a likelihood of success on the merits,or b sufficiently serious questions going to the merits and a balance of hardships decidedly tipped in the movant favor.jackson dairy,hood sons,cir per curiam.
in general,we review a district court grant of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion,overturning its decision only if it rested on an error of law or on a clearly erroneous factual finding.see fun damental too,gemmy indus,cir.further,where,as here,plaintiffs seek vindication of rights protected by the first amendment,we are obliged to make an independent examination of the record as a whole,to ensure that the district court judgment has not improperly intruded into the field of free expression.see bose consumers union of united states,d.when the injunction alters the status quo,as does this one,plaintiffs must show a substantial likelihood of success.see rodriguez ex rel.rodriguez debuono,cir per curiam.finally,where a first amendment right has been violated,the irreparable harm requirement for the issuance of a preliminary injunction has been satisfied.see elrod burns,d.
claimed constitutional violations 
first amendment claims 
plaintiffs argue that new york voter enrollment scheme violates the first amendment as applied to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment because it impinges on their right to organize a political party and associate together to advance that party shared political beliefs.the words freedom of association are not to be found in the first amendment but,over nearly years,the supreme court has developed a jurisprudence that guides us today.in,the court held that a right to associate is entitled to first and fourteenth amendment protection.see naacp alabama,d.thus,the naacp could not be compelled to disclose to the state of alabama its list of members in that state because the order requiring it to do so constituted a substantial restraint upon the exercise by petitioner members of their right to freedom of association.id.at.two years later in bates little rock,the court added that for the state to justify a significant encroachment on an associational right,the state must point to a compelling reason for that encroachment,d.and,in,the court held that the state must also persuasively show a substantial relation between the information sought and a subject of overriding and compelling state interest.gibson.legislative investigation,d.
the supreme court further instructs us that to determine whether a claimed violation of the right to associate is valid,a court must consider the character and magnitude of the alleged injury the plaintiff has sustained,and then must identify and evaluate the interests the state uses to justify the burdens imposed by the challenged rule,taking into consideration the extent to which the state interests make it necessary to burden plaintiff rights.burdick,at.quoting anderson celebrezze,d.
all election laws invariably impose some burden upon individual voters.id.at.whether that burden concerns the registration and qualifications of voters,the selection and eligibility of candidates,or the voting process itself,it inevitably has an effect on an individual right to vote and associate with others for political purposes.id.accordingly,the court has refused to subject all election regulations to strict scrutiny.id.instead,it has held that the rigorousness of our inquiry into the propriety of a state election law depends upon the extent to which a challenged regulation burdens first and fourteenth amendment rights.id.at.
if those rights are subject to severe restriction,the regulation has to be narrowly drawn to advance a compelling state interest.id.if it imposes only reasonable,nondiscriminatory restrictions,then important regulatory interests are sufficient to justify the restrictions.id.quoting anderson,at.courts are required to consider the restrictions within the totality of the state overall plan of regulation.lerman bd.of elections,cir see also storer brown,d discussing the totality approach and application of that approach in determining the constitutionality of voter laws.
fourteenth amendment claims 
plaintiffs also contend that the statutory classification scheme violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment because the state enrollment list policy gives established parties an advantage over minor or developing parties.the supreme court has said that if state law grants estab
