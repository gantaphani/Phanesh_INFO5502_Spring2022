background.
in addition to lengthy provisions regarding the financing and purchase of new saab aircraft,the term sheet provided that mesaba would sublease twenty used aircraft from fairbrook for per month,subject to a per month rebate if mesaba met certain conditions such as avoiding default.the term sheet further provided that individual subleases would be signed for each aircraft and that the term of each sublease will be between and months with best efforts to obtain four,one year extensions at the same basic rent.the term sheet contained details about the configuration,delivery,and refurbishment of each aircraft and three conditions precedent,all of which were satisfied.it provided that new york law would govern its construction,validity,and performance.after signing the term sheet,fairbrook acquired from third parties the right to sublease the twenty aircraft for the full term specified in the term sheet and spent up to refurbishing each plane.mesaba reported in its annual and quarterly sec filings that it had entered into an agreement to convert its fleet to saab aircraft.
fairbrook delivered aircraft to mesaba between may and june.the parties executed interim subleases for each and extended the term sheet deadline for the execution of a final sublease agreement.in late,saab announced it would stop manufacturing commercial aircraft.worried about the impact on maintenance and repair costs,mesaba insisted that saab pay for certain maintenance costs on the aircraft that were not included in the maintenance agreement covering the purchased aircraft.mesaba negotiators admitted that mesaba refused to sign subleases on the aircraft in part to gain leverage to obtain this concession.mesaba also wanted to shorten the sublease term on some aircraft to conform to mesaba policy of not keeping aircraft in service longer than seventeen years.negotiations toward a final contract ultimately ceased in december.
mesaba operated the aircraft through,making timely lease payments of per month.three were returned by agreement in december in july,mesaba gave notice that it would return the twenty remaining aircraft by october.in october,mesaba stopped making lease payments on several aircraft.fairbrook then commenced the declaratory judgment action to enforce the term sheet,taking the position that mesaba was bound to the full extended sublease term for each aircraft.
ii.fairbrook 
in the declaratory judgment action,the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.the district court denied mesaba motion and granted partial summary judgment in favor of fairbrook,concluding that,even though the term sheet was a preliminary agreement,it was an enforceable contract because its length,detail,formality,and completeness lend support to the finding that this document defines the parties obligations,and is not a mere invitation for them to continue to negotiate.fairbrook leasing,mesaba aviation,d.alternatively,the court held that the parties to the term sheet bound themselves at a minimum to a framework within which to negotiate open terms in good faith,and mesaba breached this duty by seeking concessions that contradicted the term sheet framework.id.at.the court concluded that fairbrook could enforce the term sheet subleases up to months but denied fairbrook summary judgment on its claim that it was entitled to unilaterally extend the term sheet subleases an additional four years.id.at.
in june,the parties entered into a stipulation reciting that the order of december,is the extent of the declarations sought by fairbrook at this time and dismissing without prejudice fairbrook claims for sublease extensions.accordingly,the stipulation recited,final judgment may be entered on the court december,order to allow mesaba to appeal that order at this time.the court entered an order that the remaining claims were dismissed without prejudice and directed that final judgment be entered.the clerk entered a separate judgment the next day containing no substantive terms.
although fairbrook filed the action seeking a declaratory judgment and referred to declarations in the stipulation that manufactured a final order for appeal,the final order of december,contained no declaratory judgment.azeez fairman,cir.it was in substance an interlocutory order granting partial summary judgment.as the district court decision was based on alternative grounds,the preclusive effect of the summary judgment we affirmed in fairbrook i must be determined by examining our opinion,not the district court order.fairbrook interprets fairbrook i as holding that the term sheet was a type i,fully enforceable contract entitling fairbrook to the benefit of its bargain,namely,damages equal to per month per aircraft for the fully extended subleases.mesaba construes fairbrook i as concluding that the term sheet was a binding commitment only to negotiate the remaining open terms in good faith.to frame this dispute,it is necessary to examine new york contract law before we review the district court decision to adopt mesaba interpretation of fairbrook i.we review the district court grant of summary judgment and its interpretation of state law de novo.at.
iii.the new york law of preliminary agreements.
in general,new york courts will not enforce a mere agreement to agree,in which a material term is left for future negotiations.joseph martin,delicatessen,schumacher.but the intent of the parties is controlling.therefore,a contract is enforceable even though it leaves some elements for future negotiation and agreement if some objective method of determin ing the open terms is available,independent of either party mere wish or desire,scheider.the absence of a contemplated formal agreement is also not dispositive.if the parties do not intend to be bound until a formal agreement is signed,there is no contract until that event occurs.on the other hand where all the substantial terms of a contract have been agreed on,and there is nothing left for future settlement,then an informal agreement can be binding even though the parties contemplate memorializing their contract in a formal document.group,horn hardart,cir quotation omitted.in addition,even if the parties have not agreed on all the essential terms of a final agreement,a new york court may conclude that they entered into an enforceable contractual obligation to cooperate in the negotiation of a final agreement.goodstein constr.city of new york.
