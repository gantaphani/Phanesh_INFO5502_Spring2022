this case arises out of a contract between appellant hudson marine management services,hudson and appellee thomas miller miller in which miller hired hudson to restore a damaged underwater reef.before hudson could complete the restoration,the area experienced a series of hurricanes which expanded the scope of the project.hudson never finished the job,and hudson and miller each filed claims against each other.the district court held that neither party breached their contract,but rather the contract terminated by its own terms when the hurricanes struck.the court declined to award any contractual damages,but awarded hudson damages based on quantum meruit for work it performed after the contract terminated.
hudson appealed the court determination that miller did not breach the contract,as well as the court calculation of damages.miller,also disputing the court calculation of damages.after review and oral argument,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
on march,the vessel eastwind eastwind ran aground on an underwater coral reef in the atlantic ocean just off the fort lauderdale coast.according to florida law when a ship runs aground on a reef in florida waters,the ship owner must arrange for a damage assessment survey,reattach live coral heads in a process known as triage,and repair damage to the site.these tasks are completed with oversight from state and county officials known as trustees.
the eastwind is owned by eastwind special maritime enterprise,which is a member of the united kingdom mutual steam ship assurance association the uk club.the uk club is a mutual insurance association comprised of vessel owners,and miller is its manager miller contracted with hudson,a marine environmental casualty management corporation,to restore the grounding site.specifically,miller and hudson entered into a time and materials contract for a damage assessment survey,reef restoration,and rubble stabilization or removal.hudson was to be compensated on a time and materials basis at the rates specified in hudson rate sheet reimbursed for travel,living and other expenses at cost plus and reimbursed for divers per diem at an agreed rate.
hudson subcontracted with marine biologist jeffrey waxman and sea byte,sea byte to assess the grounding site,confer with the trustees,and restore the reef.sea byte began work in april thereafter miller grew concerned about the high cost of the project under the time and materials contract,and in july the parties began renegotiating.on july,they agreed to modify their previous contract to a lump sum contract for a total price of,which included miller had already paid to hudson.the was intended to cover the entire scope of the project.
the lump sum contract was actually composed of a variety of email statements and telephone conversations.the email exchanges negotiating the lump sum contract in july reflect that the parties agreed miller would make regular installment payments.whereas miller preferred payments linked to progress,hudson initially preferred payments linked to specific dates.it appears that while the parties later agreed that miller payments pursuant to the lump sum contract were to be linked to actual progress milestones,such as the removal of certain amounts of rubble,they never reached an agreement as to which ones.nevertheless,miller made a series of payments to hudson between july,and the end of august totaling 
the lump sum contract also contained a severe weather provision as articulated in a july,email from hudson,hudson representative,which stated effects to reef from severe weather conditions should changes occur due to severe weather,the club,ourselves,and the trustees would then need to readdress the scope of the project.in the same email hudson agreed to miller offer of to complete the reef restoration and rubble removal project within the present,understood and agreed scope of work.
beginning in early september the area experienced a series of hurricanes which further damaged the reef,including hurricane frances on september and hurricane jeanne on september.hudson contended that the hurricanes increased the scope of the,the hurricanes scattered the stacks of rubble that sea byte divers made both underwater and on dry land.hudson requested an additional to complete the project.the parties attempted to negotiate a new price,but were ultimately unable to reach an agreement.hudson did some work after hurricanes,but on october,informed the trustees it was ceasing operations as of october.miller ultimately hired another entity marine resources,or mri to complete the restoration project for.
on october,hudson filed suit in new jersey district court against miller for,and the case was later transferred to the southern district of florida.hudson complaint included four claims.the first three claims were for breach of the time and materials contract,unjust enrichment,and quantum meruit,all seeking the same relief payment of allegedly owed under the time and materials contract.the fourth claim sought a declaratory judgment to determine the amount hudson owed to sea byte if hudson did not recover the full amount of damages from miller.miller counterclaimed and alleged it overpaid hudson for faulty incomplete work,seeking at least in damages.sea byte filed a separate lawsuit against hudson in florida state court for,which was removed to the southern district of florida and consolidated with hudson suit against miller.following a mediation involving hudson,miller,and sea byte,sea byte received from miller and from hudson.thereafter sea byte dismissed its claims against hudson.
trial on hudson and miller claims began on september.on september,the court held that miller breached the lump sum contract by failing to make regular payments to hudson as required,causing hudson to experience a cash shortage and walk off the job on october,however,the court reversed itself after reviewing the parties evidence and submissions,holding that neither party breached the lump sum contract because the hurricanes triggered a provision allowing the contract to expire on its own.see order,at 
the court also found that hudson performed work after the lump sum contract expired,and was thus entitled to recover in quantum meruit for the reasonable value of this work.the court examined the rates sea byte charged and used them as a guide to award hudson for the work it performed between september and october or work.the court also held that miller was entitled to a credit for the it paid to sea byte following mediation.
hudson appealed,disputing the court determination that miller did not breach the lump sum contract hudson also disputes the court calculation of damages for hudson work both before and after the hurricanes,and court award of the credit to miller.miller,arguing that the court erred in calculating the value of work hudson performed prior to september or work.

standard of review 
we review a district court factual findings when sitting without a jury in admiralty under the clearly erroneous standard.we review the district court conclusions of law de novo.venus lines agency,cvg int l,cir.a finding of fact is clearly erroneous when the entirety of the evidence leads the reviewing court to a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.dresdner bank ag olympia voyager,cir.
where a case arises in admiralty,we apply the general maritime law.see,coastal fuels.express shipping,cir.general maritime law is federal law.id.at.however,when neither statutory nor judicially created maritime principles provide an answer to a specific legal question,courts may apply state law provided that the application of state law does not frustrate national interests in having uniformity in admiralty law.id.
termination of the lump sum contract 
as stated above,the severe weather provision of the lump sum contract provided effects to reef from severe weather conditions should changes occur due to severe weather,the club,ourselves,and the trustees would then need to readdress the scope of the project.the district court found that the lump sum contract expired by its own terms because the hurricanes triggered its severe weather provision.specifically,the court held the lump sum contract terminated when the hurricanes increased the work required to restore the reef,hudson requested more money,and the parties were unable to negotiate a new deal.we affirm on this point.
in support of its ruling,the court found that hudson invoked the lump sum contract severe weather provision and requested an additional to complete the project.the court found that hudson effectively stopped its restoration work after the hurricanes struck,and eventually left the job site because the parties could not come to a new agreement.the court examined hudson progress reports and concluded that virtually no work was performed from september to october except when divers inspected the effects of the hurricane on the grounding site.the court further found that on september and between october and october workers the rubble strewn by the hurricanes,but did not perform any actual restoration work.
these findings are not clearly erroneous and are supported by the record.it is plain that under the lump sum contract,miller agreed to pay hudson within the present,understood and agreed scope of work.it is also plain that after the hurricanes struck,hudson requested an additional to complete the project.indeed,according to hudson trial testimony,hudson sought additional money to complete the job after the hurricanes struck because the job was not able to be completed because the job was no longer as it had been.trial tr.at.hudson confirmed that hudson requested in additional funds because hudson believed the job site had been changed by the hurricane and that there needed to be additional monies set aside for the payment of hudson work due to the hurricane.id.
it is also plain that after the hurricanes struck,hudson did stop its restoration work.the parties stipulated that f rom august through,all three of sea byte dive teams were engaged in collecting and stacking rubble,except for some occasions when some of the divers were moving boat anchors and drilling holes for and placing rods to mark reattached coral heads.at.hudson received payment during this time on august for and on august for.after the hurricanes struck in early september,hudson stopped restoration work and miller stopped making payments into hudson escrow account.indeed,the parties stipulated that n o work was done on the grounding site during september except for surveys of the hurricane effects on september,and,and clean up of rubble on september.id.at.from october through october t wo teams of sea byte divers restacked rubble.id.during this time,the parties were attempting to reach a new agreement with a new price.
further,as the court noted,when hudson informed the trustees it was stopping restoration work as of october,it stated this was because of miller failure to pay invoices as well as the parties inability to reach an agreement for payment for the clean up and removal of the rubble created by the grounding which was scattered by hurricane frances see at initial br.at.
based on these facts,we do not believe the court committed clear error in finding that hudson invoked the lump sum contract severe weather provision,that the parties tried to reach a new agreement but were unable to,and that the contract terminated without either party being in breach.hudson argues that the real reason it stopped working was not severe weather but rather the lack of regular payments from miller,as required by the lump sum contract.however,while hudson points to testimony by hudson stating this was the case,hudson has still failed to show that the court findings to the contrary were clearly erroneous such that the entirety of the evidence leads us to a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.dresdner bank,at 
in sum,we affirm the court findings that hudson invoked the lump sum contract severe weather provision when the hurricanes expanded the scope of the project,that the parties were unable to reach a new agreement,and that the contract was thus terminated by its own terms.
hudson work 
having determined that the court properly found the lump sum contract terminated on september,we must now determine whether the court correctly calculated hudson damages for work it performed under the contract up to that date.we review the district court determination of the proper legal standard to compute damages de novo.the court factual findings,however,will only be reversed if clearly erroneous.profiles,city of fort lauderdale,cir citation omitted.
the court held that hudson was entitled to the full amount of payments received between when the lump sum contract came into effect,july,and the start of the hurricanes,september.this amount is.in reaching this conclusion the court focused on the fact that a valid contract existed between those dates.at.since that contract did not include a provision for reassessing the value of past work in the event of termination because of severe weather,the court declined to create one.id.
both parties claim the court used the wrong method to calculate damages for hudson work.hudson claims it should have recovered the total value of the lump sum contract minus what miller later paid to mri to complete the restoration project and minus what miller has already paid to hudson.this leaves.
miller claims,in its,that the court should have evaluated the work hudson actually did on a quantum meruit basis.miller seeks a refund of the portion of the that does not correspond to the reasonable value of hudson work.according to miller,the reasonable value of hudson work between july and september is.this amount is the cost of the work sea byte and waxman actually performed for hudson during that time as reflected in their invoices,plus an.thus,according to miller,it is entitled to minus,or.
we agree with the district court that quantum meruit damages are not available here.in holding it could not award quantum meruit damages,the court cited to several florida federal and state cases see,webster royal caribbean cruises,d,r ecent florida appellate decisions have reinforced the position that quantum meruit damages can not be awarded when an enforceable contract exists.indeed,florida courts do hold that q uantum meruit relief is founded upon the legal fiction of an implied contract.this fiction can not be maintained,however,when the rights of the parties are described in a written contract.corn greco,so d,dca see also cross strader const,so d,dca quantum meruit is the antithesis of matters contracted for.quantum meruit damages can not be awarded when an enforceable contract exists.harding realty,turnberry towers,so d,dca t he law will not imply a contract where a valid express contract exists.solutec young lawrence,so d,dca any proof of an express agreement between the parties as to the compensation to be paid for the services rendered would defeat rather than sustain an action based upon quantum meruit.the parties had enforceable contracts at all times prior to september.the original contract was superceded by the novation entered into on july.this contract expired in a manner clearly contemplated by the terms of the contract and through no fault of either party.we will not use a theory of implied contracts to award damages under these circumstances 
although we agree with the district court rejection of quantum meruit damages,we do not agree with its ultimate approach.the court held it could not reevaluate the in payments miller made to hudson because they were made pursuant to a valid contract.however,this ignores the fact that the parties contract affixed a total value to the restoration project.in our view,there is only one fair and logical way to give effect to that agreement to determine what percentage of the project value hudson provided under the contract as of september,and multiply that percentage by the contract price of.this will tell us whether,considering the miller already remitted,hudson has been overpaid or underpaid.
we were unable to find a case taking this approach under admiralty law or florida law.however,we did find a case from a michigan appellate court that provides some
