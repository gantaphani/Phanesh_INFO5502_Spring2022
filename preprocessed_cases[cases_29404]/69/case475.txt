jessie ben hairston pleaded guilty to multiple charges involving the distribution of drugs and unlawful possession of firearms.there is no real dispute that a rule error occurred during the plea colloquy.see.although the error involved only some of the counts to which hairston pleaded guilty,we conclude that the proper remedy is to vacate hairston guilty pleas and convictions as to all charges and permit him to plead anew.
hairston was indicted on counts of various drugs and firearms count of conspiracy to make a false statement on a firearm transaction form,see west eight counts of distribution of crack cocaine,see west supp fourteen counts of unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,see g west and eight counts of use of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime,see c west supp.hairston and the government entered into a plea agreement under which the government dismissed six of the c charges and hairston pleaded guilty to the remaining charges.the plea agreement contemplated that hairston might provide substantial assistance in other prosecutions and stated that the government retained discretion to determine whether it would seek a sentence reduction based on the assistance provided by hairston.
the plea agreement spelled out the possible sentences on the charges to which hairston would be pleading guilty.as to the g and drug distribution charges,the agreement stated that hairston faced a sentence of zero to ten years.the plea agreement explained that the first c count carried with it a mandatory sentence of five years that must be served consecutively to the other sentences and that the second c count carried with it a mandatory sentence of years that must be served consecutively to all other sentences.hairston thus agreed to plead guilty to charges for which he would receive absent a substantial assistance motion by the government a sentence of at least thirty years.
during the rule proceeding,the district court reviewed the terms of the plea agreement with hairston.the district court recounted the minimum and maximum sentences as set forth in the plea agreement,including zero to ten years for each of the g counts and mandatory consecutive sentences of five and years for the c counts.the district court concluded that there was a factual basis for the charges against hairston and that hairston understood the terms of the plea agreement and was freely and intelligently entering into the agreement.the district court therefore accepted hairston guilty plea.
during the course of the presentence investigation,the probation officer determined that hairston should be sentenced as an armed career criminal under e west supp,a determination that greatly affected the minimum sentence hairston faced.as set forth in the plea agreement and during the rule colloquy,the sentence for a g violation ordinarily is not more than ten years.see a west.section e,however,imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years for a violation of g if the defendant has three previous qualifying convictions see e.hairston designation as an armed career criminal thus meant that instead of the minimum sentence spelled out in the plea agreement and discussed during the rule colloquy,hairston in fact faced a minimum sentence of minimum sentence for the g charges,plus consecutive five and sentences for the c counts.
at the sentencing hearing,the district court adopted the recommendations contained in the presentence report.after the government explained why it was declining to file a substantial assistance motion,the district court,in accordance with the calculations in the presentence report,imposed a sentence of fifteen years on the g charges and imposed sentences of five years and years on the c charges,to run consecutively to the other sentences and to each other,for a total term of years imprisonment.
the total sentence seemed to take the parties by surprise.counsel for hairston noted that the plea agreement stated that the sentence for the g charges was zero to ten years and that the agreement did not mention even the possibility of a mandatory sentence if hairston qualified as an armed career criminal.the government explained that it had repeatedly advised hairston that he faced a minimum sentence of thirty years,but counsel for the government acknowledged that he had simply overlooked the possibility that hairston would qualify as an armed career criminal.hairston himself summarized the problem fairly effectively 
y ou are telling me i waived all of my rights to take years,when my lawyer told me i was waiving all my rights to take years.
now,please tell me what is going on here.tell me i signed for years and that the years that i should get or are you telling me that no one made me aware that i was signing for years that totally against what i signed.and that not right 
your honor,i would not have signed a paper for years.my kids would never see me again.i took the years with the possibility that the government would keep me alive,that i would be able to spend whatever life i had left with my children.
i would never have signed for no years.that not what i was left to understand that i was signing the paper for.
hairston sought to withdraw his plea,explaining to the district court that if he faced a sentence of years,he would have a better chance if he went to trial.see.
after considering the parties arguments and considering the probation officer explanation of the sentence calculations,the district court refused to permit hairston to withdraw his guilty pleas.the court explained that while hairston had hoped that the government would file a substantial assistance motion and that he would receive a sentence as a result of that motion,hairston had never been promised that he would receive a sentence.without the armed career criminal designation,hairston advisory guidelines sentencing range for the and g charges was to months.because the sentence mandated by e was within the otherwise applicable guideline range,the district court believed that any misunderstanding about the minimum sentence for the g charges was not significant.
the federal rules of criminal procedure require a district court,before accepting a guilty plea,to personally inform the defendant of,and ensure that he understands,the nature of the charges against him and the consequences of his guilty plea.united states damon,cir see.b.rule requires the district court to explain to the defendant,among other things,the nature of each charge to which he is pleading guilty,the maximum penalty he faces,as well as any mandatory minimum penalty he faces.b i.on appeal,hairston contends that the district court violated rule by not informing him before accepting his guilty pleas that he faced a mandatory minimum sentence on the g charges.the government does not disagree with hairston and concedes error on this point.
although the government concession of error is not binding on this court,see united states rodriguez,cir,it is apparent that a rule error occurred in this case.as discussed above,the district court during the plea colloquy told hairston that the sentence for the g counts would be between zero and ten years the district court did not mention the possibility of a minimum sentence if hairston qualified as an armed career criminal.rule does not require courts to inform defendants of the applicable guidelines sentencing ranges,see united states good,cir,but it does require district courts to inform defendants of all potentially applicable statutory minimum and maximum sentences.see id.at explaining that rule requires the district court to clearly advise a defendant of the statutory maximum and any mandatory minimum united states cobia,cir per curiam concluding that the district court during a rule colloquy must notify the defendant of e mandatory minimum sentence.and while the district court at the time of the rule proceeding could not have been certain about whether hairston would qualify as an armed career criminal,rule nonetheless required the court to anticipate the possibility and explain to hairston the sentence that would be applicable if he had prior qualifying convictions see uni
