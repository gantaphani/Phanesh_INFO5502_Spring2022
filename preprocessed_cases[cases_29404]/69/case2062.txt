factual and procedural background 
the agreement 
appellant and overseas each have a interest in brighton villas,llc,which owns a apartment building and a apartment building in los angeles.on october,the parties entered into a written agreement for appellant to purchase overseas undivided interest in each of the properties the agreement,in order to dissolve the parties partnership.overseas wanted to structure the transaction as a tax deferred exchange under internal revenue code section and the parties agreed that appellant would receive a credit of in consideration for its cooperation with the exchange.appellant was also required to pay off of the existing loans on the properties,and excluding such costs as escrow fees,title charges and loan fees,appellant was expected to pay approximately million to close the deal.
throughout the transactions,appellant was represented by mark jen and overseas by jack chan.jen and chan are second cousins and both men are licensed real estate agents and sophisticated and experienced real estate investors.they were not on speaking terms after the agreement was signed.
the agreement identified the seller as jack chan on behalf of overseas and the buyer as mark jen on behalf of appellant.it provided that the transactions would be handled through two separate escrows at first american title company of los angeles fatcola,and that the escrows would close on or before january,the agreement also provided new financing to be obtained and all related fees to such loan s to be the buyer responsibility,and time is of the essence.chan and jen both testified that there was no particular significance to the date chosen for the closing they simply estimated it would take approximately days for overseas to locate property for the exchange and for appellant to secure financing.the parties stipulated during trial that the purchase prices were adequate and the agreement was just and reasonable.
the escrows 
over the next month and a half,the parties exchanged five drafts of escrow instructions.finally,on november,mona parvinian,the escrow officer in charge,circulated the final draft of the escrow instructions for each property,which provided in relevant part 
c new loan buyer may have the option to obtain a new first deed of trust loan in favor of lender of buyer choice,proceeds of which shall be used towards purchase price herein.however,this shall not be a contingency.

in her november,cover letters,sent separately to jen and chan and not copied to the other,parvinian requested that each party return certain documents,in addition to the signed escrow instructions.parvinian files indicated that jen signed and returned the escrow instructions on behalf of appellant and provided the other information requested from him on december.
in her letter to chan,parvinian specifically requested that chan complete,sign and return a loan information sheet and a a city report application,and that he furnish copies of overseas articles of incorporation and supporting documents.she also stated,your prompt attention to these items and their return to our office will assist us in the completion of your escrow.jen was not asked to provide any of this information.
jen wrote to chan on december and,and january,asking chan to sign the escrow instructions.in two of the letters,jen reminded chan of the scheduled january,closing date.chan admitted that he received the letters but did not respond to them.jen testified that he enlisted the aid of others to follow up with chan,including parvinian.parvinian spoke to chan in late december and informed him that while the agreement did not contain a deadline for submission of the escrow instructions,she could not move forward with the escrows until he provided the requested information.
chan finally signed the escrow instructions on behalf of overseas on friday,january,one week before the closing date,but he did not deposit them into the escrows until january.chan testified that he did not deposit the signed escrow instructions with fatcola on the day he signed them because he was driving around los angeles trying to locate property for the exchange,and he was told to bring the escrow papers to a meeting with jen the following monday afternoon.
as for other documents overseas was required to provide to escrow,chan did not submit the required rent roll statements until on january.chan admitted that he signed but left blank the form a city report application and the loan information sheet.parvinian assistant returned these blank documents to chan for completion on january.chan never filled in the missing information instead he provided the loan information telephonically on january,which was too late to allow the escrows to close that day.chan also admitted that he never provided overseas articles of incorporation to fatcola.finally,chan claimed to have signed an amendment for the exchange and provided it to the third party accommodator,nb accommodator,nb.but the parties stipulated that nb files did not contain an exchange agreement or amendment signed by chan and no such amendment was ever deposited into the escrows.parvinian testified that the escrows could not have closed without each of the documents requested from chan.furthermore,the receipt of documents on january was too late for closing on that date because all title documents had to be recorded by on the closing date.
the financing 
chan admitted that jen informed him prior to the time the agreement was executed that appellant intended to obtain new loans to finance each of the acquisitions.at trial,jen testified that appellant needed loans to close the transactions because it did not otherwise have liquid funds available for the purchases.on november,appellant submitted loan applications to washington mutual bank wmb or the lender and paid a loan application fee of.wmb was the existing lender on the properties and appellant was seeking to refinance the loans.jen testified that he estimated there would be a shortfall of approximately to between the loan amounts and the amount necessary to close the escrows,but that he had the funds to cover the shortfall 
in december,appellant obtained commitment letters from wmb.as is common,the loans were approved subject to various conditions.on january and,wmb sent letters to jen advising him that certain conditions had not been fulfilled however,cathy van huisen,the bank loan consultant who worked on the deal,testified that jen had fulfilled all conditions to be met by the borrower and that he had done nothing to prevent the loan from funding on january.she testified that the only conditions remaining to fund the loan were escrow obligations testimony by several witnesses revealed that loan documents are generally not prepared by the lender until requested by the escrow holder when escrow is ready to close,and that such documents are usually prepared about five business days prior to the closing date to allow time for any outstanding conditions to be fulfilled.because chan signed escrow instructions were not received by fatcola until january,the loan documents were not ordered from wmb until january.the loan documents were prepared the next day.van huisen testified that the issuance of loan documents means that the lender is prepared to issue the loan.jen testified that he signed the loan documents in parvinian office on january,and that he returned on january to have his signature notarized.
when chan contacted parvinian on january to find out if the escrows were ready to close that day,she advised him that the escrows were not in a position to close and that no funds had arrived.overseas gave written notice of cancellation of the escrows the following day,saturday,january.
statement of decision 
the parties stipulated that appellant would limit its remedy to specific performance and waive all monetary damages,including any apportionment of rent and any damages incidental to a specific performance action.overseas,in turn,waived recovery of interest on the purchase price should specific performance be awarded.
in its statement of decision,the court began by noting the parties respective positions appellant contends that the funding of the purchase price did not occur and the escrows did not close because overseas either failed to provide the necessary information or documentation or provided them too late to close on january.overseas,on the other hand,contends that in this time is of the essence transaction,appellant failure to perform or to tender performance,that was not prevented by overseas,bars the remedy of specific performance.
relying on the case of pittman canham th,d,the court concluded that the parties obligations constituted concurrent conditions.the court found that the conduct of overseas of which appellant complains relates to overseas not fulfilling escrow requirements,not with prevention of appellant required performance regarding funding of the transaction.overseas articles of incorporation,amendment for substitution,a report,rent roll statements,loan information sheet overseas failure to comply with escrow demands,did not,in and of itself,prevent appellant from tendering either cash or loan funds into escrow.in response to appellant argument that overseas prevented the escrow holder from providing the lender with information required to fund the transactions,the court found there was nothing to prevent appellant from providing existing lender information to escrow for the purpose of escrow preparing timely payoff demands,since both parties jointly owned brighton villas,the borrower and owner of the properties.although approval of the rent roll statements by appellant was a condition of closing the escrow,in order to allow a proration of rents at the closing of escrow,it was not a condition of any loan funding.for purposes of an estimated closing statement,escrow could use the rent roll provided by appellant,as appellant was a joint owner of brighton villas,the then owner of the properties.
thus,the court concluded that appellant has not established that it performed its obligations by fully tendering the amounts due in escrow by the deadline date,or that it was excused or prevented from doing so by defendant.nor has appellant established waiver or estoppel.judgment was entered on april.this appeal followed.
discussion 
substantial evidence does not support the trial court factual findings.
to obtain specific performance,appellant must establish its own performance or excuse for nonperformance.see erich granoff d.stratton tejani d.a plaintiff must also show that it was ready,willing and able to perform both at the time the original contract was entered into and during the specific performance action.robert nattress associates cidco d.
appellant contends that it was ready,willing and able to perform but that it was prevented from tendering the purchase price due to overseas failure to comply with its escrow obligations.the trial court found that overseas did not prevent appellant performance.
we review the trial court factual findings for substantial evidence.where findings of fact are challenged on a civil appeal,we are bound by the principal that the power of an appellate court begins and ends with a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,to support the findings below.bickel city of piedmont cal th,d.we must therefore view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,giving it the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolving all conflicts in its favor.ibid.here,the trial court finding that overseas did not prevent appellant performance is not supported by substantial evidence.
overseas performance 
under the terms of the agreement and the escrow instructions,overseas was required to submit certain documents to escrow.these documents included the los angeles city report of property records and pending special assessment liens,the rent roll statements,an amendment for the exchange,overseas articles of incorporation,and loan information.it was undisputed that overseas never submitted a completed city report or the amendment.furthermore,overseas submitted the rent roll statements and loan information on the scheduled closing date,which made it impossible for a closing to occur on that day.the trial court correctly found that overseas failed to comply with its escrow obligations.
but the trial court nevertheless found that overseas failure to comply did not prevent appellant from meeting its own obligations to tender either loan funds or cash into the escrows.this finding is contrary to the undisputed evidence in the record.
appellant expert witness,collyer church,who had more than years of experience with escrows and title companies,testified that an escrow is an evolutionary process which is dependent on the orderly receipt of information,and that an escrow holder will not ask a lender to prepare loan documents until the escrow is ready to close.employees of wmb and mona parvinian,the escrow officer in charge,testified to the same.
as the trial court noted,in order for the escrows to close,the escrow officer would have to prepare estimated closing statements from which can be determined the amount to be deposited by the buyer.
although the escrow holder requested a completed loan information sheet and rent roll statements from overseas in order to prepare the estimated closing statements,this information was not provided by overseas.the trial court found that because appellant and overseas were joint owners of brighton villas,llc,appellant could have submitted the documents to escrow.but this was not what the parties had agreed or what the agreement or the escrow instructions provided.we agree with appellant that the trial court ruling amounted to an improper rewriting of the parties contract.
in the agreement,the parties stated that for purposes of the transaction jack chan would be the seller on behalf of overseas.indeed,chan signed the escrow instructions on behalf of overseas as the seller.the escrow instructions specifically provided that seller shall furnish in escrow,for approval by buyer,a current rent statement while appellant may have had equal access to the required information,the escrow instructions explicitly required overseas to provide this information.furthermore,parvinian never asked appellant to provide this information.of greater significance in the context of an escrow,as both parvinian and church testified,because rents are prorated and deposits and repayments credited to the buyer and charged to the seller,this information must come from the seller and then be approved by the buyer in order for the escrow holder to avoid liability for having relied on erroneous information from the buyer.
overseas attempts to downplay the significance of the documents it was required to deposit into escrow.but the uncontradicted evidence at trial revealed the necessity for each of the documents in order to close the escrows.the rent roll statements and loan information were needed by the escrow holder to prepare the estimated closing statements,which advised the buyer of the exact amount necessary to deposit to close the escrows.wmb regional operations manager testified that estimated closing statements were required before the loans could fund.in addition,because the transaction had been structured as a tax deferred exchange,in which a third party accommodator was to accept the funds on behalf of the seller,an amendment for the exchange was necessary to identify the accommodator.
with respect to the city report,overseas argues,without citation to any authority,that the report was not required because the transaction was an as is sale.but parvinian testified that the report is required any time a transfer takes place in the city of los angeles.finally,anthony rivera,a title officer for fatcola,testified that overseas articles of incorporation were necessary to ensure that overseas was a valid company.the evidence was undisputed that the escrows could not close without each of these documents,and that anything that prevented the close of the escrows would constitute an impediment to funding the loans.
appellant performance.
overseas contends that appellant did not meet its own obligations because it failed to fulfill certain loan conditions by january.van huisen,the loan officer in charge of the transaction,testified that there were certain conditions that had to be fulfilled prior to funding,as was the case in almost all loan approvals.but she also testified that as of the scheduled january closing date,appellant had fulfilled all of its loan conditions and had done nothing to prevent funding by that date,and that the only outstanding conditions were escrow obligations.according to van huisen,the loans could have funded on january,if the escrows had been ready to close.
overseas argues that the loans could not have funded by january because appellant did not sign the loan documents by the closing date.in this regard,jen testified that he went to the escrow office on january to sign the loan documents,but that parvinian was busy and unable to meet with him.jen testified that he signed the documents in a conference room and returned the following week to have his signature notarized.the deed was notarized on january and the trial court found that appellant did not sign the loan documents until january,one week beyond the scheduled closing date.we find the actual signing date to be irrelevant.the evidence established without dispute that because overseas did not deposit its signed escrow instructions into escrow until january,loan documents were not ordered from the lender until january and could not be prepared until january.at that point,because overseas had failed to deposit the documents it was required to deposit in a timely fashion,it was impossible for the escrows to close by january.this impossibility was occasioned by the acts of overseas and not appellant.the failure by appellant to submit notarized loan documents on january had no causal effect on the inability of the escrows to close prior to chan submission of overseas notice of termination.furthermore,there was no evidence that jen was requested to sign completed loan documents before the notice of termination.
failure to fund by the lender by january.
overseas argues that appellant never made any demand on the lender to fund the loans by january.but the evidence is clear that all parties involved,including the lender,were well aware of the closing date.furthermore,appellant had no obligation to make such a demand,and it is clear that any demand would have been futile.the evidence was uncontroverted that the loans could not fund and the escrows could not close by january due to overseas failure to comply with its escrow obligations.indeed,jen three letters to chan urging him to sign the escrow instructions so that the escrows could close by january went unheeded 
parvinian testified that in her years of escrow experience,percent of all escrows closed after the scheduled closing dates,and that if chan had not cancelled the escrows on january,she would have continued trying to close them.church testified that if chan had completed his escrow obligations and there were no other outstanding issues,the escrows would have closed and the loans funded the week following january.the loan documents generated by the lender on january specified an estimated closing date of january.
failure to pay cash by january.
the trial court found that despite overseas breaches of its own obligations,appellant was not prevented from tendering payment in the form of cash but there was no requirement that appellant tender cash.although the escrow instructions provided that appellant option to obtain a loan was not a contingency,the parties agreement and the escrow instructions expressly gave appellant the option of securing financing,and it was undisputed that appellant was in the process of doing so.
evidence at trial suggested that the jen family had significant real estate holdings worldwide and was quite wealthy.the trial court concluded that appellant could have simply tendered cash to close the deal.even assuming this to be true,it is irrelevant.it defies logic to expect a buyer to tender million in cash into an escrow when that buyer had the express option of obtaining a loan,had spent over in loan application fees,and had already obtained loan approvals and commitment letters from the lender.indeed,church testified that in his years of experience in the escrow business he had never seen that happen.to require such a tender would not accord with commercial reality.see,fogarty saathoff d.to hold that the obligation of the seller to furnish a termite report and clearance before the buyer had solidified the deal by eliminating the contingency would not accord with commercial reality.
we also note that the escrow instructions provided that buyer deposit of balance of funds shall constitute their acknowledgment that all terms,conditions and contingencies have been met.in light of the fact that overseas had not satisfied all of its escrow obligations by the intended closing date,it would not be reasonable to require appellant to deposit the balance of funds into escrow,thereby acknowledging satisfaction that all terms and conditions had been met.
time is of the essence and good faith and fair dealing 
overseas relies on the time is of the essence provisions in the parties agreement and escrow instructions to support its position that it was entitled to cancel the escrows.we note that this particular provision in the escrow instructions,which is set forth ante,is part of a preprinted standard escrow form 
overseas argues that because appellant failed to timely perform its obligations under the agreement and escrow instructions,appellant rights thereunder expired by their own terms and overseas therefore had the right to cancel the escrows.but as we have concluded,appellant was prepared to timely perform and was prevented from doing so by overseas actions.if the cooperation of the other party is necessary for successful performance of an obligation,a promise to give that cooperation,and not to do anything which prevents realization of the fruits of performance,will often be implied.this is sometimes referred to as an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts.
overseas points out that the covenant of good faith can not be used to prohibit a party from doing that which is expressly permitted by agreement.carma developers cal,marathon development california,cal th,d,third story music,waits th,d,witkin,summary of cal.law ed.supp.contracts.according to overseas,appellant is attempting to use the covenant to import the condition of obtaining financing into the parties transaction.but appellant has never taken the position that its ability to obtain financing was a contingency of the deal.the agreement and escrow instructions expressly provided that obtaining financing was an option for appellant.
based on the parties implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that neither party would frustrate the other party right to receive the benefits of the contract,overseas was not entitled to unilaterally cancel the escrows when it did.
ii.pittman canham has no application here.
in denying specific performance to appellant,the trial court relied on pittman canham,supra,th,d.in that case the court held that the failure of both parties to a contract to perform concurrent conditions at the time for performance resulted in a discharge of both parties duties to perform.id.at,d.appellant,in urging us not to follow pittman,argues that the case is an aberration in the law,that it represents a flight from commercial reality,and that it ignores years of case law appellant points out that while pittman has been cited in secondary sources no published case has cited it since it was decided in.overseas responds that because pittman was not the sole ground for the trial court decision,we need not consider it.
we find pittman to be factually distinguishable from the case at hand and therefore conclude it has no application here.
pittman,a licensed real estate broker,offered to purchase a parcel of property in san luis obispo from lily canham.after repeated telephone calls to her from may to november,canham finally agreed to sell the property to pittman for.pittman canham,supra,th at,d.pittman drafted the contract dated november,and deposited into escrow.the contract provided for a escrow and deposit of an additional,with the balance to be paid by a note secured by a deed of trust on the property.both the contract and the escrow instructions provided that time was of the essence,and the contract required that any modifications or extensions be in writing.in the second week of december,canham gave a signed copy of the escrow instructions to pittman for delivery to escrow,and included a deed to the property which was signed but not notarized.when pittman contacted canham,she told him she would have the deed notarized at an escrow company near her home.the december closing date came and went,and canham had not tendered a notarized deed,nor had pittman tendered,a promissory note,or a deed of trust.ibid.five months later,in may,canham told pittman that she had entered into a contract with other purchasers to buy the property for.pittman wrote a letter demanding that she perform on his contract,but she sold the property to the other buyers.id.at,d.pittman then sued canham for breach of contract.the trial court grant of nonsuit was affirmed on appeal.
the court in pittman recognized that concurrent conditions are conditions precedent which are mutually dependent,and noted that the only important difference between a concurrent condition and a condition precedent is that a condition precedent must be performed before another duty arises,while a tender of performance is sufficient in the case of a concurrent condition.pittman canham,supra,th at,d.but it held that the failure of both parties to perform concurrent conditions does not leave the contract open for an indefinite period so that either party can tender performance at his leisure.the failure of both parties to perform concurrent conditions during the time for performance results in a discharge of both parties duty to perform.thus,where the parties have made time the essence of the contract,at the expiration of time without tender by either party,both parties are discharged neither party can hold the other in default and no cause of action to enforce the contract arises.see pitt mallalieu d.pittman canham,supra,th at,d.
rather than being an aberration in the law as appellant argues,we conclude that pittman is an aberration in the facts.in pittman,the real estate prepared the contract,including a time is of the essence clause,and agreed to deposit the down payment,a deed of trust and a note within days.he did not do so,and the seller treated the transaction as having been terminated without a sale.buyer did nothing until five months later when the seller told him she had agreed to sell the property to someone else.pittman canham,supra,th,d.the court noted that there had been no impediment to the buyer tender of performance.id.at,d.in fact,all that was left for the parties to do was to exchange purchase money and a note for the deed within days.
even if we assume that time was of the essence to the parties in the case before us,we can not conclude that the mutual obligations of the parties could be unilaterally extinguished because escrow was not able to close on january.this was not a situation in which the simple exchange of deed for consideration was involved.rather,the escrows here required performance of a number of steps,some necessarily in a particular sequence,to permit the escrows to be in a position for the simultaneous final concurrent exchange of deed for consideration.as such,the facts here can be easily distinguished from those in pittman.the evidence established without dispute that appellant had fulfilled its escrow and loan obligations and that the inability to fund was not due to anything appellant had failed to do.indeed,the loans could not be funded nor could the escrows close on the scheduled closing date because overseas failed to comply with its escrow obligations.
this case is more closely analogous to rubin fuchs cal d,a case which the pittman court distinguished.pittman canham,supra,th,d.in rubin,a buyer of real property agreed to deposit cash and a purchase money deed of trust before the close of escrow,and the sellers agreed to subdivide the property and record a tract map before the closing date.neither of the parties performed in accordance with these provisions.the court noted the rule that provisions of a contract will not be construed as conditions precedent in the absence of language plainly requiring such construction.rubin fuchs,supra,cal d at.however,the court found that because recordation of the tract map would supply the legal description for the deed of trust,the buyer promise to execute the deed of trust was necessarily dependent upon the sellers prior recordation of the tract map and therefore constituted a condition precedent.id.at.until the tract map was recorded,the parties were not in a position to deposit into escrow the instruments necessary to close the escrow.the court noted,however,that even if the parties promises were deemed to be concurrent,it would not be reasonable to require the buyer to rely upon the sellers mere assertions of ability to perform before depositing the purchase price.id.at.it follows that the sellers were not entitled to unilaterally rescind the contrac
