this appeal presents the question of whether a provision of the federal health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa,stat,preempts montana little hipaa law,ann.a,for purposes of both conferring federal subject matter jurisdiction and defeating causes of action on the merits.the federal and state hipaa provisions at issue prohibit certain health insurers from charging different premiums to similarly situated participants on account of a participant health factor.b ann.a.we affirm the district court and hold that federal hipaa preempts the montana law,both jurisdictionally and on the merits,because montana hipaa provision is identical to,and expressly relies upon,federal law.however,federal law does not preempt a claim for relief under a separate montana unfair insurance practices statute that bars insurers from engaging in unfair discrimination when charging policy premiums to similarly situated individuals.ann.
background 
plaintiffs appellants collectively,fossens are three brothers,dale,larry,and marlowe fossen,their three corporations which they jointly own with their spouses,and fossen brothers farms a partnership of the three corporations.in,fossen brothers farms applied to blue cross and blue shield of montana blue cross to obtain health insurance coverage for the fossen brothers farms three employees.from through may,blue cross provided coverage to fossen brothers farms through the associated merchandisers,health first plan associated merchandisers plan,and from june through the time this lawsuit was filed,blue cross provided coverage through the montana chamber choices group benefit plan chamber choices plan.
in,blue cross informed the fossens that their premium was increasing by over.the fossens learned that blue cross was imposing different increases and even decreases in some cases on other plan members.after the fossens complained to the montana insurance commissioner,blue cross reduced the proposed increase to.for the plan year,however,blue cross increased the fossens premiums over.the fossens complained again to the insurance commissioner,but apparently to no avail.they then filed this lawsuit in state court in september.
the fossens complaint asserted three substantive causes of action.first,they alleged that blue cross premium increase violated a provision of montana little hipaa statute that prohibits group health plan s and insurers offering coverage through group health plans from imposing a premium or contribution that is greater than the premium or contribution for a similarly situated individual on account of any health factor of the individual ann.a.second,the fossens asserted that blue cross premium increase violated a provision of montana unfair trade practices act,ann.et,which prohibits insurers from engaging in any unfair discrimination between individuals of the same class and of essentially the same hazard in the amount of premium,policy fees,or rates charged for any policy or contract of disability insurance,ann.see also ann.defining disability insurance as including insurance against medical expenses resulting from accident or sickness.third,the fossens claimed that the premium increase constituted a breach of their contract with blue cross,which allegedly incorporated by reference both the montana hipaa provision and the unfair practices provision the complaint sought two forms of relief declaratory relief that blue cross violated the law and restitutionary relief through a return of overcharged premiums and sought certification as a class action.
blue cross timely removed the complaint to federal court,asserting that the fossens little hipaa claim was completely preempted by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,stat.federal hipaa,which is part of erisa as amended,contains a provision similar to the montana hipaa statute raised in the complaint.as with the montana hipaa statute,federal hipaa prohibits group health plan s and insurers offering coverage through group health plans from charging different premium s or contribution s to similarly situated individual s on account of any health factor in relation to the individual s b blue cross argued that erisa complete preemption doctrine,as articulated in metropolitan life insurance taylor,and subsequent cases,conferred federal jurisdiction over the fossens nominal claims.the district court agreed with blue cross,and denied the fossens motion to remand.the court then granted blue cross motion for summary judgment.the court noted that all of the fossens claims were premised on an underlying violation of federal hipaa,and,finding no violation of that statute,the court held that the fossens claims failed as a matter of law.the court also declined to allow the fossens to amend their complaint to state a breach of contract theory first argued in the fossens summary judgment briefs premised on blue cross alleged promise not to increase their premiums by a greater amount than any other members of the associated merchandisers plan.the fossens timely appealed the district court decision.

discussion 
erisa preemption 
there are two strands of erisa preemption express preemption under erisa a,a and preemption due to a conflict with erisa exclusive remedial scheme set forth in erisa a,a.paulsen cnf,cir citing cleghorn blue shield of,cir,cert.denied.hipaa contains an additional express preemption provision relevant here erisa a,a,which is described in greater detail below.
all of these preemption provisions defeat causes of action on the merits.see,pilot life ins.dedeaux,a preemption cleghorn,at a preemption.conflict preemption under erisa a,however,also confers federal subject matter jurisdiction for claims that nominally arise under state law.see,marin,at.ordinarily,federal question jurisdiction does not lie where a defendant contends that a claim is preempted by federal law.aetna health davila,marin,at.but claims may be removed to federal court if the complete preemption doctrine applies.marin,at see also davila,at.relevant to this case,erisa a set s forth a comprehensive civil enforcement scheme that completely preempts causes of action within the scope of th es e civil enforcement provisions davila,at quoting metro.life,at pilot life,at see also marin,at 
following davila,we have distilled a test for determining whether a claim is completely preempted by erisa a a cause of action is completely preempted if an individual,at some point in time,could have brought the claim under erisa a b,and where there is no other independent legal duty that is implicated by a defendant actions.marin,at alteration omitted quoting davila,at.because this test is in the conjunctive,a cause of action is preempted by a b only if both prongs of the test are satisfied.id.at see also montefiore med.ctr.teamsters local,cir noting that davila test is conjunctive.both davila and marin general hospital discussed complete preemption by reference to a b but not the other subparts of a.the complete preemption doctrine applies to the other subparts of a as well.see metro.life,at congress has clearly manifested an intent to make causes of action within the scope of the civil enforcement provisions of a removable to federal court.sorosky burroughs,cir holding that complete preemption is applicable to the section a claims alleged in this case.
express preemption under erisa is also governed in relevant part by a test.under a,erisa broadly preempts any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any covered employee benefit plan a.but this broad preemption provision is tempered by a savings clause in b,which spares any law of any state which regulates insurance,banking,or securities.id.b a.to fall under the savings clause,a regulation must satisfy a test laid out in kentucky ass of health plans,miller.standard ins.morrison,cir,cert.denied.first,the state law must be specifically directed toward entities engaged in insurance.id.quoting.ass of health plans,at.second,it must substantially affect the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and the insured.id.quoting.ass of health plans,at.
in addition to these generally applicable preemption provisions,erisa also contains a preemption clause.under that clause,federal hipaa does not supersede any provision of state law which establishes,implements,or continues in effect any standard or requirement solely relating to health insurance issuers in connection with group health insurance coverage except to the extent that such standard or requirement prevents the application of a requirement of federal hipaa.a.the provision plain terms appear to permit state laws that are,generally speaking,more favorable to the insured.plumb fluid pump,cir dictum accord,at.noting that hipaa drafters intend the narrowest preemption,and to allow s tate laws which are broader than federal requirements 
ii.federal subject matter jurisdiction 
we apply the davila test to determine whether erisa a completely preempts the fossens claims and confers federal jurisdiction.see marin,at.we initially focus our attention on the fossens state hipaa cause of action.
first prong of davila 
under davila,the first question is whether the fossens could have brought their complaint under a.we agree with blue cross that the fossens could have done so.they are suing for restitution of premiums they allegedly overpaid in violation of montana hipaa statute.as the district court correctly recognized,the fossens claim under montana hipaa could also have been brought under federal hipaa,because the relevant state and federal hipaa provisions are identical.both statutes apply to group health plan s and insurance companies offering health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan.b ann.a.both statutes bar such entities from requiring individuals to pay insurance premium s or contribution s that are greater than other plan participants premiums on account of any health factor.b ann.a.thus,the fossens suit for return of premiums could have been brought under erisa as well as state law.see a a,b ii allowing erisa plan participants to sue to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of erisa,and to obtain other appropriate equitable relief to enforce any provisions of erisa werdehausen benicorp ins,cir holding that violations of may be remedied through erisa a see also great west life annuity ins.knudson,holding that erisa permits suits for equitable restitution to restore to the plaintiff particular funds or property in the defendant possession.
the fossens raise two related objections to this line of reasoning first,they contend that their claims fall outside the scope of erisa because they are suing with respect to blue cross multiple employer welfare arrangement mewa level contracts which are not necessarily governed by erisa and second,they argue that the montana hipaa provision is not identical to the federal provision because the language of the montana statute could be construed differently from the language of the federal statute.we disagree with both arguments.
we need not delve too deeply into the fossens distinction between plans and erisa plans,as it is clear that at least part of this lawsuit involves an erisa plan and falls within the scope of a.an erisa plan exists because the individual fossens employer,fossen brothers farms,pays its employees insurance premiums and acts as the administrator of the insurance plan.those facts are identical to the facts we relied upon in crull gem insurance,cir,to conclude that an employer conduct creates an erisa plan.see also credit managers ass of cal.kennesaw life accident ins,cir noting that a n employer can establish an erisa plan rather easily unless it is a mere advertiser who makes no contributions on behalf of its employees.because at least some of the contracts at issue in this action are erisa plans this lawsuit falls within the scope of erisa a.the individual fossens are the participants in the erisa plan,and they are suing blue cross the plan insurance company to enforce rights that are provided by erisa.see b.that is enough to bring a suit within the scope of erisa a.see cyr reliance standard life ins,cir en banc permitting a b suit for benefits against plan insurer.
in their second argument against complete preemption,the fossens suggest that montana hipaa use of the term group health plan could be construed differently from federal hipaa use of that term,and that blue cross mewa plans should be deemed group health plans under state law but not federal law.but neither the fossens nor the amici have offered a plausible explanation for how montana hipaa use of group health plan can be interpreted differently from erisa use of that term.indeed,both montana law and federal law contain identical definitions of group health plan.federal hipaa defines group health plan as an employee welfare benefit plan that provides medical care payments to employees.a.the definition of employee welfare benefit plan appears at.montana hipaa is identical it defines group health plan as an employee welfare benefit plan,as defined in,that provides medical care payments to employees.ann.emphasis added.we are unaware of any canon of statutory construction that allows us to ignore the montana legislature explicit incorporation of erisa definition of an operative term.state tower,when montana legislature adopts a statute from a sister state,montana courts follow the general rule of also adopting the construction which has been placed upon that statute by the highest court of the sister state.
in sum,because the fossens could have brought their claim under erisa a,the first prong of davila has been satisfied.marin,at quoting davila,at.
second prong of davila 
to apply the second part of davila a conflict preemption test,we must determine whether the claims arise independently of erisa or the plan terms.davila,at.in other words we must ask whether or not an independent legal duty is implicated by the defendant actions.id.at.
this question requires a practical,rather than a formalistic,analysis because c laimants simply can not obtain relief by dressing up an erisa benefits claim in the garb of a state law tort.cleghorn,at quoting dishman unum life ins.of,cir.as the davila court warned,distinguishing between and claims based on the particular label affixed to them would elevate form over substance and allow parties to evade the scope of erisa simply by relabeling their claims.davila,at internal quotation marks omitted.
consistent with this practical approach,the supreme court has held that a preempts various state laws that,at first glance,appear to be independent of erisa.for example,in ingersoll rand mcclendon,the court addressed a wrongful discharge claim arising out of a termination motivated by an employer desire to prevent a pension from vesting.the court held that this claim was conflict preempted because,although the claim was nominally premised on a tort duty that was separate from erisa,the claim was identical to a right expressly guaranteed by erisa and exclusively enforced by a.id.at.similarly,in davila,the court addressed a state law that imposed a duty on insurers to use ordinary care when making medical treatment decisions.at.the court rejected the court of appeals reasoning that the plaintiff request ed tort damages arising from an external,statutorily imposed duty of ordinary care.id.at quoting roark humana,cir.instead,the court refused to elevate form over substance,and held the cause of action merely duplicated rights and remedies available under erisa,and therefore was preempted.id.at see also cleghorn,at holding that statutory claim was completely preempted under davila because the factual basis of the complaint was the denial of reimbursement of plan bene
