earl thompson,thompson appeals the judgment,pursuant to.b,of the united states district court for the northern district of oklahoma holding,on the counterclaims of defendants henry haynes,fluid controls,and mighty clean corporation collectively fluid controls,that thompson sale of his swivel devices constituted a willful violation of the lanham act,the oklahoma deceptive trade practices act,and the common law pertaining to unfair competition awarding defendants a total of,representing fluid controls lost profits on swivel sales,thompson profits on allegedly counterfeit swivels,and damages for an advertising campaign,all trebled and set off against unpaid royalties owed to thompson by fluid controls and enjoining further unfair competition by thompson.thompson haynes,m,judgment.because the district court did not err in awarding thompson profits to fluid controls or in holding that no correction of the inventorship of the united states patent,patent was merited,and because the district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing an injunction or clearly err in finding thompson actions to be willful,we affirm in part.however,because the district court award of damages based on lost sales was based on speculation,because an award of advertising damages was not merited,and because the district court improperly trebled the award of thompson profits,we vacate those portions of the award of damages and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
in november of,thompson approached fluid controls with a fluid conducting swivel concept.in january of,thompson and fluid controls entered into an agreement to develop the concept and file a patent application.in the agreement,fluid controls president,henry haynes haynes,and thompson were described as the joint patent applicants.the agreement provided that the patent,if issued,would be assigned to fluid controls.the agreement also provided for a royalty to be paid to each of the patent owners,a phrase that apparently refers to thompson and haynes.the patent,which listed thompson and haynes as,issued on february,and was assigned to fluid controls.
for a time,thompson served as a distributor of the patented swivels,which were manufactured by fluid controls.these swivels were sold under the designation whirl jet.after disputes as to the discount at which thompson was entitled to purchase the fluid controls swivels and as to attorney fees,fluid controls ceased making royalty payments to thompson.thompson then began to produce his own swivels,at least some of which he began to sell in may of to customers to which he had previously sold fluid controls swivels.thompson filed a separate patent application on an allegedly different swivel device this application matured to patent,issued on july.
in june,one of thompson customers,simpson cleaning systems,simpson,experienced installation problems with swivels manufactured by thompson.steve pauley,the simpson engineer overseeing the installation process,contacted fluid controls for assistance in solving the problem.when fluid controls officials inspected the swivels,they discovered that the swivels were manufactured by thompson.fluid controls sent a letter to pauley informing him that the swivels infringed the patent and suggesting that simpson cancel any orders with thompson and resubmit them directly to fluid controls.thereafter,simpson ceased doing business with thompson and began purchasing directly from fluid controls.
fluid controls then warned its other customers about what it believed to be the unlicensed manufacture and sale of swivels that infringed the patent.one such customer was steel eagle.fluid controls alleges that thompson sold substitute swivels to steel eagle,although thompson disputes this.fluid controls officials believed that steel eagle unsatisfactory experiences with the thompson swivels caused steel eagle to rule out the use of fluid controls swivels in cleaning devices.
thompson sued fluid controls in the northern district for oklahoma for declaratory judgment of of the patent recovery of unpaid royalties under the agreement with fluid controls an injunction against interference with business relations damages for unfair business practices correction of inventorship of the patent to remove haynes as a rescission of the agreement to assign the patent to fluid controls and infringement of the patent,on the theory that thompson was the sole owner of all rights in the patent.fluid controls counterclaimed for infringement of the patent correction of inventorship of the patent to remove thompson as a unjust enrichment violations of the lanham act and oklahoma unfair competition law and declaratory judgment of invalidity of thompson patent.
a bench trial was held in january of.on may,the court issued partial findings of fact and conclusions of law.the court,on thompson claims,held as a matter of law that no correction of inventorship of the patent was required and found that thompson was entitled to an accounting for certain unpaid royalties.on fluid controls counterclaims,the court found that thompson had supplied his swivels to simpson instead of the fluid controls swivels without informing simpson of the substitution and concluded that thompson had willfully violated the lanham act,the oklahoma deceptive trade practices act.stat.tit,dtpa,and the common law relating to unfair competition.the court also found that thompson actions resulted in lost sales of at least fluid controls swivels per month to steel eagle.thompson haynes.may,thompson.the court did not address the remaining claims and counterclaims.the court concluded that fluid controls was entitled to injunctive relief,as well as damages,costs,and attorney fees.the court then referred the matter to a magistrate judge,acting as a special master,to complete the accounting.
based on facts obtained after the trial that thompson had not disclosed sales of his swivels to two customers,hydro tek and elite manufacturing,fluid controls moved for discovery sanctions against thompson.the court referred fluid controls motion for discovery sanctions to the same magistrate judge.
the special master issued a report on the accounting ten months later.thompson haynes,m,special master report.the special master found that thompson should be awarded for unpaid royalties,and that fluid controls should be awarded in lost sales damages,for thompson profits on swivel sales,and in damages for an advertising campaign.based on the district court finding of willfulness,the special master recommended that the damages owing to fluid controls be trebled and that fluid controls be awarded attorney fees,limited to the fees incurred for the lanham act and dtpa claims on which it prevailed at trial.the master deferred making a recommendation on attorney fees pending segregation of the fees by claim.
on the sanctions motion,the magistrate judge found that thompson had failed to meet his discovery obligations and recommended that thompson be precluded from contesting in any way that his sales of swivels to hydro tek and elite manufacturing violated the lanham act and the dtpa.thompson haynes,m,sanctions report.
the district court adopted both reports.thompson haynes,adopting order.in april of,the court issued judgment pursuant to rule b.as recommended by the special master,the court awarded fluid controls damages for lost sales and for conducting an advertising campaign,as well as thompson profits,all of which were trebled and offset against the unpaid royalties for a final award to fluid controls of.judgment at.the court did not award attorney fees.in addition,the court entered a permanent injunction against further unfair competition by thompson.id.at.
thompson challenges the district court determination that his conduct constituted willful unfair competition.he further challenges the award of damages,the entry of a permanent injunction,and the district court determination on inventorship.we have jurisdiction under a.

section a of the lanham act,a,creates a federal remedy for false representations or false designations of origin used in connection with the sale of a product.the statute provides civil liability for 
any person who,on or in connection with any goods or services,or any container for goods,uses in commerce any word,term,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof,or any false designation of origin,false or misleading description of fact,or false or misleading representation of fact,which 
a is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive as to the affiliation,connection,or association of such person with another person,or as to the origin,sponsorship,or approval of his or her goods,services,or commercial activities by another person 
the district court found that thompson substituted a device he named the swivel as product in response to orders he received from customers for the patented swivel,and that the customer that bought thompson substituted swivels testified that he had no knowledge of the substitution and thought the substitute swivels were defendants swivels.thompson at.the district court determined that this evidence of actual confusion established a likelihood of confusion,which provided the basis for the district court holding that thompson sales of substitute swivels constituted a false designation of origin,a false or misleading description of fact,and a false or misleading misrepresentation of fact in violation of section of the lanham act,a.id.
thompson argues that the district court determination was based on clearly erroneous.specifically,thompson asserts that he informed jim schiavi,simpson purchasing agent,that he was substituting his own swivels for the fluid controls swivels he had been supplying.thompson directs our attention to records establishing that schiavi cancelled one order,which was allegedly for fluid controls swivels,and substituted another order that thompson asserts was for swivels of his own manufacture.thompson asserts that schiavi did this after thompson informed him that he wished to switch the swivels supplied.thompson further relies on his own testimony that he made no misrepresentations to simpson regarding the source of the swivels and the testimony of pauley,simpson research engineer,that thompson had made no such misrepresentations to him.thompson argues that he never employed the term whirl jet,which schiavi used in his purchase order,for any of his own swivels.thompson also asserts that any evidence of confusion arising from the simpson transaction should not be used to infer confusion in other sales of thompson swivels,because the simpson transaction was unique.
fluid controls responds that none of the underlying factual findings were clearly erroneous and asserts that the evidence of actual confusion in the simpson transaction is the best evidence of confusion in the marketplace,citing jordache enterprises,hogg wyld,cir.fluid controls asserts that the similar sw d designation thompson used,schiavi note on the substituted purchase order specifying whirl jet swivels,and pauley contact with fluid controls after experiencing installation problems with thompson swivels,show that the district court did not clearly err in finding actual confusion.
the factual findings of the district court underlying its finding of likelihood of confusion are not clearly erroneous.the evidence of record establishes that in april of,more than one month before thompson asserts that he first began supplying his swivels to simpson,thompson sold fluid swivels to simpson under the designation.furthermore,pauley testified that after experiencing problems with the thompson swivels,he contacted not thompson but fluid controls for help,asking why fluid controls had changed the design of the swivel without notifying me.trial tr.at.pauley also stated that he was not aware,prior to discovering the problems,that the swivels were manufactured by thompson.thompson argues that his testimony establishes that schiavi was informed of the substitution.however,there is no testimony from schiavi in the record,and the district court explicitly rejected thompson testimony.thompson at.we see no reason to disturb this credibility determination.
thompson argues that it was fluid controls burden to have schiavi,simpson purchasing agent,testify that he was confused as to the source of the swivels.thompson confuses the burden of persuasion in the unfair competition counterclaim,which remains with fluid controls throughout,universal money,am,cir,with the burden of going forward with the burden of can shift back and forth.see,office of workers comp.programs greenwich collieries,d.fluid controls met its burden of production on the issue of confusion by establishing that pauley,a representative of the consumer of the swivels,made an incorrect mental association between the involved producers,jordache,at,at quoting arts athletics,united states olympic,d,brennan,dissenting.once fluid controls had established this,the burden of going forward with the evidence shifted to thompson to rebut fluid controls showing of actual confusion.thompson can not maintain that fluid controls ultimate burden of persuasion made it unnecessary for him to rebut fluid controls evidence.fluid controls showed that a representative of the customer was confused as to the source of the swivels.no more was required for a showing of actual confusion.
the district court finding that thompson substitution of his swivels in place of the defendants patented swivels was part of an intentional plan to deceive consumers about the source of swivels,thompson at,was supported by the similarity in the designations used,as well as the course of dealing between simpson and thompson.thus,the district court findings that thompson use of the sw designation was intentionally misleading and willful,and that the simpson transaction represented an instance of actual confusion,were not clearly erroneous.
neither was the finding of likelihood of confusion clearly erroneous.a likelihood of confusion exists when consumers make an incorrect mental association between the involved commercial products or their producers.jordache,at,at quoting arts,at,d,at brennan,dissenting.the tenth circuit considers the following factors relevant to a determination of whether a likelihood of confusion exists 
a the degree of similarity between the marks,including the marks appearance,pronunciation,suggestion,and manner of display 
b strength or weakness of the plaintiff mark 
c the intent of the alleged infringer in adopting its mark 
d similarities and differences of the parties goods,services and marketing strategies 
e the degree of care likely to be exercised by purchasers of the goods or services involved and 
f evidence of actual confusion,if any.
heartsprings,at,at.no one factor is dispositive,and the final determination of likelihood of confusion must be based on consideration of all relevant factors.id.t he best evidence of a likelihood of confusion in the marketplace is actual confusion.jordache,at,at.
in this case,the final factor,evidence of actual confusion,is strongly indicative of a likelihood of confusion.it is undisputed that pauley,the engineer at simpson who actually used both swivels,was not aware that the substituted swivels were produced by thompson and contacted fluid controls for assistance with the thompson swivels.with the exception of the degree of care exercised by consumers,regarding which we find no evidence in the record,the remaining factors all support a finding of likelihood of confusion.the designation thompson applied to his swivels,was very similar to the arbitrary designation under which thompson had previously sold the swivels manufactured by fluid controls.furthermore,although thompson characterized the sw designation as a generic term,trial tr.at,he has provided no evidence that the designation is used to describe the relevant type or class of goods.first sav.bank,first bank,cir.with respect to intent,the district court found that thompson conduct was part of an intentional plan to deceive consumers.thompson at.this is supported by the record,which reflects that the fluid controls and thompson swivels were so similar that the engineer who was responsible for installing them did not recognize that they were different until he experienced problems adjusting them,and that thompson sold both swivels in the same manner to the same customer.in sum,the district court weighed all the relevant factors as required,heartsprings,at,at,and its finding of a likelihood of confusion is not clearly erroneous.
here,in order to establish unfair competition under a of the lanham act,it must be shown that defendant made material false or misleading representations of fact concerning the origin of its product in commerce that are either likely to cause confusion or mistake as to a the origin,association or approval of the product with or by another,or b the characteristics of the goods or services and injure the plaintiff.cottrell,biotrol int l,cir citations omitted.likelihood of confusion forms the gravamen for an action under a of the lanham act.king of the mountain sports,chrysler,cir.since fluid controls has established that it was injured by thompson misleading representations in connection with the sale of his swivels and that thompson conduct caused a likelihood of confusion as to the source of those swivels,the district court conclusion of law that thompson sales of substitute swivels constituted a false designation of origin,a false or misleading description of fact,and a false or misleading misrepresentation of fact in violation of section of the lanham act,thompson at,was not erroneous.
the district court also committed no error in holding that thompson acts constituted a violation of the dtpa.the dtpa makes actionable deceptive trade practices,defined inter alia as pass ing off goods as those of another,or knowingly mak ing a false representation as to the source of goods.dtpa a.an intent to deceive need not be shown to make out a claim under the dtpa.id.b making evidence of a deceptive trade practice prima facie evidence of intent to injure competitors and to destroy or substantially lessen competition id.a stating that p roof of intent shall not be required brunswick spinit reel,cir holding that the oklahoma legislature did not make intent to deceive an element of proof of passing off.the district court found that thompson passed off his products as those of defendants and thus caused confusion in the marketplace,to defendants detriment.thompson at.this finding is not clearly erroneous,and the district court did not err in concluding as a matter of law that thompson had violated the dtpa.
lastly,the district court held that thompson had violated the common law of unfair competition.the oklahoma courts have found unfair competition where the acts of defendant are such as are calculated to deceive the ordinary buyer making his purchases under the ordinary conditions which prevail in the particular trade to which the controversy relates.coalgate abstract coal county abstract,uspq,quoting at.misuse of a distinctive term or symbol is not required.bell davidson,uspq,i f ordinary words are used to palm off goods of one manufacturer,dealer or vendor as those of another and to carry on unfair competition,their use may be enjoined by a court of equity to the same extent as a fully protected distinctive term or symbol.the test is whether the ordinary buyer,exercising ordinary intelligence and observation in business matters,will certainly or probably be deceived a mere possibility of deception and confusion is insufficient.carpet city,carpet land,uspq.applying these standards,we conclude that the district court did not err in holding that thompson actions amounted to unfair competition.
the district court found that fluid controls was entitled to an accounting of all gains,profits,and advantages derived from thompson unfair competition,as well as compensatory damages,interest and the costs of the suit.thompson at.the court addressed four categories of damages thompson profits on sales of his swivels fluid controls lost profits attributable to thompson acts of unfair competition fluid controls damages for conducting an advertising campaign to counteract the unfair competition and fluid controls attorneys fees.we shall consider each category of damages in turn.
the court found that thompson caused swivels to be manufactured,of those were sold,leaving remaining in inventory.special master report at.the court calculated the profit margin on the swivels actually sold using fluid controls sale price,because thompson sale price was not apparent from the evidence submitted.id.at.using these figures,the court arrived at a damages figure of.id.at.based on its finding that thompson willful violations of federal and state law made the case exceptional,thompson at,the court then trebled this figure.judgment at.
thompson argues that the simpson transaction that led to the finding of likelihood of confusion was unique and that the district court erred in assuming that the remaining sales were made under similar conditions.thompson states that the record evidence shows that hydro tek was aware that there was no relationship between thompson and fluid controls.thompson also argues that there is no evidence that elite was deceived by thompson.
fluid controls responds that the district court did not err in assessing damages based on all of thompson sales.fluid controls argues that the district court order granting fluid controls motion for sanctions precluded thompson from contesting in any way that his sales of swivels to hydro tek and elite violated the lanham act and the oklahoma deceptive trade practices act.sanctions order at.
we agree with fluid controls.we review the district court grant of sanctions for a discovery violation for an abuse of discretion.ehrenhaus,at.thompson essentially reargues the facts relating to the hydro tek and elite sales and explains his skepticism regarding fluid controls motivation in requesting thompson customer list.however,this does not amount to a showing that the district court abused its discretion in precluding thompson from challenging that the sales were lanham act and dtpa violations.the district court is best qualified to determine the appropriate sanction for a discovery violation,and in a case such as this,in which thompson exhibited a complete lack of attention to his obligation to provide complete and accurate information,sanctions order at,we are unwilling to substitute our judgment for that of the district court without a clear showing that the court abused its discretion.
nor do we discern any legal error or clearly erroneous fact finding in the court calculation of thompson profits.it is evident that there was some confusion as to the number of swivels sold to various customers,but this confusion was engendered by thompson dilatory conduct in discovery.a defendant whose wrongful conduct has caused the difficulty in assessing damages can not complain that the damages are somewhat speculative.brunswick,at,at.
however,we find that the district court er
