introduction 
danny nabors petitions for review of the opinion and decision after reconsideration of the workers compensation appeals board board,which affirmed the award of a workers compensation judge wcj.nabors challenges the board permanent disability apportionment formula.
background 
in may,nabors sustained industrial injury to his low back and lower extremities while employed by piedmont lumber as a foreman,lumber stacker and forklift driver,resulting in an august stipulated award of based on percent permanent disability.thereafter,while working for piedmont as a mill supervisor,he sustained injury to the same body parts cumulative to august.after a hearing,the wcj found the cumulative injury caused percent of nabors permanent disability and awarded him.the board granted nabors petition for reconsideration,and affirmed the award in an en banc opinion and decision.this timely writ petition followed.
discussion 
in his opinion on decision,the wcj explained that in apportioning disability between nabors two industrial injuries,he followed the rationale of fuentes workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,fuentes,and the plain meaning of labor code section 
in fuentes,our supreme court considered the extent of an employer liability for a worker permanent disability that was attributable to both an industrial and a preexisting injury,under amendments to section the permanent disability schedule,which changed the method for calculating compensation from four weeks of benefits for each percentage point of permanent disability to a formula in which the number of weekly benefits increases exponentially in proportion to the percentage of disability.fuentes,supra,cal d at.the court set out three computational formulas and concluded the board had properly applied formula a,subtracting from the total percentage of disability the portion that was nonindustrial.the court believed that although that approach deprived the injured worker of amended section exponential increase in benefits it was required by section id.at.since that time,section has been repealed and section has been added.stats,ch.bill.section provides,in pertinent part,a the employer shall only be liable sic for the percentage of permanent disability directly caused by the injury arising out of and occurring in the course of employment.b if the applicant has received a prior award of permanent disability,it shall be conclusively presumed that the prior permanent disability exists at the time of any subsequent industrial injury.this presumption is a presumption affecting the burden of proof.italics added.
the majority of the board agreed with the wcj that absent clear indication the legislature had abandoned its intention to encourage employment of the disabled,repeal of section did not entirely undermine fuentes rationale,especially in light of new section and amended section,subdivision c stats,ch,physician apportioning permanent disability must determine approximate percentage caused by industrial injury and approximate percentage caused by other factors,both of which speak in terms of percentage of permanent disability,and the public policy underlying the new statutes to provide relief to the state from the effects of the current workers compensation crisis stats,ch.
chairman rabine dissented on the grounds that repeal of former section removed the underpinnings of fuentes,and the express language of section requires application of formula b fuentes,supra,cal d at,number of weekly benefits authorized by section for total permanent disability percent multiplied by percentage of total permanent disability attributable to current injury.rabine noted the absence of evidence that application of formula a for almost years has,in fact,encouraged employment of the handicapped.in his analysis,percentage of permanent disability refers not to the degree to which a particular injury diminishes a worker capacity to compete for employment in the open market here,percent,but to the ratio of the disability caused by the current injury to the total disability.
while agreeing with rabine that repeal of section undercut the continuing validity of the fuentes court holding,dissenting commissioner caplane disagreed about the effect of the new statutes,believing the express language of sections and require application of formula c fuentes,supra,cal d at,dollar value of previous award subtracted from dollar value of total current permanent disability see ante,fn,because unlike repealed section,the new statutes do not include the limiting language italicized in footnote,ante,and formula c furthers the purpose of section exponential increases.not surprisingly,nabors asks us to reject the board majority opinion,and adopt that of commissioner caplane.
while this petition was pending before us,the fifth district court of appeal issued an opinion in e j gallo winery workers comp.appeals bd.th,d dykes in which,after an exhaustive analysis see post,pt.a,the court held that where an employee sustains multiple disabling injuries while working for the same employer,the employee is entitled to compensation for the total disability above any percentage of permanent disability previously awarded.id.at,d.in other words,it adopted the formula c method of computing benefits.id.at.we requested letter briefs from the parties including amicus curiae california applicants attorneys association on the issue of dykes effect on this case.in addition to their responses,we received amicus briefs from the california workers compensation institute cwci and the california chamber of commerce ccc,to which the parties had an opportunity to respond cal.rules of court,rule c.for the reasons set out below,nothing in this additional briefing persuades us to diverge from the reasoning and result in dykes.
a.the dykes opinion 
winery worker david dykes sustained an industrial back injury in,resulting in an award based on percent permanent disability.in,he became percent permanently disabled after a second industrial back injury.the wcj awarded dykes benefits based on percent permanent disability,less the amount of compensation previously awarded for the earlier injury.in other words,the wcj computed the amount of the award using fuentes formula gallo,dykes employer,petitioned for reconsideration,which was summarily denied.dykes,supra,th at,d.gallo petitioned for review,urging the application of formula id.at,d.
after surveying the applicable statutes dykes,supra,th at,d,the fuentes opinion id.at,d,and the en banc decision in nabors piedmont lumber mill,wl id.at,d see ante,fn,the court concluded fuentes was no longer controlling after senate bill id.at,d.first,the court noted that the fuentes court repeatedly stated its holding was required by the express and unequivocal language of section,going so far as to suggest that repeal of that section would create the opportunity to apply another apportionment formula,and a year later,in wilkinson workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,wilkinson,confirmed that its adoption of formula a rested exclusively on section.dykes,at,d.next,the court pointed out the significantly different approaches to apportionment between former section current injury considered by itself as if no prior disability existed and new section conclusive presumption that prior disability still exists.id.at.finally,the court rejected the nabors en banc majority conclusion that the policy of encouraging employers to hire the disabled dictates the use of formula a,noting the new legislation presumption that prior disability exists,the lack of evidence that any apportionment formula promotes hiring the disabled better than another,and the numerous statutes enacted since fuentes.id.at,d.in sum,the court concluded that the legislature contemplated a variation in determining apportionment by repealing section and replacing it with different language in section for apportioning liability among multiple injuries.ibid.
turning its attention to the meaning of the new apportionment provision,the court concluded the plain language of section,subdivision a ante,means that a n employer is liable for the direct consequences of a injury,nothing more and nothin
