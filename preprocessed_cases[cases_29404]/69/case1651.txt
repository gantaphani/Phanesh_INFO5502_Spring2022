the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri entered summary judgment against defendant homan mcfarling and in favor of the monsanto company monsanto under federal rule of civil procedure b on some,but not all,of the claims being litigated.see monsanto mcfarling,cdp,wl,granting final judgment under rule b,granting monsanto motions for summary judgment.the district court held that,when mcfarling replanted some of monsanto patented roundup ready soybeans that he had saved from his prior year crop,mcfarling breached the technology agreement that he had signed as a condition of his purchase of the patented seeds.the district court also held that mcfarling had failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact that prevented entry of summary judgment on any of his counterclaims or his defenses to monsanto claim.finally,the district court held that a liquidated damages provision in the technology agreement was valid and enforceable under missouri law and entered a judgment in the amount of.mcfarling appeals the district court rulings on several of his counterclaims and defenses,as well as its ruling on the contractual damages provision.we affirm the district court on the counterclaims and defenses,but we vacate the district court judgment as it relates to the damages provision and remand for a determination of monsanto actual damages.
monsanto manufactures roundup herbicide.roundup contains glyphosate,a chemical that indiscriminately kills vegetation by inhibiting the metabolic activity of a particular enzyme,phosphate synthase epsps.epsps is necessary for the conversion of sugars into amino thus for many plants and weeds.
monsanto also markets roundup ready technology.in soybean seeds,the roundup ready technology operates by inserting the gene sequence for a variant of epsps that is not affected by the presence of glyphosate but that still performs the function required for cell growth.thus,roundup ready soybean seeds produce both a natural version of epsps that is rendered ineffective in the presence of the glyphosate in roundup herbicide,and a genetically modified version of epsps that permits the soybean seeds to grow nonetheless.roundup,or other herbicides,can thus be sprayed over the top of an entire field,killing the weeds without harming the roundup ready soybeans.
the monsanto technology agreement in dispute in this case lists six patents related to the various seeds that are licensed by the agreement,but monsanto has asserted infringement in this case only under two patents that read on aspects of the use of the roundup ready technology in soybeans.united states patent the patent relates to the gene encoding the modified epsps enzyme,and sweepingly claims,inter alia,the isolated dna molecule encoding it,patent,claim a plant cell comprising that dna molecule,claim a sic plant comprising that plant cell,claim a seed of a plant,claim a particular transgenic soybean plant,claim and a method of producing genetically transformed plants which are tolerant toward glyphosate herbicide,claim.united states patent the patent relates to the use of a particular promoter in genetically modified plant cells.the patent claims,inter alia,dna sequences and plant cells containing the promoter.a promoter sequence is a dna sequence located in proximity to the dna sequence that encodes a protein and that,in part,tells the cellular machinery how much of the protein to make.
monsanto licenses its proprietary roundup ready technology through two interrelated licensing schemes.first,it licenses the patented gene to seed companies that manufacture the seeds that are sold to farmers.under this license,seed companies gain the right to insert the genetic trait into the germplasm of their own seeds which can differ from seed company to seed company,and monsanto receives the right to a royalty or technology fee of for every bag of seed containing the roundup ready technology sold by the seed company.monsanto also owns several subsidiary seed companies that comprise approximately percent of the market for roundup ready soybeans.
second,monsanto requires that seed companies execute licenses,rather than conduct unconditional sales,with their farmer customers.the version of this monsanto technology agreement the technology agreement between monsanto and the soybean farmers using roundup ready soybeans places several conditions on the soybean farmers use of the licensed soybeans.in exchange for the o pportunity to purchase and plant seed containing the roundup ready technology,soybean farmers agree,inter alia 
to use the seed containing monsanto gene technologies for planting a commercial crop only in a single season.
to not supply any of this seed to any other person or entity for planting,and to not save any crop produced from this seed for replanting,or supply saved seed to anyone for replanting.
to not use this seed or provide it to anyone for crop breeding,research,generation of herbicide registration data or seed production.
the technology agreement also contains a clause specifying damages in the event of breach by the farmer 
in the event that the grower saves,supplies,sells or acquires seed for replant in violation of this agreement and license restriction,in addition to other remedies available to the technology provider s,the grower agrees that damages will include a claim for liquidated damages,which will be based on times the applicable technology fee.
homan mcfarling operates a farm in pontotoc county,mississippi.in,mcfarling executed the technology agreement in connection with the license of bags of roundup ready soybean seed.mcfarling concedes that he saved bushels of seed from his crop,enough to plant approximately acres,and that he replanted them in.he subsequently saved bags of soybeans from his crop,replanting them in.
soybeans destined for replanting are apparently cleaned after harvest.when mcfarling sent his seeds saved from the season to a third party for cleaning,monsanto had some samples taken,had the genetic makeup of the seeds tested at mississippi state university,and thus learned that mcfarling was saving roundup ready seeds.
in january,monsanto filed suit against mcfarling,alleging,inter alia,infringement of the and patents and breach of the technology agreement,and seeking a preliminary injunction prohibiting mcfarling from planting,transferring or selling the infringing articles to a third party.in his answer,mcfarling raised affirmative defenses styled alternatively as counterclaims when possible both to,inter alia,violations of the plant variety protection act pvpa,stat,as amended,et,the federal antitrust laws,the patent misuse doctrine,and the patent exhaustion and first sale to damages as calculated under the multiplier in the technology agreement.he did not,however,challenge the validity of monsanto patents.because mcfarling only connection with missouri was a forum selection clause in the technology agreement,mcfarling also brought a motion to dismiss based on a lack of personal jurisdiction.
the district court held that the forum selection clause was valid and entered a preliminary injunction against mcfarling.on appeal,we affirmed the district court on both issues.see monsanto mcfarling,mcfarling i.addressing monsanto likelihood of success on the merits,we held that the district court did not err in finding that mcfarling had not demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on his affirmative defenses.id.at.
back in the district court,monsanto moved for summary judgment on the infringement claim under the patent,the breach of the technology agreement claim,and all of mcfarling affirmative defenses.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of monsanto on all of mcfarling defenses as well as on liability with respect to monsanto patent infringement claim and the technology agreement claim.on damages,however,the district court denied monsanto summary judgment motion.it left the damages issue regarding infringement of the patent for trial.additionally,although it held the liquidated damages clause in the technology agreement to be valid and enforceable provided the multiplier was applied to the number of bags of seed purchased rather than the number replanted,it concluded that there was insufficient evidence of the number of bags purchased by mcfarling in to enter judgment on damages on the claim.after mcfarling stipulated that he purchased bags of roundup ready soybean seed in,the district court entered final judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b on monsanto claim only in the amount of x x,and against mcfarling on his counterclaims.
in the district court,monsanto had argued that the multiplier in the liquidated damages clause should be interpreted to produce damages of times the technology fee times the number of bags of seed replanted by mcfarling.the district court rejected that formula,reasoning that it would constitute an unlawful penalty because it simply imposes a multiple of times monsanto actual damages.to avoid that result and sustain the lawfulness of the liquidated damages clause,the district court fashioned a formula that multiplies times the licensing fee times the number of bags of seed purchased.
mcfarling appealed the district court final judgment to us,and we have jurisdiction to hear his appeal pursuant to a.mcfarling argues that the district court grant of summary judgment on the claim was erroneous on the following issues his defense,his antitrust counterclaim,his defense under the pvpa,and his defense that the multiplier in the liquidated damages provision of the technology agreement is a penalty clause that is unenforceable under missouri law.we address each in turn below.
we review a grant of summary judgment by the district court without deference.combined,def.tech.of.summary judgment is appropriate if,drawing all factual inferences in favor of the,there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.
mcfarling argues that monsanto has committed patent misuse because monsanto has impermissibly tied an unpatented product to a patented product.in mcfarling words,b y prohibiting,monsanto has extended its patent on the gene technology to include an unpatented soybean seed which is not within the terms of the patent.
the policy of the patent misuse doctrine is to prevent a patentee from using the patent to obtain market benefit beyond that which inures in the statutory patent right.mallinckrodt,medipart.therefore,in evaluating a defense,t he key inquiry is whether,by imposing conditions that derive their force from the patent,the patentee has impermissibly broadened the scope of the patent grant with anticompetitive effect.bard,see also.panel mac panel,mallinckrodt,at windsurfing int l,amf.in the cases in which the restriction is reasonably within the patent grant,the patent misuse defense can never succeed.see talking pictures.braun,abbott,mallinckrodt,at.in cases in which a condition controlling the use of a patented invention extends beyond the patentee statutory right to exclude,however,either a per se rule of patent misuse,see.panel,at discussing specific practices constituting per se misuse,or a rule of reason analysis,see mallinckrodt,at windsurfing int l,at to sustain a misuse defense involving a licensing arrangement not held to have been per se anticompetitive by the supreme court,a factual determination must reveal that the overall effect of the license tends to restrain competition unlawfully in an appropriately defined relevant market,must be applied.
tying can constitute patent misuse a patent licensor who conditions the license on a patent licensee purchase of an unpatented material for use in the invention may,under certain conditions,be impermissibly extending the scope of the subject matter encompassed by the patent grant.see carbice of am.am.patents dev.seiffhart.
we need not plumb the complexities of tying as misuse of a patent,however,to determine that the district court correctly granted summary judgment for monsanto.mcfarling does not raise a typical tying allegation,and the mere recitation of the word tying is not sufficient to state a patent misuse defense.mcfarling does not argue that he can not purchase soybean germplasm without the genetic trait that brings the soybean within the ambit of monsanto patent.in fact,a market for such unmodified soybeans exists.see mcfarling i,at.neither does mcfarling argue that he sought or is capable of performing under the type of license granted to the seed companies to purchase,make or use the patented gene sequence prior to its insertion into the seed.
mcfarling tying argument instead centers on his desire to replant the entire seed,including the genetic modifications,and on monsanto refusal to grant him permission to do so.mcfarling proposes that monsanto could untie the seed and the trait by permitting the farmer to save and replant roundup ready seed each year,provided the farmer still pays directly to monsanto the required technology fee,rather than requiring a farmer to purchase both the seed and the genetic technology together at the beginning of each growing season.by suggesting that he should be allowed to pay the technology fee in conjunction with replanting of the soybeans,the closest mcfarling comes to alleging a tying argument is a suggestion that monsanto has tied together the legal right to exclude granted by a patent and the entire,physical patented product or combination of germplasm and trait.at its simplest,mcfarling effectively argues in different words that he should be granted a compulsory license to use the patent rights in conjunction with the roundup ready soybeans in his possession after harvest.we decline to hold that monsanto raw exercise of its right to exclude from the patented invention by itself is a tying arrangement that exceeds the scope of the patent grant.
what perhaps truly irks mcfarling is that the license controls what mcfarling can do with seeds that mcfarling made using the seeds that he acquired under a strict license.mcfarling argues that the prohibition in the technology agreement on sav ing any crop produced from this seed for replanting constitutes patent misuse he does not suggest that the prohibitions on supply ing any of this seed to any other person or entity for planting and on supply ing saved seed to anyone for replanting should render the patent unenforceable.nonetheless,monsanto tries rather unconvincingly to paint its restrictions in the technology agreement as permissible restrictions on the seeds.braun,at f ield of use restrictions are generally upheld.monsanto argues that it may license a grower to use its patented roundup ready biotechnology to grow a commercial crop,but decline to license a grower to make patented seed for use or sale as a crop seed.based on the record before us,mcfarling plants and grows the seed in an identical fashion whether he intends to sell the seed as a commercial crop for consumption or whether he intends to replant it.thus,the technology agreement does not impose a restriction on the use of the product purchased under license but rather imposes a restriction on the use of the goods made by the licensed product.
our case law has not addressed in general terms the status of such restrictions placed on goods made by,yet not incorporating,the licensed good under the patent misuse doctrine.however,the technology agreement presents a unique set of facts in which licensing restrictions on the use of goods produced by the licensed product are not beyond the scope of the patent grant at issue the licensed and patented product the seeds and the good made by the licensed product the seeds are nearly identical copies.thus,given that we must presume that monsanto patent reads on the seeds it also reads on the seeds.see patent,claiming a seed of a plant.because the patent would read on all generations of soybeans produced,we hold that the restrictions in the technology agreement prohibiting the replanting of the second generation of roundup ready soybeans do not extend monsanto rights under the patent statute.
mcfarling next repackages his tying defense as a tying antitrust counterclaim.however,because we have found mcfarling allegations insufficient to present a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether monsanto licensing restrictions went beyond the boundaries of its patent grant,mcfarling antitrust counterclaim also fails.in re indep.serv.orgs.antitrust,concluding that an antitrust claim does nothing to limit the right of the patentee to refuse to sell or license in markets within the scope of the statutory patent grant.panel,at b ecause we determine that the conduct underlying the allegations of misuse does not amount to patent misuse,the same conduct can not support a judgment that the patentee licensor conduct violated the sherman act.in this instance,the anticompetitive effect of which mcfarling complains is part and parcel of the patent system role in creating incentives for potential inventors.
mcfarling also argues that the district court improperly assumed the role of the fact finder and decided that the patented technology the patented trait and the seed are not two separate markets without examining consumer demand for either.we agree with mcfarling that,for antitrust purposes,whether there are two distinct products for tying purposes is a question of fact usually determined by examining consumer demand.see jefferson parish hosp.dist.hyde,d analyzing the existence of separate markets based on the character of the demand for the two items.furthermore,we agree that the district court failed to consider consumer demand.however,the district court finding concerning the unified nature of the market for the trait and the seed is not relevant to our holding,so we expressly decline to reach or review it.mcfarling is not alleging that he is unable to,or even that he desires to,purchase a natural soybean seed and the roundup ready genetic trait as distinct items he alleges only that monsanto refuses to grant him a license to use the genetically modified seeds in his possession after harvest in his preferred manner.
mcfarling asks that we reconsider our ruling in mcfarling i that the plant variety protection act does not demonstrate a congressional intent to preempt and invalidate all prohibitions on seed saving contained in licenses.see mcfarling i,at t he right to save seed of plants registered under the pvpa does not impart the right to save seed of plants patented under the patent act.we remain unpersuaded by mcfarling arguments.
in ag supply,pioneer international,d,the supreme court held that plants were subject matter eligible for protection under,ag supply,at,and that hybrid seeds also eligible for protection under the pvpa were not an exception to that general rule,id.at.in considering whether congress enactment of the pvpa implicitly altered the scope of patentable subject matter under section,the court recognized that there are no exemptions for saving seed under a utility patent,id.at,as there is in the pvpa,see,yet it held nonetheless that the two statutory schemes could mutually coexist,ag supply,at.internal quotation marks omitted.in light of the supreme court interpretation of congress intent,we conclude that congress did not intend to prohibit owners of utility patents from enforcing prohibitions in their licenses.
finally,mcfarling argues that the district court erred in holding that the multiplier on the technology fee in the technology agreement was a valid and enforceable liquidated damages clause under missouri law.upon independent review,see robert blond meat eisenberg,holding that the validity of a liquidated damages clause is a question of law and reviewing it without deference,we agree with mcfarling that the liquidated damages clause in the technology agreement is invalid and unenforceable under missouri law as it applies to mcfarling breach of replanting of saved seed.
missouri law distinguishes between liquidated damages clauses,which are valid and enforceable,and penalty clauses,which are neither.see diffley royal papers,paragon group,ampleman,burst beal,grand bissell towers,joan gagnon.
for a damage clause to be valid as fixing liquidated damages the amount fixed as damages must be a reasonable forecast for the harm caused by the breach and the harm must be of a kind difficult to accurately estimate.diffley,at see also paragon group,at citing the restatement first of contracts and the restatement second of contracts as the sources of the missouri rule grand bissell towers,at same.the two prongs of this conjunctive test are interrelated.if the difficulty of proof of loss is great,considerable latitude is allowed in the approximation of anticipated or actual harm.luna smith,quoting restatement second of contracts,cmt.b see also paragon group,at where the difficulty of measuring loss is great,significant latitude is allowed in setting the amount of anticipated damages.the courts tend to construe such contractual damages stipulations,if doubtful,as punitive in nature.wilt waterfield.
to survive the first prong of the missouri test,a contractual damages provision must be fixed on the basis of compensation.diffley,at.the reasonableness of the contractual damages provision is measured relative to an estimation,made at the time of contracting,of the compensation that would be required to negate the harm to the nonbreaching party in the event of breach see diffley,at discussing a reasonable forecast for the harm burst,at t he damages fixed must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the amount of harm anticipated when the contract was made.grand bissell towers,at these rules requiring some reasonable relation between the damages agreed upon and those expected to result from the breach are not rules about actual damages.see also info.networks kansas city,cir interpreting missouri law to require that t he validity of the liquidated damages clause must be viewed at the time the contract was executed.in contrast,penalty clauses are impermissible because they are designed primarily to compel performance at the time of contracting.wilt,at see also diffley,at restatement second of contracts,cmt.a noting that the central objective behind the system of contract remedies is compensatory,not punitive,and that liquidated damages provisions may not disregard the principle of compensation.
for a contractual damages provision to survive the second prong of the missouri test,it must be anticipated that the loss will be difficult to measure at the time breach is discovered difficulty in measuring the extent of damages at the time of contracting is not sufficient.in luna,for example,a missouri court of appeals looked to the determination that the amount of damages actually sustained by defendants would have been difficult to prove in order to determine that proof of loss was difficult and that the liquidated damages clause was valid.at emphasis added.likewise,in paragon group,a missouri court of appeals relied on the principle that actual damages for breach of real estate sales contracts are uncertain and difficult to prove to determine that proof of loss was difficult to determine.at emphasis added see also carmel dieckmann,liquidated damage provisions in real estate contracts are frequently utilized because the actual damages in an action for breach are uncertain in amount and difficult to ascertain or prove.quoting stein bruce.the harm that will flow from a breach is difficult to estimate at the time of contracting in nearly all contracts requiring ongoing performance,because the time of breach is not known at the time of contracting.only by measuring the difficulty of proving loss at the time of the discovery of the breach is the second prong of the missouri test interpreted as something other than a truism.
one litmus test that the missouri courts use to determine whether a contractual provision determining damages is a reasonable estimate of the anticipated harm is what we term the rule 
a court may consider whether the agreement contains various stipulations of various degrees of importance,the breaches of which would be easy to calculate in damages as to some and difficult as to others,in which event the sum specified would be construed as a penalty and not as liquidated damages even though the parties in express terms have declared the contrary.
wilt,at quoting sylvester watts smyth realty am.sur.of,see also plymouth sec.johnson,where a contract of sale contains several distinct covenants of various degrees of importance and the damages for breaches would be easy to calculate as to some of them and difficult as to others,the specification of a sum of money or definite property as damages for breach of the contract will be construed as a penalty designed to insure performance,even though the parties have expressly declared the provision to be one for liquidated damages.morse rathburn,w hen the agreement contains several distinct covenants,on which there may be divers breaches,some of an uncertain nature and others certain,with one entire sum to be paid on breach of performance,then the contract will be treated as one for a penalty,and not for liquidated damages.jennings first bank of.city.
this fixed rule of missouri contract law is not unusual.variations on this rule are applied in a number of jurisdictions.see,united states martin lumber,cir applying mississippi law labeling a contractual damages clause as a penalty clause when it provides for double payment and without discrimination,provides the same penalty for leaving marked trees uncut as for cutting unmarked tress,and,as to trees injured through carelessness,provides the same penalty without regard to the extent in each case of the injury d damages citing cases.
the rule is an intuitive corollary of the missouri test that applies when a single formula for liquidated damages applies to multiple provisions in the contract.the rule highlights that both prongs of the test must be satisfied for each contract provision or each type of breach to which the contractual damages provision pertains.it reminds us that the validity of a damages clause must be measured on a basis the fact that the harm flowing from the breach of one provision may be difficult to measure does not validate a contractual damages provision as it applies to the breach of another provision.additionally,the rule provides a rule of thumb assay to determine if a contractual damages provision was fixed on the basis of compensation if the same formula is used to calculate damages for breaches of two different provisions that would be expected to require two substantially different methods of compensation,then the contract on its face admits that the parties did not view the specified damages as compensatory.in some cases,this evidence intrinsic to the contract may provide a more reliable measure of the parties intent than a hindsight comparison of the sum specified in the contract and the damage award required to compensate the nonbreaching party for the damages actually sustained.
we conclude that the multiplier in the technology agreement is not valid under missouri law.it was not,at the time of contracting,a reasonable estimate of the harm that monsanto would likely suffer in the event that mcfarling breached the contractual prohibition on saving roundup ready soybeans.
monsanto principal argument to the contrary is that roundup ready soybeans can at an exponential rate.one bag of soybean seed can yield bags of soybean seed to save for the following season,although this figure may vary with different types of crops,seed varieties,geographic growing locations,planting rates,cultural practices,and growing conditions,among other factors.based on this figure together with assumptions of infinite acreage on which to plant and no commercial sale of any soybeans,a farmer planting one bag of soybeans in year one would reap bags to replant in year two,bags to replant in year three,and bags to replant in year four.this simple narrative is forceful insofar it illustrates the potential magnitude of the harm that monsanto could suffer from losing control of its proprietary technology.however,an illustration that breach of the technology agreement under particular conditions may be reasonably expected to lead to harm of a great magnitude is not sufficient to uphold the validity of the damages clause in its entirety.the damages clause is not valid as applied to the provision of the technology agreement that prohibits saving soybean seed and that was breached by mcfarling.in other words,the multiplier does not pass muster under missouri rule.
the multiplier in the technology agreement violates the rule because the identical technology agreement is used to govern a grower rights with respect to several different crops that would be expected to replicate at different rates.if the anticipated harm flows from the capacity of genetically modified seeds,then a reasonable estimate of compensation upon breach must logically be adjusted to incorporate the different rates of.the technology agreement makes no such adjustment.
the technology agreement signed by mcfarling is used with monsanto proprietary strains of genetically modified cotton,soybeans,and corn this monsanto technology agreement covers roundup ready cotton,bollgard cotton,bollgard with roundup ready cotton,roundup ready soybeans,yieldgard corn and roundup ready corn.the report of monsanto damages expert and monsanto brief on appeal assume a ratio of to for seed produced from seed planted to calculate the harm from the of soybeans from one growing season to the next.this same report,however,quotes monsanto technology agreement applicable to cotton only as stating that t he average ratio of cotton seed produced from cotton seed planted is to.based on the information presented in this report,the figure first appeared in this license and was only subsequently used in the license.because the rates of of cotton and soybeans differ by over a factor of three it is difficult to understand how the same multiplier as applied to the technology fee could be a reasonable forecast of harm in the event of a breach by both a cotton farmer and a soybean farmer.
the multiplier in the technology agreement also violates the rule because it specifies the same measure of damages in the event of breach of several different restrictive provisions of the contract that lead to different types of damage.the licensee can trigger the multiplier in the technology agreement by violating any one of several distinct provisions in the event that the grower saves,supplies,sells or acquires seed for replant in violation of this agreement and license restriction the grower agrees that damages will include a claim for liquidated damages emphases added.we conclude that the nature of the harm to monsanto flowing from breach of the provision prohibiting seed saving is fundamentally different from the nature of the harm to monsanto flowing from breach of the provision prohibiting seed supplying and seed selling.
in fact,monsanto repeatedly acknowledged the importance of the distinction between seed saving by the farmer for replant on his own farm and seed transfer to third parties for replant.monsanto argued in its brief that w hether an infringer saves seed for himself only or transfers saved seed to other growers significantly impacts the multiplier effect and the harm to monsanto.additionally,the following exchange occurred at oral argument between the court and monsanto attorney 
court t he character or quality of the breach when mcfarling breaches on his own farm is really different from monsanto perspective than the quality of the breach if he goes to the county fair and sells bags to different purchasers.am i right 
counsel absolutely.and that why the times multiple is so reasonable.
in a letter,monsanto responded to the court citation of wilt,as well as to the suggestion made during oral argument that the contractual damages provision might be reasonable as applied to a grower who breached by selling saved seed,but not to one who breached by planting saved seed.monsanto argued that the contractual damages provision was reasonable because monsanto can not know whether a grower bent upon breach will do so by transferring or replanting saved seed,or both.monsanto did not argue that the harms caused by the two distinct breaches of transferring and saving seed were similar in nature.
under the rule,a liquidated damages clause is invalid if even one breach covered by the clause fails to qualify for enforceability as liquidat
