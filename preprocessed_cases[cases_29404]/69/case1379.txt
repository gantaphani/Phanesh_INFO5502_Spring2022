this appeal arises out of an uninsured motorist coverage dispute between the defendant hartford insurance group,hartford insurance company of the midwest,a connecticut corporation the hartford,and oklahoma plaintiff joann haberman haberman.the hartford appeals from a final amended judgment entered on a jury verdict in favor of haberman.the hartford also challenges the denial of its summary judgment motion.in a,haberman appeals from the denial of her motion for new trial and to amend the judgment.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to and affirm.
background 
plaintiff haberman is the sole shareholder of a professional corporation,breast cancer screening center of oklahoma.on august,haberman and her office manager,tamara moomey,were returning to oklahoma city from a pleasure trip in dallas,texas.moomey was the driver and owner of a mercury suv that was headed northbound on just five miles south of davis,oklahoma.moomey lost control of the suv and spun off the highway,killing herself and injuring haberman who sustained a fractured pelvis and multiple contusions.
moomey insurer,geico direct,settled with haberman for its liability limits of and an additional on moomey uninsured motorist policy.haberman then attempted to pursue a further claim for benefits under the uninsured motorist um provisions of her policy through the breast cancer screening center.however,the mercury suv was not a scheduled vehicle under the center commercial insurance policy.
on some date prior to the accident,the center had taken out a special commercial business insurance policy with the hartford.haberman did not personally pay insurance premiums to the hartford for the policy rather the center paid the premiums.the center was the named insured for all lines of coverage under the policy,including the uninsured motorist um provision under the commercial automobile section.
relevant provisions of the policy 
the policy included subsections entitled commercial auto coverage part and business auto coverage form.the business auto coverage form provides in pertinent part throughout this policy the words you and your refer to the named insured shown in the declarations.in section coverage,insured is defined as 
the following are insureds 
a.you for any covered auto 
anyone else while using with your permission a covered auto you own,hire or borrow except 
the owner or anyone else from whom you hire or borrow a covered auto.this exception does not apply if the covered auto is a trailer connected to a covered auto.
your employee if the covered auto is owned by that employee or a member of his or her household.
someone using a covered auto while he or she is working in a business of selling,servicing,repairing,parking or storing autos unless that business is yours.
anyone other than your employees,partners if you are a partnership,members if you are a limited liability company,or a lessee or borrower or any of their employees while moving property to or from a covered auto.
a partner if you are a partnership or a member if you are a limited liability company for a covered auto owned by him or her or a member of his or her household.
anyone liable for the conduct of an insured described above,but only to the extent of that liability.
in section,insured is defined as any person or organization qualifying as an insured in the who is an insured provision of the applicable coverage.at.in an endorsement entitled oklahoma uninsured motorists coverage hereinafter endorsement the who is an insured provision provides that an insured is 
if you are an individual,any family member.
anyone else occupying a covered auto or a temporary substitute for a covered auto.the covered auto must be out of service because of its breakdown,repair,servicing,loss,or destruction.
anyone for damages he or she is entitled to recover because of bodily injury sustained by another insured.
in an endorsement entitled auto medical payments coverage,the who is insured provision states that an insured is 
you while occupying or,while a pedestrian,when struck by any auto.
if you are an individual,any family member while occupying or,while a pedestrian,when struck by any auto.
anyone else occupying a covered auto or a temporary substitute for a covered auto.the covered auto must be out of service because of its breakdown,repair,servicing,loss or destruction.
finally,there is an endorsement provision titled named persons as insureds which states as follows 
this endorsement modifies insurance provided under the following business auto coverage form,garage coverage form,truckers coverage form 
named person s or organizations s joann haberman,an individual 
each person or organization listed above is an insured for liability coverage,but only to the extent that person or organization qualifies as an insured under the who is insured provision of section coverage.
at this provision also listed haberman as an additional insured.id.
section i covered autos under the business auto coverage form,states 
item two of the declarations shows the autos that are covered autos for each of your coverages.the following numerical symbols describe the autos that may be covered autos.the symbols next to a coverage on the declarations designate the only autos that are covered autos.
at.the symbol is defined as 
specifically described autos only those autos described in item three of the declarations for which a premium charge is shown and for liability coverage any trailers you do own while attached to any power unit described in item three.
at.the commercial policy section titled item of coverages and covered autos,uses the symbol under uninsured motorists coverages.
the um provisions in the policy only covered two automobiles,a honda accord and a lexus,which were listed under symbol of the center commercial automobile policy.the commercial policy section titled schedule of limits uninsured motorist coverage and underinsured motorists coverage states that the limits are designated as each accident.
haberman claim to the hartford 
on february,haberman,through counsel,submitted initial correspondence to the hartford stating,we are making a claim under haberman uninsured motorist coverage.ann marie mull was the hartford adjuster assigned to the claim.
on march,mull wrote haberman attorney a letter explaining that the hartford had denied coverage because only the two scheduled vehicles under the policy the honda and the lexus ls were covered.mull cited the definition of symbol found in the business auto coverage form under the policy,as the basis for denial because haberman was not riding in a covered vehicle under the commercial insurance policy.mull also requested that haberman provide any additional information that she wished the hartford to consider on its decision to deny coverage.
procedural history 
on july,haberman filed suit against the hartford,alleging claims under the insurance contract and for bad faith failure to pay.the united states district court for the western district of oklahoma exercised jurisdiction pursuant to et and,as the parties are completely diverse and the amount in controversy exceeded.
on may,the hartford filed a motion for summary judgment which addressed the contract and bad faith claims.haberman filed an objection to the hartford motion for summary judgment and a counter motion for summary judgment on the coverage issue.applying oklahoma law,the district court concluded,as a matter of law,that the named person endorsement is unambiguous and makes haberman a named insured for all purposes under the policy.the trial court also made an alternative ruling that if there is any merit to the hartford interpretation of the endorsement,it is ambiguous and any ambiguity would be resolved in favor of haberman based on parol evidence which includes the interpretations of the hartford adjusters.based on these conclusions,the trial court entered summary judgment on the coverage issues in favor of plaintiff haberman.
the case proceeded to trial on august.at the conclusion of the evidence,haberman moved for judgment as a matter of law on her contract claim.the motion was granted.the hartford also made motions for judgment as a matter of law,but each time the grounds for the motion were limited to haberman bad faith cause of action.the motion as to the bad faith claim was denied.
the case then went to the jury.haberman requested jury instructions which dealt with the specific duties of the hartford,which the trial court declined to give.haberman also objected to instruction,failure to deal fairly and in good faith,for not noting specific items of the hartford conduct which could be considered bad faith.
on august,the jury returned a plaintiff verdict for on the contract claim,for actual damages on the bad faith claim and a further for punitive damages on the bad faith claim.judgment was entered by the district court on september.on,haberman filed a motion to alter the judgment or for a new trial,which was denied on november.
issues presented 
on appeal,the hartford alleges pretrial,trial and errors,and haberman alleges a error by a.the hartford contends that the court committed reversible errors by finding that the named person endorsement makes haberman a named insured for all purposes under the insurance policy,and by its ruling that haberman is entitled to stack um benefits.we affirm the district court on these rulings 
the hartford next raises two trial errors.first,the hartford argues that the district court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law and submitting the issue of bad faith to the jury.second,the hartford argues that the court committed reversible error by instructing the jury on punitive damages.we hold that the district court correctly applied the law on these issues.
finally,the hartford contends that the amount of punitive damages violates its due process rights.we disagree and hold that the punitive damages award is not violative of due process.
on,haberman argues that the trial court erred in failing to grant a new trial based on inadequate instructions.we hold that the district court instructions were adequate.
discussion 
as an initial matter,we address whether the hartford properly preserved for appeal the issues relating to the district court finding of coverage for haberman as a named insured.haberman contends that because the district court finding of coverage was made before trial on summary judgment,and because the hartford consented to haberman motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidence,the hartford may no longer appeal these issues.she points out that if the trial court grants a motion for directed verdict,an adverse party who did not object to the lack of supporting grounds in the trial court may not raise the point in the appellate court 
indeed,this court has held that the denial of summary judgment based on factual disputes is not properly reviewable on an appeal from a final judgment entered after trial.whalen unit rig,cir,cert.denied,d even if summary judgment was erroneously denied,the proper redress would not be through appeal of that denial but through subsequent motions for judgment as a matter of law and appellate review of those motions if they were denied.see also allahar zahora,cir failure to renew a summary judgment denial was based on factual a motion for judgment as a matter of law under.a at the close of all the evidence is considered a waiver of the issue on appeal.however,when the material facts are not in dispute and the denial of summary judgment is based on the interpretation of a purely legal question,such a decision is appealable after final judgment wilson union pacific,cir ruyle continental oil,cir,cert.denied,d.in the present case,the district court undertook a legal interpretation of the insurance contract when ruling on the motion for summary judgment.the court concluded that the contract covered haberman under the uninsured motorist um provision as a matter of law.by so concluding,the court took the coverage issue away from the jury,leaving it only the question of damages.the rulings below raise pure questions of law that are reviewable on appeal.
we review de novo a district court disposition of a motion for judgment as a matter of law.baty willamette indus,cir quotations and citations omitted,overruled on other grounds,passenger morgan,d.in diversity cases,the substantive law of the forum state governs the analysis of the underlying claims,including specification of the applicable standards of proof,but federal law controls the ultimate,procedural question whether judgment as a matter of law is appropriate.see gust jones,cir.therefore,the substantive law of oklahoma applies and governs as we review the issues raised on appeal in this case.
effect of the named person endorsement 
the hartford first contends that the district court erred by holding that haberman is a named insured under its insurance contract with breast cancer screening center of oklahoma.according to the hartford,the named person as insured endorsement which lists haberman as a named person refers only to her liability coverage under the contract we are not persuaded.
the guidelines for ascribing meaning to an insurance policy terms in oklahoma are well established.an insurance policy is a contract when its terms are unambiguous and clear,the language is accorded its ordinary,plain meaning and enforced so as to carry out the parties intentions.bituminous casualty cowen construction,footnotes omitted.see also idg,continental casualty,cir.the parties are bound by the terms of their agreement and the court will not undertake to rewrite the same nor to make for either party a better contract than the one which was executed.id.the test to be applied in determining whether a word or phrase is ambiguous is whether the word or phrase is susceptible to two interpretations on its face.cranfill aetna life insurance,quoting littlefield state farm fire and cas.the test is applied from the standpoint of a reasonably prudent lay person,not from that of a lawyer.id.citing couch on insurance.in reviewing a provision of an insurance contract,the court should not use a forced or strained construction,take a provision out of context,or narrowly focus on a provision,wynn avemco ins,citing dodson paul ins,so as to import a more favorable consideration to either party than that expressed in the contract.crawford indemnity underwriters ins.
the parties agree that absent the named person endorsement,haberman would not be entitled to benefits under the policy because she was neither a named insured on the policy declarations page nor riding in a covered auto at the time of the accident.thus,the issue to be resolved is the effect of the named person endorsement.notably,the endorsement is titled named person s or organization s as insured.emphasis added.the endorsement states that the endorsement changes the policy and joann haberman is listed as a named person.in addition,the document states that the endorsement modifies insurance provided under the business auto coverage form,garage coverage form and truckers coverage form.the business auto coverage form includes liability coverage,uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage,and medical payments coverage.clearly,based on this language alone,the endorsement unambiguously modifies the policy to make haberman an insured for all purposes.
however,the last sentence in the endorsement states that each person named is an insured for liability coverage,but only to the extent that person qualifies as an insured under the who is an insured provision of section coverage.the hartford argues that this sentence means that haberman is a named insured only for liability coverage.but,the sentence does not expressly state that haberman is covered only for liability,and the hartford fails to articulate why an endorsement purportedly limiting a named insured only to liability coverage would clearly state that the endorsement modifies the whole policy business auto coverage form,garage coverage form,and truckers coverage form.by the plain words of the sentence,the named insured is provided liability coverage,but only to the extent provided for in the liability section of the policy.read in its entirety,the endorsement makes haberman a named insured for all purposes under the policy,but her liability coverage is limited to the extent provided for in the liability section of the policy.
even assuming arguendo that there is merit to the hartford argument,the endorsement would be ambiguous because it does not explicitly exclude all other coverage and the ambiguity would be resolved in favor of haberman.corporation admiral insurance,if the language in an insurance contract is found to be ambiguous,the contract should be interpreted consistent with the mutual intent of the parties,with the ambiguity resolved most favorably to the insured and against the insurance carrier.see also mcdonald schreiner,when an insurance contract provision is ambiguous,words of inclusion will be liberally construed in favor of the insured and those of exclusion will be strictly construed against the insurer.emphasis in original max true plastering united states fidelity and guaranty.because the endorsement does not expressly exclude all other coverage,or expressly limit coverage to liability only,we hold that haberman is a named insured for all purposes under the policy,including coverage 
the hartford next contends that under oklahoma law,coverage may be tied to specified vehicles in a commercial auto insurance policy and that,as a result,haberman is not entitled to coverage since she was not riding in a covered vehicle.haberman expert witness conceded during her testimony that coverage may be tied to specified vehicles in a commercial auto insurance policy.therefore,the issue is whether an individual who is a named insured may be limited to specified vehicles for purposes of coverage in a commercial auto insurance policy.
as far as we are aware,there is no oklahoma case precedent directly addressing this issue.nevertheless,the hartford asserts that the oklahoma supreme court ruling in graham travelers insurance,supports its argument that haberman may be denied um coverage because she was not riding in a covered vehicle.our review of graham,however,shows that the case is distinguishable from the present case.the record in this case also clearly shows that the policy did not tie haberman coverage to specified vehicles so that we conclude that haberman is entitled to um coverage based on the policy.
in graham,the oklahoma state supreme court addressed whether in a commercial insurance policy,coverage that is provided for vehicles owned by the named insured,must also be provided to employees using their own vehicles,which are limited by an endorsement to liability coverage id.at.the court began by examining the policy at issue in the case 
the policy included in the record has separate explanations for who is an insured for the liability coverage,and for the um coverage.the um coverage is in the form of an endorsement,which states in bold letters at the top this endorsement changes the policy.read it carefully.in a larger font,the next line reads oklahoma uninsured motorists coverage.under section b,who is an insured,the policy provides 
if you are an individual,any family member.
anyone else occupying a covered auto or a temporary substitute for a covered auto.the covered auto must be out of service because of its breakdown,repair,servicing,loss or destruction.
anyone for damages he or she is entitled to recover because of bodily injury sustained by another insured.
under an endorsement entitled employees as insureds the policy provides,the following is added to the liability coverage who is an insured provision.on the next line it adds,any employee of yours is an insured while using a covered auto you do own,hire or borrow in your business or your personal affairs.the business auto coverage part declarations page shows a covered auto symbol of for liability coverage.the limit of insurance is.symbol on the business auto coverage form indicates that any auto.
id.at.finding that the endorsements clearly show that cke the employer and travelers the insurance company intended coverage for vehicles owned by cke,the oklahoma state supreme court held that graham vehicle clearly was insured for liability and was not insured,under the provisions of the policy,for.id.at.
the court pointed out that graham,the plaintiff,was required by law to have liability coverage,and thus coverage,for his own vehicle 
cke liability policy for nonowned vehicles benefits the company since it insures cke for the negligent acts of its employees who are in the course of their employment.it has an indirect benefit to the employee,who must by law insure his own vehicle for liability.
at internal citations omitted.as a result,the court concluded that not finding coverage in that case did not violate oklahoma public policy interest in providing coverage.
here,haberman is a named insured by virtue of the named person endorsement.the plain words of the endorsement made haberman a named insured for all purposes,including coverage,since the endorsement modified the entire policy.the endorsement also did not limit haberman coverage to only liability for circumstances in the course of employment,unlike the endorsement in graham that was specifically limited to adding company employees to the company liability coverage while acting in the course of their employment.in addition,the endorsement in this case did not expressly limit haberman coverage to only covered vehicles,unlike the policy in graham.accordingly,the policy in this case provided coverage to haberman in her capacity as an individual,rather than only as an employee of breast cancer screening center of oklahoma.
moreover,the record indicates that both haberman and the hartford intended for the policy to provide coverage to haberman.the hartford knew that haberman is the sole principal of a closely held business.the hartford knew that the vehicles that haberman drives for her personal use were the same vehicles used by her closely held business,and that she did not have any separate automobile insurance.that is why the hartford insurance agent explained in a letter to haberman the second endorsement the named person s or organization s as insured endorsement adds you as an individually named insured to the automobile policy since you do not have an individual personal automobile policy.therefore,the policy in this case was designed to give a direct,rather than an indirect,benefit to haberman.
oklahoma courts have stated that a ny attempt to tie uninsured motorist coverage to automobiles alone,rather than to people,must fail.state farm mutual automobile ins.wendt,citing cothren emcasco insurance.see also mustain united states fidelity guaranty,pursuant to,um insurance is coverage that follows the person.footnotes omitted.the policy in this case provided coverage to haberman as an individual.given that the endorsement did not limit haberman coverage to liability or in the course of employment,and given that the endorsement did not limit coverage to only while riding in a covered vehicle,we conclude that haberman is entitled to coverage,even though she was not riding in a covered vehicle,as she would have in a personal policy in which she is a named insured.see graham at quoting moser liberty mutual ins,t he intent of the uninsured motorist legislation is to afford one insured under his own liability insurance policy the same protection in the event he is injured by an uninsured motorist as he would have had if the negligent motorist had carried liability insurance.
to be clear,our decision is based on the facts of this case the record shows that the parties intended for haberman to have coverage and,as noted above,the policy did not limit haberman coverage to liability and the endorsement did not specifically limit coverage only to while riding in a covered vehicle.we are,therefore,confident that oklahoma courts will not find our ruling today inimical to the state public policy on coverage.
the hartford also contends that the district court committed reversible error because the court allowed haberman to stack the um benefits.we find no merit to this claim of error.
as discussed above,haberman is a named insured in her capacity as an individual rather than as an employee.accordingly,she is a class,rather than a class,insured entitled to coverage.under oklahoma law,when separate premiums are charged for uninsured motorist coverage the benefits can be stacked.see withrow pickard,it is well settled in oklahoma that insureds may stack their um coverage for the additional vehicles under a policy if they have paid separate um premiums for each vehicle.the record in this case shows that two separate premiums of each were paid for the two automobiles listed in the policy.at.it was,therefore,not error for the district court to determine that haberman could stack um benefits.
bad faith claim 
the hartford contends that the district court erred by denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law on the bad faith issue and submitting that issue to the jury.because there is a legitimate dispute as to coverage,the hartford argues,there can not be bad faith.we are not persuaded.
this court reviews a district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo,applying the same standard as the district court and construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see greene safeway stores,cir.unless the evidence so overwhelmingly favors the movant as to permit no other rational conclusion,judgment as a matter of law is improper.id.citation omitted.under this standard,the evidence must be construed favorably against the hartford,the moving party.accordingly,we decide whether the evidence presented before the district court so overwhelmingly favors the hartford as to permit no other rational conclusion.
oklahoma courts have recognized an insured right to sue his or her insurer for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.in christian american home assur,the oklahoma supreme court stated we approve and adopt the rule that an insurer has an implied duty to deal fairly and act in good faith with its insured and that the violation of this duty gives rise to an action in tort for which consequential and,in a proper case,punitive,damages may be sought.the court in mccorkle great atlantic insurance,held 
t he essence of the intentional tort of bad faith with regard to the insurance industry is the insurer unreasonable,conduct,including the unjustified withholding of payment due under a policy,and if there is conflicting evidence from which different inferences may be drawn regarding the insurer conduct,then what is reasonable is always a question of fact to be determined by the trier of fact by a consideration of the circumstances in each case.
during the proceedings before the district court,haberman presented evidence suggesting that the hartford ignored the provisions of its own policy and ignored oklahoma law.haberman showed that the hartford denied her claims for uninsured motorist and medical pay benefits.the hartford delayed payment of haberman medical payments coverage until just weeks before trial.the hartford did not evaluate haberman claim until the third day of trial,and did not offer her any amount of money for her uninsured motorist claim.the hartford did not check to see if oklahoma law would permit tying the policy uninsured motorist coverage for an individually named insured to specific vehicles.these facts,construed most favorably against the hartford,can reasonably be perceived to be tortious.
these facts notwithstanding,the hartford asserts that it demonstrated a legitimate dispute as to coverage under the policy,making it error for the district court to deny its motion for summary judgment in support of this argument,the hartford cites narvaez state farm mutual auto.ins,okla,wherein one of the divisions of the oklahoma court of civil appeals stated t he general rule is that it is not bad faith for an insurer to resort to a judicial forum to settle legitimate disputes as to the validity or amount of an insurance claim.there can be disagreement between insurer and insured on a variety of matters such as insurable interest,extent of coverage,cause of loss,or breach of policy conditions.narvaez at.
however,this court has held that a legitimate dispute as to coverage will not act as an impenetrable shield against a valid claim of bad faith or unreasonable conduct.timberlake constr.fidelity guar,cir applying oklahoma law quoting oulds principal mut.life ins,cir.we stated in vining enterprise financial group,cir,that a plaintiff may bring a bad faith cause of action even though a legitimate defense to a breach of contract claim exists if the defendant did not actually rely on that defense to deny payment under the policy.the record shows that the dispute identified by the hartford in its motion for summary judgment,whether plaintiff was an insured under the policy for purposes of coverage was not the reason or justification the hartford provided to haberman for denying her request for benefits.the hartford denied haberman claim on the ground that she was not riding in a covered vehicle at the time of the accident.because the legitimate reason for denying haberman claim is different from the reason haberman was given,we conclude that the district court correctly denied the hartford motion for summary judgment on the bad faith claim.
the hartford next contends that there was insufficient evidence to submit the punitive damages issue to the jury and that,as a result,the district court committed reversible error by instructing the jury on punitive damages.
in oklahoma,punitive damages are allowable when there is evidence of reckless and wanton disregard of another rights from which malice and evil intent may be inferred.graham keuchel,citing mitchell ford motor credit.and malice may be shown by an indifference to or conscious disregard of the rights of another,justifying an award of punitive damages.alsobrook national travelers life ins.in state ex rel.pollution control coordinating board kerr mcgee,the oklahoma supreme court ruled that whether a defendant conduct was sufficiently reckless to merit punishment by an award of punitive damages is a jury question.according to the court,where it is impossible to say from a reading of the record there was no evidence reasonably tending to support an inference of gross negligence,it is proper for the trial court to submit the punitive damage question to the jury.only when there is no evidence whatsoever that would give rise to an inference of malice or conduct deemed equivalent to malice may the trial court refuse to submit an exemplary damage instruction to the jury.id.
reading the record in this case,we can not conclude that there is no evidence whatsoever that could give rise to an inference of malice.haberman presented evidence suggesting that the hartford ignored the provisions of its own policy and ignored oklahoma law.haberman argued that although the hartford knew its insured suffered a serious injury and would have a substantial lost wages claim,the hartford denied the claim.the hartford delayed payment of haberman medical payments coverage until just weeks before trial.and haberman asserted that the hartford did not check to see if oklahoma law would permit tying the policy uninsured motorist coverage for an individually named insured to specific vehicles.these facts could give rise to an inference of the hartford was indifferent to,or consciously disregarded,haberman rights.it was,therefore,proper for the district court to submit the issue to the jury.
due process claim 
finally,the hartford contends that the punitive damages award of is grossly excessive and violates its due process rights under the supreme court holdings in bmw of north america,gore,d,and state farm mutual auto.campbell,d.we are not persuaded.
the supreme court instructs us to use three guideposts in reviewing whether a punitive damages award is grossly excessive the degree of reprehensibility of defendant misconduct the disparity between the harm or potential harm suffered and the punitive damages award and the difference between the punitive damages award and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.see bmw at see also state farm at.in its brief to this court,the hartford does not argue that the punitive damages award of is grossly excessive on the basis of any of
