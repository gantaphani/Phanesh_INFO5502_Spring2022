plaintiff,charter township of muskegon,appeals from the district court order entered on november,denying its motion for relief from judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b,and sua sponte dismissing in its entirety this action brought against defendant,the city of muskegon,for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the district court order as to the lack of subject matter jurisdiction,and remand the case to the district court for a hearing on the merits of plaintiff rule b motion.
background 
in,the charter township of muskegon,michigan the township issued revenue bonds to finance the construction of the muskegon township water distribution system.the township went into default,and in,certain bondholders filed a diversity action in the united states district court for the western district of michigan in order to protect their interests.the case was docketed as.both the township and the city of muskegon,michigan the city were named as defendants.
a trial was held in.excerpts from the proceedings over which district judge wallace kent presided indicated that the parties were seeking to reach a settlement and that it was understood that the decree settlement may include a provision that upon retirement of all the bonds and upon payment of all the bonds and upon payment of all the other obligations of the township system,that the township system will then become merged into and become part of the water system of the city of muskegon.at.significant to the matter at hand,the excerpts from the proceedings also indicate that the following colloquy took place 
the court frederick,did you have something to say 
the court yes,existing bond issue.
frederick there may be more issued in the future,and this could go on for ever and ever.
the court everything as to the bond issue,reference is made to that which is the subject of the lawsuit and no other bond issue.and no obligations except those required in order to remedy the default,except as the income of,no,i think we can leave it right there,because from then on you are the operators.so when those obligations are liquidated,then the system becomes part of the city system.it is merged into it.
knudson okay,they take over the assets and liabilities.
the court liabilities and everything it all becomes part of the city system.
on june,judgment was entered by judge kent.the judgment,which provided a method for ensuring that the bonds would be paid,resulted from efforts by the township and the city to reach a settlement.the judgment ordered the city to assume operation of the water system in the capacity of trustee and to loan sufficient funds to the water system to cure any default in its bonded obligations.paragraphs and of the judgment are relevant to this case and provide,respectively,that 
t he rates and charges of the township customers shall become uniform with the rates and charges throughout the city when all the outstanding bonds have been fully paid for the existing bond issue and the city has been fully reimbursed of any monies it may have obliged to loan to the muskegon township water distribution system.
the city trusteeship and its obligation to maintain books and records shall continue until all existing bond and other obligations of the system,including obligations due the city,are paid in full,at which time title to the said muskegon township water distribution system and any future extensions thereto shall vest in the city of muskegon and shall be merged into the city water system.rates and charges shall thereafter be uniform throughout the city and township except where a differential is justified as hereinbefore provided.
at emphasis added.
the city made its final payment on the bonds in may of.at that point,all debts and obligations existing in were paid in full,and according to the city,it automatically acquired title to the system at that time.in a june,letter from the city to the township,the parties attempted to negotiate a new water service agreement.in the interim,the arrangement that was in place prior to the last bond payment by the city was continued.then,on august,after no agreement could be reached,the city gave notice to the township that effective september,it would assume ownership and operation of the water system in accordance with the judgment.the township responded by filing a rule b motion in district court under the case number to enjoin the city from assuming ownership.the motion was,however,docketed by the clerk as a new case and given a new case number.
on october,a hearing was held by the district court,judge bell,presiding,regarding the township request for injunctive relief.the court sua sponte expressed concern regarding its jurisdiction given that the bondholders were no longer parties to the action,and neither diversity jurisdiction nor federal question jurisdiction appeared to be present.the court instructed the parties to brief the issue,and took the matter under advisement.thereafter,on november,the district court entered an opinion and an order wherein the court ruled that the prior judgment vesting title of the muskegon township water distribution system must stand,that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the present controversy of rate setting,and that the parties should seek redress in the appropriate state forum on those issues.at.
in dicta,the district court determined that even if it did have jurisdiction over the matter,it would deny the township the relief that it was seeking.the court began by noting that the township was seeking to revisit the judgment under federal rule civil procedure b,which allows a court to relieve a party from a final judgment when the judgment has been satisfied,released,or discharged,or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.at.the court noted that any motion brought under this rule must be made within a reasonable time,and that the township motion some years after judgment was entered was not within a reasonable time,nor did the judgment rise to the level of inequity necessary for the court to revisit it.at.the district court opined that 
t he township seems to want to have its cake and eat it,too.having struck a bargain with the city in to save the township from financial default,it now wishes to retain the city benefit of the bargain.in dismissing the current case,this court allows the township to pursue its aims in the appropriate courts of the state of michigan,while at the same time ruling that the judgment stands.
a court should engage in consideration of the equities of the judgment only under circumstances when the judgment involves prospective obligations and effects requiring ongoing court supervision or execution.the judgment in this case does not involve prospective obligations,nor does it require ongoing court supervision.the judgment was fully executed in when the original bondholders were repaid,and title to the water system vested in the city.further arbitration contemplated by the judgment concerning rates can be done through the appropriate state forum.

the township filed the instant appeal from the district court order,and also moved before this court for injunctive relief pending appeal.in so moving,the township requested that the city be enjoined from taking any action to assume or exert ownership of township water distribution system,including setting water rates for township residents taking control of the assets of the system making any decisions associated with connections and expansions to the system without the township approval taking any action that would affect the township rights in the system including retiring the remaining outstanding obligations of the system and violating any other term of the judgment.in an order filed on january,this court denied the township motion for an injunction pending appeal,finding that the test used to determine whether an injunction should issue did not weigh in favor of the township request.
the township appeal is now before the court,wherein the township argues that the sole issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the township case.the township contends that because the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter,the court improperly ruled,albeit in dicta,upon the merits of the township request for relief from judgment.as a result,the township urges this court to reverse the district court decision holding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction,and remand the case for a hearing on the township claim for relief from judgment under rule b.

district court opinion 
the district court recognized that for purposes of federal court jurisdiction,diversity of citizenship is determined at the time that the action is commenced,and that subsequent changes in citizenship can not serve to divest the court jurisdiction over the matter.despite this rule of law,the district court found that it did not have jurisdiction over the matter at hand because it viewed the township actions here as a new suit.the court noted the two parties present in this suit were the defendants in the original suit,and that the subject matter of the instant claim was different from that in the original suit inasmuch as the original suit involved the protection of the bondholder rights while the matter at hand involves the ownership of the water system.
in finding that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the matter,the district court first considered the township claim that under the terms of the judgment,title to the water system would not vest in the city until all financial obligations incurred in the course of managing the system were paid,including the debt incurred as a result of the extension.after examining paragraphs seven and twelve of the judgment,and after considering the parties colloquies with judge kent,the district court found it clear that the intent of the court and the parties was that at the date the original bonds were paid off,the entire system,including any new bond obligations,would transfer to the city.according to the district court,given the fact that the judgment was,title to the water system had vested in the city and was not open to further discussion.
the district court therefore concluded that because the township request for relief was,in effect,a new action in which neither diversity jurisdiction nor federal question jurisdiction was present,subject matter jurisdiction was lacking.specifically,the court opined 
it is true,as the township points out,that diversity jurisdiction is determined at the time the action is commenced,and that subsequent changes in state citizenship will not affect the diversity of that action.here,however,the township has filed what can only be called a new action.two of the original parties are in the present suit,but they were defendants in the original suit.the subject matter is different as well.in the original suit,the issue was the protection of the rights of the bondholders.the ownership of the water system was only ancillary to that.here,the township is bringing suit making the ownership of the water system the primary reason to bring the suit.yet ownership of the system was settled by the court order and agreement of the parties years ago.were this court to revisit the matter in the absence of a clear rule b sic mandate,it would throw open the courthouse door to challenge any order of a court at any time.
at.the district court then noted that precedent from the seventh circuit existed to support the conclusion that jurisdiction does not exist over a consent judgment where the grounds for federal jurisdiction have been abrogated.quoting evans city of chicago,cir,the district court opined that principles of respect for a coordinate sovereign and in some cases the eleventh amendment mean that federal courts should refrain from adjudicating claims under state law,whether raised directly or whether used as the springboards for other theories.at.the court found that the grounds for federal subject matter jurisdiction had vanished in this case,reasoning that a part from the consent judgment there is neither diversity nor federal question jurisdiction.what remains is a local disagreement that on the face of the pleadings must turn to state law for succor.at.relying on pennhurst state school hospital halderman,d,the court concluded that it could not interfere with what was a purely local disagreement between two state bodies.
rule b and the relevant jurisprudence 
frederick sir,going back to your last statement on the city assumption of the ownership of the system,should we have the words,existing bond issue.
the general purpose of rule b is to strike a proper balance between the conflicting principles that litigation must be brought to an end and that justice must be done.coltec,hobgood,cir quoting boughner sec y of health,educ.welfare,cir.rule b provides in relevant part 
on motion and upon such terms as are just,the court may relieve a party or a party legal representative from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for the following reasons the judgment has been satisfied,released,or discharged,or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated,or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application the motion shall be made within a reasonable time,and for reasons,and,not more than one year after the judgment,order,or proceeding was entered or taken.a motion under this subsection b does not affect the finality of judgment or suspend its operation.this rule does not limit the power of a court to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from judgment,order,or proceeding writs of coram nobis,coram vobis,audita querela,and bills of review and bills in the nature of a bill of review,are abolished,and the procedure for obtaining any relief from a judgment shall be by motion as prescribed in these rules or by an independent action.
b.the amendment to the rule as the language currently reads made clear that nearly all of the old forms of obtaining relief from a judgment,coram nobis,coram vobism,audita querela,bills of review,and bills in the nature of review,had been abolished.the revision made equally clear,however,that one of the old forms,the independent action,still survived.united states beggerly,d footnote omitted.the advisory committee notes illustrate the survival of the independent action in the amendment.see id.specifically,the advisory committee notes state that i f the right to make a motion is lost by the expiration of the time limits fixed in these rules,the only other procedural remedy is by a new or independent action to set aside a judgment upon those principles which have heretofore been applied in such an action.see id.quoting advisory committee notes on amt.to fed.rule civ.
the beggerly court further expounded on the independent action,as continued to be permitted under the amended rule,by relying on the case of pacific railroad of missouri missouri pacific railway,which the advisory committee cited as an example of such a cause.see beggerly,at.the beggerly court opined 
one case that exemplifies the category of independent action is pacific of missouri pacific.
in pacific the underlying suit had resulted in a decree foreclosing a mortgage on railroad property and ordering its sale.this court enforced the decree and shortly thereafter the railroad company whose property had been foreclosed filed a bill to impeach for fraud the foreclosure decree that had been affirmed.the bill alleged that the plaintiff in the underlying suit had conspired with the attorney and directors of the plaintiff in the subsequent suit to ensure that the property would be forfeited.the plaintiff in the subsequent suit was a missouri corporation,and it named several missouri citizens as defendants in its bill seeking relief from the prior judgment.
when the matter reached this court,we rejected the contention that the federal courts had no jurisdic
