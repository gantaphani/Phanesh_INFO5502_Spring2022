a movie production company hires an executive to look for projects,with the movie production company having the right of first refusal as to any projects the executive finds.the producer is housed in the movie production offices and has all of the trappings of an executive producer of the company.when the producer finds investors for a movie,he promises millions in profits and then proceeds to fraudulently convert over a million dollars from those investors.
at trial,the movie production company disavows the executive producer actions and claims he was an independent producer.the jury finds he was an agent and awards damages for moneys invested and lost in addition to lost profits and punitive damages.on this appeal the fraud of the producer is not disputed,but agency and lost profits are.
we reverse that portion of the judgment awarding damages for lost profits and remand for a new hearing on the issue of the amount of punitive damages.
the appellants in this action are itc entertainment group,itc entertainment group and itc distribution,itc.respondents are streetscenes and crewcast respondents the principals of streetscenes and crewcast are martin chernoff chernoff,neil feinstein feinstein and ron hunt hunt.the other party to this action was travis clark clark.a default judgment was obtained as to clark.in may,clark was hired by itc to share,create ideas and develop projects.clark was brought aboard at itc by itc president jules haimovitz who had previously worked with clark at spelling entertainment.
hunt,feinstein and chernoff had been business partners for over years.feinstein had financed a low budget film in the past,but in that case he had been a passive investor.hunt had written a screenplay entitled wrong decision which was based upon his experiences as a manager and then owner of a nightclub.hunt recalled having met clark and recalled clark was somehow involved in the movie industry.hunt decided to submit his script to clark whom hunt knew was now at itc.after clark read the script,hunt and clark talked.clark then told hunt the script had serious potential and that itc was interested in making a movie for distribution.
clark represented himself to be an executive producer at itc and stated that itc would produce and distribute the movie.clark also faxed to respondents,on itc fax machine,with an itc cover sheet,his resume and biographical information.the resume specified clark had completed a motion picture and was an executive producer at film entertainment.
in july,clark flew to washington,at hunt expense to meet with hunt and keith rosenburg rosenburg,who was respondents transactional attorney.at the meeting in rosenburg office,clark claimed he was an executive producer for itc and,through his position at itc,he was to produce the film which itc would distribute.
clark represented the film would focus on the market and should do very well in video and cable.clark also told others,at a lunch meeting,that he was an executive producer with a very large hollywood company called itc and that itc had deep seated connections in the distribution of movies,especially in the inner cities.he further explained that with itc extensive distribution systems and a sound track with recording artists,the low budget movie should make a profit of to million.
in a letter,on itc distribution letterhead,dated july,clark confirmed itc agreement for guaranteed distribution for the intended film presently entitled wrong decision.clark also wrote,itc and i are looking forward to distributing this project.itc,through clark,then guaranteed two additional projects for plaintiffs following the completion of wrong decision.
on or about july,clark sent rosenburg a letter on itc distribution letterhead along with itc detailed financial projections for the movie.the projections were also on itc distribution letterhead and were sent from itc fax machine.the projections were in part based upon industry publications and estimates from itc people.projections of this type were normally provided by itc chief operating officer,mike novelly 
the projections were detailed and included home video revenues of between to,of between to,cable revenue of between to,and basic cable of between to.syndication was estimated at being between to,and foreign theatrical revenue was estimated at between to.
clark further represented the film would be a theatrical release,with itc calculated theater revenue of between to million.clark further promised he would complete the film for approximately.
itc provided clark with all of the accoutrements of an itc executive.he was housed in an executive office on the same floor as itc president,vice president,general counsel and other senior executives.additionally,itc provided clark with itc letterhead,fax cover sheets,use of itc telephone,fax machines,mail room and other resources for the purpose of completing projects for itc.also,clark was provided embossed business cards with the itc logo,identifying him as an executive producer for itc.these were displayed prominently on clark desk.one visiting clark at the itc offices would come away with the impression that clark was a very heavy hitter at itc.
there were other independent production companies,such as american zoetrope,located in the itc suites.these companies had separate signage and their own telephone numbers.separate signage typically distinguished independent film producers.there was no separate signage indicating clark was any different from any other itc executive or that he was an independent producer.
clark written promises of itc production and distribution,combined with the detailed and very promising itc revenue projections,convinced respondents to enter into a production agreement.clark also promised,on itc behalf,a soundtrack with recording artists such as stevie wonder and george clinton.
a meeting was held in clark office,where clark suggested feinstein,hunt and chernoff should form a production company to handle film financing.as a result,streetscenes,to handle the production,and crewcast,to handle the payments to the crew,were formed.respondents then started putting money into the project.clark was in control of the money and was to be paid a producers fee.clark represented this was standard practice for itc films.
in april,which lasted several weeks,commenced at the itc offices.clark hired the director and music director and told them both that he was doing the film for itc,which was also to be the distributor.clark also hired the film accountant who prepared credit applications for equipment rental and other forms using itc name and address.
casting and rehearsals took place in itc conference room.a great deal of activity was occurring in the itc offices,in full view of other itc executives and there was a buzz at itc about the film.during this same period of time clark and others began to rewrite the script.
once the film production started,costs began to spiral out of control and the budget was never finalized.what had been a production soon escalated to million.clark deposited some of the money into his own personal banking account and even forged the name of the music director.at one point,while the film was being shot in washington,clark left for about four or five days while he went to vancouver,canada to work on another itc project.this had the effect of leaving the film production floundering.during this same period of time clark kept asking respondents for more money,referring back to the itc projections,if respondents balked.he also provided bogus updates on the sound track that was in development by stevie wonder or other big names.
when respondents began to want explanations for the cost overruns,they asked to see the dailies.clark would not oblige.when they were finally allowed to see the movie,it was of such poor quality that they became concerned the whole thing was a scam.clark,however,continued to emphasize the film potential revenue and his belief the film could be saved.respondents began to investigate the circumstances surrounding the making of the film and soon discovered numerous bills had not been paid.in fact,they were sued by various vendor
