this case,which spans a period,has been the subject of two previous appeals to this court.see micro,great plains chem,nonobviousness micro,great plains chem,infringement.the present appeal involves only damages.the united states district court for the district of colorado granted summary judgment denying micro chemical,lost profits.the district court then conducted a bench trial to determine the proper reasonable royalty for lextron,infringement of micro patent patent.micro seeks review of the district court judgment denying it lost profits and granting a reasonable royalty of only one percent.additionally,micro requests reassignment to a different judge should this case be remanded to the district court.
because lextron type machine was not an available substitute,the district court erred in holding,on summary judgment,that micro was not entitled to lost profits.therefore,this court also vacates the reasonable royalty determination.this court denies micro request for a different judge on remand.
background 
animal feedlots generally add microingredients to livestock and poultry feed.microingredients are feed additives,such as vitamins,antibiotics,hormones,medicines,and nutritional supplements,that provide a balanced diet,stimulate growth,and protect the animals from disease.one method of adding microingredients to livestock and poultry feed involves mixing dry supplements that contain microingredients into the feed.alternatively,feedlots may spread dry microingredients directly on top of the feed in the trough called top dressing.both methods have some disadvantages in that they do not ensure uniform,accurate dosages,and they limit the feedlot flexibility to alter dosages.
microingredient dispensing machines overcame some of those problems.these machines measure and dispense microingredients by mixing them into a liquid carrier that is sprayed over livestock and poultry feed rations.one example of such a machine measures and dispenses microingredients by volume.micro patent claims a machine that dispenses microingredients by weight.weigh machines measure microingredients by weight before mixing them into the liquid carrier.this technology improved on the prior volume machine technology.
micro and lextron both produce microingredient weigh machines.they place their weigh machines in feedlots at no cost to the feedlots.they recoup their expenses by selling microingredients to the feedlots at an eight to premium.although not required by contract to do so,feedlots generally purchase their premium the company that placed its machine on the feedlot.in the liability phase of this case,this court held that lextron type weigh machine infringed the patent.lextron used primarily the infringing type machine during the infringement period,to.after micro sued lextron in,lextron developed its type no mix weigh machine.the type machine had clumping problems that limited its commercial use.by,there was only one type machine still in use.after this court opinion issued,lextron began modifying its existing type machines into a new type weigh machine.
during the damages phase,micro sought recovery under both lost profits and reasonable royalty theories.on summary judgment,the district court held that micro was not entitled to lost profits under either the or the panduit test.trial proceeded on a reasonable royalty damage theory,and the court awarded micro a royalty of one percent on lextron microingredient sales.micro appealed to this court,which has jurisdiction under a.

this court reviews without deference a district court grant of summary judgment,reapplying the same standard as the district court.cortland line orvis.thus,this court decides for itself whether the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in so doing,this court draws all reasonable factual inferences in favor of the.anderson liberty lobby,d.

the requested reassignment to a different trial judge on remand invokes a matter not within the exclusive jurisdiction of this court.therefore,on this question,this court applies the law of the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit.see glaxo,novopharm,atari,js a group,uspq,en banc.the tenth circuit will reassign a different judge on remand only when there is proof of personal bias or under extreme circumstances showing that reassignment best serves the interests of justice.mitchell maynard,cir.

the district court found that micro could not satisfy two of the four panduit factors demand for the patented product and absence of available,noninfringing substitutes.see panduit stahlin.fibre works,cir.specifically,the court found that lextron type weigh machine was an available,noninfringing substitute,and that there was no demand for micro patented weigh machines.
the district court deemed the type machine available under grain processing american.in grain processing,this court reaffirmed its earlier precedent stating that a technology not on the market at the time of infringement can,in certain circumstances,constitute an available,noninfringing alternative.id.at.grain processing did not erect a rigid test for determining availability.rather,it provided guidelines for when an alternative not actually on sale during the infringement period may have been readily available and thus part of the economic calculation of lost profits.
in grain processing,for example,the material and for the alleged substitute were readily available at the time of infringement.id.at.according to the record in that case,the infringer had all of the necessary equipment,and experience to make the substitution at that time.id.therefore,the infringer was able to convert to the substitute manufacturing process in the remarkably short period of two weeks.id.at.in grain processing,even the ready availability of material and alone did not make the substitute process available for the lost profits calculus.this court also weighed the fact that the high cost of a necessary material can conceivably render a substitute unavailable.id.similarly,this court noted that the finding that an infringer had to design or invent around the patented technology to develop an alleged substitute weighs against a finding of availability.id.in sum,this court in grain processing weighed the factors that would show the substitute effect on the market.
in this case,the record evidence does not support the district court grant of summary judgment on the availability of the lextron type machine.the record shows that lextron did not have the necessary equipment,and experience to make the type machine at the time of infringement.lextron expended hours to design the type machine and another to test it.charles hoff,a lextron engineer,worked for several months on the design of the type machine.thereafter,he continued to work on the project,estimating th
