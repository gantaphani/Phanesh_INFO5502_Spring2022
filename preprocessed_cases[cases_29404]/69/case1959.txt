in the,the citizens of san bernardino county fell victim to a political corruption scandal involving their county officials.james hlawek,the county chief administrative officer,and other officials accepted bribes and kickbacks from contractors in return for using their official positions to assist the contractors in obtaining profitable contracts from the county.several county officials and businessmen were indicted in on federal bribery charges,and the instant civil action was filed by the county in an effort to recover damages suffered as a result of the bribery.
this appeal covers two of the bribery schemes alleged in the civil action.in one scheme,appellants harry mays,kenneth james walsh,and technologies,bribed hlawek to obtain approval of a solid waste management contract with the county.in the other scheme,appellants william mccook and oakridge group corporation bribed hlawek to obtain approval of a billboard lease from the county.hlawek,mays,and walsh were convicted of criminal bribery charges,but mccook was acquitted.except for hlawek involvement,the two bribery schemes are factually unrelated.
the county obtained a money judgment against both and who filed separate appeals.both appeals focus on issues of compensatory and punitive damages.contend the trial court erred by awarding unjust enrichment damages to the county that required them to disgorge the profits from their bribes.they also contend the punitive damages awards were excessive.similarly,contend the trial court erred by awarding damages to the county that required them to disgorge the profits realized by the assignment of the billboard lease to a third party.we conclude that the trial court remedy on both appeals was supported by the evidence and the law.accordingly,we affirm the judgment as to and.
in addition,the county filed a separate appeal of a pretrial order granting summary adjudication of certain claims against.because our affirmance of the judgment provides the county the relief it prayed for in its complaint,the county appeal is moot and we do not consider the issues raised therein.
waste management contractfacts 
the san bernardino county administrative officer cao is the principal administrative officer of the county.the cao advises the county board of supervisors,recommends specific determinations by the board,sets the board agenda,and administers board decisions.harry mays served as cao from to.james hlawek succeeded mays and served as cao from july to september.before hlawek became cao,mays learned that hlawek had a criminal record arising from prior employment by the irs.on advice from mays,hlawek concealed his criminal record from county officials.
in,norcal waste systems,norcal entered into a contract to provide waste management services for the county.walsh,a of norcal,was in charge of norcal operations.in,norcal,acting through walsh,began negotiating a new contract which would increase norcal duties and control over the county waste disposal system,and result in an increase in county annual payments to norcal from approximately million to more than million.
in september,shortly after his retirement as cao,mays entered into a consulting agreement with norcal to assist norcal in obtaining county approval of the new waste management contract.in the same month,mays and walsh agreed to bribe hlawek to secure hlawek influence on their and norcal behalf.in october,walsh set up queue corporation as a conduit for bribes.mays would transfer money received from norcal into queue and another walsh company,and those companies would use the money to pay bribes to hlawek.
after september,and hlawek arranged for further personal financial gain from the new norcal contract.mays negotiated a more lucrative consulting agreement with norcal in january.the revised contract provided that mays and technologies,bio,a company controlled by mays,would receive a million fee when the county approved the norcal contract,plus additional payments if norcal revenue was further increased through the issuance of bonds to finance landfill closures.mays agreed to split bio fees with walsh.
during,hlawek used his authority and influence as chairperson of the county negotiating committee to obtain county approval of the norcal contract.among other things,hlawek convinced the county to award the contract without competitive bidding.the county approved the norcal contract on september.
from to,the county paid norcal more than million.during the same period,norcal paid million to mays and bio under their consulting agreement and bio,in turn,paid more than million to queue and walsh other company.mays and walsh made more than in bribery payments to hlawek.
in addition,hlawek urged the county to give norcal extra trust account work for additional compensation and to do so without competitive bidding.hlawek also influenced the county to hire daniel hernandez trucking as a subcontractor because walsh was getting kickbacks from hernandez which ultimately totaled.
in april,the county,acting as the inland empire solid waste financing authority,approved a million bond offering to finance the closure of county landfills.based on a promise of more bribes from,hlawek selected miller schroeder m s as bond underwriter.mays received from m s and additional compensation from norcal for his efforts in convincing the board of supervisors to authorize the issuance of bonds.
in,federal authorities started a criminal investigation of the bribery scheme.until then,the county was unaware of any bribery or other misconduct by and hlawek.in late and,hlawek,mays,and walsh pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery.in,walsh and mays were sentenced to and prison terms,respectively.
in june,the county filed its civil complaint against,hlawek,m s,norcal,and others alleging a variety of claims.norcal and m s settled before trial.norcal settlement included a million payment to the county and cancellation of its contract.
in february,the county filed an amended complaint.after a bench trial in june and july,the trial court issued a detailed statement of decision ruling that hlawek and were jointly and severally liable for breaching or inducing a breach of hlawek fiduciary duty,fraud,unfair competition,and unjust enrichment.on the claims other than unfair competition,the court awarded damages of,comprised of hlawek salary,direct bribes by to hlawek,hernandez kickbacks,and most of mays consulting fees from norcal.after a bifurcated bench trial,the trial court assessed million in punitive damages against mays,and in punitive damages against walsh on the breach of fiduciary and fraud causes of action.
discussion 
substantial evidence supports liability 
contend that there is no evidence to support liability.they argue that county approval of the norcal contract was inevitable when the bribery scheme began,and that the bribery scheme should be disregarded because the contract was a good bargain for the county.we disagree.
we review a challenge to the trial court factual findings under the substantial evidence test.foreman clark fallon cal d,sfpp,burlington northern santa fe ry.th,d.we presume the record contains evidence sufficient to support the judgment,consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment,and resolve all conflicts in favor of the judgment.sfpp,supra,at,d.
substantial evidence supports the finding that mays or walsh began bribing hlawek before the september approval of the norcal contract or any county action that made approval inevitable.bribery payments by started in,walsh created queue corporation to launder bribery money in,and hlawek efforts to convince the county to approve the contract also began long before the contract was approved.plea agreements signed by mays and walsh regarding their criminal bribery convictions include factual admissions which permitted,and virtually required,the trial court to make these factual findings.we reject the argument that the plea agreements are inadmissible or should be discounted in any manner.see teitelbaum furs,dominion ins.cal d.there was also testimony by hlawek,mays,walsh,and county officials which support the admissions in the plea agreements and otherwise support the trial court findings.additional evidence shows that the bribery scheme continued well into when bribes were made to increase the scope of work under the norcal contract.
we also reject the argument that the county suffered no damages because the expanded waste disposal contract with norcal was a good bargain for the county.apart from agreeing with the county that there is no such thing as harmless bribery or honest graft,there is substantial evidence to support the conclusion that the county lost millions of dollars.norcal compensation increased from million per year under the contract to more than million per year under the contract and,between and,the county paid norcal more than million including over million that ended up in the pockets of.
damages properly based on unjust enrichment 
the essence of the position is that the county did not incur any damage from the bribery scheme because the county money was not used to pay the bribes.although the evidence shows that the county suffered a monetary loss,the trial court damage award was not based on a computation of that loss.instead,the court applied the principle of unjust enrichment to require to disgorge the gains they received in the bribery scheme.in substance,are contending that the trial court applied an improper theory of damages.we conclude that the evidence and law support the trial court and warrant a damage award based on disgorgement of the amounts by which were unjustly enriched.
unjust enrichment is an equitable principle that underlies various legal doctrines and remedies.dinosaur development,white d.it is based on the idea that one person should not be permitted unjustly to enrich himself at the expense of another,but should be required to make restitution of or for property or benefits received,retained,or appropriated,where it is just and equitable that such restitution be made,and where such action involves no violation or frustration of law or opposition to public policy,either directly or indirectly.see also ghirardo antonioli cal th,d,melchior new line productions,th,d,restitution.
typically,the defendant benefit and the plaintiff loss are the same,and restitution requires the defendant to restore plaintiff to his or her original position.dunkin boskey th,d unilogic,burroughs th,d.the principle of unjust enrichment,however,is broader than mere restoration of what the plaintiff lost.many instances of liability based on unjust enrichment do not involve the restoration of anything the claimant previously possessed includ ing cases involving the disgorgement of profits wrongfully obtained rest d restitution and unjust enrichment discussion draft,com.t he public policy of this state does not permit one to take advantage of his own wrong regardless of whether the other party suffers actual damage.ward taggart cal d.where a benefit has been received by the defendant but the plaintiff has not suffered a corresponding loss or,in some cases,any loss,but nevertheless the enrichment of the defendant would be unjust t he defendant may be under a duty to give to the plaintiff the amount by which the defendant has been enriched,restitution,com.
i t is not essential that money be paid directly to the recipient by the party seeking restitution shersher superior court th,d hirsch bank of america th,d county of solano vallejo redevelopment agency th,d.the emphasis is on the wrongdoer enrichment,not the victim loss.in particular,a person acting in conscious disregard of the rights of another should be required to disgorge all profit because disgorgement both benefits the injured parties and deters the perpetrator from committing the same unlawful actions again.ward taggart,supra,cal d at,california levi strauss cal d.disgorgement may include a restitutionary element,but it may compel a defendant to surrender all money obtained through an unfair business practice regardless of whether those profits represent money taken directly from persons who were victims of the unfair practice.korea supply lockheed martin cal th,d.without this result,there would be an insufficient deterrent to improper conduct that is more profitable than lawful conduct.
disgorgement of profits is particularly applicable in cases dealing with breach of a fiduciary duty,and is a logical extension of the principle that public officials and other fiduciaries can not profit by a breach of their duty.where a person profits from transactions conducted by him as a fiduciary,the proper measure of damages is full disgorgement of any secret profit made by the fiduciary regardless of whether the principal suffers any damage.ward taggart,supra,cal d at,see also,restitution,see also cal pak delivery,united parcel service,th,d attorney who offered to sell out his clients for money should not receive any amount as an attorney fee when such action is inconsistent with the character of the profession,and incompatible with the faithful discharge of its duties.
here,hlawek and mays were government officials with a fiduciary duty to the county and,although walsh was a norcal official,liability extends both to the holder of the fiduciary duty and to others who are active participants in a breach of such duty.city of atascadero merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,th,fn,d pierce lyman th,d.active participants in the breach of fiduciary duty by another are accountable for all advantages they gained thereby and are liable to the beneficiary of the duty without reference to the amount of the fruits of the fraudulent transaction he personally obtains,restitution.
in this case,were actively involved in corruption which undermined good government and the proper use of public money for the benefit of the people government serves.the judgment against takes back the money they reaped from their personal fraud and dishonesty.it awarded to the county that which was rightfully the county.this result is both equitable and vindicates a public policy that wrongdoers must give up the money they wrongfully obtain in dealing with the government.although norcal wrote the checks to mays and bio,norcal received the money from the county in performing the contract.the county was the source of the money received by and it can fairly be said that the entire bribery scheme was at the expense of the county and its residents.
no error in ruling on setoffs 
contend that they are entitled to,but did not receive,a setoff against their judgment for amounts paid in settlement by norcal and other parties.code civ.we disagree,and conclude that the trial court made the setoffs necessary to avoid a double recovery.
code of civil procedure section,subdivision a is designed to provide for equitable sharing of damages,and assure that a plaintiff will not be enriched unjustly by a double recovery,collecting part of his total claim from one joint tortfeasor and all of his claim from another.reed wilson th,d.we review a ruling granting or denying offsets under the deferential abuse of discretion standard,and conclude there was no abuse of discretion.erreca superior court th,d may miller d.
the trial court expressly found that the damage awards against the appellants represented their proportionate share of liability,reflected a setoff for the amounts paid in settlement by norcal,m s and others,and would not result in any double recovery.in particular,the court found that norcal received more than million in profits.the court set off the norcal settlement and the m s settlement against this million,leaving total damages well in excess of the judgment against.ignoring the trial court factual findings,essentially argue that the norcal and m s settlements constitute the total amount of damages to the county.
award of punitive damages proper 
contend that the evidence of their financial condition is insufficient to support the punitive damages awards.they argue that there was no evidence or adequate findings of their financial condition at the time of trial,and that the million and awards will financially destroy both men.we disagree.
the essential question in determining a punitive damages award is whether the amount of the award substantially serves the societal interest in punishing the wrongdoer and deterring similar misconduct.in answering the question,courts consider the reprehensibility of the defendant conduct,the relationship between the punitive damage award and the harm done,and the amount of the punitive damage award in proportion to the defendant wealth.adams murakami cal d,neal farmers ins.exchange cal d.
under california law,we review a trial court determination of punitive damages under the substantial evidence standard baxter peterson th,d.we will reverse the trier of fact only if the award is so excessive as to raise a presumption it was the result of passion or prejudice.neal farmers ins.exchange,supra,cal d at,las palmas associates las palmas center associates d,d.we conclude that the trial court award of punitive damages is supported by substantial evidence of all three critical factors.
the bribery scheme was reprehensible.they bribed a county cao.their criminal conduct did not involve a single act but,rather,a pattern of deceit in a and complex scheme that required continuous manipulation of the county over an extended period of time.the misconduct also caused injury that extended beyond the dollar amounts involved.the wrongdoing was political corruption and the injury was to the people of san bernardino county.attack on fundamental governmental processes undermines public confidence in government,and the ability of the county to serve its residents.
the argument,however,focuses on the claim that mays and walsh lack the financial resources to pay any punitive damage award.as they argue,a punitive damage award that is reasonable in light of the reprehensibility and injury factors may be so disproportionate to the defendant ability to pay that the award is excessive.adams murakami,supra,cal d at.an award can not exceed the level necessary to properly punish and deter,at,quoting neal farmers ins.exchange,supra,cal d at.
moreover,a defendant ability to pay a punitive damage award must be based on meaningful and substantial evidence of his or her financial condition.adams murakami,supra,cal d at,lara cadag th,d.a defendant net worth is the critical determinant of financial condition,but there is no rigid formula and other factors may be dispositive especially when net worth is manipulated and fails to reflect actual wealth.see adams,at,kenly ukegawa th,d.the purpose of punitive damages is not served by financially destroying a defendant.the purpose is to deter,not to destroy.adams,at.in all cases,the plaintiff has the burden of proving the financial condition of the defendant.adams,at.
here,the trial court found that both mays and walsh had systematically and deceitfully manipulated and concealed their gains and their net worth,and provided knowingly false testimony at trial concerning the extent of the wealth they obtained from the bribery scheme.despite some success in this concealment,substantial evidence supports the trial court conclusion that the punitive damage awards will not financially destroy either mays or walsh and that they retain sufficient exempt or assets to live comfortably despite the awards.
the court found that,since,mays manipulated a net worth of million to ensure that he would retain a comfortable lifestyle regardless of any judgment in this case.the court also found that walsh had manipulated his assets which exceeded million.specifically,based on unchallenged evidence offered by the county,mays had hidden at least million by opening an offshore asset protection account in the cayman islands in,and had deposited into a private retirement plan.there is also evidence that he bought a residence in nevada for,paid a down payment on another house on lee court in carlsbad,transferred to his spouse in their divorce while continuing to live with her,and gave his former wife their residence which was then sold for.the court found that mays retained use of the assets transferred to his wife after their stipulated divorce.
the trial court found that walsh had transferred two investment properties to his wife,he was working for his wife as an employee at the time of trial,and that,as of may,walsh and his wife owned more than million in assets as well as equity in real property of.the court also found that walsh retained use of the assets transferred to his wife.
the court also found that mays receives approximately in monthly public retirement benefits which is exempt from execution by creditors code civ,and in monthly and partially exempt private retirement benefits.code civ.the court found that walsh had a interest in an exempt private retirement plan as of september.
do not contest the trial court specific factual findings on appeal except to challenge their sufficiency.in addition,they failed to offer any evidence of their financial condition at trial except for vague and evasive assertions that they had no assets at all.as a result,the trial court findings were and are essentially uncontested.
as stated by the trial court,i n determining what inferences to draw from the evidence or facts in the case against a party,the trier of fact may consider,among other things,the party failure to explain or to deny by his testimony such evidence or facts in the case against him,or his willful suppression of evidence relating thereto.mays and walsh intentionally concealed their assets,testified falsely regarding many factual issues,and were,at best,evasive and nonresponsive in answering questions as to their financial condition.this conduct gave the court wide latitude to make inferences from the evidence unfavorable to mays and walsh.see mike davidov issod th,d vallbona springer th,d.
in addition,the amount of punitive damages is not out of proportion to the compensatory damages and bears a reasonable relationship to the harm suffered by the county.see,sierra club foundation graham th,d diamond woodworks,argonaut ins.th,d.and,the trial court could have,but did not,assess prejudgment interest which would have exceeded the amount of punitive damages.
billboard leasefacts 
the san bernardino county flood control district is a county agency governed by the county board of supervisors.its director reports to a county official who,in turn,reports to the cao who,at all relevant times,was hlawek.oakridge group corporation is a corporation owned and controlled by william mccook collectively.
in november,the county board of supervisors approved a lease to of billboard sites along certain county highway.the lease required to complete construction of billboards on the sites within the initial months of the lease term.the lease also required county approval of any assignment of the lease.
failed to obtain the permits required for construction of the billboards during the required period and two extensions granted by the county.to facilitate county approval of the extensions,provided hlawek and other county officials free lodging and food and beverages at a las vegas casino.
in june,the county gave a third extension to construct the billboards.continued to have difficulty in completing their permit and construction obligations,and paid a bribe to hlawek to use his influence to expedite the permit and construction process.hlawek did so and seven billboards had been completed by april at a cost to of.
in may,agreed to assign the lease and sell five of the seven billboards to eller media for a payment of million.the agreement was subject to obtaining county consent to the assignment and a letter from the county stating that there were no defaults under the lease.
when had difficulty obtaining the consent and letter,the assignment and sale to eller media was placed in jeopardy.again,obtained hlawek assistance.in return for a bribe,hlawek expedited the issuance of the county consent and issuance of a letter.the consent and letter were reluctantly issued by the county board of supervisors after hlawek convinced board members that there was no reasonable basis to withhold consent.received a million payment from eller media in june.subtracting the cost of erecting the billboards,profit was million.the county discovered the bribery scheme involving and hlawek shortly before the count
