introduction 
no claim for punitive damages may be made in any action against a religious corporation unless the trial court first concludes the plaintiff has evidence that substantiates that he or she will meet the clear and convincing standard of proof for punitive damages under civil code section code civ.a similar statute protects health care providers against claims for punitive damages in any action arising out of their professional negligence unless the trial court finds in a separate pretrial proceeding the plaintiff has established a substantial probability he or she will prevail on the claim,subd.a.
in covenant care,superior court cal th,d,covenant care the supreme court held,because claims under the elder abuse and dependent adult civil protection act welf,et the elder abuse act are rooted in conduct far more egregious than professional medical negligence,section prerequisites for filing a punitive damage claim do not apply in elder abuse cases.the pending petition for writ of mandate filed by little company of mary hospital and little company of mary subacute care center collectively little company of mary questions whether the covenant care analysis applies in the related context of section that is,although a plaintiff seeking punitive damages against a health care corporation for elder abuse is not subject to section,must the plaintiff nonetheless satisfy section nearly identical requirement of proving a substantial probability of prevailing on the punitive damage claim when the defendant health care provider qualifies as a religious corporation 
the plain language of section,coupled with its legislative history,reflects an unmistakable intent to afford religious organizations protection against unsubstantiated punitive damage claims without regard to the conduct giving rise to the claim.in this way,section protections are broader than those afforded secular health care providers by section.because the trial court erred in concluding the pretrial mechanism provided in section does not apply in elder abuse cases seeking exemplary damages against religious organizations,we grant the petition for writ of mandate and direct respondent los angeles superior court to vacate its order denying little company of mary motion to strike the punitive damage claim in the underlying action.
factual and procedural background 
francisco marin filed an action for elder abuse and wrongful death after his mother,julia gomez,died while in the care and custody of little company of mary.marin complaint sought punitive damages in connection with the claim for elder abuse.little company of mary,owned and operated by providence health california,a religious corporation,moved to strike the punitive damage claim.invoking the protections of section,little company of mary argued marin was precluded from seeking punitive damages unless,in a separate hearing,marin demonstrated he could satisfy the standard of proof for punitive damages articulated in civil code section.in response marin argued,under the holding and analysis of covenant care,supra,cal th,d,punitive damage claims for elder abuse are not subject to the requirement of a pretrial showing of merit.
acknowledging that covenant care,supra,cal th,d,held section,not section,inapplicable in the context of elder abuse claims,the trial court nonetheless concluded the two sections had been enacted for the same general purpose to protect groups seen as socially beneficial from unwarranted claims for punitive damages and ruled the rationale articulated in covenant care to exclude elder punitive damage claims from the requirements of section applied equally to claims against religious organizations.accordingly,the trial court denied little company of mary motion to strike the elder punitive damage claim in marin action.
on november,little company of mary petitioned this court for a writ of mandate compelling the trial court to vacate its order denying the motion to strike the punitive damage claim in marin first amended complaint and to enter a new order granting the motion.on december,after receiving an informal response from marin,we issued an order to show cause why the relief requested should not be granted.
