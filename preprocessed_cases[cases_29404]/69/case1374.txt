ii.background 
the three facilities within albuquerque main post office are the vehicle maintenance facility vmf,the auxiliary service facility asf,and the main plant it is undisputed that nlra violations involving two union craft directors and all vmf employees occurred at the three facilities in.beginning in september,when vmf craft director john orlovsky made an information request for forms he believed union workers were unlawfully asked to sign,vmf manager michael quintana and vmf supervisor thomas smith subjected orlovsky to nine retaliatory disciplinary actions,including official discussions,meetings,a letter of warning,suspensions,and,ultimately,discharge.smith and quintana also prevented orlovsky from conferring with a union representative during two meetings and failed to disclose the charges against him prior to one of the meetings,both in violation of the union collective bargaining agreement.after orlovsky discharge,smith held a mandatory meeting with all vmf employees at which he asserted that employees agreed to restrict their behavior when they came to work for the postal service,chastised union members for allowing orlovsky to squander union dues with his conduct,and threatened all employees with discipline or discharge for engaging in the types of behavior in which orlovsky engaged.finally,also in,the asf craft director,charles trujillo,made several information requests of usps management regarding management actions at the asf and the main plant.trujillo requests were made for the purposes of investigating potential grievances and processing filed grievances.postal service management failed to respond to two of these requests.
an administrative law judge alj heard testimony and received evidence in june finding violations of nlra section a and a in connection with smith and quintana actions toward orlovsky,a violation of section a in connection with smith threats to all vmf employees,and two violations of section a in connection with trujillo unfulfilled asf and main plant information requests.when considering an appropriate remedy for the multiple violations,the alj took into account both the postal service nationwide history of section a violations,as well as a january consent judgment entered by this court between the board and the usps involving violations at three other albuquerque post offices.the alj ultimately recommended a broad order containing the remedial in any other manner language now challenged before this court.united states postal,at.the alj also recommended notice posting at all usps facilities in the city of albuquerque.id.at.
the usps contested both the geographic scope of the posting requirement and the breadth of the language in the alj recommended order.as to the breadth of the language,it argued a broad order was inappropriate under nlrb precedent in hickmott foods,because its violations were limited to one location and were committed by a small number of supervisors it contended its misconduct did not amount to egregious or widespread violations and did not demonstrate a proclivity to violate the act,as required for the issuance of a broad remedial order under hickmott foods.the usps,furthermore,objected to the alj consideration of nationwide nlra violations when determining that the usps had a proclivity to violate the act.it claimed the number of nationwide violations paled in comparison to its long history of union cooperation.
a nlrb panel modified the scope of the alj recommendation to require posting only at the three facilities within albuquerque main post office rather than in all albuquerque city postal facilities,but affirmed the broad injunctive language recommended by the alj.united states postal,at.with one member dissenting as to the need for broad language,the panel determined the violations at albuquerque main post office demonstrated a proclivity to respond unlawfully to the usps employees meaningful exercise of their statutory rights.id.at.the board stated its determination that a broad order was appropriate based on the series of section a and a violations by quintana and smith against orlovsky,and the section a violation resulting from the meeting smith held with all vmf employees after orlovsky discharge.id.at.the latter incident was particularly significant in the board determination that the usps had a proclivity to violate the act.id.at.
additionally,as had the alj,the board referenced the tenth circuit entry of a january consent judgment between the nlrb and the usps,which had been precipitated by violations at three other usps facilities in albuquerque and which contained the same broad remedial language challenged here.id.at citing nlrb united states postal,cir,unpublished consent judgment.the board observed that the nlra violations arising in the wake of orlovsky information request amounted to the very conduct which the previous order sought to remedy.id.although the board order in the instant albuquerque case also referenced a decision issued the same day involving violations at waco,texas,postal facilities,united states postal,the board did not explicitly discuss the postal service history of nationwide violations in justifying its broad order.united states postal,at.
iii.discussion 
this court has the authority to enforce,modify,or set aside an nlrb order.e.enforcement is appropriate when the agency has correctly applied the law and its findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.nlrb velocity express,cir quotation omitted.substantial evidence is defined as such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.quotation omitted.when reviewing a remedy for nlra violations,appellate courts must recognize the board primary responsibility and broad discretion to devise remedies that effectuate the policies of the act,nlrb,d citing c.this court scope of review is narrow,and should give special respect to the board choice of remedy,velocity express,at.we should not,therefore,disturb the board chosen remedy unless it can be shown that the order is a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the nlra.id.
because the usps does not challenge the board factual findings or its conclusions regarding the occurrence of section a,a,and a violations,the only issue for this court determination is the permissibility of the broad,in any other manner language the board thought appropriate to include in its remedial order.the breadth of a remedial order must depend upon the circumstances of each case.nlrb express pbl g.to be a permissible exercise of the board discretion,an order that enjoins violations other than those found by the board is permissible if it appears the enjoined violations bear some resemblance to that which the employer has committed or that danger of their commission in the future is to be anticipated from the course of its conduct in the past.id.at.a key inquiry is whether the employer actions display an attitude of opposition to the purposes of the act to protect the rights of employees generally.may stores nlrb.
