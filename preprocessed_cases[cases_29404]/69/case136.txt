this is a contract dispute between teragram corporation and,screamingmedia.the dispute centers on three software products,referred to collectively as the teragram software,which teragram licensed to screamingmedia.the first two products,entity extraction,sdk,and tlgrep entity compilers and entity extraction english dictionaries and grammars,are together referred to as the entity extraction software,while the third,summarization engine with english data,is referred to as the summarization software.
teragram sued for breach of contract and sought damages of,representing the annual licensing and support fees for the first two years of the contract screamingmedia counterclaimed that teragram misrepresented its products and was itself in breach of contract,thus excusing screamingmedia from its payment obligations.the district court,on for summary judgment,issued judgment in favor of teragram with respect to the summarization software and limited teragram damages award to the amount of one year licensing and support fees for that product,totaling.the court also entered judgment in favor of screamingmedia with respect to the entity extraction software and awarded nominal damages of.the court reached different results as to each product in part because screamingmedia did not give timely notice to teragram of the alleged material failure of the summarization software,but did give timely notice of the alleged material failure of the entity extraction software.
teragram appeals the issuance of summary judgment against it with respect to the entity extraction software it also appeals the limit the district court set on the damages award in its favor.screamingmedia from the issuance of summary judgment in teragram favor with respect to the summarization software.
we affirm the district court judgment.
the facts are not in dispute.screamingmedia was,at all relevant times,in the business of providing summarized textual content,such as news stories,to mobile phone users and other third parties.initially,the company employed human editors to consolidate news stories into digests that would fit on mobile phone screens.in,however,it began to seek out software that would both automate the summarization process and insert hyperlinked stock market ticker symbols into the text of summarized articles.
to this end,in june,screamingmedia entered into discussions with teragram,a linguistic technology company.teragram accepted screamingmedia invitation to participate in a competitive evaluation of its software and installed linux versions of its software on screamingmedia computer server.at the conclusion of that evaluation process,screamingmedia decided to license teragram software,and the parties entered into a licensing agreement agreement effective on october.the interpretation of this agreement is at the crux of the present dispute.
under the agreement,screamingmedia received from teragram a limited license to the teragram software.the agreement also required teragram to provide to screamingmedia certain maintenance and support services that were set forth in an exhibit 
pursuant to the agreement,screamingmedia was obliged to pay teragram a total of annually over a period for the entity extraction software,consisting of in license fees and in support fees.as for the summarization software,screamingmedia was to pay teragram a total of annually,consisting of in license fees and for support fees.payment of these fees was due days following the delivery date of the software and on the anniversaries of the delivery date.the agreement defined delivery date as the date the particular teragram software in question is delivered to licensee.
section of the agreement,entitled term and termination,provided that t he license for each teragram product shall not commence until the delivery date for such teragram product,and that the agreement would terminate as to each teragram product upon the third anniversary of such teragram product delivery date,unless earlier terminated in accordance with this section.the section went on to specify 
this agreement and the licenses granted hereunder may be terminated by either party in the event of a material breach hereof by the other which is not cured within thirty days after the breaching party receipt of notice of such breach from the nonbreaching party 
section of the agreement set forth a standard warranty 
teragram warrants that the teragram products,for a period of thirty days after delivery to screamingmedia,shall perform substantially in accordance with the documentation.screamingmedia exclusive remedy and teragram sole liability under this warranty shall be for teragram to correct any material failure of the teragram products to perform as warranted,if such failure is reported to teragram within the warranty period in the event that teragram can not,after repeated efforts,remedy such failure,teragram shall refund all license and support fees received by teragram from screamingmedia with respect to the defective teragram product hereunder and terminate the agreement as to such teragram product 
the next paragraph,which limits both the warranties and the definition for breach of warranty,states in bold type 
the above are the only warranties of any kind,either express or implied,that are made by teragram and teragram disclaims all other warranties,including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability,noninfringement,fitness for a particular purpose or that the operation of the teragram products will be uninterrupted or.no oral or written information or advice given by teragram,its agents or employees shall create a warranty or in any way increase the scope of the warranties in this agreement.such warranties shall not be deemed to have failed of their essential purpose so long as teragram is making good faith efforts to correct defects or failures under the terms of the warranty.
section a of the agreement,entitled limitation of liability,set a limit on the form and amount of screamingmedia recovery in event of breach 
regardless of whether any remedy set forth in this agreement fails of its essential purpose,in no event will teragram be liable for any indirect,special,punitive,consequential,or incidental damages including damages for loss of business profits,business interruption,loss of business information,and the like arising out of this agreement or the use of or inability to use the teragram products even if such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.in no case shall teragram aggregate liability for any one matter arising out of the subject matter of this agreement,whether in contract,tort or otherwise,exceed the amount actually received by teragram from screamingmedia under this agreement in the twelve months preceding the occurrence of such matter,and for all matters,in the aggregate,the total amount actually received by teragram from screamingmedia under this agreement.
teragram first delivered to screamingmedia a linux version of the summarization software on october.it made subsequent deliveries of new releases of the summarization software on november,and,and on december.also on december,teragram made its first delivery of the linux versions of the entity extraction software.teragram later delivered new linux versions of that software on january,and versions on january,in between the various delivery dates,the parties frequently communicated by.
on december,screamingmedia sent an to teragram requesting an invoice for the annual fees.teragram replied by the next day,with an invoice for the amount of.teragram followed up on january,with a second,again attaching a copy of the invoice that same day,screamingmedia responded by that the invoice had already been approved and that payment was probably caught up in the morass of the company quarter accounting.when payment was not made by february,teragram sent a third and invoice to screamingmedia,again requesting payment.these were cordial in tone 
the next day,on february,teragram received by overnight mail a letter from screamingmedia.the letter,which was dated february,alleged that teragram is in material breach of the license agreement because the teragram software has substantially failed to achieve the results that teragram warranted.according to the letter,teragram insisted,both in verbal communications between the parties as well as in its product literature,that its product would allow screamingmedia to locate company names,names of executives,places and other entities concepts within textual documents and to discover associations such as and many others,within the textual documents however,s ince teragram product was first delivered to screamingmedia on january,it has substantially failed to achieve the results that teragram warranted.screamingmedia concluded its letter as follows 
pursuant to section of the agreement,screamingmedia hereby provides teragram with thirty days notice of its intention to terminate the agreement if the material breaches outlined herein have not been cured within the notice period.should teragram be unable to cure this material breach,screamingmedia will make demand that all license and support fees remitted to teragram pursuant to the agreement be refunded in accordance with the limited warranty provision of section.
teragram did not respond.
on april,screamingmedia sent a second letter to teragram,stating that because t o date,we have not received any response to our february letter,nor have the material breaches been cured,it was thereby terminating the agreement pursuant to section of the agreement.
teragram finally replied to screamingmedia letters on april.in a letter of that date,teragram countered that it was was in material breach of the agreement by failing to make payment for the teragram software.teragram alleged that payment for the summarization software was due on november,thirty days after october,when the software was first delivered to screamingmedia in turn,payment for the entity extraction software was due on january,thirty days after december,the date the linux versions of the products were initially delivered.screamingmedia,teragram maintained,must cure its breach before it demands warranty support under the agreement.in any event,teragram continued,section of the agreement limits the warranty period to thirty days after delivery of the product thus,in its view,the warranty for the summarization software expired on november,while the warranty for the entity extraction software expired on january,before it received screamingmedia notice of breach.
teragram acknowledged,however,that it had delivered windows versions of the entity extraction software to screamingmedia on january.the windows versions,it claimed,were complimentary and not contemplated by the agreement.it asserted that t o the extent that a court might conclude that there was any warranty on these deliveries teragram takes the position that there was none,the day warranty on this version of the software expired on february,one day before teragram received screamingmedia letter alleging breach,and thus screamingmedia letter had no legal effect.
teragram concluded its letter by stating that it was more than willing to work with screamingmedia to answer technical questions,but that i f screamingmedia does not comply with its payment obligations under the agreement by april,teragram will file suit in the federal district court for the district of massachusetts under massachusetts law,in accordance with the forum selection and choice of law provisions of the agreement.
by june,screamingmedia had yet to reply to teragram letter or to tender any payment.on that date,teragram filed this diversity action in federal district court,claiming breach of contract and seeking declaratory judgment on account of screamingmedia failure to pay licensing and support fees allegedly due under the agreement.teragram initially sought damages in the amount of,representing the first of three annual license and support fees,but subsequently was granted leave to amend its complaint to seek damages for,comprising the first and second of three annual license and support fees.
screamingmedia counterclaimed for breach of,misrepresentation,and declaratory judgment.as to its own alleged breach of contract,screamingmedia argued that it was relieved of all payment obligations as a result of teragram prior material breach,namely,its failure to provide software in conformance with,and technical support as required by,sections and of the agreement.
the parties for summary judgment,and the court issued an order and opinion on december,and judgment on march.as to screamingmedia breach of counterclaim,the court noted that section of the agreement required any material failure of the teragram products to be reported to teragram within the warranty period of thirty days.f inding that the delivery of each new version of the software to screamingmedia by teragram set the warranty clock running anew,the court concluded that screamingmedia did not provide timely notice of any breach of warranty with respect to the summarization software,but did provide timely notice with respect to the entity extraction software.
the court denied the parties summary judgment motions with respect to the entity extraction software,however,because it determined that material disputes remained regarding whether the software and technical support provided by teragram complied with the agreement.but after teragram stipulated that the entity extraction software did not perform substantially in accordance with the documentation within the meaning of section of the agreement,and that a fter february,teragram did not provide any support services to screamingmedia in connection with the entity extraction software,the court entered judgment against teragram on its breach of contract claim and in favor of screamingmedia on its parallel counterclaim solely with respect to the entity extraction software.it awarded screamingmedia nominal damages in the amount of one dollar.
as to teragram breach of contract claim against screamingmedia,the district court concluded that screamingmedia failure to make payments under the agreement constituted a material breach.because screamingmedia failed to provide notice of alleged prior material breach by teragram regarding the summarization software,the court granted summary judgment to teragram on the breach of contract claim and against screamingmedia on its counterclaim with respect to that software only.it awarded damages to teragram in the amount of,representing the first year licensing and support fees for the summarization software.
the court also issued summary judgment in favor of teragram on screamingmedia misrepresentation counterclaim and declared moot the parties respective requests for declaratory judgment to the degree not otherwise fully addressed in this judgment.finally,it denied teragram motion to amend its complaint a third time to seek licensing and support fees for the third year of the contract 
neither party was fully satisfied by the district court resolution of the breach of contract claims after the district court denied its motion for reconsideration,teragram filed this appeal from the judgment against it with respect to the entity extraction software.in turn,screamingmedia from the judgment against it with respect to the summarization software.teragram also appealed the district court decision to limit the amount of its damages award against screamingmedia to only the first year of licensing and support fees for the summarization software.

breach of contract claims 
screamingmedia 
screamingmedia argues on its,as well as in its defense to teragram successful claim,that summary judgment should have been granted in its favor with respect to the summarization software because the district court erred in concluding that it had not provided timely notice of teragram alleged prior material breach.moreover,screamingmedia argues that even if its notice were untimely,its withholding of payment was no more than an immaterial breach of the agreement,and so teragram was still obligated to perform.neither argument is persuasive.
screamingmedia alleges that teragram committed a breach of warranty by failing to provide software and ongoing support,and that screamingmedia gave timely notice of the breach to teragram.it cites to section of the agreement,which required teragram to provide to licensee the maintenance and support services set forth in exhibit it further relies on section,which warrant ed that the teragram software,for a period of thirty days after delivery to licensee,shall perform substantially in accordance with the documentation and also required teragram to correct any material failure of the teragram software to perform as warranted,but only so long as such failure is reported to teragram within the warranty period of thirty days.screamingmedia argues,and teragram does not dispute,that its receipt of software and support is an essential and inducing feature of the contract,bucholz green,the failure of which would release it from further performance under the agreement,see ward am.mut.liab.ins.
the parties agree,for the purpose of construing the warranty provision of the agreement,that the last delivery of the summarization software occurred on december,and that screamingmedia had to give notice to teragram within thirty days of that is,by january,it wished to invoke the warranty.screamingmedia claims that it complied with section because,beginning as early as november,it sent numerous to teragram,purportedly apprising the latter of problems it was having with the summarization software.the argument fails for two reasons the notice required was not notice by,and the screamingmedia sent did not,in any event,provide adequate notice.
section specified that an allegation of material failure of the software must be reported to teragram within the warranty period.it did not permit report ing by.although section did not itself describe the medium by which reporting was to have been effected,subsection a of the agreement mandated that a ll notices shall be in writing and given by personal delivery,certified mail,return receipt requested,or by commercial overnight courier for next business day delivery,to the recipient address set forth above.plainly was not among the recognized forms of notice.
screamingmedia argues that section did not require notice,but merely report ing,and thus subsection a did not apply.nothing in the agreement,however,indicated that the term report in section was a term of art,used only,as screamingmedia asserts,in connection with efforts to deal with software problems that cause the software to fail to perform substantially in accordance with documentation.rather,because the formal notification procedures were set forth under section,which was entitled general,those procedures applied to any type of situation in which notice to the other party was required,unless otherwise specified.indeed,only exhibit b of the agreement,which detailed teragram annual support obligations,provided for reporting,and it did so solely with respect to minor maintenance problems bugs,not to material failures of the software.see abodeely ins.commerce,every phrase and clause must be presumed to have been designedly employed,and must be given meaning and effect,whenever practicable,when construed with all the other phraseology contained in the instrument,which must be considered as a workable and harmonious means for carrying out and effectuating the intent of the parties.quoting sullivan commonwealth,internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,since subsection a notice is required when one party seeks to notify the other of material breach under section of the agreement,it would make little sense to construe section differently.
in any event,as the district court correctly noted,screamingmedia never once alleged in the course of its correspondence that there had been a material failure of the software or that the software was not performing substantially in accordance with the documentation.consequently,the could not have put teragram on fair notice.finally,that screamingmedia requested from teragram an invoice for the first year fees as late as december,least a week after it had sent the very last of its to teragram regarding the summarization that screamingmedia did not,as a matter of fact,intend for its to serve as notices of material failures of the software 
it was not until february,that teragram received from screamingmedia a notice of breach in a form recognized by subsection a of the agreement.by that date,the warranty period for the summarization software had expired,and teragram was no longer under obligation to correct any material failure of that software to perform as warranted.
since teragram could not have been in prior material breach of the warranty with respect to the summarization software,screamingmedia was obligated to fulfill its obligations under the agreement,namely,to pay the applicable annual license and support fees.on appeal,as before the district court,screamingmedia does not argue that it had,in fact,fulfilled its end of the bargain.rather,it argues that the breach,if not excused by teragram breach,was immaterial.see.port,when a party to an agreement commits an immaterial breach of that agreement,the injured party may not stop performing its obligations under the agreement.alternatively,it argues that the materiality of the breach should have been left to the trier of fact.we disagree.
a material breach of an agreement occurs when there is a breach of an essential and inducing feature of the contract.id.alteration in original quoting bucholz,at.a material breach by one party excuses the other party from further performance under the contract,id.quoting ward,at,and o nce relieved from performance,the injured party is not liable for further damages incurred by the party in material breach,id.
screamingmedia relies heavily on the rule that the materiality of a breach of contract is generally a question for the trier of fact to decide.see id.nevertheless,a s is true of virtually any factual question,if the materiality question in a given case admits of only one reasonable answer because the evidence on the point is either undisputed or sufficiently lopsided,then the court must intervene and address what is ordinarily a factual question as a question of law.gibson city of cranston,cir see also,at noting that the materiality of breach normally is a question for the jury to decide,but that o n this record,we may decide the matter on our own.
here,the district court correctly concluded that as a matter of law,the breach was material.under the agreement,payment was due days following the delivery date of the software,with delivery date being defined as the date the particular teragram product is delivered to licensee.screamingmedia admitted that
