en banc opinion 
defendant the city of lowell city,claiming immunity to punitive damages under city of newport fact concerts,d,appeals from a judgment of punitive damages in a suit filed under.a divided panel of this court affirmed on march,agreeing with the district court that the city objection had been waived.we vacated the panel opinion pending rehearing en banc,and now reverse.the facts taken in the light most hospitable to the verdict winner,ass of soc.workers harwood,cir,are as follows.
on february,craig chestnut and his wife went to a bar in lowell,massachusetts.city police officers steven coyle and stephen ciavola were also present when chestnut became embroiled in a fracas.coyle arrested and handcuffed chestnut and removed him from the bar,whereupon ciavola struck chestnut in the face,knocked him to the ground and kicked him in the face.as a result of ciavola violent conduct,chestnut required fourteen stitches around his right eye,which is permanently damaged.this injury impairs chestnut depth perception and precludes him from earning a living as a crane operator,as he did previously.
chestnut filed suit under together with supplemental state law negligence claims against the city,coyle and ciavola,alleging inter alia that ciavola used excessive force against him coyle,after having taken chestnut into police custody,failed to protect him and the city improperly hired and retained ciavola,who had an extensive criminal record including convictions for assault and battery and was,at the time of hire,the subject of an active arrest warrant for failure to appear in court for violating his probation.
as the trial drew to a close,the district court held a conference with the attorneys on may,to discuss jury instructions and the verdict form,which included a question on punitive damages.the court raised with counsel the appropriateness of a punitive damages award under section.chestnut attorney replied that such an award was appropriate,and the city counsel did not respond to the judge inquiry or take issue with opposing counsel response.in due course,the trial judge instructed the jury,without objection,that it could award punitive damages against each defendant,including the city,as to the section claim.
on may,the jury returned a verdict for chestnut on both the negligence and section counts against ciavola and the city.the jury did not find coyle liable on either count it awarded chestnut in damages in punitive damages against the city,in punitive damages against ciavola,and in compensatory damages against both of these defendants jointly and severally.the district court entered judgment,again without objection from the city.
finally awakening to its oversight of city of newport on may,the city filed a motion for a new trial,or,in the alternative,to strike the of punitive damages.at a motion hearing on july,the district court,ruling from the bench,denied the city motion.although recognizing that an award of punitive damages against a municipality was indeed error in light of city of newport,the district court found that the city failure to interpose a timely objection under.waived its immunity.these appeals followed 
in relying upon waiver,the district court assuredly did not mean that the city knowingly relinquished its immunity under city of newport to punitive damages there is no evidence whatsoever that the city counsel knew of city of newport.rather,the district judge clearly meant,in the term used in united states olano,d,that the city had forfeited its objection through ignorance or neglect.although most judges,and many supreme court decisions,continue to use the term waiver to cover both situations,the distinction is important in this case and we will follow olano convention in this instance.
failures to object,unless a true waiver is involved,are almost always subject to review for plain error.this is so even in the case of jury instructions where rule current language suggests otherwise however,even in criminal cases,the requirements for plain error,set out in olano itself,at,are extremely demanding and in this circuit,it is rare indeed for a panel to find plain error in a civil case.still,this case at first blush meets the olano requirements error,plainness,prejudice,and miscarriage of justice or something akin to it.
the district court itself acknowledged the error,its plainness is amply demonstrated by a contrary supreme court precedent on point namely,city of newport that has been on the books for over twenty years.prejudice in the sense of affecting the final outcome is also obvious had the jury been instructed as to the city immunity,there almost certainly would not be a judgment against it today,although conceivably the jury might have somewhat increased the compensatory damages.
this also appears to be the rare civil case where the miscarriage of justice requirement is met.importantly,the error was caused by the plaintiff as well as the defendant.plaintiff counsel,quite erroneously,represented to the district court at the charge conference that punitive damages were permissible against a municipality.this does not excuse the negligence of the city counsel but it does mean that responsibility for the mistake is somewhat unusual circumstance.
further,even without punitive damages,the plaintiff is still entitled to full actual damages,which in this case are substantial.nor need such damages be reduced by attorneys fees because under section such fees are separately awarded.punitive damages are,in this sense,a one that here would come at the expense of innocent taxpayers of the city,the very ones for whose benefit city of newport adopted the rule giving municipalities such an immunity.at.
the main hitch with the plain error doctrine is that city of newport described the protection against punitive damages as an immunity,rather than as a rule forbidding punitive damages.accordingly,as an immunity need not be asserted,one could argue that the instruction was not error at all,let alone plain error.a state,after all,can waive sovereign immunity.certainly if counsel for the city had stood up and said that the city preferred to face punitive damages,it could hardly complain if the judge took the city at its word.
still,this is surely a matter of form over substance.for all practical purposes,the district court made an error,and the district court itself acknowledged as much.if the district judge had discovered newport on her own the night before the instructions,it is hardly likely that she would have authorized punitive damages.and although a state might sometimes choose to waive sovereign immunity for policy reasons,hoping to win on the merits,one can hardly imagine a competent lawyer choosing to waive protection against punitive damages.
this realistic view is not without precedent.in huard,cir,cert.denied,d,we reviewed for plain error the defendant defense of qualified immunity,raised for the first time after the entry of judgment.in applying the plain error analysis,we did not find that the defendant forfeited her immunity by her procedural default,but rather denied relief on the lack of evidence.id.at.we treated a interposition of qualified immunity in the same fashion in lewis kendrick,cir.see also id.at breyer,concurring 
of course,even if the doctrine of plain error were not strictly applicable,it is settled in this circuit that an appellate court has discretion,in an exceptional case,to reach virgin issues,that is,to relieve a party of a prior forfeiture.united states la guardia,cir.recently we described pertinent factors in harwood,at relieving forfeiture of legislative immunity most of those factors are present here and,although this case,unlike harwood,does not involve a constitutional issue,neither did harwood disregard a governing and plainly applicable supreme court precedent.see also united states krynicki,cir.the city asserts that we should simply strike the punitive damages award,holding the actual damages award intact.probably,the jury actual damages award was uninfluenced by the large punitives but given that the city bears much of the blame for any uncertainty,we think on remand it should be the plaintiff option whether to have a new trial on actual damages against the city but not against ciavola a trial in which plaintiff attorneys fees will be borne by the city.see.the district court shall set a time within which the plaintiff may make such an election.
the judgment insofar as it awards punitive damages against the city is vacated and the matter is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.each side will bear its own costs on this appeal.
it is so ordered.
though i arrive at the same destination as the majority,i choose an alternative route to get route which,in my view,is both less conceptually troubling and better supported by existing precedent.
contrary to the majority opinion,i do not think that this case can be resolved by relying on the plain error doctrine.taken together,the first two prongs of the plain error standard require the appellant to demonstrate that an obvious error of law occurred.see olano,at.the majority,the parties,and the district court are of the view that it is a foregone conclusion that such an error occurred here.their steadfast belief rests on the assumption that the district court jury instruction,which made punitive damages available against the city,directly contradicted the supreme court holding in city of newport.according to them,city of newport essentially stands for the proposition that punitive damages are unavailable against a municipality under.
notwithstanding their belief,however,city of newport never held that punitive damages are unavailable in a action against a municipality.rather,the supreme court ruled that a municipality is immune from punitive damages under.city of newport,at.emphasis added accord,cir characterizing city of newport as holding that as a general rule,municipalities are immune from punitive damages judgments when sued under.although this distinction may appear inconsequential,it is rather significant in light of the circumstances of this case.if the supreme court had held that punitive damages were unavailable against a municipality in a suit,then a plaintiff would be filing a frivolous complaint were he to sue for such damages.see.b requiring that the claims in a party complaint be warranted by existing law.however,the supreme court holding that municipalities are immune from punitive damages under has slightly different implications.immunity,whether qualified or absolute,is an affirmative defense that can be forfeited,if not asserted in a timely manner,or waived.see cozzo tangipahoa parish gov t,cir ruling that absolute immunity is an affirmative defense that is forfeited if not pleaded,cir since immunity must be affirmatively pleaded,it follows that failure to do so can work as a waiver of the defense.krzeminski,cir holding that a municipality indemnification agreement with defendant constituted a waiver of its municipal immunity defense bell city of milwaukee,cir holding that state indemnification statute waived municipal immunity defense with respect to indemnified judgments.thus,whereas unavailability implies a limitation on damages altogether,immunity,in the doctrinal sense,is a defense that can be forfeited or waived.
in fact,in,we allowed a plaintiff to seek discovery against a municipality on the claim that the city had waived its municipal immunity defense under.at.our holding rested on the explicit assumption that the municipal immunity set forth in city of newport is an affirmative defense that can be waived.see id.at noting that precedent supports the view that waiver of the municipal immunity defense is possible.moreover,we questioned whether the city had forfeited its municipal immunity defense by failing to assert it at or before trial.see id.thus demonstrates how permeable municipal immunity from punitive damages under can be,both in terms of forfeiture and waiver.
in the instant case,the city never pled an affirmative defense of immunity in its answer and did not raise this defense at summary judgment or trial.the city failure to do so can reasonably be viewed as a forfeiture of that defense.see,at holding that the failure of a government official to timely assert an affirmative defense of qualified immunity under at trial would forfeit the defense for trial purposes.i therefore can not conclude that the district court committed plain error in charging the jury that punitive damages were available against the city.to hold otherwise would require me to adopt two seemingly implausible propositions that the supreme court holding in city of newport was perfectly clear that no punitive damages are ever available under and that,which supports the proposition that municipal immunity can be forfeited,was so obviously incorrect as a matter of law that the district court should not have relied on it.see generally united states turman,cir if the district judge would have to be clairvoyant to detect the error the error is not plain and defendant must object as a condition for having it considered on appeal.
rather than delving into an abyss of implausibility,i hold firm to the view that the district court did not commit plain error in its jury instructions because the city failed to assert,and thus likely forfeited,its affirmative defense of municipal immunity from punitive damages.
the majority contends that this argument is surely a matter of form over substance.the majority elaborates on this point by offering a hypothetical if the night before the jury instructions were given the district court judge had discovered the city of newport opinion,it is hardly likely that the judge would have authorized punitive damages.i respectfully disagree and offer a derivation of the majority hypothetical to demonstrate my point if the night before the jury instructions were given,the district court judge obtained a complete description of the state of the is,discovered the municipal immunity to punitive damages set forth in city of newport and learned about our opinion in,which explicitly discusses how the city of newport immunity defense can be waived or am convinced that the judge would have instructed the jury that punitive damages were available,since the city failed to assert its immunity defense at any stage of the litigation.
notwithstanding my unwillingness to find plain error,i believe that there is an alternative,and more principled,ground for striking the punitive damages award against the city.ordinarily,a party who fails to raise a claim or a defense in the district court is prohibited from unveiling it in the court of appeals.see united states slade,cir.this rule is deeply embedded in our jurisprudence,and we have invoked it with a fervor.harwood,at internal citations omitted.however,every rule speaks of an exception,and this one is no different.in exceptional circumstances and to prevent a miscarriage of justice,this court may relieve a party from his failure to timely assert an affirmative defense.see,correa hosp.san francisco,cir see generally la guardia,at holding that an appellate court has discretion,in an exceptional case,to reach virgin issues.
in harwood,we reached the merits of a legislative immunity defense even though the defendants failed to raise the issue in the district court.at.we found it appropriate to reach the untimely immunity issue because the omitted issue was purely legal in nature the belated proffer raised an issue of constitutional magnitude the omitted argument was highly persuasive there was no inequity or special prejudice to the plaintiffs in allowing the defense to be raised for the first time on appeal the omission seemed entirely inadvertent and the omitted issue implicated a matter of great public concern.see see also krynicki,at allowing a party to raise a virgin issue on appeal because the issue was purely legal the omitted argument was highly persuasive the omitted issue was likely to arise again in other cases and the failure to address the issue would result in a miscarriage of justice.
because i believe that these factors are more than adequately represented in this case,i would excuse the city failure to raise its municipal immunity defense below.first,whether the city should be immune from the punitive damages award is a purely legal issue,harwood,at discussing the issue of legislative immunity as purely legal in nature,and the record necessary to resolve it can be developed no further.see la guardia,at whether the point can be resolved with certitude on the existing record is a factor that often inclines a court to entertain a pivotal argument for the first time on appeal.second,the omitted issue is highly is,if the city is allowed to raise its municipal immunity defense,it would undoubtedly prove victorious on the issue given the supreme court holding in city of newport.
third,chestnut would not suffer any procedural inequity or special prejudice were we to address this issue plaintiff addressed the omitted issue in his brief and set forth his claims at oral argument.singleton wulff,d discussing importance,in determining whether to reach an omitted issue,of ensuring that the opposing party ha s the opportunity to present whatever legal arguments he may have to the court of appeals.thus,the absence of unfairness weighs in favor of addressing the omitted issue.
fourth,the city failure to raise its municipal immunity defense seems entirely inadvertent.although the omission had the regrettable effect of prolonging the trial,it did not produce any tactical advantage to the defendant.
fifth,and perhaps most importantly,the failure to address the city municipal immunity defense would result in a miscarriage of justice.p unitive damages imposed on a municipality are likely accompanied by an increase in taxes or a reduction of public services for the citizens footing the bill.city of newport,at.it is convoluted and unfair to impose the burdens of a punitive damages award on the same taxpayers and citizens for whose benefit the wrongdoer was being chastised.see id.punishing blameless taxpayers for the ineptitude of the city attorney is simply unjust,especially considering that the taxpayers are in no position to deter similar negligence in the future.
because all of these factors converge in the city favor,i would excuse the city failure to assert its immunity defense below and proceed to address the merits of the defense.in city of newport,the supreme court unequivocally held that municipalities are immune from punitive damages in actions.at.chestnut can advance no argument,and i can not conceive of any,to attack this proposition.on this basis,i would find that the city defense precludes the punitive damages award in this case,and i would strike those damages.
i therefore concur in the outcome of the majority opinion.
i can understand the impulse to grant relief to the city here.together,plaintiff counsel and counsel for the city failed to recognize the principle that local governmental entities are immune from punitive damages under.city of newport fact concerts,d.a very able trial judge also missed the mistake.hence,the jury awarded in punitive damages against the city.
no one disputes that,under city of newport,the city could have avoided such an award.but that easy avoidance does not justify relieving the city of the consequences of its mistake.whether we treat the city oversight as a failure to raise the affirmative defense of city of newport immunity,or as a failure to object to a jury instruction under rule,we must affirm the jury verdict unless we conclude that allowing the punitive damages award to stand would constitute a miscarriage of justice.until today,we have reserved that label for extraordinary cases.teamsters,local superline transp,cir.indeed,it appears that we have never before found a miscarriage of justice in a civil case involving faulty jury instructions.see davis rennie,cir.the circumstances of this case give us no reason to depart from that settled practice.therefore,i respectfully dissent.
the majority and concurring opinions cite several factors to support their conclusion that allowing the punitive damages award to stand would result in a miscarriage of justice.in my view,those individually or in far short of a miscarriage of justice.
innocent taxpayers 
both the majority and the concurring opinions emphasize that affirming the punitive damages award would be unjust because it would punish innocent taxpayers.see city of newport,at.those references to innocent taxpayers seem to have multiple meanings.the taxpayers are innocent in the sense that they did not engage in the conduct that the punitive damages are intended to punish and deter.instead,the do not need to be deterred from future pay for the misdeeds of governmental actors.the taxpayers also are innocent in the sense that they did not make the mistake in litigation that resulted in the punitive damages award.instead,that mistake was made by the city counsel.
both versions of the innocence argument prove too much.the first version,focusing on the absence of deterrence,is simply a restatement of a policy reason invoked by the supreme court for the rule that municipalities are immune from punitive damages under.if that policy reason translates into a miscarriage of justice in every case where punitive damages are wrongly awarded against a municipality,there should be no pretense of a analysis in such cases.certainly,this version of innocence does not distinguish one such case from another.
on an even more basic level,the innocent taxpayer will always be the victim when some error at trial results in a large or larger damages award against a municipality or other governmental entity.we are prepared to recognize a exception to our rules governing procedural mere fact that innocent taxpayers will bear the brunt of the city error can not suffice to establish a miscarriage of justice here 
the second version of the innocence argument suffers from a similar defect in failing to distinguish this case from any other case subject to plain error review.there are few tenets so well established in american jurisprudence as the proposition that a client is bound by the mistakes of its chosen counsel.see,irwin of veterans affairs,d explaining that in our system of representative litigation each party is deemed bound by the acts of his hoult hoult,cir we have repeatedly held that the acts and omissions of counsel are customarily visited upon the client in a civil case.internal quotation marks omitted.plain error review offers an exception to that general rule for extraordinary cases.obviously,the plain error particularly the requirement that relief will not be available absent a miscarriage of justice can not be satisfied simply because the complaining party or those who ultimately bear its costs will be harmed by its attorney mistake.to hold otherwise would deprive the miscarriage of justice requirement of any meaning,except in the very rare case where the error was caused by the party itself.
put simply,the harm to innocent taxpayers here is no different from the harm that will occur whenever punitive damages are erroneously awarded against a municipality under,or when government counsel makes a costly blunder.while unfortunate,such harm does not constitute a peculiar circumstance that necessitates relief in order to prevent a clear miscarriage of justice.nimrod sylvester,cir.
windfall to chestnut 
the majority opinion states that the court is justified in affording relief because this punitive damages award was a windfall for chestnut,meaning,i gather,that those damages were unnecessary to compensate him fully.that assertion is grounded in speculation.we can not know how the jury would have treated the compensatory damages question had it had been aware that punitive damages were unavailable.
one thing is very clear,however.this was not a runaway jury.to the contrary,chestnut presented detailed evidence of the pay differential between his income as a crane operator and as a crane mechanic,including expert testimony from an economist who placed his past and future economic damages at.that expert prepared a report that was admitted into evidence regarding present value calculations of chestnut economic damages under various assumptions.
thus,considered in combination with the compensatory damages award,the punitive damages were well within the range of the com
