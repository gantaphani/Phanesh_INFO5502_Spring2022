leonard fafel appeals from the denial of his rule b motion for relief from an injunction that prohibits him from pursuing claims in state court in contravention of a consent judgment entered in federal court pursuant to rule.see.relief from judgment or order.offer of judgment.fafel argues that the injunction is void for lack of jurisdiction because the district court misunderstood the scope of its ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the underlying rule judgment.given that the district court had more than an arguable basis for concluding that it had jurisdiction to enforce its judgment,we reject fafel collateral attack and affirm the district court decision.
fafel state and federal court actions 
we recount the undisputed facts and procedural history in some detail to provide an understanding of the unusual nature of this case.on april,fafel filed a civil rights action under,along with pendent state law claims,in federal district court against,middlesex county sheriff james dipaola,individually and in his official capacity,based on fafel termination from employment in april.specifically,fafel alleged that dipaola had caused a deprivation of fafel constitutional rights to freedom of association and due process in violation of and its state law counterpart.ch,and that he had engaged in tortious interference with fafel employment.fafel had already filed another action against dipaola and the commonwealth of massachusetts arising out of the same incident in massachusetts superior court alleging that fafel had been terminated without the benefit of procedural protections required under.ch.on may,less than two months after the filing of his federal court action,fafel obtained a court order in his state court action directing dipaola and the commonwealth of massachusetts to reinstate fafel with back pay.judgment in fafel favor was not entered until approximately six months later,in january.
dipaola offer of judgment 
on april,while dipaola appeal from the state court judgment was pending in the massachusetts appeals court,fafel filed a civil contempt action against dipaola in state court seeking enforcement of the state court judgment.on april,dipaola filed a motion for summary judgment in fafel federal court action.instead of waiting for a ruling on the motion,dipaola extended an offer of judgment to fafel on may,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,which permits a party defending against a claim to serve upon the adverse party an offer to allow judgment to be taken against the defending party for the money or property or to the effect specified in the offer,with costs then accrued.dipaola offer specified an amount of,including attorney fees and costs accrued to date in the federal court case only,which amount,i f accepted,shall satisfy all claims made and relief sought by the plaintiff against the defendant arising from or related to the april termination of the plaintiff from his employment in the middlesex sheriff department.the offer also provided that,upon fafel acceptance,judgment shall enter in the amount of in the case of leonard fafel james dipaola,individually,and in his capacity as middlesex sheriff,and plaintiff claims for punitive damages and injunctive relief shall be dismissed with prejudice.the offer of judgment did not explicitly refer to the disposition of fafel state law claims.
under rule,i f within days after the service of the offer the adverse party serves written notice that the offer is accepted,either party may then file the offer and notice of acceptance together with proof of service thereof and thereupon the clerk shall enter judgment.fafel timely accepted the offer,and dipaola filed the requisite documents with the court on may.for reasons that remain unclear,judgment was not immediately entered.instead,on may,the entire case was dismissed i n accordance with the offer of judgement filed by the defendant on may.
dipaola motion to enforce 
when fafel refused to sign a stipulation of dismissal in his state court contempt action or to assent to a motion to vacate the state court judgment of reinstatement and back pay based on fafel april termination,dipaola moved in federal district court on june,to enforce the rule judgment through an injunction prohibiting fafel from pursuing his state court action.that same day,judgment was entered in the federal court action in fafel favor.because the order of dismissal entered on may,clearly failed to comply with either the terms of rule or the terms of the offer of judgment filed with the court we treat that order as superseded by the judgment that was properly entered on june,i n accordance with plaintiff acceptance of the defendant offer of judgement,which in turn provided that judgment shall enter in the amount of in the case of leonard fafel james dipaola individually,and in his capacity as middlesex sheriff,and plaintiff claims for punitive damages and injunctive relief shall be dismissed with prejudice.
on august,the district court held a hearing on dipaola motion to enforce dipaola argued that fafel was precluded from pursuing reinstatement through his state court contempt action because,under the terms of the rule offer of judgment that fafel had accepted,his identical prayer for injunctive relief in the form of reinstatement in the federal court action had been dismissed with prejudice.similarly,dipaola argued,fafel was precluded from pursuing back pay in state court through his contempt action because,again under the terms of the rule offer,fafel acceptance of payment of satisf ied all claims made and relief sought by the plaintiff against the defendant arising from or related to his april termination.
observing that fafel had lost any entitlement to back pay the amount of which had never been calculated in state court by accepting dipaola offer of a federal court judgment in satisfaction of all claims made and relief sought arising from or related to his april termination,the district court enjoined parrot ing the terms of the offer of judgment he had accepted from taking any action to seek relief or make claims against defendant arising from or related to the april termination of the plaintiff from his employment in the middlesex sheriff department.when fafel objected on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction over his action in state court,the district court responded,i have jurisdiction over my judgment,and i enforcing this judgment with respect to all claims made and relief sought by the plaintiff against the defendant arising from or related to the april termination of the plaintiff.
fafel motion for relief 
fafel did not appeal from the issuance of the injunction.on october,approximately one month after the time limit for filing a notice of appeal had passed,fafel,represented by new counsel,filed a motion to vacate the judgment and reopen the case due to an unauthorized acceptance of an offer of judgment.he claimed that his former attorney had acted contrary to fafel specific instruction that his attorney not accept an offer of judgment to the extent that it would dispose of fafel claims in massachusetts court.in his motion,fafel estimated that he would be owed in back pay as of june,under the state court judgment and stated that i t simply would not have made sense to accept a offer of judgment in federal court,to the extent that it would have led to a waiver of the lucrative judgment in state court worth plus reinstatement.fafel then alleged that his former attorney had been instructed not to accept the offer to the extent that it called for a release of the state law claims.in his prayer for relief,fafel requested that the court w ithdraw the injunction that prevents plaintiff from pursuing remedies in state court for the april termination.
the magistrate judge considering this motion held an evidentiary hearing on february,and issued a report and recommendation on april.the magistrate judge construed the motion as one for relief from judgment under the provision of federal rule of civil procedure b,which permits a district court to grant relief for any other reason not set forth in rule b justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.
the magistrate judge first addressed fafel failure to appeal the issuance of the injunction.reciting the bedrock rule that rule b can not,and should not,be used to circumvent time limits available to take an appeal,the magistrate judge stated to the extent that plaintiff was of the view that the district judge improperly or improvidently granted the defendant the injunctive relief sought,he could have filed an appeal within thirty days after the injunctive relief was ordered.the magistrate judge concluded,quoting cotto united states,cir,that p laintiff current motion to reopen is nothing more than an attempt to escape the consequences of failure to take a timely appeal.
nevertheless,the magistrate judge went on to address fafel motion on the merits.based on the evidence presented during the hearing,he determined that fafel did give his attorney actual authority to accept the offer of judgment,knowing full well that there was a downside risk in acceptance of the offer.accordingly,the magistrate judge recommended denial of fafel motion to vacate the rule judgment on the merits.
then,after noting that n either side ha d addressed fafel prayer for relief requesting withdrawal of the injunction enforcing the rule judgment as distinct from fafel request for relief from the rule judgment itself,the magistrate judge recommended sua sponte that the district court vacate the injunction because this court always must be vigilant about jurisdiction the magistrate judge explained that dipaola motion to enforce the rule judgment must be t reated as a breach of contract suit between parties governed solely by state law,over which the district court lacked jurisdiction once the court had disposed of fafel suit.the magistrate judge then quoted extensively from the supreme court opinion in kokkonen guardian life insurance of america,d.there,the court held that a federal district court lacked jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement for which part of the consideration was the filing of a stipulation of voluntary dismissal pursuant to.a ii the court held that the settlement agreement at issue in kokkonen,which provided no independent basis for federal jurisdiction,could only be enforced in federal court pursuant to the court ancillary jurisdiction if the dismissal order either incorporated the terms of the settlement agreement or contained a provision,with the parties consent,expressly reserving jurisdiction to enforce the agreement.id.at.
in the instant case,the magistrate judge reasoned,the district court had employed neither of the measures set forth in kokkonen.instead,t he order of dismissal previously entered on may,and the formal judgment later entered on june,did not purport to condition the dismissal on compliance with the terms of the offer of judgment.nor did they purport to retain jurisdiction over the case to enforce the settlement.as a result,the magistrate judge concluded,the district court lacked jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the rule offer purporting to satisfy all claims made and relief sought by the plaintiff against the defendant arising from or related to his april termination.
dipaola filed a limited objection to the magistrate judge report and recommendation relating to jurisdiction.the district court then issued the following margin order on april,
i adopt the report and recommendation except with respect to the recommendation that i lack subject matter jurisdiction to enforce the offer of judgment by an injunction.i believe i have jurisdiction to issue the injunction.see utility automation choctawhatchee electric cooperative,cir.
the district court denied fafel motion for reconsideration of its jurisdictional ruling on may.fafel now appeals only from that portion of the court decision rejecting the magistrate judge recommendation to vacate the injunction for lack of jurisdiction.
standard of review 
we treat fafel appeal,which continues a collateral attack on the validity of an injunction allegedly issued in the absence of jurisdiction,as an appeal from a denial of a motion for relief from a judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,which permits a court to grant such relief where the judgment is void.see lubben selective serv.local bd,cir analyzing claim that judgment was entered without jurisdiction under rule b ordinarily,a district court decision to grant or deny relief from judgment pursuant to rule b is reviewable on appeal only for an abuse of discretion.honneus donovan,cir per curiam citation omitted.we have said,however,that a court deciding a motion brought under rule b ha s no discretion because a judgment is either void or it is not.id.citations omitted.thus,we review de novo the district court legal conclusion that it had jurisdiction to enforce its judgment with the issuance of the injunction.
void judgments 
as the magistrate judge noted,courts must always be vigilant about the existence of jurisdiction.yet determining when a judgment rendered in the absence of jurisdiction is void for purposes of collateral attack is an issue of some complexity.

a void judgment is to be distinguished from an erroneous one,in that the latter is subject only to direct attack.a void judgment is one which,from its inception,was a complete nullity and without legal effect.in the interest of finality,the concept of void judgments is narrowly construed.while absence of subject matter jurisdiction may make a judgment void,such total want of jurisdiction must be distinguished from an error in the exercise of jurisdiction.a court has the power to determine its own jurisdiction,and an error in that determination will not render the judgment void.only in the rare instance of a clear usurpation of power will a judgment be rendered void.
