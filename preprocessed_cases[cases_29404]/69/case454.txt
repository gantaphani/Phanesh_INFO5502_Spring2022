we held that the district court had committed a significant procedural error by imposing a de facto life sentence in reliance on clearly erroneous facts the government indisputably false information about its agreement with costa rica.pileggi,app x at.thus,we vacated pileggi month sentence and remand ed with instructions that the case be reassigned for resentencing.id.at.our mandate stated that the judgment of the district court was vacated,and remanded the case only for further proceedings consistent with our decision.
at pileggi resentencing in september,the district court imposed a sentence of months years and ordered pileggi to pay restitution of.
the government then asked to address the amount of restitution,noting that,in another case involving the same fraudulent sweepstakes operation in costa rica,this court had found that losses for restitution purposes had to be attributed to the individual rooms,or call centers,where each defendant had worked.citing united states llamas,cir.the government argued that the million figure in pileggi case was tainted because the trial judge had chosen to group the rooms all together although the government did mind the million figure,it argued that pileggi would likely contend on appeal that he had been wrongly held responsible for losses from other rooms.id.at.the government thus asked the court to use the forfeiture amount about million as the restitution figure,even though the government had gone back and done another analysis which show ed that the loss is even higher.id.at.
the district court decided to limit restitution to the million figure,but agreed to hold that restitution component open and allow the government to file its amended figures within days.id.at.
at a second hearing focused solely on restitution,the government argued that the million forfeiture figure had resulted from a analysis of wire transfer records that had been done as speedily as possible.upon remand,the government had applied a analysis to the same records,which had increased the restitution amount from million to about some million.id.the government asserted that t his analysis was done specifically in response to llamas.id.at.
the district court rejected pileggi argument that it lacked authority to reconsider the restitution amount,reasoning that the issue was ripe for adjudication in light of the llamas case.after hearing the testimony of the government analyst,id.at,the court increased the restitution amount to,id.at.

we review de novo the district court interpretation of the mandate.united states susi,cir.
few legal precepts are as firmly established as the doctrine that the mandate of a higher court is controlling as to matters within its compass.united states bell,cir internal quotation marks omitted.because this mandate rule is merely a specific application of the law of the case doctrine,in the absence of exceptional circumstances,it compels compliance on remand with the dictates of a superior court and forecloses relitigation of issues expressly or impliedly decided by the appellate court,quoted in susi,at.
t o the extent that the mandate of the appellate court instructs or permits reconsideration of sentencing issues on remand,the district court may consider the issue de novo,entertaining any relevant evidence on that issue that it could have heard at the first hearing.bell,at internal quotation marks omitted,quoted in susi,at.but the mandate rule forecloses litigation of issues foregone on appeal or otherwise waived,for example because they were not raised in the district court.
w hen this court remands for further proceedings,a district court must,except in rare circumstances,implement both the letter and spirit of the mandate,taking into account our opinion and the circumstances it embraces.
id.accord atl.of,lp riese,cir the court must attempt to implement the spirit of the mandate.
we unhesitatingly conclude that the mandate rule barred the district court from reconsidering the restitution order on remand.neither party had raised the issue before this court,and the government is not permitted to use the accident of a remand to raise an issue that it could just as well have raised in the first appeal.although we remand ed with instructions that the case be reassigned for resentencing,we vacated only pileggi month sentence.pileggi,app x at.thus,the opinion limited the district court to correcting only the incarceration term of pileggi sentence.see bell,at.
the supreme court recent decision in pepper united states,d,does not counsel otherwise.in pepper,the supreme court rejected the contention that the law of the case required a new judge,on remand,to adhere to the prior sentencing judge downward departure from the advisory guidelines sentence.pepper.at.the pepper court reasoned that an appellate court when reversing one part of a defendant sentence may vacate the entire sentence so that,on remand,the trial court can reconfigure the sentencing plan to satisfy the sentencing factors in a.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.because the appellate court had set aside the defendant entire sentence and remanded for a de novo resentencing,the remand order had effectively wiped the slate clean.id.emphasis added.
here,by contrast,we vacated only pileggi month term,not his entire sentence moreover,pepper does not abolish waiver in the context of.the government waived any challenge to the amount of restitution by failing to raise it on appeal because the mandate rule forecloses litigation of issues foregone on appeal,bell,at,the district court was prohibited from revisiting restitution on r
